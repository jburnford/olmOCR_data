H. V. BULYEA, Esq., M. L. A.,\nCommissioner of Public Works.\n\nSIR,\u2014I have the honour to submit the report of the Department of Public Works of the North-West Territories for the first eight months of the year 1905.\n\nThe increase and extension of the work in the department, referred to in the last Annual Report, has continued, as will be found from the detailed information in the following pages. This increase was to be expected from the large influx of settlement and extension of the areas within which the department has been called upon to perform public works during the season.\n\nIt is gratifying to be in a position to report no loss of structures, or serious damage by flood, as was the case in 1904, and while this is partially accounted for by the absence of excessive floods, the more permanent class of structures put in since 1901, many of which have been severely tested, are in a very considerable measure responsible for the absence of loss, and while in many cases the expenditures have been heavy, I think the results so far warrant the departure from more primitive methods, which in so many cases failed to withstand the floods and freshets when tested. The system of putting in steel superstructures as far as possible has been followed as in 1904, and a very considerable number of permanent bridges now stand as a valuable asset in the Territories.\n\nA large amount of road improvements was carried on as in 1904, in large and small local improvement districts and the same policy of concentrating the improvements on leading trails as far as possible was also adhered to, it being evident that expenditures on such works outside of what the local improvement districts are able to perform, should as far as possible be made upon the leading trails or roads, with a view to benefiting the largest number of settlers for the expenditure. The amount of road work undertaken previous to September 1st was not large, as it had been found advisable to generally undertake extensive improvements after this date when the country was dryer and work could be performed in a better manner and at less cost than earlier in the season.\n\nThough contracts were let and some fireguarding was undertaken previous to September 1st, a considerable portion of it was finished after that date.\n\nA comparatively dry season again demonstrated the shortage of water in several localities, and that the few machines operated by the department are not of sufficient capacity to cope with the requirements, and it is gratifying to note that the settlers are beginning to realize the importance of helping themselves to procure water supply in such localities.\n\nThe areas organized under The Local Improvement Ordinance up to August 31st, 1905, is very gratifying and generally speaking the councils are showing a marked interest in looking after their own local affairs, which is resulting in a lot of good work being done, besides placing the department in a position to deal with the council as a body representing the district in preference to the confusion that generally arises when aiming to deal\nwith public improvements on private requests and recommendations, and while individual councillors seem to feel called upon to make requests and carry on communications about the needs of the particular divisions of their district they are generally beginning to realize the fact that such recommendations and communications should emanate from their local improvement council as a body through their secretary, otherwise their secretary is not kept in touch with the business he is paid to conduct and confusion frequently arises that should be avoided; but in this respect it is a matter of gratification to note an improvement and general marked interest in their local affairs.\n\nOwing to the very low water in most of the large streams where ferries are operated considerable difficulty was experienced in connection with their operation.\n\nOnly two steam dredges were operated this season, one upon drain No. 110 south of Strathcona, which was nearly completed at the end of August, and the other upon drain No. 30 between Morningside and Lacombe, it having been decided that no additional drainage schemes would be undertaken until the question of assessing the lands benefited could be more satisfactorily dealt with.\n\nThe total expenditure incurred by the department for the first eight months of the year and paid out of general revenue amounts to $276,442.57. This cannot conveniently be compared with the expenditures for the first eight months of 1904 as the accounts for that year were closed at the end of the year instead of at the end of August as in 1905.\n\nThe expenditures are therefore appended for the information of the public.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJOHN STOCKS,\nDeputy Commissioner.\n\nCORRESPONDENCE BRANCH.\n\n| Staff | 1 messenger. |\n|-------|-------------|\n|       | 4 clerks.   |\n\n| Communications received, 1903 | 46,306 |\n|-------------------------------|--------|\n| Communications received, 1904 | 75,264 |\n| Communications received, 1905 (Jan. 1st to Aug. 31st) | 50,173 |\n| Communications sent, 1903 | 88,304 |\n| Communications sent, 1904 | 147,691 |\n| Communications sent, 1905 (Jan. 1st to Aug. 31st) | 63,292 |\n| Irrigation office, 1903 | 3,519 |\n| Irrigation office, 1904 | 5,548 |\n| Irrigation office, Jan. 1st to Aug. 31st, 1905 | 3,693 |\n| Entries of cash received, 1903 | 10,429 |\n| Entries of cash received, 1904 | 18,468 |\n| Entries of cash received, 1905 (Jan. 1st to Aug. 31st) | 10,455 |\n| Total number of communications dealt with, 1903 | 140,929 |\n| Total number of communications dealt with, 1904 | 223,003 |\n| Total number of communications dealt with, 1905 (Jan. 1st to Aug. 31st) | 127,613 |\nAverage number of communications dealt with daily,\n1903 ........................................... 463\n1904 ........................................... 761\nAverage number of communications dealt with daily,\n1905 (January 1st to August 31st) ............ 613\n\nThe above statement shows that a large amount of work has been handled by this branch during the portion of the year covered by this report. The daily average number of communications, although larger than in years previous to 1904, does not reach the number for that year and this is due to the fact that for a month or two previous to August 31st the staff were kept busy separating records and various matters which in the usual course of events would have been dealt with by the government but were held back for reference to the Provincial Governments.\n\n---\n\n**The Coal Mines Regulations Ordinance, 1905.**\n\nInside staff .................................. 1 clerk and stenographer.\nOutside staff .................................. 1 inspector.\n\nThe large increase in the number of new mines opened in the Provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan during the past year is a strong indication of the rapid advance the provinces are making both with regard to population and the operation of industrial enterprises.

I will treat briefly of the companies operating in these districts, their plants and the development work of the mines.\n\nBlairmore and Frank District.\n\nThe International Coal & Coke Co., Limited,\nDenison Colliery, Coleman, Alta.\n\nH. N. Galer, general manager.\nE. E. Reynolds, general superintendent of mines\nGeo. L. Fraser, mine superintendent and master mechanic.\nJ. W. Powell, mine manager.\n\nThis company's mine is situated in the eastern extremity of the coal mining industry of the district. Their openings comprise a main entry driven in the coal on No. 2 seam with a cross-cut tunnel through the measures to No. 4 seam. Another opening is by a slope on No. 2 seam forming one lift of coal and No. 4 will also be tapped from the foot of this slope. The system of working is pillar and stall. The improvement at this colliery during the past year has been the completion of the slope on No. 2 seam and the installation of a hoisting plant to operate it. An additional battery of boilers and two new air locomotives for the mine. A duplicate electric plant is nearly completed to run the ventilating fan and lighting. The Ottumwa box car loader has proved a great success handling over 1,000 tons in eight hours.\nThe Canadian American Coal & Coke Company, Limited,\nFrank, Alberta.\n\nF. A. Hill, general manager.\nLawrence Harris, mine superintendent.\nJohn Robertson, mine manager.\nAlex McGregor, pit boss.\n\nThe improvements at this mine are the installation of a new fan and a battery of boilers. The trail rope haulage in the mine has greatly reduced the cost in that department. The system of working the mine has had to be altered several times and I think improvements have been made especially to the advantage of the safety of the miner although there will always be elements of danger in this mine to be met with that cannot be eliminated so easily as in a flat seam or one with a less degree of pitch. An unfortunate incident happened in the workings on the 19th April last whereby the inside workings went on fire, the cause of which is still unaccounted for. I was wired for and immediately proceeded to the mine. After consulting with the management and an examination of the plans as to the point at which the fire had been closed off by stoppings, I decided to call in another inspector and mine managers in consultation. At my invitation Messrs. Drinnan and Colville, mine managers of the Crow's Nest Pass Coal Co., Mr. Whiteside, general manager of the West Canadian Collieries, and Inspector Morgan, of British Columbia, met me at Frank the following morning. With the mine officials and representatives of the miners' union the foregoing gentlemen and myself entered the mine and examined the stoppings and general condition of the mine carefully. After a conference it was decided that it was quite safe for the mine to be opened outside the stoppings. After the inside workings being closed for over a month, the stoppings were opened and the seat of fire examined but found to be still burning with little chance of putting it out. That portion was again closed up and a request made by me to the management that the mine should not be opened until the new fan was in condition to thoroughly handle the problem of ventilation and new openings made to the surface so that the air could be divided into splits. This idea was carried out and the inside area again opened up last month when it was found that the fire had been entirely damped out. The only evidence left of the fire was charred wood and some of the coal coked. The mine is now assuming a normal condition.\n\nThe Western Canadian Collieries, Limited,\nBlairmore, Alta.\n\nO. E. S. Whiteside, general manager.\nW. P. Williams, general mine superintendent.\nW. W. Leach, mining engineer.\nRaoul Green, mine manager, Lille Colliery.\nRelief fire boss.\nChas. Emerson, mine manager, Bellvue Colliery.\nJohn Anderson, fire boss.\n\nThe Lille colliery of this company, six miles north of Frank, is producing about six hundred tons per day. All the screenings from this plant\nare made into coke. The coal after being dumped over an automatic tipple passes on to shaking screens and picking tables. The screened coal is used for locomotive purposes and the screenings taken to a Luhrig washer. Here the coal is washed from containing an ash of seventeen to eighteen per cent. to a coal containing only about eight per cent ash. The capacity of the washer is 400 tons per day.\n\nBellevue colliery operated by the same company is a fairly large producer. The north gangways have been in faulty ground for some time but recently the coal has opened out to its regular size. A new tipple has been built during the past year and a battery of boilers and a four drill compressor added to the plant.\n\n**The Hillcrest Coal Co.,**\nFrank, Alta.\n\nC. P. Hill, general manager.\nChas. Chestnut, pit boss.\n\nThis company has just lately started operations and are certainly making preparations for a large output; a railway and tramway has just been completed to the mine. The development of the mine is proceeding rapidly on two seams.\n\n**The Breckenridge Lund Coal Co.,**\nLundbrek, Cowley.\n\nWm. Addie, mine manager.\n\nWork progressed very slowly at this mine during the past year on account of the installation of new machinery. They were held back for over three months on account of its non-arrival but are now pushing ahead with great vigor in the erection of a steel pit-head frame and placing of the machinery. A full description of their new erections will be given in next year's report.\n\n*Lethbridge District.*\n\n**Alberta Railway and Irrigation Co., Limited,**\nPincher Creek Mine, Lethbridge.\n\nP. L. Naismith, general manager.\nW. D. L. Hardie, mine manager.\n\nThis company have been prospecting to the south of Pincher Creek lately and have now satisfied themselves of the value of the coal lands. The prospects are that a railway will soon be built to the property and a new coal district opened up.\n\n**Alberta Railway and Irrigation Company, Limited,**\nLethbridge, Alberta.\n\nP. L. Naismith, general manager.\nW. D. L. Hardie, mine manager.\nR. Livingstone, pit boss.\nA general description of the plant and mine workings of this colliery has been given in previous annual reports. This company with their management are alive to all the new improvements for a modern colliery and as far as possible in the present location of the mine keep well up to date.\n\n**The Bulwell Coal & Iron Company, Limited,**  \nLethbridge, Alta.  \nThomas Underwood, managing director.  \nC. Padley, general manager.\n\nThis company have acquired a large area of coal land about seven miles north-east of Lethbridge and when railway connection is obtained they will be a strong competitor in the market for this class of coal.\n\n**Taber Coal Mining Co., Limited,**  \nTaber, Alta.  \nWm. Hamilton, general manager.  \nArchibald Waute, mine manager.\n\nThe operations of this company are steadily increasing. During the past few months they have erected a fan and placed in position a ten drill compressor. The Taber district is a new mining camp thirty miles east of Lethbridge. The companies operating there are McPhee Bros., J. Marsh as mine manager; The Consolidated Coal Company, operated by Messrs. Marcheshault & Wilcox; The Reliance Coal Company, with W. Aubin, general manager, and Luke Raisbeck, mine manager.\n\n*Canmore District.*\n\n**The H. W. McNeill Co., Limited,**  \nCanmore, Alta.  \nW F. Little, general manager.  \nJ. L. Morris, mine manager.  \nWm Musgrove, pit boss.\n\nA great many improvements have been made at this colliery, especially with regard to the safety of the mine, which is a gaseous one. The new fan erected produces eighty thousand cubic feet of air per minute. New openings have been made to the surface, allowing the air to be split often-er and more exits for the miners. Outside the mine the plant has been increased by the installation of a Jeffrey-Robinson coal washer, capable of handling four hundred tons per day. The washer is doing excellent work in having the coal placed on the market in a much cleaner condition than formerly.\nThe original coal breaker that this company put in has now been entirely abandoned and the whole output of the mine amounting to one thousand tons per day passes through the new breaker which has been erected on the flat close to the new opening of the mine. Three large air locomotives are now in use handling the coal from the mine. Air hoists are used inside the mine lowering the coal from the different level to the lowest one. A, B, C and D levels are now opened on No. 2 seam. During the year four other seams to the west of No. 2 have been opened out and are producing an excellent quality of Anthracite coal. The electric plant operated at the mine supplies the towns of Bankhead and Banff with light. The former town is well supplied with a water and sewerage system. In fact the whole surroundings make it one of the model mining camps of the continent, both with regard to the plant installed and the comfort of the community.\n\nSouris District.\n\nThe Souris Coal Mining Co., Limited,\nCoalfields, Sask.\n\nGeo. Taylor, general manager.\nC. C. Symons, mine manager.\n\nThe concentration of all the mines of this company at one point will tend to the development and economic working of the property, Roche Percee Mine, Souris, No. 1 and No. 2 all being operated from Taylorton No. 1 slope. A new tipple has been built with automatic arrangements for handling loaded and empty mine cars. The coal after being dumped passes over straight screen bars and is loaded in railway cars by an Ottumwa box car loader, which is doing very satisfactory work. A first class hoisting engine and battery of boilers has also been added to this plant.\n\nEureka Brick & Coal Co.,\nEstevan, Sask.\n\nC. Peterson, general manager.\nJ. Bardsley, mine manager.\n\nThe development work at this mine has been carried on systematically until now it is one of the largest shipping mines. The improvements at their brick plant have been considerable, and the machine brick they are turning out are considered the best in the market.\n\nThe other mines working in the district are increasing their output and the industry promises to be a very remunerative one.\nOther coal mining districts are Medicine Hat, Knee Hill, High River and Edmonton. The latter district is developing very rapidly, especially since the advent of the Canadian Northern Railway into the city of Edmonton. The coal, although only suitable for stationary boilers and domestic use, is bound to create a large market to the east, north, west and from some distance to the south until it meets competition from the products of the other fields.\n\nACCIDENTS.\n\nOf the number of accidents reported for 1905 to this department, it is sad to relate that over 50 per cent. are fatal. This no doubt is accounted for by the different companies not reporting all the slight accidents that happen in a mine. This matter of reporting all accidents I have repeatedly taken up with the management of the various collieries and have shown them that what they consider a slight accident might eventually prove fatal. All the fatal accidents I have carefully investigated and strange to say it seems they all happened through the foolhardiness of the men over anxious at their work. Fatal accidents were caused by mine cars, 2; premature explosion of dynamite, 4; suffocated by coal in chutes, 4; installing machinery in the mine, 1; fall of rock from the roof, 1. Total accidents outside the mine were caused by mine cars, 1; attending to oiling of machinery, 2.\n\nI append a list of the accidents as reported.\n| No | Date   | Mine                          | Name          | Occupation | Remarks                                                                 |\n|----|--------|-------------------------------|---------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1  | Jan. 24| Lethbridge, A.

This has been taken up especially by the employees, and in connection with it I would like to assist them; the matter to be taken up by the Legislature and made compulsory that all mining companies employing more than twenty men should have an ambulance room with stretchers and all appliances for first aid to the injured, the mine physician taking up a class of this description in which all mine managers, pit bosses and fire bosses are required to pass an examination.\n\nWORK OF INSPECTION.\n\nI have endeavoured to visit all the small mines in the Territories at least once during the year, and some of them oftener. It is often difficult to get notice of all the mines that are opened and in this connection if a notice was placed in the newspapers of the province twice a year with a copy of section 8 of The Coal Mines Regulations Ordinance it would assist in keeping track of the development of the industry. The large mines I have visited several times, inspecting separate sections on each visit, and any suggestions made have been carried out by the companies. I have impressed on all coal operators the necessity of keeping the mine plans up to date for inspection, and also at the small mines the great advantage of having a plan of the mine so that they can direct their operations to the advantage of their property. During the year I have only had two grievances placed before me by the miners, and in each case there was cause for complaint, not so much as to their safety, but in facility for going and coming from their work. I went over the ground with them and the defects were speedily remedied by the management. These complaints, if sent to me in writing, I would attend to as soon as possible, as there may be points that come up requiring a remedy between the dates of inspection.\n\nEXAMINATIONS.\n\nThe regular examinations were held in April and November of 1905, only one special one being held for a fire boss certificate, the candidate having met with an accident the day before one of the regular examinations was to be held. He passed successfully. In April the examinations were held at Coleman, Bankhead and Coalfields, in all seven presenting themselves for mine managers, two failing to obtain the certificate. Six pit bosses, all passed. Seven fire bosses, all passed.\n\nIn November the examinations were at Canmore and Frank for the Province of Alberta, and at Coalfields for the Province of Saskatchewan. At the former place one presented himself for mine manager's certificate, but did not complete the examination, three for pit boss, and six for fire boss, all passing a very successful examination. At Coalfields there was granted one mine manager's certificate, and one pit boss certificate. Certificates that have been granted under sections 17 and 20 of The Coal Mines Regulations Ordinance are enumerated in tabulated form. It is gratifying to find so many men anxious to obtain certificates of competency so that they are able to fill an official position. This gaining of a certificate in a great many cases seems to be the limit to which they go, as I find the\noperators have great difficulty in securing suitable men to occupy the official positions open. The reason for this seems to be that wages are more and easier made at the coal face. Also with regard to men being suitable for a position; unless he follows up this class of work he cannot expect to develop the executive ability that is necessary in an official. The wages made by the miners digging on contract vary from $75 to $180 per month, according to the place assigned him or his ability to mine coal. General wages for day labourers are as follows:\n\n### INSIDE MEN\n\n| Occupation                  | Wage   |\n|----------------------------|--------|\n| Fire bosses                | $3.50  |\n| Shot lighters               | 3.00   |\n| Brattlemen                 | 3.00   |\n| \" helpers                  | 2.50   |\n| Timbermen                  | 3.00   |\n| \"                           | 2.50   |\n| Drivers                    | 2.50   |\n| Drivers wet places          | 2.75   |\n| Team drivers               | 3.00   |\n| Tracklayer                 | 3.00   |\n| Tracklayer helper           | 2.50   |\n| Rock miners                | 3.50   |\n| Miners                     | 3.00   |\n| Miners wet places           | 3.50   |\n| Locomotive engineer         | 2.75   |\n| Switch boys                | 2.50   |\n| Chute loaders              | 2.50   |\n| Labourers                  | 2.50   |\n| Timber handlers             | 2.75   |\n| Machine men                | 3.50   |\n| Machine helpers             | 3.00   |\n| Switch boys                 | 1.50   |\n| Dock boy                   | 1.00   |\n| Hoistmen                   | 2.75   |\n| Rope riders                | 2.50   |\n| Coupler's men              | 2.50   |\n| Coupler's boys             | 1.50   |\n| Pushers                    | 2.50   |\n\n### OUTSIDE MEN\n\n| Occupation                  | Wage   |\n|----------------------------|--------|\n| Pit leadman                | 2.50   |\n| Slate pickers (men)        | 2.00   |\n| Slate pickers (boys)       | 1.25   |\n| Car oiler (boys)           | 1.50   |\n| Car oiler (men)            | 2.00   |\n| Tally boys                 | 1.25   |\n| Teamsters                  | 2.50   |\n| Blacksmiths                | 3.50   |\n| Blacksmith's helper        | 2.50   |\n| Mine carpenter             | 3.50   |\n| Mine carpenter helper      | 2.50   |\n| Car repairers              | 3.00   |\n| Power house engineers      | 3.50   |\n| Tripple engineers           | 3.25   |\n| Locomotive engineers       | 3.25   |\n| Locomotive engineer's helper| 2.80   |\n| Firemen                    | 2.50   |\n| R.R. car handlers          | 2.25   |\n| Fanmen                     | 2.50   |\n| Fan fireman                | 3.00   |\n| Outside labourers          | 2.00   |\n| Lamproom                   | 2.50   |\n| Machinists                 | 3.20   |\n| Machinist's helpers        | 2.50   |\n| Couplers                   | 2.00   |\n| Sawyer                     | 3.00   |\nPROSPECTS.\n\nThe coal industry of the new provinces is seemingly an unlimited quantity from the number of coal mines that were opened last year and the year previous. This I think is rather an optimistic view to take but there is no doubt the influx of immigration and the starting of manufactures will keep most of them busy during the winter months at least. The enormous increase in railway building and naturally the increased consumption of coal is a great factor in the coal mining industry. The coal of Northern Alberta is not a suitable locomotive coal, but the time may come when a process of using the slack in the shape of briquettes will solve the problem. The development of the oil wells and stone quarries in the south, cement works and mineral prospects in the west, and the gas wells of the north, are a strong indication of the wealth and prosperity of the country. All these natural resources just mentioned should I think be included in the future legislation for the protection of life and property.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nFrank B.

Since the formation of the province four months ago the only fact to be recorded is the increased growth of the coal mining industry, seven new mines having started operations since then. No serious accidents have occurred, and the mines are in very fair condition with regard to ventilation and timbering.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank B.

Smyth of Moose Jaw being appointed to the position on May 5th.\n\nThe names and addresses of the inspectors are as follows:\n\nWm. Waller\nJos. Buxton\nWm. Mayhew\nDavid Fraser\nBurrows M. Smyth\n\nWhitewood.\nCalgary.\nWhitewood.\nStrathecona.\nMoose Jaw.\n\nInspection of Boilers.\n\nThe work of inspecting the steam boilers in the Territories during the past eight months has been accomplished under considerable disadvantage to the inspectors. Three of the five officials were obliged to cover ground that was practically new to them, and on this account difficulty was experienced in locating the boilers. An open spring, however, permitted them to commence their duties in good time, and I am pleased to report that the inspection work is progressing satisfactorily.\n\nA large number of new threshing outfits have come into the Territories, and much time has been spent by the inspectors looking these up for the purpose of inspecting the boilers.\nThe total number of boilers inspected to date is nine hundred and three as against seven hundred and sixty during the same period last year. The inspectors have reported the majority of these boilers in good condition.\n\nThey might be summed up as follows:\n\n| Condition   | Number |\n|-------------|--------|\n| Good        | 760    |\n| Very fair   | 70     |\n| Fair        | 52     |\n| Poor        | 19     |\n| Condemned   | 2      |\n\nThere are two casualties to report under section 22 of the Ordinance, which occurred in Inspector Fraser's district. A report of these casualties will be found in the annual report of the said inspector, appended hereto.\n\nExamination of Engineers.\n\nIt was found necessary to discontinue, to a large extent, the old system of holding engineers' examinations for final certificates during the summer months. The number of boilers was increasing so rapidly that it was thought advisable to have the inspectors devote the greater part of their time, while the mild weather lasted, to inspection work. Accordingly most of the examinations were held in the winter months. Some doubt was entertained as to whether or not it would be possible to get the engineers to attend examinations held at this time of the year, owing to the fact that many of them would have returned to their homesteads and some would be engaged upon other work in out of the way places, thus changing their post office addresses and making it difficult to reach them through the mails. But as the returns for the ensuing eight months show, most gratifying results have been obtained. By referring to the schedule attached to this section of the report, it will be observed that three hundred and thirty-five engineers were examined, which is seventy-four in excess of the total number examined during the entire year 1904.\n\nThe interest exhibited by the engineers throughout the Territories in regard to the examinations is steadily increasing, and as a consequence there has been a marked improvement in the number of final certificates issued. As in previous years, all engineers' certificates have been issued at the department, upon the recommendations of the inspectors.\n\nUnder section 29 of the Ordinance the inspectors have orally examined about one hundred engineers for provisional certificates.\n\nThe portion of subsection 1 of section 29 authorizing the issue of provisional certificates to persons furnishing proof of two years' experience as engineers has not proven so satisfactory as expected.\n\nThe following schedule has been drawn up to illustrate the work performed in connection with The Steam Boilers Ordinance. As might be expected it has been necessary to conduct a considerable volume of correspondence to accomplish this work:\n\n| Item                                      | Number |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Boilers inspected                         | 903    |\n| Engineers examined                        | 335    |\n| First class engineer's certificates issued| 7      |\n| Second \"                                  | 16     |\n| Third \"                                   | 205    |\n| Provisional certificates of qualification issued | 416 |\n| Second provisional certificates of qualification issued (under subsection 2 of section 29) | 5     |\n| Permits issued                            | 6      |\nFees collected:\n\n- Inspection of steam boilers $3,805.00\n- Final certificates issued (under section 28) $57.00\n- Examination of engineers $672.00\n- Provisional certificates $1,248.00\n\nTotal $5,800.00\n\nThe inspectors' annual reports, together with a list of the holders of final certificates are submitted herewith:\n\nWhitewood, August 31st, 1905.\n\nJ. Stocks, Esq.,\nDeputy Commissioner Public Works,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honour to submit to you my report as inspector of steam boilers for 1905, up to the end of August, in accordance with section 19 of the provisions of The Steam Boilers Ordinance.\n\nI held a series of examinations at thirteen different points. Following that work I inspected the stationary boilers at Regina and Moose Jaw.\n\nOn March 10th I received orders to proceed to Battleford to superintend the repairing and launching of the steam ferry at that point, which work was done successfully. Afterwards I proceeded to inspect the boilers in the surrounding district which includes Lloydminster and Onion Lake. From there to Prince Albert, Duek Lake, Rosthern, Hague, Saskatoon. After inspecting all stationary boilers at the above points I commenced at the east side of my district, which is Qu\u2019Appelle, inspecting threshing boilers, until August 31st, which was the end of the term of office of the Government of the North-West Territories. During this time I inspected two hundred and thirty-four boilers.\n\nThe following are the different types and conditions:\n\n**Types**\n\n| Type                        | Count |\n|-----------------------------|-------|\n| Tabular stationary          | 29    |\n| Locomotive type, traction   | 121   |\n| Locomotive type, portable   | 41    |\n| Locomotive type, stationary | 2     |\n| Return tubular, traction    | 18    |\n| Return tubular, portable    | 7     |\n| Return tubular, stationary  | 2     |\n| Upright portable            | 4     |\n| Upright, stationary         | 5     |\n| Water tubular, stationary   | 2     |\n| Riveted tubular, stationary | 3     |\n\nTotal 234\n\n**Conditions**\n\n| Condition       | Count |\n|-----------------|-------|\n| Good            | 200   |\n| Very fair       | 3     |\n| Fair            | 17    |\n| Only fair       | 14    |\n| Not inspected before | 32 |\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWM.

There were three boilers which were not in operation since last inspection, therefore no inspection certificates were issued to them this year.\n\nDuring the past year I held examinations for final engineers' certificates at different points as advertised in this district.\n\n| Applicants for first class | 2 |\n|-----------------------------|---|\n| Applicants for second class | 11|\n| Applicants for third class  | 45|\n| Apprentices for third class | 3 |\n\nOf this number who came up for examination, there graded as follows:\n\n| Class   | Number |\n|---------|--------|\n| First class | 1 |\n| Second class | 9 |\n| Third class  | 45 |\n\nThis includes apprentices who obtained provisional certificates and applicants who wrote the second class examinations and obtained third class certificates.\n\nI am pleased to state that there are no accidents to report from this district during the year.\n\nI am also pleased to state that some of the larger firms are installing large and modern boilers from 75 horse power up to 150 horse power and are doing away with the smaller plants with which they have been pros-\npecting and that the majority of the larger owners are in favour of placing more restriction on the applicants for provisional certificates or doing away with them altogether and make a fourth class limited to 25 horse power and no more, also that it be printed on the bottom of every certificate \"please post up your certificate.\"\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJos.

I issued two permits between January 1st and August 31st. During this period there was one prosecution for illegal operation.\n\nTwo fatal accidents occurred in my district during the spring and summer. In one case Mr. Thomas Rattary, the engineer in Cushing Bros. sash and door factory, was thrown upon the main drive belt and sustained injuries from which he died in two days; in the other case Mr. Chas. Sanderson was caught by a key extending beyond the end of a shaft in his brickyard and received injuries from which he died. Guards have been placed in several dangerous places since to prevent as far as possible accidents of a similar nature in future.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDavid Fraser,\nInspector of Steam Boilers.\nSir,\u2014I have the honour to submit my annual report as an inspector of steam boilers for the year ending August 31st, 1905, in accordance with The Steam Boilers Ordinance.\n\nI commenced my duties on May 5th, and was assigned south-eastern Assiniboia as my field of work.

The records of the department would then be divided and turned over to the new\nprovinces, that the surveys made would be of value to them and the lands required as right-of-way for public improvements form a valuable asset. An effort was therefore made to have all field work fully reported on and action, so far as was possible, taken to close outstanding matters regarding the acquirement of titles and payment of compensation to the owners of the land affected.\n\nHeretofore we have been filing our plans in accordance with The North-West Territories Act, the action making them in reality vesting plans, from which the registrar of land titles was empowered to issue title, in fee simple, in the name of the Crown for lands covered thereby. Owing to the alleged confliction between the provisions of The North-West Territories Act, referred to, and The Land Titles Act, F. F. Forbes, registrar of land titles at Regina, deemed it advisable to secure a ruling from the bench and the matter was therefore placed before Mr. Justice Newlands, who ruled that in his opinion The North-West Territories Act only provided for an easement in respect to the area required for roads as shown on the plans.\n\nIn the face of this ruling the registrar refused to issue any more titles in fee simple, in the name of the Crown, therefore, the plans which had been sent to the land titles office and in respect to which no action regarding registration had been taken, were withdrawn and held in the vault of the department pending an anticipated amendment to the Act in order that easement might not be created where we were obliged to pay compensation, and considered that a clear title was the only satisfactory guarantee for moneys expended.\n\nThe matter was then submitted to Ottawa but the Minister of the Interior deemed it inadvisable to make amendments to The Land Titles Act owing to the fact that the land titles offices would in the near future be handed over to the new Provinces, and each would then have power to provide its own laws regarding this matter. On this account we still have no titles for a great deal of the land on which public moneys have been expended. In urgent cases and where difficulties were liable to arise, we secured title by transfer, but owing to the increased work in the branch in having copies of the records prepared to be handed over to the new provinces we were able to deal with only a comparatively small number of cases, and the responsibility of settling these long standing matters is left to the respective Governments.\n\nStrict attention was paid, however, to the matter of reservation for roadway through lands for which patents had not already issued from the Crown and the assistants of the several district engineers were employed in making tracings of the plans of the surveys for roads, where such a reservation was possible, and certified copies of the plans were placed on file in the Department of the Interior, as the Federal Government had kindly consented to recognize such plans.\n\nThe work carried on by the branch may be summarized as follows:\n\n| Description                                      | Number |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Surveys carried forward from 1904                | 296    |\n| Surveys requisitioned for during 1905             | 399    |\n| Surveys for which instructions were issued        | 129    |\n| Surveys completed and instructions made           | 258    |\n| Plans received and recorded                       | 371    |\n| Field books received and recorded                 | 60     |\n| Preliminary agreements for right-of-way received and recorded | 268 |\nTransfer received and recorded 44\nCertificates of title received and recorded . . . 400\nAmount paid for right-of-way $30,676 44\nAverage price per acre $6 00\nMiles of road allowance for which applications to lease have been received 262\nNumber of applicants 71\nMiles of roads made in 1954, new leases 198. Total 393 \u00bd\nNumber of payments made in settlement of claims to compensation for right-of-way on account of surveyed roads and drains 715\nNumber of owners written under Ordinance 459\nNumber of owners written under Ordinance second time (on reconsideration) 79\nNumber of owners accepting second ruling. 51\nNumber of these cases unsettled 28\nAppeal to arbitration 8\n\nIn addition to the regular clerical work of the branch it was found necessary to have a number of the books copied that the department of the new provinces might have a complete record of all matter regarding surveys affecting the area which they would be called upon to deal. One temporary clerk was employed to assist the regular staff; in this way the work of division did not impede the regular correspondence connected with the branch and when the time for dividing the records arrived there was no unnecessary delay.\n\nWith a view to closing out all unfinished work the regular specific instructions were not sent to the district surveyors and engineers to any great extent, each being given a list of all surveys which had been asked for within his district, and all were advised to make a special effort to close up any surveys which had been started, and when passing over their district, to attend to \"requested\" surveys that appeared to be urgent.\n\nWhen it transpired that the division of the Territories into provinces would not take place until September 1st the surveyors were asked to continue as before in hopes that they, being in close touch with the needs of the district, would be cognizant of what should require immediate attention.\n\nAt the closing of the work in connection with this branch of the department it might not be amiss to mention the fact that the business of the department has increased very rapidly of recent years, and the system inaugurated many years ago regarding district surveyors, and engineers will be hardly sufficient to cope with the work required by the new provinces. The work in the outlying districts was necessarily light, and as it was considered advisable to retain the services of a competent engineer, who could be referred to on matters of importance, and the duties at that time were insufficient to warrant the payment of a salary equal to that which might be earned elsewhere by a competent man, they were given the privilege of doing private work which would not interfere with departmental duties, in order to allow them to augment their departmental salaries. The time has now come, I think, when the departments of the new Governments will require the services of the best men that can be procured, and the difference in salary necessary to obtain competent officials should not be a consideration compared with the additional values received from undivided and efficient services rendered.\nIn May, T. H. Wiggins, D.L.S., who had been in charge of the public works district of Centre Assiniboia in connection with his duties as drainage engineer for the Territories, tendered his resignation to open a private surveying and engineering business in the city, and the services of J. A. Carbert, D.L.S., were secured to continue the work of the district. The reports received from the district surveyors and engineers are subtended and will show the works undertaken in each district.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nF. J ROBINSON,\nDirector of Surveys.\n\nEDMONTON, ALTA, February 26th, 1906.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honour to report on the work of this office during the past season up to the 1st day of September after which date it was transferred over to the Province of Alberta.\n\nOwing to the expected transfer mentioned, the field work was not started until late in the season, and then only in a limited way, as it was the intention to clear up all old work rather than attempt any new; with this object in view the following works were undertaken:\n\nDRAINS.\n\nExamination as to work done on drain between sections 32 and 33-53-22w4.\nExamination for extension of drain No. 4 and removal of ditcher No. 2.\nOverseeing work of ditcher No. 1 on drain No. 110 and renewing grade stakes.\nExamination as to work done on ditch north of section 22-50-24w4.\nRe-staking drain No. 36 along west boundaries of sections 16 and 21-53-24w4.\n\nSURVEYS.\n\nSurvey of new road in sections 17 and 20-52-24w4 and closing C. & E. trail through same.\nSurvey of road north of sections 13, 14, 15 and 16-50-24w4.\nSurvey of road along blind line west of Leduc through township 49, ranges 27 and 28w4.\nExamination for extension of road diversion through 10-51-25w4.\nSurvey of road through centre of 34-51-25w4.\nSurvey of roadway along railway through 32-51-23w4.\nSurvey of road diversion around lake in 34-51-23w4.\nExamination for road around ravine in 26-50-26w4.\nSurvey of road division around lakes in sections 19 and 30-52-1w5.\nRe-survey of road along north boundary of river lots Fort Saskatchewan settlement.\nSurvey to ferry on both sides of Saskatchewan river in sections 27 and 35-55-12w4.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\nA. DRISCOLL,\nDominion Land Surveyor.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner,\nDepartment of Public Works, Regina.\nSir,\u2014I beg to submit the following report with regard to the work done by me in the public works district of Lacombe for that portion of the season of 1905 ending August 31st.\n\nIn the early part of the season, that is the winter months, I was employed, with my assistant in completing and checking the returns of surveys made in the previous year.\n\nOwing to the instructions from the department, I did not organize a party for field work until after July 1st; in the meantime, however, all the minor surveys and inspections which could be reached from here were completed, saving a considerable amount of unnecessary travel by my party when organized.\n\nOn July 7th I left Red Deer, working north and completing all surveys west and in the vicinity of the Calgary and Edmonton branch of the Canadian Pacific Railway, reaching Wetaskiwin about the end of the same month.\n\nFrom Wetaskiwin I proceeded with my party to Duhamel P.O., thence north and west to Township 48 Range 23 west Fourth Meridian and back to Wetaskiwin.\n\nOn completing several surveys west of, and in the vicinity of Wetaskiwin, I proceeded east along the Wetaskiwin branch of the C.P.R. as far as Quarrel Lake. From this point I worked southwesterly, being engaged in the survey of the road near Ferry Point P.O. at the date of the inauguration of the province.\n\nIn addition to the surveys and drainage work completed, I made a number of special inspections, the party in the meantime being in charge of my assistant.\n\nBelow will be found a schedule of new roads, road diversions, drains and reports, including cross sections for bridges, which were completed by myself and party up to August 31st.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

From the beginning of the year to that date I visited the following places: Millarville (twice), Priddis, Okotoks (twice), High River, Nanton, Didsbury, Olds, Nose Creek bush trail (twice), Edmonton trail, 13 miles up (twice), and Macleod trail, 6 miles up. Between these travels I was in the office preparing, with the help of my assistant, the plans and returns of the surveys made.\n\nOn the 19th of July, having organized a party of three labourers and a cook, I took my camp up north, to survey some diversions of the Edmonton trail in Township 25-1w5. From there I moved to the west side of Nose Creek, to complete the diversions on the Nose Creek bush trail.\n\nThis survey was much longer than I expected and kept me at work until the 16th of August, thirty-four days, counting the eight days' work done in June. This trail had been surveyed with a view of shortening distances, regardless of rough and low ground, with the\nresult that traffic could not follow the survey and went far from it in many places; I had to re-locate the old trail and survey diversions where needed. As the west end of this trail and part of the east branch go over rough ground, partly covered with scrub and brush, the work was slow with three men only to open two lines most of the distance.\n\nFor the latter part of August, I moved my camp south of Calgary and surveyed diversions in the vicinity of Okotoks, Millarville and High River, reaching Cayley on the 31st of the month. During that part of the year I was eighty-seven days absent from the office for field work; deducting from these Sundays, stormy days and days of travel, leaves fifty-four days of actual work in the field.\n\n**Schedule of surveys made for this part of the season.**\n\n**OLD TRAILS.**\n\n- Diversion of Macleod trail in section 22, township 20-29w4.\n- Diversion of Macleod trail in section 34, township 23-1w5.\n- Resurvey and diversions of Nose Creek bush trail, from section 9, township 25-1w5 to section 18, township 28-4w5, and east branch from section 10, township 28-4w5, to section 30, township 28-3w5.\n- Diversion of the Calgary and Edmonton trail in township 25-1w5.\n- Diversion of trail High River to Lineham in section 21-18-2w5.\n\n**NEW ROADS.**\n\n- Road in section 22-17-29w5.\n- Road in section 33-32-2w5.\n- In sections 14 and 15-20-29w4.\n- From section 16-28-2w5 to section 1-29-3w5.

Talbot,\nDistrict Surveyor and Engineer.\n\nMACLEOD, 10th January, 1906.\n\nJohn Stocks, Esq.,\nDeputy Commissioner of Public Works for the North-West Territories,\nRegina.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honour to submit my annual report, showing the work done in the Macleod public works district between the 1st of January and the 31st August during the year 1905.\n\nBetween the 1st January and 1st April I was generally occupied at headquarters, Macleod, in preparing returns of surveys made during the season of 1904, but several special trips were made to outside points during these months to make surveys or inspections.\n\nIn accordance with instructions received from the department, no regular party was organized until the 1st July, the date arranged for the division of the Territories into two provinces, this date being afterwards postponed until the 1st September. No full party was actually organized until that date, and the assistance of only such men as could be picked up from time to time was depended on.\n\nThe season as a whole, was favourable for surveying operations, but the difficulty of obtaining camping grounds is increasing from year to year as fences go up, and much delay occurs through this difficulty.\n\nSeparate reports accompanied by sketches have been submitted to your department on the completion of each survey made.\n\nFollowing is a list showing the different surveys made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

A.

T. Thomson,\nDistrict Surveyor and Engineer.\n\nMoosomin, August 31st, 1905.\n\nJohn Stocks, Esq.,\nDeputy Commissioner of Public Works,\nRegina, N.W.T.\n\nSir,\u2014I beg to submit the following report of work completed in the public works district of East Assiniboia from January 1st to August 31st in the year 1905.\nDuring January, February and March, the completion of returns for surveys made during the season of 1904 fully occupied my time.\n\nOn the 9th of February the building, part of which I occupied as my office, was destroyed by fire, nothing being saved except my field notes, of which two copies were on hand, though notes of four surveys were lost. In April I made resurveys to obtain new notes to replace those burned and also made some inspections for bridges.\n\nThe beginning of May party was put in the field, working steadily until the 31st of August. Surveys for a large amount of drainage have been asked for and completed.\n\nThe surveys through the northern part of this district were chiefly drainage or grades through the deep ravines to the bridges.

K. MOBERLY,\nDistrict Surveyor and Engineer.\nPRINCE ALBERT, August 31st, 1905.\n\nJOHN STOCKS, Esq.,\nDeputy Commissioner of Public Works,\nRegina, N.W.T.\n\nSir,\u2014Herewith I beg to submit this my report on surveys and other duties of my office performed from the 1st day of January to the 31st day of August, 1905, thus completing the record of work for the North-West Territories.\n\nDuring the early part of this term I made plans and reports of my surveys of 1904 and attended to correspondence.\n\nOn the opening of the season I began my surveys, eighteen of which I finished before the end of August as enumerated below:\n\nROAD DIVERSIONS.\n\nDiversion from road allowance north of section 14-48-25w2.\nDiversion from road allowance south of section 23-48-25w2.\nDiversion from road allowance east of sections 9 and 16-42-6w3.\nDiversion from road allowance east of sections 29 and 30-48-25w2.\nDiversion from road allowance east of section 28-42-2w3.\nDiversion from road allowance east of section 4-43a-3w3.\n\nNEW ROADS.\n\nNew road through east half of section 29-36-5w4.\nNew road through section 29-42-6w3 leading to Doukhobor ferry.\nNew road through the west part of section 16 and south part of section 21-44-20w2.\nNew road from Duck Lake through sections 32, 29, 30, 19 and 18, 42-2w3.\nNew road through river lots 6 to 23 inclusive, township 45-25w2, and diversion from road allowance of section 6-45-2w3.\nSurvey of right-of-way for access to Adam's ferry, section 5-47a-25w2.\nThat part of Duck Lake and Carlton trail on sections 11 and 15-45-4w3.\nThat part of Prince Albert and Isbester ferry trails on sections 11 and 12-48-24w2.\nSurvey of old trail known as Lacerte's trail from the Prince Albert and Montreal lake trail commencing at east side of section 32-49-27w2 west to the east side of section 10-50- w3.\n\nDRAINS.\n\nSurvey of ditch to drain Duck Lake on Beardy's Indian reserve east of section 15-45-3w3.\nSurvey of a ditch to drain sloughs on sections 6, 5, 4, 3 and 10-50-26w2.\n\nOne of these surveys known as the Lacerte trail was about 11 miles in length, on ground that required much exploration to select the best route. Some eight miles more of survey was asked for but I found that the original road allowances would better serve the majority of the settlers. Therefore, I did not extend that survey farther west.\n\nOne of the surveys was for right-of-way to give access to the ferry cable at Adam's Crossing of the south branch of the river Saskatchewan, section 5 township 47a range 25 west 2nd meridian. Two surveys were for large drains.\n\nThat for the drainage of Duck Lake excavated two years ago has I think fully answered its purpose,\u2014the waters of the lake having been lowered four feet, thus recovering roads and hay lands. It enabled me to survey a much needed road of about five miles south-west of the town of Duck Lake.\n\nThe other surveys were mostly of short diversions to avoid sloughs.\nThe survey of road in section 15 township 45 range 27 west 2nd meridian was prevented by not being on my regular routes and in the expectation of being able to undertake it at the end of the season.\n\nAnother survey (file 16381) was so far out from the last on my western circuit that I deferred it to a more convenient opportunity.\n\nInterim reports and sketches of the surveys were sent in monthly as performed.\n\nAll of which is most respectfully submitted.\n\nCyrus Carroll, D.L.S.,\nDistrict Surveyor and Engineer.\n\nEngineering Branch.\n\n| Staff | 1 assistant chief engineer. |\n|-------|---------------------------|\n|       | 1 draughtsman.            |\n|       | 1 assistant draughtsman.   |\n|       | 1 clerk in charge of bridge records |\n|       | 1 clerk and stenographer in charge of road improvements. |\n|       | 2 stenographers           |\n\nFrom January 1st, 1905, until August 31st, 1905, being the date upon which the affairs of the North-West Government were wound up, one hundred and thirty-seven bridges were constructed, twenty-one reconstructed and fifty repaired, making a total of two hundred and eight bridges dealt with. The office work of this branch shows that two hundred and seventy-five bills of quantity, sixty-eight contracts and thirty-six plans were prepared and recorded. As stated in previous reports, standard bridge plans were prepared and the bridges were constructed as far as possible in accordance with these standard plans, excepting in cases where special designs were required. The amount of work done by this branch will be clearly illustrated by the list of roads, bridges, fireguards, etc. The usual schedule of bridges constructed, reconstructed and repaired is shown below.\n\nSchedule of bridges constructed, reconstructed and repaired.\n\n- Arm river, on road allowance north of section 2 township 26 range 28 west 2nd meridian.\n- Arm river on road allowance north of section 33 township 27 range 28 west 2nd meridian.

Repairs.\n\nThe following bridges are worthy of special mention:\n\nBridge over the Bow River at Morley.\n\nThe timber bridge at this point having reached the limit of its life, it was found necessary in order to meet the traffic demands at that point to construct a steel bridge, and considered advisable, owing to the nature of the stream, to put in concrete substructures. The bridge was completed early in the season, and consists of two 125 ft. rivet connected steel spans with 16 ft. clear roadway and 80 ft. of timber approaches at the south end, making a substantial crossing not likely to require further expenditure for some time.\n\nBridge over Battle River, section 31-42-25w4.\n\nThe increased settlement and consequent traffic necessitated the construction of a bridge at the above point and after an examination by the district engineer it was decided to erect a 60 foot steel truss with one timber span of 20 feet at each end, upon pile and timber substructures which serves the interests of a very considerable settlement.\nBridge over Battle River, section 33-43-18w4, known as the Ferry Point Bridge.\n\nThe construction of a bridge on the Battle River at the above point became necessary owing to the influx of population. The structure consists of one riveted connected steel span of 100 feet with two 20 foot timber spans at each end, the truss being erected upon pile and timber piers, and provides a permanent crossing of great convenience to the settlers in that locality.\n\nBridge over Battle River between river lots 4 and 28, township 46 range 21 west 4th Meridian.\n\nThis structure consists of one 80 ft. riveted connected steel span with one 20 foot timber span at each end which serves the interests of a large and populous district.\n\nBridge over Pincher Creek at Village of Pincher.\n\nThe old structure at this point was broken down by a traction engine, and it was found necessary to replace it with a new standard steel structure of 100 foot span, riveted connected truss with four foot sidewalk, upon concrete substructures, providing a permanent crossing, the work to be completed after the establishment of the province.\n\nBridge over Willow Creek, between sections 36 and 6, townships 10 and 11, range 27, west 4th meridian.\n\nOwing to the large influx of population in this section of the country south and west of Leavings, it was found necessary to construct a bridge over Willow creek to give an outlet to the town of Leavings. This structure consists of two 90 foot riveted connected steel spans with three 20 foot timber spans at one end and two at the other, and erected on pile substructures, thus providing a very substantial structure which is used by a large community.\n\nTHE CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE OF ROADS.\n\nOwing to the yearly increase and extension of settlement a large expenditure is necessary in this connection each season, and it is desirable as far as possible to distribute such expenditure upon the leading trails of roads with the object in view of eventually establishing permanent roads, and giving preference in this respect to highways most used by the public. Distributed as this work is, and carried on from year to year, the success depends largely upon the organization in each district to properly locate the most necessary works, and apply the expenditures where they will best serve the interests of the public. Lacking in this requisite, money and labour spent do not give\nthe best results, while with a perfect system every dollar spent should be of benefit and a good investment. Special effort is made by the department when requests for improvements are received to obtain the fullest and most reliable information in order that the greatest number may benefit by the improvements if undertaken, and at the same time the aim has been to continue improvements already undertaken. On the other hand the department while endeavouring to fulfil the trust reposed upon them must guard against those who in making the loudest demands for assistance do not always voice the most urgent needs of the country and in pressing their claims cannot consider any improvements except those that will bring direct gain to themselves, losing sight of the benefit that should accrue to the general public. This is particularly noticeable where the effort is made to divert travel from one place of business to another, and has necessitated our making most careful enquiries and investigations before acting upon such requests. In addition to the work done by local improvement districts, $35,716.00 was expended on road improvements by the department during 1905.\n\nSchedule of Road Improvements undertaken during the year

Owing to very low water during most of the season in both the North and South\nSaskatchewan rivers, the operation of most of the ferries was maintained with considerable difficulty and at considerable expense. The formation of sand bars in several localities necessitated the removal of ferries to other localities. Among those moved were the Battleford Steam ferry, the Batoche ferry, and the ferry on the South Saskatchewan river west of Hanley. A new ferry was established at the Elbow on the South Saskatchewan river west of Davidson, and a new ferry on the Red Deer river at the mouth of Tail creek. The scows at Adams' and Carlton crossings were rebuilt and various other repairs and removals necessitated owing to low water.\n\nThe increased population in several new districts necessitated the operation of additional ferries, and the traffic generally was greatly increased on most of the ferries from the same cause.\n\nFIREGUARDS.\n\nBelow is given a list of fireguards constructed or maintained during the season. It will be noticed that approximately one thousand miles of guard were plowed. An effort was made to bring all the guards up to the standard of sixteen feet in width, except in cases where two eight foot guards were provided some distance apart to permit of burning out the grass between. The usual trouble was experienced this season as in former years, by contractors not having their work completed early enough in the season, and in this connection the specifications will have to be more rigidly enforced, it frequently happening that the carelessness of an individual to properly complete work results in fires getting away.\n\nSeveral portions of the country were visited by disastrous fires, and it will undoubtedly be necessary to provide a very considerable mileage of fireguards next season.\n\n| Description

charge of each, who was directly responsible to the deputy commissioner for the work of his particular section. The office of cashier and clerk of assessment were in this way added to the branch. Other officials engaged in the work were: one assistant cashier, thirteen, clerks and three stenographers to each of whom were assigned duties in the different portions of the branch. The staff had increased January, 1905, to nearly four times what it had been in January, 1903, and an even larger number was necessary had the limited quarters provided the necessary room. The rapid growth of population in the Territories was shown in this branch as well as in every other department of the public service.\n\nSMALL DISTRICTS.\n\nThe system of organization provided by the present local Improvement Ordinance has proved fairly popular, and many sections of the country took advantage of the privilege of organization; those in the organized small districts thus gaining complete control of the expenditure of the funds collected in and for the townships which\ncomprise the district. The average size of these small districts is four townships. Each of these townships in turn is represented on the council board by a regularly elected councillor. Where the population warrants it, a small local improvement district may be organized anywhere by petitioning the Commissioner to that effect.\n\nTaxes for the current year and all arrears since the constitution of the district may be collected by the secretary-treasurer of the small district. At the end of each year a report is made to the department showing owners and occupants of lands and giving a general statement of all local improvements performed under the direction of the council during the year. A return of unpaid taxes is also sent in showing assessments which, for various reasons, are unpaid. When payments of arrears are made after the return is sent in, the secretary-treasurer is expected to report such payment on the same day as made, that no taxes may be shown outstanding on the district return on file in the department, which have been paid to the local official. Payment of arrears of taxes are accepted at all times by this branch. When received for small districts they are immediately sent on to the council to be expended on needed local improvements. In this way the sum of $24,880.83 was collected by this department and forwarded to secretary-treasurers. Following is a complete list of small districts which were formed in 1904 and 1905:\n\n**DISTRICTS FORMED IN 1904**\n\n- **1-A-1**\u2014Townships 1 and 2 in ranges 30 and 31 and east halves of townships 1 and 2 in range 32, all west 1st meridian.

The general tide of immigration to the Canadian North-West has caused so much land to be occupied that the number of townships in which there are no entries is being rapidly reduced, which fact accounts for this portion of the local improvement branch increasing to large proportions.\n\nThe quantity of work connected with the assessment of large districts may be estimated from the fact that in the first eight months of 1905 the sum of $90,469.89 was collected and handled in connection with large districts alone by this branch. The expenditure of taxes thus collected is controlled by the Commissioner of Public Works. The rate of assessment in large districts was one and one-quarter cents per acre. The total assessments as shown on the registers are as follows:\n### Department of Public Works\n\n| No. | Districts | Amount of Assessment | Amount Collected | Amount Expended

W. H. Cushing, M. L. A.,\nMinister of Public Works,\nEdmonton, Alta.\n\nSir.\u2014I have the honour to submit the report of the Department of Public Works of the Province of Alberta for the last four months of the year 1905.\n\nIt was considered advisable by the Executive to transfer a few capable and experienced men from each branch of the Public Works service with a view of starting the work of the department under the Provincial Government with the least possible interruption. A considerable amount of work being under way when the establishment of the provinces took place, it seemed in the interests of the public service to carry on this work without interruption that otherwise might occur.\n\nThe employment of the outside staff\u2014surveyors and engineers, bridge and road foremen and their crews\u2014was continued, all plant and equipment, the property of the Territories, in use in the Province of Alberta, remaining where it was, a fair valuation being made of it in each province and a division of these values adjusted by the liquidator.\n\nAll records and documents pertaining to the Province of Alberta were transferred to Edmonton, and the work of the department carried on without any very serious interruption.\n\nWhile, as previously stated, a certain amount of work, principally in connection with the construction of bridges, was not completed upon the establishment of the provinces, the authorization of road improvements and certain bridge work was generally withheld by the Territorial administration, and consequently had to be dealt with by the Provincial Executive so as to permit of completing as much of the work as possible before winter. This, in addition to the organization of the inside staff to meet the new conditions, kept the department very busy right up to the end of the year, and while the expenditure in connection with roads and bridges was not so large as in the previous year, it was possible, owing to the favourable weather, to accomplish a good deal, the work being carried on upon the same lines as had prevailed for some time under the Territorial administration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJOHN STOCKS,\nDeputy Minister.\nThe following statement will show the amount of work handled by this branch from September 1st to December 31st, 1905.\n\nStaff ............................................ 1 chief clerk.\n..................................................... 3 clerks.\n..................................................... 1 messenger.\n\nCommunications received ....................................... 14,116\nTotal number of communications sent .................................. 20,222\nEntries of cash received ........................................... 4,732\n\nThe Steam Boilers Ordinance.\n\nInside staff ................................................................ 1 clerk in charge.\nOutside staff ......................................................................... 2 inspectors.\n\nThe following are the names and addresses of the Inspectors:\n\nJoseph Buxton ........................................... Calgary.\nDavid Fraser .............................................. Strathcona.\n\nThe schedule below shows the ground covered during the past four months, viz.: September 1st to December 31st in connection with the administration of The Steam Boilers Ordinance.\n\nNumber of boilers inspected ................................................ 190\nNumber of examinations of engineers held ........................................ 17\nNumber of second class engineers' certificates issued ......................... 9\nNumber of third class engineers' certificates issued ............................ 58\nNumber of provisional certificates of qualification issued ..................... 106\nNumber of permits for operation of steam boilers issued ................. 4\n\nFEES COLLECTED.\n\nFor inspection of steam boilers .............................................. $920.00\nFor final certificates issued under section 28 .................................... 6.00\nFor examination of engineers .................................................. 204.00\nFor Provincial certificates ....................................................... 318.00\nFor permits for operation of steam boilers ....................................... 12.00\n\nTotal ............................................................... $1,460.00\n\nIn addition to the certificates issued as recorded in the above schedule, two second provisional certificates have been issued under subsection 2 of section 29.\n\nIt will be noticed that no first class certificates have been issued.\n\nIt is a pleasure to report that no accident has occurred during these four months for which the condition of boilers is accountable.\n\nThe reports of the staff of inspectors and a list of all final certificates issued are submitted herewith.\n\nCALGARY, January 1st, 1906.\n\nJOHN STOCKS, Esq.,\nDeputy Minister of Public Works,\nEdmonton, Alta.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honour to submit my annual report for the year 1905 as inspector of steam boilers in accordance with the provisions of The Steam Boilers Ordinance, section 19.\nThe number of boilers inspected by me during the past year, part after the division of the Territories from September 1st to December 31st, was one hundred and ten boilers and the following is a statement of the different classes and conditions of same:\n\n| Class                        | Quantity |\n|------------------------------|----------|\n| Horizontal tubular           | 24       |\n| Horizontal furnace           | 10       |\n| Horizontal flue              | 1        |\n| Water tube                   | 6        |\n| Locomotive firebox           | 32       |\n| Locomotive firebox, portable type | 11     |\n| Return locomotive firebox    | 3        |\n| Return tubular               | 7        |\n| Upright tubular              | 15       |\n| Upright cross sectional      | 1        |\n\nCONDITION OF BOILERS INSPECTED.\n\n| Condition                  | Quantity |\n|----------------------------|----------|\n| Good condition             | 81       |\n| Very fair condition        | 27       |\n| Fair condition             | 2        |\n\nSince the division of the Territories I held examinations once as was advertised and had seven applicants for final certificates. I also held one since, making eight in all, which graded as follows:\n\n| Class | Quantity |\n|-------|----------|\n| 1st class | 0       |\n| 2nd class | 1       |\n| 3rd class | 7       |\n\nI have no accidents to report in connection with the operation of steam boilers in my district, also to state that in the south-west part of my district there are eight new boilers being installed and will be ready for inspection in March.\n\nOn account of the snow storm which came on during the end of November, all portable boilers and engines were not inspected in the Macleod district and north to Calgary. I am pleased to state that some of the larger firms are installing modern boilers from 75 horse-power to 150 horse-power and are doing away with the smaller plants which they have been prospecting with, and that the majority of the larger owners are in favour of more restriction being placed on applicants for provisional certificates or doing away with them altogether and having a fourth class, limited to a 25 horse-power and no more, also that it be printed on the bottom of every certificate \"Please post up your certificate.\"\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJOSEPH BUXTON,\nInspector of Steam Boilers.\n\n---\n\nSTRATHCONA, ALTA., January 17th, 1906.\n\nJOHN STOCKS, Esq.,\nDeputy Minister of Public Works,\nEdmonton, Alta.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honour to submit my annual report as inspector of steam boilers for the year 1905 in accordance with The Steam Boilers Ordinance, from September 1st to December 31st.\nSince September 1st I have inspected eighty boilers, which may be classed as follows:\n\n- Locomotive firebox: .52\n- Return tubular: .15\n- Horizontal tubular: .5\n- Upright tubular: .5\n- Furnace tubular: .2\n- Upright cross sectional: .1\n\nOf this number nineteen were new and four were brought into the district second hand. Various repairs were ordered on four boilers, new steam gauge on one and new safety valve on one.\n\n**CONDITION OF BOILERS INSPECTED:**\n\n| Condition    | Number |\n|--------------|--------|\n| Good         | 67     |\n| Very fair    | 9      |\n| Fair         | 4      |\n\nDuring the threshing season I issued five permits for thirty days in order to enable owners to operate their machines, three of them could not get engineers and in two cases the qualified engineers left without notice.\n\nNine engineers wrote on the examination for final certificates.\n\nOne accident happened about November 24th east of Red Deer by an engine going through a bridge over a creek and severely injuring the engineer. This is a matter which the local Government should look into. The bridges that were sufficiently strong a few years ago to accommodate the small engines in use at that time are altogether too light to safely carry the engines that are coming into the district at the present time.\n\nThere are several ploughing engines in the district which weigh fifteen tons or over and the tendency at present is to purchase still heavier engines in future, so that bridges to be built from now on should have a carrying capacity of twenty or twenty-five tons.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDAVID FRASER,\nInspector of Steam Boilers.\n\n---\n\n**SCHEDULE OF HOLDERS OF CERTIFICATES OF QUALIFICATION UNDER THE STEAM BOILERS ORDINANCE.**\n\n**SECOND CLASS.**\n\n| NAME          | ADDRESS       | DATE OF ISSUE |\n|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Burger, M.

I am pleased to be able to report that this effort has been fairly successful and the old outstanding cases are pretty well disposed of, with the exception of those in the district around Medicine Hat in the territory in ranges 1 to 10 west of the 4th meridian, which has been a part of the Assiniboia land registration district. This was owing to the registrar at Regina interpreting The North-West Territories Act differently from the other registrars and refusing to issue titles off vesting plans of roads.\n\nThe territory above mentioned will shortly become a part of the South Alberta land registration district, and it is hoped that then we will have matters of title soon cleared up and be able to deal with these old cases mentioned.\nThe recent rapid settlement of the country has caused a great increase in the requests for road surveys and also has caused a necessary change in the policy of the department in connection therewith. Some years ago, when settlement was scattered, the demands were for roads across country, regardless of regular road allowances, while now there are constantly arising objections to these old roads cutting up the lands and traffic is being diverted to the road allowances where possible and surveys of roads are only being made where the natural obstacles on the original road allowances are not easily overcome. The construction of new railway lines has also changed the lines of traffic in many cases and rendered unnecessary roads which were previously much needed.\n\nFrom these causes there has been considerable work to be undertaken in re-transferring roads which were acquired and are now unnecessary.\n\nThe necessity having become apparent of requiring the undivided services of the district surveyors and engineers, instead of the past practice of allowing them the privilege of doing a certain amount of private work, it was decided that the present system would be discontinued at the end of this year, and sufficient salary paid to retain the full services of competent men.\n\nNo appointment was made to fill the vacancy caused in the Medicine Hat district by my removal to Edmonton.\n\nIn the Macleod district, Mr. A. W. Ponton, D.L.S., having accepted work from the Dominion Government resigned his position with this Government, dating from the end of the year.\n\nIn the North Alberta district, Mr. A. Driscoll, D.L.S., owing to pressure of private business was unable to undertake our work any longer and is severing his connection with the department at the end of the year. Arrangements are being made to attend to the work of this district direct from the head office, and the department has men in view for each of the other districts.\n\nOwing to the large settlement east of Edmonton, following the railway construction through that part of the country, a large amount of work is arising and it will probably be necessary to form a new district cutting off part of the present North Alberta district, and it will also be necessary to place a surveyor and engineer at some suitable point to attend to this work.\n\nThe reports received from the district surveyors and engineers are given below and will show the work done in each district.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nL.

The four others had to be tested and when proved to be free from infection were allowed to go. An examination was made and a diversion surveyed near Calgary while waiting for the horses.\n\nFrom the 25th of September to the 13th of November work was done in the northern part of the district, beginning with a new road along the blind line west of Crossfield, thence north along the railway as far as Olds and Mayton, thence west to the Little Red Deer river near Eagle hills, thence south by way of Dog Pound, Beaverdam, Bradbourne and Cochrane.\n\nThe balance of the season was spent in the south-west part of the district where a few surveys and examinations had to be made in the vicinity of DeVinton, Lineham, Millerville and Priddis. On the 25th of November the party was back at headquarters, when I paid the men for the season and discharged them.\n\nSCHEDULE of Surveys made.\n\nNEW ROADS.\n\nOn centre blind line of township 17 ranges 27 and 28 west 4th meridian.

STOCKS, Esq.,\nDeputy Minister of Public Works,\nEdmonton, Alta.\n\nSir,\u2014I beg to submit the following report regarding the work done by me in the public works district of Lacombe, from Sept. 1st to the end of the season of 1905.\nOn September 1st I was engaged with party in the survey of a road across the Battle river, near Ferry Point P.O. and on completing the same proceeded south, examining and surveying all roads which were found to be necessary, arriving at Red Deer on October 15th.\n\nI left Red Deer at once for the south and on the completion of the work in the Innisfail district, proceeded to the territory lying between Red Deer and the Medicine river, disbanding the party on the 6th Nov.\n\nAlthough the season was somewhat shorter than usual it will be seen from this and the report to the department previous to Sept. 1st, that the whole of the Lacombe district was covered by myself and party from Millet station on the north to Bowden station on the south and about twenty miles west and about fifty east of the Calgary and Edmonton Railway line.\n\nIn addition to the general work of surveying new roads, road diversions and drains, I made a number of special inspections, including visits to steam ditcher No. 3 between Lacombe and Morningside.\n\nI find that in each year the work in that portion of the district lying to the south of the Red Deer river is decreasing, whereas the work in that portion lying to the north of this line is increasing, especially along the new branch railways running east of Lacombe and Wetaskiwin, which are rapidly opening up a new territory in the eastern part of the district, which will require a considerable amount of the work in order that the settlers will have access to the new towns which are springing up along these new lines.\n\nBetween the time of disbanding party and the end of the year, myself and assistant were engaged in preparing returns of surveys completed in the past summer and several minor surveys and inspections, which could be reached from here.\n\nBelow will be found a schedule of new roads, road diversions, drains and inspections completed between September 1st and the end of the season of 1905.\n\n**NEW ROADS.**\n\nRoad to bridge at Ferry Point P.O. in sections 20, 29, 32, 33 and 4 townships 43 and 44 range 18 west 4th meridian.\n\nRoad running west from Whitebrush P.O. in

of the Department of Public Works pertaining to the Province of Alberta was carried on under the Government of Alberta. The Ordinances belonging to this branch were administered in practically the same manner as they had been during the first eight months of the year by the local improvement branch of the Public Works Department of the North-West Territories. Owing to the extra amount of work caused by the organization of the work in the new Province, it was found impossible to take any action towards forfeiting lands for nonpayment of taxes, and therefore this matter had to stand over.\n\nSMALL DISTRICTS.\n\nAn attempt was made to collect the arrears of local improvement taxes which were still outstanding on the lands in small districts, from assessments made prior to the organization of said districts. Notices calling for payment of these arrears were sent out, and the sum of $8,532.20 was collected and forwarded to the treasurers of the different districts.\n\nLARGE DISTRICTS.\n\nIn the large local improvement districts the collection of taxes was carried on as usual, tax notices having all been sent out from the Department of Public Works at Regina, the amount collected during the four months being $19,809.48. This together with the $459.29 collected for tax certificates, costs for redemption of forfeited lands, interest and other matters made a total collection in the large district account of $20,268.77. The collections from the large local improvement districts were made up as follows:\n\n| District       | Amount   |\n|----------------|----------|\n| Banff          | 623.70   |\n| Battleford     | 403.95   |\n| Cardston       | 3,268.93 |\n| Calgary East   | 368.96   |\n| Calgary West   | 847.04   |\n| Edmonton       | 64.94    |\n| High River     | 1,118.45 |\n| Innisfail      | 1,015.11 |\n| Lacombe        | 775.96   |\n| Lethbridge     | 2,118.30 |\n| Macleod        | 6,966.88 |\n| Medicine Hat   | 1,876.48 |\n| Strathcona     | 341.01   |\n| St. Albert     | 39.64    |\n| Victoria       | 157.35   |\n| Wetaskiwin     | 606.98   |\n\n$19,809.48\nThe collections of arrears of school taxes was also carried on, and the sum of $1,474.53 was collected and forwarded to the treasurers of the school districts.\n\nVILLAGES.\n\nNo villages were established nor were there any villages proclaimed towns in the Province of Alberta during the last four months of the year 1905. Some applications from areas desiring to be established were received prior to December 31st, but these applications were not received soon enough to allow of the establishment of any villages prior to the end of the year.\n\nThe amount of mail received by this branch of the department increased very rapidly towards the end of the year; there being four times as many letters received in the month of December as in the month of September.\n\nThe amount of mail matter received was nine thousand seven hundred and seventy items. The mail sent out amounted to seventeen thousand three hundred and fifty eight items, which amount was composed of two thousand seven hundred and sixty-one letters, four thousand and ninety-seven receipts, and ten thousand and thirty-five notices and four hundred and sixty-five cheques.\nINDEX\n\nTERRITORIAL REPORT\n\nCORRESPONDENCE BRANCH\n\nCOAL MINES REGULATIONS ORDINANCE\u2014\n\nOutput of
