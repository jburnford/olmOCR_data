Hett,\nSupt.

The number of pupils for whom 62 days grant was claimed adds up to 33. If all of the 33 pupils for whom 62 days grant was claimed were discharged, the enrolment for the school would be increased by at least seven pupils.\n\nAttached is a copy of a letter forwarded Canon Hives on September 11 asking him to limit his total enrolment to 190 pupils which is the authorized enrolment for the school.\n\nWe have received a large number of applications for admission for pupils in the Nicola Agency and your Agency. On checking with the Return it is noted that these pupils are already in the school and entered on the September Return. The Principal has calculated the average for the September Return to be 211 which is 21 over the authorized enrolment. Would you kindly contact Canon Hives and advise this office on what authority he admitted pupils to the St. George's school without having their admissions approved and knowing that his average would exceed the authorized enrolment.\nI am forwarding you an extra copy of this letter should you wish to forward it to Canon Hives.\n\nWe are withholding approval of admission of the pupils from your Agency and the Nicola Agency until we hear from you.\n\nWould you kindly indicate the religious denomination on the attached applications.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nMFT/HM\n\nEncl:\nOctober 30, 1951.\n\nMr. D.M.

III.\n\nWe have a letter of October 18 from Canon Hives requesting the discharge of a number of pupils. It would be appreciated if you would advise Reverend Hives that a request for future discharges should be indicated on Form I.A. III. When the entries are made on this form, it is easier to check our records when any information is required in future.\n\nWe do not appear to have any applications for the admission of the following pupils: 0501, 0503, 615, 616 and 0487.

This is my first day in my office since coming out of hospital, where I had to undergo a major operation. My first letter is to you in reference to the letter, 388-10 to Mr. Hott, Superintendent at Lytton. I am sorry that my health has hindered proper supervision of admission and discharge of pupils.\n\nIn the recent quarterly returns from St. George's School, there was a large turnover of pupils. No matter how carefully I try to arrange things so that I may know a little before-hand what new pupils we are likely to have, I can never be sure just what is going to take place until the day of school opening at the beginning of September. Of late years they have come crowding in, and I have had to turn many away. Then, because children come in, who are either too far distant from any school, or who come from broken homes, I have to sort out those in school, whose parents can reasonably be expected to care for them and send them to a Public School, in order to make room for the more urgent cases.\n\nA few years ago I wrote you a letter showing my concern on account of the financial situation; and how difficult it was to make ends meet. In reply you said the only remedy was a full school. With that object in view, I have taken the sewing-room from the top floor of the main building, and have turned them into dormitories, as per original plan. I applied for and received last Summer twenty new beds; and we now have the same dormitory space and accommodation as Alert Bay, where they have, I believe, a pupilage of 220. The only possible way that we can carry on here is to have a full school, and receive a grant allowance for every child in school. The same staff is required for 100 as for 220. The same heating and lighting expenses. Last year we received a grant allowance for an average of 304.5 pupils all through the year. I do sincerely hope that we may be allowed a full school. Dr. Tennant was here a few weeks ago, and seemed to satisfied with the dormitory space allowed for the pupils. If I have to discharge pupils down to the pupilage 100, it will be a very great disappointment to the people, and a disgrace to us.\n\nThere was some mention about pupil No. 527, Donald Adams. Previous to last year this boy attended St. George's School. He was sent to Edmonton last year, and, from what I can make out, did not do very well. Mr. Indian Superintendent Anfield sent him back to us, and he was given his old number.\n\nThe explanation for the two Application Forms enclosed is as follows: The deceased father of the two children was a Catholic, the mother an old pupil of St. George's School. The children were found\nin a state of neglect by the brother of the deceased father, who adopted them and brought them here. This man is an Anglican, and has three children here.\n\nI think it is to be regretted that this and similar matters could not be disposed of from the Commissioner's office in Vancouver. We seldom ever see any official here, and you are so far away. But there are times when even important officials from Ottawa come, and drive through Lytton without bothering to call on us. They could, at least call and give a word of encouragement.\n\nNow, I suppose the balance of the Quarterly grant allowance will be held up until this matter is settled. We have less than nothing in the bank, and many bills to pay. I do hope you will, as I think you always have, try to do your best for us.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMama Tannery\nMama B.C.\nAugust 9th 1951\n\nDear Miss Wilson,\n\nThe days for our children's holiday are nearing the end very quickly as it seems and we must prepare them for their return. The first thing that I want to know is: are you having an escort for the northern children and what direction are they taking to return to school after their vacation? Last year we waited for them expecting them to return by boat and rail but they took the interior route. Second we have a young one Elizabeth Margaret Mahoney aged 7 years that we wish to enter with Emma and Gloria soon. We wrote a letter just before the other children came out about these children but have received no reply as of today. And what day will the northern children if they return by steamship leave Prince Rupert south bound so that we may put our children on this boat. And the registration papers that we sign for entry we wish to have sent here then we could fill them and forward the escort or mail to you.\n\nI wishing you and yours the best of health and may God bless you all.\n\nYours Truly,\nRaymond Mahoney\nAugust 14, 1951\n\nMr. Raymond Nahanees,\nNamu Cannery,\nNamu, B.C.\n\nDear Raymond:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th inst., re. your girls. The boat, returning with the Prince Rupert pupils, will leave P. Rupert on Sept. 4th. The children will be under the supervision of Mr. Anfield, Indian Superintendent at Prince Rupert, who will escort them to Vancouver.\n\nI am enclosing an application form for your daughter Elizabeth. In regard to Leonie I consider it was a great pity that she was taken from the Roman Catholic school and sent to us. I know this may appear strange for me to say this, but she had, I presume, spent some years under the sisters. They simply made a good Catholic of her during those years, and she will always be one at heart for the rest of her life. That is my sincere conviction of the matter. For her own peace of mind and future welfare and happiness, I think, Raymond, that you should send her to a Roman Catholic convent. And as I say this, I speak as one father to another. I am an Anglican, and nobody could change me from that status, but I do love children, and every child who comes to me is my child. And so, Raymond, I would again urge on you to give Leona back to the Church that she really, at heart belongs.\n\nThe other two girls, I will gladly take in, and do everything possible for them.\n\nKindest regards and every good wish.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPrincipal.\nReverend Principal,\nSt. George's School,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI would refer to former pupil Leona Melrose Nahanee, daughter of Raymond Nahanee of the Squamish Indian Band at present living at Namu, B.C.\n\nShe apparently has one more year of school to complete before she is of legal leaving age. Her father writes that you suggest her entering a Roman Catholic convent, but says the Anglican religion is acceptable to her. Her parents prefer her to remain at your school.\n\nHas a bed been held for this girl?\n\nWill you please write me in this matter at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(H. E. Taylor)\nIndian Superintendent.\nOct. 14, 1951\n\nMr. H.E. Taylor,\nSuperintendent of Indians,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Taylor:\n\nOwing to illness, I was unable to keep my promise to meet you last Thursday in reference to Leona Nehnsee. We have, at present, two girls, sisters of the above. In answer to a letter from the father, asking me to find a position for Leona, who was supposed to be of age to leave school, I told him it would be far better for him to place her in a convent, as she was, at heart, because of her early training, a Roman Catholic girl. He then asked me if I could do with the younger girl. I told him we could take in two of his girls. He therefore sent the two younger than Leona. We have a very full school; more than we should have, and unless the Department give us a full per capita grant allowance for all we have in school, I don't see how we are going to pay all the bills that come in.\n\nI am afraid I shall not be able to get into Vancouver for some weeks, as I have to go into hospital on Wednesday to undergo a fairly serious operation.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nPrincipal.\nOctober 5th 1931.\n\nMr. H. E. Taylor,\nIndian Superintendent,\n403 Federal Building,\nVancouver 2, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 4th inst., regarding the return to school of Leona Nahanees, daughter of Raymond Nahanees of the Squamish Indian Band. I expect to be in Vancouver next Thursday, October 11th, and will take up this matter with you then.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nPrincipal.\nMrs. Maurice Mahanee\nMoose, B.C.\nOct. 1/51.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed find $1.00 for the school paper \"Dragon.\" Do you still publish it?\n\nHow is Elizabeth & Maria making out at school especially Elizabeth as it is her first year. I do hope she feels at home as she is amongst her own people.\n\nWe have just found out that Laura is fifteen. That is an error through our record book. And we like to send her back to St. George's if you are willing to take her back. We have questioned her about the religious angle & she claims that she is willing to accept the Anglican faith or has. And although she does not remember anything for the Catholic faith, so please consider it and if you can send her back there with you at St. George's.\n\nShe would also like to be there with her sisters. Thank you very much.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nMaurice Mahanee\nDEPARTMENT OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n403 Federal Building,\nVancouver 2, B.C.\n\nNovember 2, 1951.\n\nReverend Principal,\nSt. George's Indian School,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to my letter to you of the 23rd instant re the children of Raymond Nahane, Squamish Band, the parents advise that the elementary school in Namu is full, and Leona cannot be admitted. They prefer to keep her at home and leave her younger sisters with you.\n\nWe did not receive any application forms of admission of the two younger ones who have been admitted to your school according to your advice. Have these forms been completed?\n\nIn order to keep track of the family allowance payments and other records, it is necessary that we be kept promptly advised of all admission and discharges. Kindly advise at your earliest convenience.\n\nI hope that you are now in good health.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(H. E.

Hives  \nPrincipal\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nI am replying to letter written to Mr. Superintendent Hott, October 30th. I have already dealt with pupil No. 522, Donald Adams, in a previous letter, showing that he was absent from St. George's School for a year while he attended Edmonton School for a time, where, it would appear from observation, he was on a fairly good basis. The boy has now settled down to our routine and discipline, and will do well.\n\nPupil No. 507, 508. The original Application for Admission went forward from this office to the office of Lytton Agency. Our own office copies, I herewith enclose. Likewise Nos. 612-616. These are our school copies, and I would appreciate it if they could be returned when the originals come to light. I am also enclosing our office copy of No. 529, signed by the mother of the child. In a previous letter I have complained about No. 509, Elizabeth Nahane, and I am enclosing the original correspondence between Raymond Nahane and myself regarding this child and her sisters. In future I shall avoid having anything whatever to do with these discontented people, who come to us, either out of guilt or because they cannot have their own way.\n\nNo. 6437. The application went forward along with Application for Admission of Matilda Gloria Edmonds of the same band. The latter was accepted. I enclose along with the other letters, a letter from the mother of 6437, and would be glad to have all these letters returned.\n\nIn regard to discharges, I have always been in the habit of placing these names on Form I.A./A1 after approval has been given by Ottawa, as I was instructed to do so. They would, therefore, appear in the October-December Quarterly Returns.\n\nI would appreciate having a cheque as soon as possible, as I cannot possibly maintain very much longer unless I do receive finances in the near future.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan  \nSuperintendent of Education,  \nIndian Affairs,  \nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6466, file 888-10, part 12)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES  \nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES  \nCANADA\nLyttom, B.

You will be advised in this respect by the respective Indian Superintendents.\n\nNo decision has been reached on the admission of #0503 Margaret Nahanee to the St. George's School. It would be appreciated if you would delete this girl's name from the Quarterly Returns as the Department is not prepared to allow a Per Capita Grant for this girl until her admission is approved. In the meantime, we are holding all the correspondence on the case and when a definite decision is reached you will be informed accordingly and the school correspondence returned.\nThe September Quarter Grant has been paid in full and it is presumed that a cheque for $5,000, representing an advance on the December grant has reached you by now.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nYour File No. 888-10 (E6)\n\nReceipt is acknowledged of letter of the\n1st instant from the Superintendent of Education re the\napplication for admission into the St. George's Indian\nResidential School of Elizabeth Margaret Nahane of the\nSquamish Indian Band.\n\nIt is noted that the Department is not pre-\npared to approve the admission of this pupil to the St.\nGeorge's School at present as she is of the Roman Catholic\nFaith. I may say that I had assumed that Elizabeth\nMargaret had been accepted into the Anglican Faith in the\nsame way as her sisters, who were entered into the Lytton\nSchool.\n\nThe father of this girl, Raymond Nahane,\nafter divorcing his first wife, married an Indian girl who\nhad previously been a pupil of the St. George's Indian\nSchool. Raymond Nahane is presumably a Catholic, but\nacquiesced in the desire of his wife to have the other\nchildren, who had been baptized as Catholic, readmitted into\nthe Anglican Faith.\n\nI wrote to the parents following receipt of\nMr. Phelan's letter, and am now advised that they wish\nElizabeth Margaret to be accepted into the Anglican Faith\nin the same way as her sisters. I am notifying the\nprincipal of the St. George's School of the wishes of the\nparents, and will await further developments.\n\n(H. E.

I am very desirous of getting this activity extended without delay, and, as a preliminary step, I have to authorise you to purchase the materials listed on the enclosure you forwarded. The materials for work benches, the individual and general sets of tools and the drawing sets indicated should be supplied to the Skeetches, Squamish, Upper Island, Cariboo, St. Mary's, St. George's, Alert Bay, and Fraser Lake schools. As the Skeetches activity can be started immediately, work benches, drawing sets, etc., may be purchased. For Squamish you may supply $450 worth of equipment, as listed in your letter. The department is already in correspondence with the Reverend Mr. Scott concerning suitable workrooms for St. George's. I rely upon you to purchase to the best advantage and to write to the principals concerned explaining the use to which this equipment will be put. You may also authorise each principal to purchase lumber with which to work, as soon as the classes can be started. You may fix the amount to be expended on these materials from $600 to $1,100 as indicated in your letter, and you should direct principals to make requisition to the Indians agent for further materials, when required. If you find that any expenditure is necessary to complete the carpenter shop at Fraser Lake you should let the department have an estimate.\n\nI have written a special letter to Father Monk of the Cariboo School, pointing out that the department not be overworked in connection with the supply of fuel, and I am satisfied that vocational training can be started at this institution also. The building is being insured to assist with current financing, and I have clearly indicated that the extra grant is for the engaging of labour for the supply of fuel.\n\nThe question of organising this work and the appointment or securing of suitable instructors should now engage our attention.

It might be a good investment. The duties of such a man would be to make recommendations regarding buildings and equipment for vocational training at each school; to advise regarding the local instructors and to get the classes started. At some schools, it would be necessary to add a man to the staff and at others, to make arrangements for the holding of classes by public school instructors.\n\nThe Department will secure copies of the manuals and job sheets Mr. Sly has recommended, and these will be sent to the various schools. If the Department is able to secure the services of a special officer to organize this work, I should expect you to supervise his activity. The organization might take from one to two years, and, at that time, experience would have shown whether it would be necessary to continue the position. If you are able to secure applicants for this organization work, please let me know when I can visit you a few weeks from now.\n\nAt a later date, after courses in carpentry are well under way, the Department must consider the advisability of extending the work along other lines.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nFebruary 7, 1929.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nOn File 600224, Commissioner Ditchburn was authorized, on February 6th, to purchase the following equipment for the St. George's Indian Residential School.

Ryfe Smith Co., Ltd., 1320 Richards St., Vancouver, B.C., for lumber for the instruction of wood work in connection with the manual training classes to be inaugurated at St. George's Indian Residential School, Lytton Agency.\n\nAuthority for this purchase is contained in a letter from the Deputy Superintendent General dated February 6, 1929, File 600224.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E. Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnclosures:\n\nHM.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6466, file 888-11, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, May 14, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department is making special efforts to improve the instruction in manual and vocational training for boys in the Indian schools of British Columbia. If this phase of our educational programme can be made more effective, it will greatly benefit the Indians of the province. Most residential schools have a workshop or other space that can be used for vocational training. If you can improve the workshop facilities should be taken at the St. George's Indian Residential School, please cooperate with Mr. Indian Agent Graham with a view to making a recommendation to the Department.\n\nA thorough course in carpentry is the present aim. To this end, Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn has been authorized to supply benches and tools and there has been directed to you a text on manual training, job sheets in woodworking and a publication on how to work with tools and wood. Further, you have been authorized to present to Mr. Agent Graham reasonable accounts for materials with which to work.\n\nThe Department is desirous of having a qualified instructor for this work at all schools where this special training is being undertaken. Some schools have on the staff an officer who is well qualified for the activity and who can be released from other duties for the manual training classes. I understand there are summer courses for instructors in manual training in Vancouver and Victoria. Other Indian schools are so situated that they can secure the services of instructors from municipal schools. In this case, classes are held two or three times per week. The Department would like to know what arrangements you have made, or can make, for this important work. Do not hesitate to enlist the cooperation of Mr. Graham, if the Department can be of any assistance.\n\nAt a later date, it is hoped to extend the vocational training to include gas engines and other machinery; and whenever you believe this additional course should be given at the St. George's Indian Residential School, you will please inform the Department. A copy of this letter is being directed to Mr. Agent Graham for his information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Mclean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. A. R. Lett,\nPrincipal,\nSt. George's Indian Residential School,\nLytton, B. C.\nDear Sir-\n\nI note with extreme interest the propositions of the Dept., regarding manual training and the possibility of gas engines and other machinery coming under their Dept in the schools. We could to a degree carry on this latter at the present time if a shop were available.\n\nThe manual training and repair shops are now under course of construction but these do not include a shop wherein we could put in our own trucks and engines for repair.\n\nWe need a machine shed wherein to house our farm machinery and a shop in connection with this building would be the proper place for the engine repair shop.\n\nIt is a step which will prove of great benefit to the Indian work in this province and a great boon to the schools.\n\nI shall put forth every effort to utilize the Dept in their endeavor.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nSt Georges Residential School\n\nMachine and Blacksmith's Shop\n\nScale \\( \\frac{1}{8} = 1 \\text{ ft.} \\)\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nReferring to that part of the Ass. Dep. & Secretary's letter of May the 14th numbering 168-9-11 end of which you have a copy, please note that I am to enlist your help in carrying the proposed new phase of work in our school.\n\nIn connection therewith I might say that I have been able to secure the services of a competent man who has qualified for this work in Victoria and as it is a new phase in the school education and one in which I heartily concur, it is adding an extra salary of approximately $30.00 per month to the present amount paid by the school in salaries. Do you think the Dept would be satisfied to allow me a cash salary of $80.00 over and above the present per capita grants allowing me to take care of the remainder in the way of benefits such as vegetables, fuel, etc. I would gladly accept this help as the financing of the school is by no means an easy task.\n\nI have also to say that I have on the staff now a man who could handle the gas engine work spoken of by the Ass. Dep. and would like to start this work immediately or as soon as possible but this work will entail a building in which to house our blacksmithing equipment which is still at the old site and several of the tools have since we moved away been stolen. It is essential that we should move this shop as quickly as we can to save the property of the Dept. and have same near at hand to do our repair work and teach the boys. The Gas Engine shop should be in this building and if the Dept. can see fit to give us the lumber I can safely say that we can undertake the building of same with our own help under the supervision of Mr Leonard, the Manual instructor who is a carpenter by trade.\n\nWe also have no machine shed in which to house the farm implements. Up to the present we have been housing them in every available tumble down shack, these are becoming more dilapidated as the years go by and now are almost as good as nothing. If the lumber were available we could also erect this building ourselves, not only saving the Dept. the cost of labor but would also give the older boys some needed practical training.\n\nThe training in the Manual room must in this part of Canada lead up to the Building trade and the more actual work the boys can receive here the better for them.\n\nI trust you will see fit to take these requirements to the Dept. asking them to do what they can to aid us in the same.\n\nYours very obediently\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nSir:\n\nOn May 15th, the Department addressed a letter to the Rev. Principal of St. George's Residential School, in connection with making a special effort to improve manual and vocational training in schools of British Columbia. A copy of Department's letter was sent to me, asking for my co-operation.\n\nI have gone into this matter thoroughly with the Rev. Principal, and am now enclosing a copy of a letter just received from him, together with plans for a new machine and blacksmith shop, along an implement shed, which is fully explained in the Rev. Principal's letter.\n\nThe actual cost of the material for these buildings would amount to $200 or $300, and if this work is to be carried on this building is very essential, as the present blacksmith shop, which is really inadequate, being too small, and an old building, is situated at the site of the old school, which is at least half a mile from the present school.\n\nThe implement shed is greatly needed, as at the present time, all farm machinery is scattered in old buildings in all parts of the farm. The most of these buildings are falling down.\n\nI would like to recommend that the material for these buildings asked for be supplied.\n\nThe wages to be paid to a manual training teacher will come rather hard on the Principal, and I would like to recommend that the Department make a special grant for this.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6466, file 888-11, part 1)\nOttawa, September 19, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, enclosing a communication from the Principal of St. George's Indian Residential School regarding manual and vocational training at this school. The sketch drawings of the new machine and blacksmith shop and implement shed, with estimate of the cost of the material to erect same which he states is required to properly carry out the manual training instruction, and the need in providing an implement shed, have been noted.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department will approve of an expenditure not exceeding approximately $1,000 in the purchase of the building material required to erect a machine and blacksmith shop, also an implement shed. This building material should be purchased to the best advantage, and certified accounts, in duplicate, covering the cost should be forwarded by you in the usual manner. It is to be understood that the labour in erecting the buildings will be performed by school help under the supervision of the manual training instructor without cost to the Department.\n\nRelative to the Principal's request that this Department provide part of the salary of the manual training instructor, I have to say that the sum of $40 per month will be allowed for this purpose. This will be paid upon receipt of certified vouchers from you from time to time for the amount due at the above rate.\n\nThe expenditure in supplying the building material and also the grant allowed towards payment of the salary of the instructor will be made from \"Special Grant\", and you should so state on your vouchers.\n\nIn erecting the machine and blacksmith shop and implement shed, care should be taken to see that proper sites for these buildings are selected, and while at convenient points they should not detract from the general appearance of the other buildings.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.

BARRY,\nDATED FEBRUARY 19, 1931, ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE\nST. GEORGE'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on File 165-0-6.\n\nMr. Batchelor has a Temporary Manual Training Certificate from Vancouver.\n\nThere are 65 boys in this class. They work in groups. The room has 8 very good benches with room for 16 boys. The Provincial Course adapted to local conditions is followed and the boys enjoy their work.\n\nThere is an excellent supply of the necessary tools. These are well looked after by the teacher and the boys. A large number of the articles made are used in the school. The boys are building a First Aid Room and making the furniture for it.\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nWe are in receipt of your circular of the 19th inst., No. 1-11, and note your suggestions. We are able to carry out the greater part of these in detail, excepting perhaps for the butter making for girls.\n\nWe are at the present time feeding milk to the children, and while they are here we are not separating so we handle all the whole milk in the school, but the time is not far hence when we shall be obliged to do continual separating and this will mean a new cream separator and some other equipment such as churn and other utensils to be used for butter making. We shall be glad when the time comes to give this instruction if the Department will equip us with these necessities in the dairy.\n\nWe have also been able to give some instruction in gas engines, having the building fairly well equipped; in order that this should become a course of instruction it will be necessary for us to have a special man for the work and unless the Department is prepared to accept the responsibility of a full salaried instructor it will not be possible to employ such a man, paying him at the per capita grant.\n\nI agree with you, and I have heretofore and up to the present time, made it my business to carry members of the staff, both inside and out, who are in every way capable of scientific instruction. These people, if efficient, demand a fairly high wage. With the present financial condition, is it possible to employ this extra man?\n\nI trust you will see fit in the near future to be able to allow us the needed equipment, and also the extra salaried man. When the Department is ready to do this I shall be pleased to put this instruction into action as I realise the necessity for a thorough training for the equipping of the children to enable them to take care of themselves when they return to the reserves and make homes for themselves.\n\nI trust you will be able to make it possible for us to carry out the wishes of the Department.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL.\n\nRussell T.

Sir:\n\nThe Department has received a report from Mr. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools, on the vocational training being carried out by the pupils of St. George's Indian Residential School. He states that, while the course followed is that approved for use in the provincial schools, too much attention is being paid to the actual scientific work of manual training. He also states he discussed this matter with Mr. John Kyle, Organizer of Technical Instruction for the Provincial Department of Education, and that they both agree that in Indian schools it is a mistake to keep the boys at such elementary work for a lengthy period. They feel it would be much better to show them how to use the tools, and then to put them to the actual construction of useful articles. Mr. Barry states that he explained this to Mr. Batchelor, the Instructor at the school.\n\nThe Department is not prepared to furnish an electric lathe and band saw. Mr. Kyle, who is an expert on manual training, and whose opinion is of value, has pointed out that the use of lathes and band saws are not what is wanted in the teaching of manual training. He is of opinion that the boys ought to be taught the use of tools which they will be using when they leave school.\n\nThe Department will place an order with the Government Stationery Office here to supply asbestoslate blackboard, 12' x 4', as recommended by Inspector Barry for use in the manual training shop.\n\nYou may arrange to purchase a quantity of lumber for the construction of drawing benches, to a cost not exceeding approximately $15. It is understood that the boys will be able to make these benches if the lumber is supplied. After the purchase has been made, please forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. A. R. Lett,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nLytton, B.C.\nVocational Training:\n\nThe girls are learning to cook, and to do all the ordinary house work. There are in the sewing-room nine ordinary Singer sewing machines and two of the larger Singer tailor machines. The girls learn to use these machines in due course. They learn to sew, patch, darn, and as they grow older they make some of their own dresses and other clothes.\n\nThe Manual Training is under Mr. Batchelor. This teacher has a Temporary Manual Training Certificate from the Provincial Dept. of Education, as he has taken, and will complete his training, in the Vancouver Summer School for Manual Training Teachers. There are 65 boys in this class. They work in groups. The Manual Training shop has eight very good dual benches.\n\nWhile it is true that the course followed is that approved for use in the Provincial Schools, as previously reported when I first inspected this school, it is also true that too much attention is being paid to the actual scientific work of Manual Training. It will no doubt be noted that this is the exact opposite of the conditions in the majority of the Indian Residential Schools. Since my inspection of this school, I have had a long talk with the Organizer of Vocational Instruction in British Columbia, a Mr. John Kyle, of the Department of Education, in Victoria.\n\nThe display from this school at the Canadian Pacific Exhibition in Vancouver was as I reported at the time much below the standard of either Alert Bay or Coqualeetza Indian Residential Schools.\n\nI am informed that the Manual Training class here at Lytton has been following the course set for the Vancouver City schools. Mr. Kyle and I agree that in Indian schools it is a mistake to keep the boys at such elementary work for a lengthy time. It is we feel much better to show them how to use the tools, and then put them to the actual construction of useful articles.\n\nI have explained some of this to the Instructor, Mr. Batchelor, and think that there will be a definite improvement in the work at St. Joseph's before long.\n\nA number of articles have been made for use in the school. These include tables, cupboards, a High School Laboratory Cabinet, and a number of smaller articles.\n\nThe tools are in excellent condition, and everything is well looked after by the teacher. In fact the Manual Training here is a very definite part of the school work.\n\nA Green Kiloplate Board 12 feet by 4 feet is strongly recommended for use in the Manual Training Shop. I also wish to recommend the supply of about \u00a315.00 worth of lumber for the construction of Drawing Benches. The boys will be able to make these if they have the required lumber.\n\nThe Principal and Mr. Batchelor also wish for an Electric Lathe and for an Electric Band Saw. While I was perfectly willing to recommend these, if they would be for the benefit of the boys, I spoke about it to Mr. Kyle. Mr. Kyle is of course an expert on Manual Training, and his opinion is of value. He pointed out to me that the use of Lathes and Band Saws was not what was needed in the teaching of Manual Training. He thought that the boys ought to be taught the use of the tools which they will be using when they leave school. I am therefore not prepared to recommend the supply of the above mentioned Lathe and Band-Saw at the present time.\n\nAll the above Vocational Work is of definite use to the boys and girls when they leave school. It is making a difference to life in the Indian villages, as the children leaving school insist on changes being made in their homes to conform more or less with the conditions under which they have lived in the Residential Schools.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6466, file 888-11, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n**GOVERNMENT OF THE DOMINION OF CANADA**\n\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS, BRITISH COLUMBIA**\n\n**Lytton AGENCY**\n\nTo...St...George's School...Lytton...B.C.\n\n| DATE   | DETAIL                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 1932   | St.George's School $50.00                                              |        |\n| Feb.6  | To Grant for Manual Training Instructor for the month of January,      | $50.00 |\n\n**STATEMENT**\n\n30th January 1932\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nIndian Agent's Office,\nLytton B.C.\n\nIn Act with St. George's School.\n\nTerms\n\nJanuary 30 To Manual Training cheque (for Jan:\n1932) $50.00\n\nI hereby certify that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that all expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nForm No. 11\nGOVERNMENT OF THE DOMINION OF CANADA\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS, BRITISH COLUMBIA\n\nLytton AGENCY\n\nTo St. George's School, Lytton, B.C.\n\n| DATE   | DETAIL          | AMOUNT |\n|--------|-----------------|--------|\n| 1932   | St. George's School | $50.00 |\n\nFeb. 6.\n\n$50.00\n\nI hereby certify that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that all expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nForm No. 11\nOffice of the Lytton Indian Agency,\n\nFebruary 18th, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. #339, amounting to $50.00 in favour of St. George's School for grant towards Manual Training Instructor.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. dated September 1930.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101 AS/MD\nLytton, B.C.,\n19th February,\n\nRussell T. Perrier Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to yours of February last (No. 165-0-11) Inspector Barry has evidently been impressed by an argument which he and I had over Exhibition work displayed at the Vancouver Exhibition last autumn. I pointed out to him that I felt the work exhibited by these Schools was far in excess of work which should be done for the length of time the Manual Training course has become a factor in our School Education. I thought there was too much highly polished furniture and not enough elementary work on exhibit. Again, I pointed out that with only two boys in St. George's School who were over fifteen years of age it was a physical impossibility for us to compete with classes ranging in number from ten to twenty. I also pointed out to him that we had too much other work in Manual Training for the boys to do without confining our whole year to Exhibition work.\n\nI am sure you can readily see for yourself by the enclosed list of Manual Training Room production that we are not confining ourselves to those courses stipulated by the Organiser of Technical Education. We are using tin models only in which to acquaint the boys with the tools, then branching out into heavier and more practical work.\n\nThis year I have mapped out a course for the Manual Training shop which includes building of irrigation flumes, making of gates, making rustic chairs etc. etc. This I think is much more practical for the boys of this district and much more valuable to them, than the making of highly polished furniture.\n\nWe shall be working on the butcher's shop shortly, and this will help to increase their knowledge of building.\nSt. George's Indian Residential School\nOriginated by the New England Company\n(The oldest English Missionary Society, founded 1649)\n\nLytton, B.C.\n\nR.T.Ferrier Esq: -2- 19.2.32\n\nI trust that the foregoing, together with the enclosed list will serve to show that Inspector Barry placed altogether too much emphasis on our talk of Exhibition production. If the Exhibition of last year is what is expected of these Schools then St. George's is out of the running for some years to come, as boys of fourteen and fifteen cannot produce the workmanship of lads running in age from eighteen to twenty. But if we are recognised in comparison of age grade, then we can hope to do something.\n\nVery obediently yours,\n\nA.R.LETT\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL\n\nARL/MW\nEnc:\nManual Training Room............. 19th February 1932.\n\nLarge cupboard alterations\n5' kitchen table (gate leg and flap top style)\n8' x 7' x 3' Kitchen Cabinet\n14' Sewing-Room table\nSteam pipe boxing\nLaboratory Cabinet 5' x 4' x 2'\nWall partition\nServing Wagon for Dining-Room (two tray style on wheels)\n18 picture frames for Hall decoration\nBlueprinting and tracing for proposed slaughterhouse\nStage erections and fixtures\nTool Box\n1 large flume model (Irrigation)\n1 small flume model (Irrigation)\n1 draughting table\n1 large First-Aid Cabinet\n1 Grader, triangular pendulum type (for Irrigation Ditch Grading)\n\n1 sectioned Cabinet frame with glass settings } Display\n2 sectioned doors with glass settings } Cabinet carcass supplied by Department.\n4 large drawers for display Cabinet\n\n1 Model gate - Indian style\n6 sleighs with runners (bob sleigh style)\n1 chair - rustic, with woven seat and back rest\n1 stool - rustic, with woven seat\n1 small stool - modern type with woven top\n1 large Serving-Room table\n\n(Boys work up to model No. 10 and then branch into elementary practical work)\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6466, file 888-11, part 1)\nGOVERNMENT OF THE DOMINION OF CANADA\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS, BRITISH COLUMBIA\n\nLytton AGENCY\n\nTo St. George's School, Lytton, B.C.\n\n| DATE | DETAIL | AMOUNT |\n|------|--------|--------|\n| 1932 | St. George's School $50.00 |        |\n| Mar. 2 | To grant for Manual Training Instructor for February, which expenditure was authorized in September, 1930, | $50.00 |\n\nSTATEMENT\n\n29th February 1932\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nIndian Agent's Office\n\nLytton B.C.\n\nIn Accrual with St. George's School\n\nForm No. 11\n\nFeb. 29 To Manual Training cheque (for Feb. 1932) $50.00\n\n$50.00\n\nthe work performed ately and that each\n\nIndian Agent\n\nE&CE.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6466, file 888-11, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI hereby certify that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that all expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6466, file 883-11, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nLetter No. 3-06\n\nOffice of the...

I regret to report that this gentleman, unfortunately, has been in ill health, but I understand he is now better again.\n\nThere were 160 children in the school at the time of my visit. The school was clean and tidy. Fire drill is carried out regularly, the time for getting the children out at the last alarm being 2\u00bd minutes. The chemical extinguishers have been filled lately, and I instructed that the hose pipes should be tested.\n\nThe children were having stew, potatoes and apple pie for their next meal.\n\nThe crops looked very promising. Good manual training is being continued. A good store cupboard is required for the keeping of the carpenter tools in the manual training shop. Cost of material would be about $15.00, and I should suggest that this be authorized.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n(Geo. S.

Strang,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Strang:\n\nIn your note, dated yesterday, numbering 1361-06, regarding the bill presented to you from Mr. Fred Meyers, amounting to $55.37, in which the Department says there is no authority given by the Department for the purchase of this material.\n\nIn regard to this bill, as it included necessary material to carry on the work in the Manual Training Shop for the School year, 1932-1933, I have to refer you to letter number 165-C-11 dated May 14th 1929, in which the Department states the following:\n\n\"Further, you have been authorised to present to Mr. Agent Graham, reasonable accounts for materials with which to work.\"\n\nand again:\n\n\"Do not hesitate to enlist the co-operation of Mr. Graham if the Department can be of any assistance.\"\n\nHeretofore, this has been done without any criticism at all from the Department, and, as this account was for material at the beginning of the term, the bill for which unfortunately was overlooked, there seems to be no reason why the Department should make any objection to paying this bill. As stated above, permission was given to me direct from the Department, under signature of J. D. McLean, assistant Deputy and Secretary, to cooperate with the Indian Agent in regard to the purchase of this material.\n\nI trust this will prove satisfactory, and you will find this the information you are seeking regarding the bill, presented from Fred C. Meyers and Company.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nA.R. Lett.\n\nPRINCIPAL\u2014 A. R.

In this connection it is noted that the sum authorized, viz.: $110, is not sufficient.\n\nThe total amount that can be allowed for the purchase of supplies for the manual training classes at this school during the coming academic year is $300. I enclose an encumbrance certificate authorizing a further expenditure of $190. This, with the authority already given you, will provide for an expenditure to the amount mentioned. You should therefore arrange for the purchase from a firm on the list to receive consideration. Please obtain an itemized account, in triplicate, covering the cost of the materials purchased. This, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. You should state on each copy of the voucher that the expenditure was incurred under authority of E. R. Nos. 806 and 880.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nEncl.\n\nA.

H. BARRY ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE LYTTON INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL ON DECEMBER 18th AND 19th, 1933.\n\nWhile Mr. White's work may be considered satisfactory and even good by the Principal, I am perfectly satisfied that far less time should be devoted to the drawing of detailed geometrical drawings of the articles to be constructed, and far more of the time spent in the actual handling of tools and the construction of articles which the boys may wish to make after they leave school. I have had so many talks with the Superintendent of Technical Instruction, Mr. John Kyle, over the best methods of instructing country boys, Indians or otherwise, that I know this is also his view. He and I agree that rough working sketches WITH DIMENSIONS are all that is required. The keeping of young boys at drawing boards during Manual Training periods leads me to conclude that the Instructor does not understand what is required. I have tried my best to point out to him that Indian boys do not require the same work as do boys in the Provincial High Schools. If the present Instructor is either unwilling or unable to change his methods by the time of my next inspection, I shall have to ask the Department to take the matter up with the Principal. If the manual Training given in the Residential Schools is not that which will fit the Indian boys for after school conditions, the sooner the Department saves its special grants for this purpose the better.\nOttawa, February 26, 1934.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nAs soon as possible after March 31st next, you should forward to the Department a detailed report regarding the vocational training that is given at the St. George's Indian Residential School. This report should contain the following information:\n\n(a) Instruction: Name and qualifications of instructor or instructors.\n\n(b) Industries: Under this heading you should specify the industries taught, the number of pupils in each industry, number of hours weekly that each pupil is engaged, and list of work accomplished during the period April 1, 1933, to March 31, 1934.\n\n(c) General Remarks: Under this heading you should state if the pupils are interested, and if you consider the results that are being obtained justify the expenditure that is being made.\n\nIf you feel that the value of the course could be improved, you should state in what manner you believe this could be done.\n\nIn addition to the above, you should let me know what is being done at your school to carry out the instructions contained in circular letter of March 15, 1931, a copy of which is enclosed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The above projects include the necessary theory lessons, such as making of plans and elevations with instruments, followed by neat freehand sketches with all dimensions included; the comprehension of \"Cutting Lists\", bills of \"material used\"; lessons on care of tools, how to grind, whet, etc., is all included in the Manual Training instruction.\nSection C. - General Interest.\n\nBecause of so much alfalfa grown the school keeps a small apiary whereby the boys receive instruction in bee husbandry. Bees do very well in the Dry Belt of British Columbia and could be made quite a payable investment.\n\nThe Indian craft of basketry which in this section of B. C. and especially among the Lower Thompson Tribes became advanced to a very high standard of craftsmanship and Indian art. It is now gradually becoming a thing of the past. I therefore feel that interest should again be aroused and provision made for an Indian woman to spend a short time each year in the school teaching the children in order that this craftsmanship might be perpetuated. The Indians could make quite a bit of this work, catering to tourist trade and the art therefore should not be allowed to become extinct. The Department would do well therefore to make some arrangement whereby this dying craft should again be revived.\n\nRe circular letter of March 19, 1931.\n\nIn connection with your letter of March 19, 1931, I would respectfully call your attention to my answer to this circular, dated March 24, 1931, in which I stated that the milk production of the school herd was then all being used. This condition still exists because we have been obliged to butcher so many cows in connection with the abortion trouble in the barn. We therefore have not been able to instruct the girls in buttermaking as asked for.\n\nWe are endeavouring in every way to give the boys the general training called for and feel that if it is made possible for these boys to carry out in their after school life such training as is given, they would soon measure up to an equal standard with every independent citizen of our Dominion.\n\nI trust you will find the above satisfactory and if there is any further information you desire I shall be pleased to forward the same.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\nA. A. Lett,\nPrincipal.\nBoys:\n\nThere are 62 boys receiving vocational training.\n\nManual Training Department.\n\n56 hours per week. 20 boys per month are rotated in this Department, repeating once every three months. List of work done enclosed on a separate sheet.\n\nFarm.\n\n56 hours per week. 26 boys are rotated each month. The farm is divided into the following departments: the dairy, 8 boys; gardening and fruit-growing, 4 boys; general farm work, 14 boys. The general farm work includes blacksmith shop, tractor and motor repairs, farm implements and general repairs, covering 640 hours during the year; Cleaning and treating seed grain, cutting and treating seed potatoes, 500 hours; Spraying and pruning, 448 hours.\n\nThe work in the dairy includes care and feeding of cows in general, making an individual study of productive, weighing of milk, value of feed and milk, advertising the ability of the cow to pay her way; care and sterilization of utensils; care of milk, making a study of methods which to keep down bacteria growth; sequence in breeding for production and testing; R.O.I. tests are made every six weeks by Dominion Inspectors.\n\nHogs - purebred Berkshires are grown, specially teaching the boys to make the best advantage of pasturage and general feeding to produce a choice hog in the shortest possible time.\n\nSpecial seed plots are maintained in order that a high standard of seed should be produced, thereby assuring continuation of high production. Seed plots of beans, mangels, corn, potatoes. The school is endeavouring to teach the boys to grow alfalfa seed which in this district will be a very decided asset.\n\nEngineering Department.\n\n2 boys 56 hours a week. Care of boilers and generating of steam; care and running of motors; general plumbing repairs.\n\nSection C. - General Interest.\n\nThe girls show a general interest in Domestic Science, sewing and in keeping themselves neat and tidy and in the general cleanliness of household work. It is generally believed by those who are in direct touch with them during their school life, they would, if given an opportunity, carry this out in their after school life. Their interest is especially keen in learning how to cook and bake.\n\nWe regret that more music cannot be given the girls as in the main they are musically inclined and it would afford great pleasures in after school life. The school would welcome assistance financially in this regard.\n\nThe boys show great aptitude and keenness in mechanical and carpentry work. We are fortunate at the present time to have an outstanding instructor in the Manual Training shop. The fact of his presence on the staff is due no doubt to general conditions existing in the industrial world, as a man of his calibre and ability cannot be picked up for the same amount offered by any other school. The course in the Manual Training shop is constructed so that it will meet with the general needs of the boy's after school life.\n\nThe above also applies in connection with the farm. The boys show general interest in the mechanical work and also in the scientific phase of farm industry on the whole but are not fond of the physical labour entailed in the production of hay and grain and other crops.\n\nThe tractor and motor repairs together with the blacksmith shop and repair of farm implements might be extended somewhat but do not feel that a special course in motor mechanics could be made available at the present time. Since these boys may be called to the care of themselves by agriculture, greater attention should be given to this department.\nGeneral Housework Department.\n\nEvery morning all girls, excepting those in the kitchen or laundry, are detailed for work throughout the school. This work, such as cleaning dormitories, making beds, working in the children's dining-room, tidying sitting-rooms, etc., is done in the hour between Chapel and school time. All the work is supervised by the girl's matron who judges and gives marks accordingly, thus encouraging the girls to do their very best.\n\nOn Saturday mornings the girls do housework from 8 a.m. till 12 a.m. and the school is scrubbed, swept, dusted, etc., from \"top to bottom\". Therefore all the girls get a thorough training in the art of housekeeping.\n\nOne girl each month is given special training in housekeeping working in the Residence under the supervision of the Head Matron. The Residence girl observes and learns the work of caring for a modern home. She does fine sewing, cooking for a family instead of large quantities such as done in the school kitchen, and all the work connected with housekeeping today.\n\nDomestic Science - Special Classes.\n\nTwo afternoons a week the head matron has special classes for four of the older girls of the school. They are taught fancy cooking, making special desserts, bread and biscuit making. These girls have also made seat. The laundry matron who specializes in rugmaking, takes the Domestic Science girls in that work.\n\nPractical Nursing.\n\nAll the rudimentary First Aid work is attended to by the girl's matron. The attending of sores, cuts, slivers, bruises, sprains, etc. is observed by the senior girls and when done by them is closely supervised by the girl's matron.\n\nThe girls have organized a Junior Red Cross Society and they are taught St. John's Ambulance course by the Junior Teacher. They learn bandaging, elementary anatomy course, first aid in fainting or drowning accidents.\nSection A. - Instruction.\n\nDomestic Science.\n\nMiss G. Davies - 3rd class certificate for B.C.

Piper - Farm Manager and general repair man - nine years in charge in general farming and experimental plots; five years handy man and machinist; making fourteen years experience on the Sutherland Estate, Brooks, Alta., which farm constitutes 7000 acres under irrigation.\n\nMr. R. Vaughan-Jones - Dairyman - Agricultural Certificate from Llysfasi Farm Institute, Ruthin, North Wales; demonstration lectures, practical work in dairying, feeding and milk testing, taken in a short course in Vancouver, B.C.\n\nMr. L. Stemp - Poultry, Orchard, Garden and Butchering - practical; short courses at University of B.C. on poultry raising and fruit farming.\n\nMr. S. F. Lepine - Engineer and Fireman - 4th Class B.C. Certificate.\n\nMr. J. S. White - Manual Training Instructor - B.C. Manual Training Instructor's Certificate; machinist and pattern maker.\n\nMr. A. C. Batchelor - Sport's Instructor - Dominion Cadet Trainer's Course.\nReport re Vocational Training at St. George's School.\n\nApril 9, 1934.\n\nGirls:\n\nThere are about 60 girls on the training list as the girls who are in Grade 1 do not work. These 60 girls are divided into two divisions, A and B. If the B-Division is in school, the A Division are busy in the different departments throughout the school, and so all the girls rotate. The list changes every month so by the end of the school year each girl has been in every department at least once.\n\nKitchen Department.\n\nThere are 5 girls in A Division and 5 girls in B Division detailed for the Kitchen each month. Each girl in each division is in the kitchen 7 hours in every 28 hours, making a total of 42 hours for each girl each week. 50 percent of this time is spent in actual instruction by the Kitchen Matron in cooking. The girls do all the cooking for both children and staff, which means they prepare 190 to 200 meals three times a day. The other 50 percent of the time is spent in preparing vegetables, washing-up, cleaning, etc. All this work is supervised and commented on by the Matron who advises and explains the best methods for doing such work.\n\nLaundry Department.\n\nThere are 6 girls in A Division and 6 girls in B Division detailed for the Laundry each month. Each girl in each division is in the laundry 5\u00bd hours each day except Saturday and Sunday, making a total of 26\u00bd hours for each girl each week. The washing and ironing for the children and the staff, including clothes, bed linen, table linen, curtains, etc., is done, making over 1000 pieces going through the laundry each week.\n\n1\u00bd days each week is spent in rugmaking. These rug patterns are designed and drawn by the children. The rugs are hooked from old garments which are washed, dyed and made ready for use by the girls. Braided and knitted mats have also been made and these are used throughout the school in bedrooms and bathrooms.\n\nSewing Department.\n\nThere are 31 girls in the sewing-room each day, each girl putting in about 22 hours a week, as there is no work done on Saturday or Sunday. These are some of the things the girls have accomplished in this school term: 56 Sunday dresses, 185 everyday dresses, 72 nightgowns, 53 girl's shirts, 14 boy's shirts, 52 sheets, 16 pillow slips, 28 table napkins, 71 aprons, 12 mattress covers, 72 towels, etc. The girls patch, mend and make all the girls' clothes, make all the linen for the staff and all departments throughout the school such as doctor's towels, dishtowels, etc. They have made surplices and chapel collars for the choir. Formerly the girls knitted the boy's socks; now they re-boost them, but they confine their knitting to fancier articles, such as scarves, tams, sweaters. The girls are taught to embroider and to crochet.\nSTATEMENT\n\nMay 7, 1934.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nIn connection with St. George's School,\n\nLytton, B.C.\n\nTERMS\n\nManual Training Grant\n\nfor April $50.00 $50.00\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n|      | St. George's School | $10.00 |\n|      | To Grant on Salary of Manual Training Instructor | $50.00 |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nAgent\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6466, file 888-11, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOffice of the Lytton Indian Agency,\n\nMay 15th, 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers No. SS.T.,\n\namounting to $50.00 in favour\n\nof St. George's School,\n\nfor manual training instructor's grant.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental\n\nLetter No. dated\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101 AS/MD\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\n**Voucher No. 190**\n\nTo...St. George's School,\n\nLytton, B.C.\n\n| DATE       | SERVICE                                      | AMOUNT |\n|------------|----------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 1934       | St. George's School                          | $50.00 |\n| June 9     | To Grant for Manual Training Instructor for May, | $50.00 |\n\n---\n\n**Vote:** 176\n\n**School Number:** 888\n\n**Allot.:** 516\n\n**R.

I find that the prices submitted to me by the Principal on the list of material required were taken from an old catalogue, therefore the amount I asked for in the first place is seventy six dollars and twenty five cents ($76.25) less than the amount required.\n\nThis I regret very much and would ask the Department to kindly grant this further amount of seventy six dollars and twenty five cents ($76.25), so that I can complete the purchase of these supplies.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nA.

In this connection it is noted that it will require a further sum of $76.25, in excess of the amount authorized by official letter of July 3rd, last, in supplying these materials.\n\nThe Department will approve of an expenditure which must not exceed $300.00 in the purchase of the material and other supplies required. Purchase should be made from a firm on the approved list. You should obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost. These, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. The expenditure will be provided from B.C.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nI have been thinking over and have planned in my mind, with the cooperation of the Department, the building of a Log House such as we undertook to model in the Manual Training Shop last Spring and a picture of which you saw during my visit to the Dept. last May.\n\nIn connection with this, a number of our boy graduates have expressed the desire to return to the School for this training, and personally, I feel that it should be given them if at all possible.\n\nThis would necessitate, perhaps, an expenditure of $500 or $600, and also if the boys occupied space in the dormitory and received meals from the School, say, per capita earnings for this excess number.\n\nI am anxious to try this project out, not only from the point of view of training for the boys and a model house for their homes on the reserves, but I also hope, when such building is finished, to house in it a teacher with two girls who would carry on general housekeeping, together with cottage handicrafts, which latter are now being taught in the School and which were very successfully exhibited at the Arts and Handicrafts Exhibition last Spring and also at the Canada Pacific this Autumn, and which handicrafts are very much in demand, especially our wool work. I foresee a nice revenue for girl graduates in their homes through this source of occupation.\n\nI hope to begin this project, perhaps in the last week of this month, but not later than December 1st, because, before the frosts set in, I will be obliged to lay my foundations.\nNovember 8, 1938.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nMay I ask your co-operation, and perhaps any suggestions that you can make might be incorporated.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nP.S. May I call your attention to the fact that we have not yet had an answer to our letter dated October 5th regarding pupils for whom we asked permission to give special training?\nOttawa, November 15, 1938.\n\nDear Mr. Lett:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 8th instant, in which you discuss the desirability of proceeding with the construction of a log house at the St. George's Residential School.\n\nI am personally very much interested in this proposal, and I consider your suggestion - that a couple of senior girls be placed in a house such as this, with a teacher in charge - particularly commendable. I am not at all sure, however, that we can seriously entertain the suggestion that pupils formerly enrolled at your school should be permitted to return to take up special vocational training. There are, as you know, a large number of districts in the province of British Columbia in which no educational facilities whatever have been provided by the Department. Just so long as such conditions exist anywhere in the Dominion, it is exceedingly difficult to justify expenditures on what one might term post graduate work. There is a possibility, of course, that night classes might be organized on an inexpensive basis for a number of grown-up boys and girls who live in comparatively close proximity to your school.\n\nI was more than delighted to learn of the success of your handicraft exhibit at the Coast. I agree with you, that revenue can be obtained by girl graduates who are proficient in this work. A number of our Eastern Schools are experimenting with hand loom weaving, and I am sending forward a catalogue published by the Guild of All Arts, Scarborough, Ontario. Girls can operate these looms after a -\n\nReverend A. R. Lett,\nPrincipal,\nSt. George's Residential School,\nLyttton, B. C.\n\nEncl.\nafter a few hours' instruction, and there seems to be a very wide-spread demand for the hand woven products. Your course of study will, no doubt, be determined largely by the needs of the district in which your Indians reside.\n\nShould you require an advance cheque to enable you to proceed with the construction of the house, you might, at your convenience, send forward a request for the amount you may require.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

It is my purpose to make two large looms and perhaps the same number of small looms in the shop; and in connection with this, I have been in touch with a woman who is head of the Cottage Crafts in the Woman's Institute and she is extremely interested in our work here. This woman has promised to come to us on February 1st to spend a month instructing our girls and interested members of the Staff in weaving, wool rug making etc. I have in mind distinctly the use of Indian design of the district to which the School caters in education.

Under these circumstances it is difficult to understand why the account was forwarded to the Agent for transmission to the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. A. R. Lett,\nPrincipal,\nSt. George's Indian Residential School,\nLytton, B.C.\nJanuary 4th, 1938.\n\nMr. A. Strang,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Strang,\n\nIn regard to our Manual Training grant, may I point out that I am today forwarding bills for two months, December and January, but in view of the fact that we did not have a regular manual training instructor during the month of November, the Dept. may not wish to honour the December bill.\n\nWe have a man on our Staff who is able to carry on certain instruction in Manual training, and whilst the shop did not have a regular man, it was not in reality idle. However, in view of the fact that we did not have a regular man, the Department may see fit to cancel one of these enclosed bills. The School, of course, can accept both bills as regular assistance to the Manual Training shop.\n\nI trust you will find this satisfactory.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEnclosure\n\nPrincipal.\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nIn reply to your letter of 24th inst., for your information I am enclosing copy of a letter forwarded to the Indian Agent and which I trust will explain the situation regarding the Manual Training Instructor.\n\nSince a copy of this letter was not forwarded with Mr. Strang's recommendation, and again, since the Department has heretofore accepted the agent's recommendation for the payment of this grant, it would seem that the agent accepted my vouchers as justifiable and in order.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Strang, together with Commissioner McKay visited the School in the early part of this month and found the Manual Training Instructor busy with a class of boys.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nEnclosure/copy letter.\nMarch 19\n\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch.

Hoey\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nWe are forwarding to Miss Moody, who is in charge of the Handicrafts Department, one (1) rug each of tapestry, hooking, and weaving, and with them one (1) Cowichan sweater. I understood, from Dr. Moore when he visited the school a few days ago, that Miss Moody was turning quite a lot of this work over in your handicrafts department and while my main object is to let the Department see what the school is doing, it would be nice if Miss Moody could sell these things for us. The prices with designs are marked on the tickets.\n\nMy sewing matron was very loathe to forwarding the grey and black hooked mat as during our local exhibitions it has become dirtied, but I have persuaded her to send it forward to you and ask Miss Moody to have cleaned at your dry-cleaners. We shall be glad to take care of any expense incurred as there is no dry-cleaning place here to which we can send it. The sweater, hooked mat and woven mat are all products from the wool of our own sheep.\n\nI trust this will give you some idea of what we are trying to do in handicrafts training.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nAL:WM\nOttawa, October 25, 1939.\n\nDear Mr. Lett:\n\nOn my return to Ottawa, Mr. Hoey transferred to me your letter of October 4 regarding the rugs and sweater. I think the rugs are very attractive, and am interested in knowing whether the small rug which is done in various colors has been made with vegetable-dyed yarn. The colors are lovely. I am having the black and grey hooked mat cleaned, and plan to send them to an exhibit of handicraft which is being put on by the Canadian Handicraft Guild in Montreal in November. We will send them as part of a display but will also quote the prices in the hope that they may find purchasers. It is rather difficult to sell individual articles as most of our sales are on a wholesale basis, but I feel sure that we will be able to sell at least one or two of the rugs and possibly the sweater, but I will write you further in this connection.\n\nWith best wishes, I am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nHandicraft Section.\n\nReverend A.

Hoey\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI thought you might be interested in receiving the enclosed write-up which appeared in one of local daily newspapers.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nAL:WM\nEncl:\nOttawa, December 28, 1939.\n\nDear Mr. Lett:\n\nPlease accept my sincere thanks for your letter of the 18th instant and for the newspaper clipping attached thereto. I was indeed very much interested in the establishment of a Model Cottage at your school. It is my earnest hope that the cottage will prove of real practical value to the senior girls in attendance at your institution.\n\nIt has occurred to me that if you have an additional newspaper clipping of this cottage you might send it on to the Principal of the Mohawk Institute, Brantford, Ontario. It is my hope that we may be able to establish a cottage similar to this at the Mohawk Institute in the immediate future.\n\nMay I embrace this opportunity to wish you, the members of your staff and the pupils a very happy and successful New Year.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend A. R. Lett,\nPrincipal,\nSt. George's Residential School,\nLyttton, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nThe question of the issue of wool spinners to girl graduates of St. George's Indian Residential School, Lytton, has been brought up with this office by the Reverend Principal through the office of the Indian Agent.\n\nThe spinners cost $5.00 apiece complete, $3.50 of which is paid to the Singer Sewing Machine Company for treadles of old machines. These treadles are fitted up with spinners made in the Manual Training Division of the school and are ideal for spinning wool for rugs, sweaters and other articles.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Strang has recommended that spinners be issued to the undermentioned graduates of the school:\n\nMargaret Sam, Lytton Band,\nEileen Tom, \" \"\nMamie Lewis, Boston Bar Band.\n\nThe Agent's recommendation is endorsed, and if the Department approves, the amount involved, i.e. $15.00, should be paid to St. George's School.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 3, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo with reference to the issue of wool spinners to girl graduates of the St. George's Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Department considers it advisable to issue these spinners to those who can use them but I do not see why we should be requested to pay $5.00 for them. We are prepared to pay the amount of $3.50 each which is the sum paid to the Singer Sewing Machine Company for treadles. A voucher for the treadles should be submitted for payment from the B.C. Special appropriation.\n\nIt is noted that the Indian Agent recommends that three of these spinners be issued at the present time and you may instruct him to issue the voucher in favour of the St. George's Residential School for $10.50. The receipted account from the Singer Sewing Machine Company should be attached to the voucher.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hosey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nONE of the most practical and \"understanding\" courses of training designed to meet the needs of Indian children when they return to their homes on the reserves is being put into effect in St. George's Indian Residential School at Lytton, British Columbia.\n\nAs a result of such training the Indians will be learning among other things, how comfortable and attractive houses may be built at small cost from materials to be found on, or near, every reserve. And the girls will be learning to use their fingers while they learn to make artistic curtains, towels, rugs, bedspreads and other articles suitable for commercial purposes.\n\nThe log cabin-building pictured on this page is an attractive four-room and bath structure, was built with a view to serving as a model for work. This cabin, built by two pupils and six \"old boys\" under the direction of an experienced carpenter, is to be used as a centre for training in home economics and handicrafts. The young pupils will be able to visualize the results of their efforts in a living room.\n\nBy Edna Kells\n\nFreight on lumber, shingles and plaster.\n\nWhile under construction, the building was visited by the centre of interest for all the pupils, and many a boy on the sidelines absorbed the practical knowledge of building which threw a new and interesting light on his future, so well described in his manual training classes.\n\nAs the children\u2014-as they watched the cabin walls go up log by log, they saw a vision of the day when they might build for their own, under improved living conditions on the reserve. And the turned to their weaving and stitching with their domestic duties with new zeal.\n\nIn the cabins they will learn to keep house on a family, rather than an institutional basis. They will see the curtains, the weaves hanging on \"home\" windows, their rugs laid on \"home\" floors. Ex-\n\nTending this idea further, Mr. Lett contemplates bringing an Indian mother and her baby to cabin in order to give the girls a course in child care.\n\nTHE HANDICRAFT training the girls receive, will serve a double purpose. They will not only be able to make rugs, blankets, towels and other articles for home use, stout Cowichan sweaters for their families, but they will literally at their finger tips, the means of developing a profitable business enterprise whereby in which the art of their own people will be prominently featured.\n\nAncient geometrical symbolic designs are being adapted to modern uses as can be seen on the rugs displayed in the picture. The Thompson Indians, artistic and in earlier days created many designs which they used to decorate their dwellings and clothing. Among the Thompson Indians, these designs appear especially frequently in their basketry. But it has been demonstrated at the school that these designs can be easily adapted to weaving, tapestry, knitting, and embroidery.\n\nMr. Lett is getting together as much of the old designs as he possibly can. In this case he has been able to get photographs of some of the designs which are present in themselves, very old design writing. These he hopes to incorporate in the designs of wood handicraft.\n\nThe girls are expected, displaying their skill in making rugs, a craft which lends itself wonderfully to Indian decoration. It is anticipated that great progress will be made in combining design in order to reproduce scenes of beauty and nature, such as a cloud effect in the border with an eagle in the clouds, symbolizing the spirit of mind.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6466, file 838-11, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nPractical Courses for B.C. Indian Children\n\nBy Edna Kells\n\nONE of the most practical and \"understanding\" courses of training designed to meet the needs of Indian children when they return from their homes on the reserves, is being put into effect in St. George's Indian Residential School at Lytton, British Columbia.\n\nAs a result of this training, the Indian boys are learning among other things, how comfortable and attractive their log cabin built at small cost from material they have found on or near every reserve. And the girls are learning to use their fingers while they learn to make artistic clothes, towels, rugs, bedspreads for home equipment and for commercial purposes.\n\nThe log cabin, which is pictured on this page, an attractive living room and bath structure, was built with the help of the pupils who did the work. This cabin, built by two pupils and six \"old boys\" under the direction of an experienced carpenter, is to be used as a centre for training the pupils in the art of handicraft. Thus the young pupils will be able to visualize the results of their efforts in a practical rather than an institutional setting.\n\nBack of all this lies a story. The Rev. Mr. Lett, principal of the school, is blessed with vision and an understanding of the executive abilities.\n\nWell, we can understand the reluctance of many of the older girl students to return to their homes on the reserves at the end of their ten year training in the spacious, well-developed school. There they would have to combat the old and manner of living not far removed from the primitive. There was little hope of raising the standard of living, the idea so carefully awakened in them, yet doubt, if not actually killed, in the struggle.\n\nFor the more intelligent pupils, the happiness of the latter years of their school life was overshadowed by dread of what was to come after.\n\nThis dread is being dispelled by Mr. Lett who, through his carefully thought out plan is giving the pupils training which will be of practical assistance to them in solving their home problems, as well as appealing to their imagination and developing their creative ability.\n\nManual training and handicraft have long been an important part of the curriculum of Canada's Indian residential schools. But Mr. Lett has not been content with the routine training. It is not enough, he says, that the pupils should be taught to do this and that; the girls taught to do housework, to sew, to weave and knit. They must also be taught how to actually live and how to make good use of the knowledge they acquire, to their benefit on the reserves, and through this to improve the lives of their own people who have had fewer advantages, as well as enjoy better living conditions and a fuller life all around.\n\nBoys Build Cabin\n\nWith this in view the cabin, which is 30 by 32 feet, was built under the direction of a competent carpenter, Philip McLean. As the young builders worked, they acquired a practical knowledge of woodwork as well as in the work of their hands. As much of the material as possible was collected from the surrounding country, so they also learned how to find and make use of that which lay at hand instead of merely dreaming of homes which they could not afford to build, or making shift for themselves when they might have good homes.\n\nThe substantial cement foundation was laid by the pupils with much of the old design work as possible. In some cases he has even been able to get reproductions of rock paintings and carvings which are used as designs for rug design writing. These he hopes to reproduce in the development of tool handling.\n\nThe girls are depicted, displaying their skill in rug craft which lends itself wonderfully to Indian design. In rug work an effort is made among the pupils to reproduce some of the more beautiful ideas, such as a bird, a fish, a bear, a wolf, with an eagle in the centre. This in reality is a form of art, the best symbolizing the development of mind as well as body.\n\nHere the object is two-fold\u2014to utilize the imagination in the child, to demand a product which will create a liking for the finer things.\n\nIndians are primarily great naturalists and if this appreciation of the natural world is to be developed, it will be a valuable addition to their handicraft skills.\n\nCowicheen sweaters which the girls are taught to knit, are very popular. The oil remaining in the wool will shed rain and snow. Mr. Lett has also introduced to the pupils, such as the training of a Witch (Turn to Page 30).

I understand that most of these have now been sold, but that a tapestry rug is still on hand, and I have been wondering whether you would accept this rug as a souvenir of the work being done in St. George's School by the Handicraft class. It will give our pupils much pleasure to know that this rug has been accepted by you, and they will be encouraged by your interest.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, February 8, 1941.\n\nDear Mr. Lett:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 23th ultimo, in which you intimate that the pupils of your school are anxious to present me with the Tapestry Rug sent forward a few months ago with a number of other handicraft products to the Welfare Section of this Branch.\n\nI must express regret that we have been unable, so far, to secure a market for this particular rug. In view of this fact, I shall be glad to adopt the suggestion contained in your communication. Please accept and convey to the pupils my most sincere thanks for their generosity.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend A. R.

On reviewing invoice No. 83745 attached to the voucher it was found that McLennan, McFeely & Prior requested a total payment of $36.59. Included in this amount was an item of $1.10 for freight and when the invoice reached here, attached to Mr. Strang's voucher, the item of $1.10 had been struck out and the total of the account shown as $35.49. The account carried a notation that there was a 2\u00bd discount on $35.10. Deducting 66\u00a2 from the account left a balance of $34.83. Cheque 65555 for this amount was issued and sent to the company on December 28. Today I am in receipt of a letter from them requesting information that will permit them to adjust their books. It would be appreciated if you would interview the company and explain to them the manner in which the Department arrived at the amount of $34.83.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D.M.

Canada has, from its very beginning, been conscious of its responsibility for the Indian race and the past of its history has numerous examples of well meant attempts to discharge this obligation. However, except in a few instances, the best effort and good will expended on the schools for Indian girls and boys might better have been poured down the drain. Some of these persons unavoidable came to the meeting of one type of civilization with another. Some of it is due to the singular inability of the Indians by their directors in this education, then blindness to the conditions of life which would surround their graduates.\n\nIt is from the beautiful valleys of the Fraser and the Thompsons that the children come to this Lytton school where Rev. A. R. Lett is principal. There are acres of land, most of which, by the way, must be irrigated. This point had been overlooked in 1901 when the school was instituted, it being then the idea that the graduates would settle near it. However, 160 acres are now cultivated and the writer, Mr. Stewart, has told me that of the crops of alfalfa, oats and vegetables, some of them harvested three times a year. There are orchards also.\n\nHe has to recount much also of the cattle herd and the sheep flock, of the pigs and the hens, and the market garden has not yet sold off the place of the products of these products. He also has to tell of the providing of the school with gallons of fresh milk and with every variety of the food grown there.\n\nSome of this sort of thing has been done at other Indian schools, but unless the children get this growing \"virus\" into their own veins and do not go through the same experiments which they don't get them anywhere. Principal Lett is evidently aware of this and is attempting to meet it.\n\nThe boys of the school, for instance, have built a log cabin and the girls have helped to furnish it. Various buildings are being carried out there under conditions which could, within possibility, obtain in homes which the graduates could and may set up. Just how much of this hard work preserves the Indians' own fine traditions in this field we do not know, nor do we know in the preserving of fruits and vegetables how much cognizance is taken of the conditions under which these projects must be carried out in the Indian home\u2014where there isn't apt to be electricity, and whether any effort is made to teach the Indians our way of preserving these things by the drying method.\n\nThere is another point also where the writer has not been explicit. He tells of the academic study and the physical training, including dancing. However fine the traditions of England may be, there need not be anything but a mild feeling of mildness settling upon us when a group has obliged with a morris dance. The Indians have dances of their own which certainly do not lack in life and mettle. How about some of these in the physical training? They are the Indians' own assets.\n\nPrincipal Lett does have thought all of these things. The article in question leaves one with definite hopes that he has.\n\nThere is another hope on the horizon today in Indian education. It is the fact that Mr. R. A. Hoey, to whom this Province is indebted for his work here as Inspector of Schools, is now Superintendent of Welfare and Training, Indian Affairs branch, Ottawa.\n**STATEMENT**\n\nApril 1st /9 1941\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIn a/c With St. George's Indian Residential School,\nLytton, B.

Charlton, in his special audit report on the St. George's Indian Residential School, Lytton, B.C., dated October 9, 1941, submits for departmental consideration a number of recommendations, the adoption of which would in his judgment contribute substantially to the efficient management and operation of the school.\n\nThese recommendations will be sent forward to you in due course, but at the moment I am particularly interested in Recommendation 17, which reads as follows:\n\n\"The Manual Training section should list the current stock of saleable articles\u2014priced as agreed upon. A list of additions to stock should be furnished monthly. All sales, whether for cash or on consignment, should be recorded by the counter sales book. These should be in triplicate\u2014one with the goods, one with the office, and one with Mr. McLean. Returns to stock should be recorded in the same manner and plainly marked 'RETURNS'. All transactions should go through the school books and there should be no separate ventures with separate bank accounts.\"\n\nThis is the first intimation the Department has had that handicraft or manual training products produced at our schools were offered for sale through the ordinary commercial channels, and I find the news somewhat disturbing. In the province of Manitoba\u2014and I feel this is also true of the other provinces\u2014the products made at technical schools are not offered for sale. A few years ago the Labour representatives on the Winnipeg School Board and in the Manitoba Legislature took a strong stand on this question, and it was agreed then that no products made in a school established for educational purposes and maintained by public funds should be disposed of through the ordinary channels of trade, in competition with the regular supplies produced by factories. It is now customary, I understand, to have the pupils to a very large extent decide on their own projects. When a pupil decides to build a table or a chair, the material necessary is purchased by the school and the task is undertaken by the pupil under the direction of an instructor. When the article is completed it becomes the property of the boy who has made it; after he returns to the school the actual cost of the material. Public exhibitions at a great many of these schools are held annually, but no goods are offered for sale. On the other hand, at a number of subnormal institutions throughout the\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.C.\nDominion, where vocational therapy is encouraged, annual exhibitions or bazaars are held. Inasmuch as the pupils at such institutions have been committed for long periods, the articles produced are usually sold to visitors and the proceeds become part of the regular school funds.\n\nI am anxious that you with your officials should work out a uniform policy that will meet conditions in B.C. I am anxious that nothing should be done to discourage in any way or in any sense vocational instruction or manual arts at our residential schools, and I am also anxious that these goods should not, except in very exceptional cases, be offered for sale. I am afraid that if such goods are offered for sale a number of our residential school principals will find it difficult to resist the temptation to produce for profit and thus the pedagogical features of manual training would be overlooked or relegated to a subordinate position. Where a boat, or boats, have been built at a school, I do not suppose there would be any serious objection to the disposal of a boat to a group of pupils, who might use it for fishing after their graduation. Mr. Doucet, with whom I have discussed this matter very fully, is of the opinion that the repair of school buildings, the production of furniture necessary at the school, windows, frames, tables, etc., should occupy a great deal of their time. He is also of the opinion that the construction of model Indian homes, where a residential school is close to a reserve, might be encouraged, or the construction of fabricated homes where a school is not near a reserve.\n\nThere is no particular urgency about this matter, but it is one that should be reviewed and a definite policy worked out, when you and your officials have the time necessary to undertake such a task.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.A.

In talking this over with Dr. Ellis he preferred they be toxoided against Diphtheria, and stated that he wanted extra pay for this work. Dr. Ellis states he should be paid extra for vaccinations as well. It is pointed out that preventative medicine is a big part of practice now and this type of work should be done by the part-time Medical Officer, under the salary arrangement.\n\nThe school here is stressing manual training and have a well equipped work room and are showing some excellent work done by the children.\n\nW.

F. Hives, Principal of St. George's Indian Residential School that he be allowed to continue the use of the services of the Manual Training Instructor during the months of July and August in order that he may make necessary repairs to the institution during that period. He has also requested that he be authorized to expend $70.00 for the purchase of the paint.\n\nA similar request made last year was approved by the Department and funds to pay the Manual Training Instructor and purchase the paint were provided from the New England Company's Grant. This would appear to be a desirable arrangement to continue, and the request is recommended for your approval.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa,\nJune 13, 1944.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O.\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 7th instant it has been decided to forward Mr. Hives a cheque for $250 from New England Company funds. This will permit him to pay the manual training instructor for the months of July and August and also purchase paint and other materials to make minor repairs. As stated to you last year, we feel that this is a better way to handle the request than to continue the salary of the manual training instructor from the B.C. Special Appropriation.\n\nWe are following the same procedure as last year with regard to the cheque; namely, we are sending this direct to Mr. Hives, but we are not writing to him as I thought it likely that you would be purchasing the paint and materials in Vancouver.\n\nR.A.

I assure you that they would be of great value in training the boys. They would be a great attraction to the boys. And they would be a great asset in the matter of making useful articles and doing work in connection with our school.\n\nThe Kamloops school has much more in their workshop than I have asked for. I am informed that they are a great success in helping toward training the boys. The tools would be used only under the control and supervision of the Manual Instructor. The boys are never allowed in the shop excepting under supervision.\n\nAll technical schools have power tools. I don't see why we should always be behind white schools in the matter of equipment etc. Almost any modern Manual Instructor looks upon the power tools as standard equipment.\n\nI would be very much obliged if you would please present the request again to the Department.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMr A.

You were asking if I had yet been able to buy a car. I have not, but the money is safe, for I have put it in a Special account, making note of it in my Monthly Financial Statement.\n\nThis week, I am hoping to make a trip to Chilliwack to interview the Public School Inspector, in order to find out what facilities exist in that district in the matter of vocation schools; and if the cream of our schools could be allowed to attend them. I am convinced that something of that nature has to be done for our graduate pupils. At the present time the education we give them does not get them anywhere. In fact, I think sometimes, that it is almost more of a menace to their progress; for we take them so far, and tell them all kinds of glowing accounts of the wonderful world that is awaiting them; but when they leave us to go to the \"wonderful\" world, they are absolutely lost. They know not the eyes of the people outside our care and influence. I am convinced, in my own mind, that our advanced pupils should mingle in the classrooms and vocational shops with other children of the country. I have seen this method working with great success time and time again when I was at Shingwauk. And I am sure you will find that ninety per cent of those pupils who attended Technical High School, during the twelve years I was at Sault Ste. Marie, are living honorable and useful lives, since they have gone out into the world. I found always that our pupils were most popular amongst the pupils of the school. Young people are not so choosy in the matter of race, color or creed as older people.\n\nI will write you again after my trip to Chilliwack, and, if possible, put forth another\nof my wild, and perhaps daring recommendations.\n\nWe had a very delightful visit from Mr. Tom Reid, M.P. Before he left, he very graciously told me that I now have a \"friend in court.\" He seemed to be quite thrilled with what he saw here. So perhaps his visit will bear fruit in due season.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nColonel Bernard N. Neary,\nCust. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nExtract from letter from Bob Davey, 136 Government St., Victoria, B.C., dated 30 September, 1946, (addressed to Col. Neary).\n\nI went down and saw Mr. Jones, the Director of Technical Education, this morning and received the information you requested. He says that they have less trouble with accidents with band saws than with circular saws and that it is even less likely that an accident should occur with a planer and jointer. With a jointer the most serious thing that is likely to happen is that 1/8 of an inch of the finger might be taken off which would, of course, only involve the fleshy part. However, this would only happen in the case of gross carelessness. Incidentally you had \"jointer\" in your letter but this was an error in the typing I believe. Regarding the safety precautions, Mr. Jones said that he tried to insist that pupils used power operated machinery only when in view of the instructor. In addition he said that they secured a considerable amount of information from the Department of Labour (Provincial) which publishes a number of pamphlets on the use of equipment such as is used in the schools. I may say that I also phoned my brother Jack who is a shops Foreman at the Vancouver Island Coach Lines where they have and use considerably a band saw in their body repair work. He said that the band saw is far more generally useful than a circular saw and is probably less dangerous. In addition it is coming into much more general use now, particularly since the war. He also thought that the band saw was less dangerous than the circular saw. The wheels over which the saw runs should be guarded as should the run where the teeth are going up leaving only the opening where the sawing actually takes place exposed.\n\nI secured from Mr. Jones sheets of the equipment required for different types of technical work, woodwork, metalwork, and electricity, for Junior and Senior High School. He said that the lists were not complete in that the Senior High woodwork was missing. However I notice that there is a list clipped to the end of the Junior High sheets which seems to cover the Senior High so I think that everything is there. He promised to send me down a copy when he got one so unless there is no difference I shall send it along when I get it.\nOttawa, October 30, 1946.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nProvision of power tools for the Schools of British Columbia\n\nYou have recently requested that we clarify the whole situation insofar as the provision of power tools to Residential Schools of British Columbia is concerned. Therefore, in answer, we would like to point out the following general policy which will be followed by the Department in this regard:\n\n1. MANUAL TRAINING TEACHERS\n\nThe Department will provide power tools for manual training shops where the teacher is fully qualified and holds the proper teaching certificates granted by the Department of Education of the Province of British Columbia. In all other cases, each individual instructor's qualifications will be carefully considered before approving expenditures for power equipment.\n\nThe grants to be made by the Department for the purchase of power tools will be based upon the attendance at the residential school concerned.\n\n2. USE OF POWER TOOLS BY STUDENTS\n\nIt is understood that in the manual training shops of the junior and senior high schools of the Province of British Columbia, pupils use power operated machinery\n\n....... only when in\nonly when in view of the instructor. It is most essential that a similar precaution be employed in our schools, especially in view of the fact that our manual training begins often at an earlier age for Indian boys than for boys in the provincial schools.\n\n3. **INSPECTION OF SAFETY DEVICES**\n\nIt is understood that the Workmen's Compensation Board of the Province of British Columbia will send one of their Inspectors to check the installation of these power tools and will be glad to give whatever advice is required in their operation. In all instances where residential schools have such equipment or are installing such equipment, this service of the Workmen's Compensation Board should be used.\n\n4. **SAFETY LITERATURE FROM THE WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION BOARD**\n\nIt is most essential that all such literature receives the fullest distribution throughout the manual training shops of our schools using power tools. These posters must be displayed in our manual training shops and the Inspector of Schools will ensure that this is done. Indian agents should also check on this practice in their visits to our schools.\n\n5. **SAFETY PRECAUTIONS REGARDING THE USE OF POWER TOOLS.**\n\n(a) **Saws:** It is now generally agreed by the various Directors of Technical Education for the Provincial Departments of Education that there are fewer accidents when power saws are used than with circular saws. In industry the band saw is more generally useful than a circular saw and is also less dangerous.\n\nThe band saw should at all times have a guard over it, leaving only the opening exposed where the actual sawing takes place. Boys should not stand at the side of a band saw.\n5. (b) Planers: It is unlikely that an accident should occur when pupils are using this tool. However, care should be taken that the feed is not too heavy and that no one stands in front of the plane.\n\n(c) Jointers: The most serious thing that is likely to happen in an accident using this tool is that 1/8\" of the finger might be taken off, which would of course involve only the fleshy part. However, this would only happen in the case of gross carelessness.\n\nThe jointer should have a telescopic rear-guard as well as a standard swing-guard in the front so that at no time any portion of the knife is open other than that over which work is passing. When using short material, pupils should always use a push stick.\n\n6. CONCLUSION\n\nIt is felt that if the Principals of Residential Schools and Indian Agents are all made aware of the above precautions, very few accidents should occur in our manual training shops. It is realized that this training in operating such machinery will be most valuable to our Indian students and will enable them to obtain better positions in the mills and factories of your province.\n\nDirector.\nAIRMAIL\n\nOttawa, November 4, 1946.\n\nMajor D.

Original on file # 165-0-6.\n\nThe work in this Department was rather disappointing. The Instructor is a good craftsman and had had experience in instructing in the army; but most of the work of the pupils appears to have been along the lines of work with power tools or in doing maintenance work about the school. Some of this has a very definite educational value, but should not exclude instruction which aims at teaching certain fundamental operations and the care and use of basic tools. To ensure that these have not been omitted the Instructor should follow a well defined programme. The writer has tried to be of assistance in this respect by requesting the instructor to requisition for the Manual First Year Woodwork, which has been prepared by the Training Branch, and by giving him a list of reference books and manuals which he is to requisition. The Principal will see that the course is followed.\n| DATE       | SERVICE                                      | AMOUNT |\n|------------|----------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 1948       | Lytton Agency                                |        |\n| March 31   | To: Manual training grant for the month of   |        |\n|            | March                                       | 50.00  |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

It would seem that the Reverend Principal intended to use some of this for maintenance or new construction.\n\nI have placed a red cross against those items which I think should be deleted and have shown the quantities I think should be supplied where the order appears to be excessive.\n\nR.F. Davey,\nDist. School Inspector.\nApril 9, 1948.\n\nAir Mail\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a requisition in quadruplicate covering the supply of manual training tools and materials for the St. George's Indian Residential School, together with a memorandum dated April 2nd from District School Inspector Davey in this connection.\n\nThe estimated cost of the tools, nails, screws etc. recommended by Mr. Davey is approximately $250.00 and the cost of the lumber, the supply of which he recommends, is approximately $300.00. I would recommend that the Department authorize the purchase of tools and materials to these amounts.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nApril 20, 1948.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 9th instant, file 7-11-6 (165), the Department approves the purchase of tools, nails, screws, at a cost of approximately $250.00 and also the purchase of lumber at a cost of approximately $300.00 for the manual training class at the St. George's Indian Residential School.\n\nWhen forwarding accounts you should mark on them \"Pay from B.C. Special\".\n\nThe above authority is given on the understanding that any items which Inspector Davey considers are not required should be deleted and where the order appears to be excessive, the quantities requested should be reduced.\n\nBernard F.

F. Mackenzie,\nSecretary, Dept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Mackenzie:\n\nIn connection with the troubles we have been having with our dairy herd, I might say that I have been in touch with Mr. F. Moore, Superintendent of the Provincial Farm at Essendale, with a view of trying to overcome the situation existing in the herd through Abortion, and I would ask to be allowed to have Dr. Jagger take another blood test at his next visit during this month so that we could, in co-operation with Mr. Moore, who has kindly offered to take our Positives, using them for beef in the Institution, and for them give us some of his young stock, which this Autumn he is obliged to dispose of. Personally, I think this is a very, very good offer, and the school should not hesitate to avail themselves of this opportunity.\n\nIt is true, we shall not be able to do away entirely with at least two of our high productive cows, one of whom is now giving 86 lbs. milk per diem, on three times a day milking. We can, however, provide isolation for two or three of these cows, and in that way, keep them for the purpose, perhaps, of getting a few heifer calves as well as to keep up our milk supply.\n\nI have written Dr. Jagger to be prepared to make a blood test, as I have no hesitancy in feeling that you will agree with this proposition, as it will not cost the Department anything over the blood test, which is 25\u00a2 per cow tested, and it will put us in a position wherein we shall not need the services of Dr. Jagger, I hope, more than once a quarter, excepting in extreme cases.\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nA. R. Lett.\nPrincipal.\n\nARL/CW\nOttawa, October 10, 1933.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the third instant, with further reference to the trouble you are having with the dairy herd at the St. George's Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that you may make arrangements to have Dr. Jagger take another blood test when he next visits the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Lett,\nPrincipal,\nSt. George's Residential School,\nLyttton, B.C.\nOffice of the Lytton Indian Agency,\n\nOctober 5th, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 4778, amounting to $102.60 in favour of T.

McKenzie,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nJust a report on the recent blood test taken to determine the percentage of cases affected with the Bacillis Abortus. I make the following statement.\n\nOut of thirty one tested there are two positives, three suspicious, these, together with five positives not tested, make a total of seven positives and three suspicious in the barn. I have had a long conversation with Dr. Jagger on the condition of the barn at present, and it is his opinion that we ought not to bring in any more cattle, but continue with our cleaning up system, for the test shows the disease has not been on the increase, but rather decreasing as the time goes by.\n\nTwice in succession our Senior Sire has been a suspicious character and Dr. Jagger feels that this bull should be immediately taken out and because of this, I have been in touch with Mr. P. Moore of the Colony Farm, who has been, and is now catering to our breeding necessities, and he has offered to let me have a young bull who will follow up our breeding, and for whom he asks a sum of $50.00, also adding that he wishes the bull to be held by the school and Colony Farm as joint ownership so that if necessary the bull will be available for the show ring, as this year, this young individual travelled with his stock to exhibitions in British Columbia. I will be grateful, therefore, if the Department could see fit to make payment for this bull, as this is an unforeseen necessity in connection with the dairy.\nMr. A. F. McKenzie-\n\nWe are at the present time, shipping alfalfa hay to Colony Farm, and could take care of the bull out of the money we shall receive, but in order that we should not be obliged to make this payment, we would appreciate the Department returning the money to us if at all convenient and being available.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\nA. R. Lett.\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, November 1, 1933.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd ultimo, regarding the recent tests carried out to determine the cases affected with Bacillus Abortus among the dairy herd at the St. George's Indian Residential School and requesting that a grant of $50.00 be allowed for the purchase of a bull, to be under the joint ownership of the school and the colony farm.\n\nIn connection with the results of the test, it is noted that there is a total of 7 positives and 3 suspicious. It is considered that every effort should be made to continue with the cleaning up system and that no further cattle should be brought in until this disease has been eradicated.\n\nWith reference to the purchase of a bull, I regret that the Department will have no funds to assist. It is thought that it should be possible for you to arrange for the necessary funds from farm receipts, especially from the sale of alfalfa hay. It is considered that the animals affected should be isolated from the rest of the herd. Careful thought should be given as to whether the milk from these cows is fit to be supplied to the pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. A. R.

We are having trouble with our hogs and have lost a number of youngsters and I had Dr. Jagger examine them on one of his trips up at which time he prescribed some medical aid and also asked me to send a sample from a sick pig to Dr. Bruce, Dominion Pathologist at Saanichon. I did this and received Dr. Bruce's report, diagnosing the trouble as haemorrhagic septicaemia which called for vaccination, hence the bill enclosed which I trust the Department will handle.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nA. R. Lett,\nPrincipal.\nSir:-\n\nI herewith beg to enclose voucher numbered 708 S amounting to $131.70 in favor of T. H.

H. Jagger, V.S., for professional services to the dairy herd at the St. George's Indian Residential School. This account is being paid.\n\nThe Department wishes, however, that you consult the Principal as soon as possible and submit a full report regarding the present condition of the school herd.\n\nI may say that on November 1st, last, the Reverend Principal was written and advised that the Department considered that careful thought should be given as to whether the milk from the cows was fit to be supplied to the pupils. Please advise if this phase of the question has received consideration.\n\nYou should also let me have a full report regarding the hogs at the school.\n\nWill it be necessary to again use Dr. Jagger's services? His services have amounted to a considerable sum during the past year, and, while the Department is anxious that the herd should receive every possible attention, it is hoped that the Principal and yourself will give careful consideration to the necessity of curtailing expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. Strang, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nApril 27th, 1933.\n\nRev. A. R. Lett,\nLytton, B. C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn answer to your request for a report on health conditions in the dairy herd at St. George's School, I would say that Bang's Disease is the only infectious condition you have to contend with at the present time.\n\nIn a number of dairy herds we are handling Bang's Disease by blood tests every ninety days, segregation of the positives in separate pastures and on opposite ends or sides of the dairy barn.\n\nThe heifer calves are kept away from the older animals until they are ready to be placed in the milking herd.\n\nWhile this method of handling is not absolute isolation yet it offers an economical way of handling this disease. True one may have occasional breaks under this system but the blood tests will detect these and it gives you reasonable control instead of working in the dark.\n\nIt also gives you a chance to raise a herd of clean heifers from your heavy producing cows.\n\nIn regard to the milk from the positive cows being dangerous and liable to produce undulant fever in the human, I do not think you need have any worry in that regard.\n\nThe people of the world have been using milk from cows affected with Bang's Disease for ages. The number of known cases are few in comparison with population and not many of these can be traced directly to milk consumption.\n\nUndulant fever is more of an occupational disease, affecting those coming in actual contact with the diseased animals and most of these cases seem to be traceable to infection from hogs or pork. The porcine strain of organism seems to be much more virulent for the human than does the bovine organism.\n\nIn any event the milk can always be made safe by pasteurization.\n\nThe question of sterility in dairy herds is one that gives a great deal of trouble and loss of dairy time.\nSterility was formerly looked upon as a part of Bang's Disease but since we started to use the blood test for Bang's Disease we find that there is just about as much sterility in the negative animals as there is in the positives.\n\nI have been in close touch with the question of sterility for the past fourteen years and find that over ninety percent of the cases are due to various ovarian conditions. These ovarian troubles are a separate condition having nothing to do with Bang's Disease.\n\nIn order to keep a dairy herd in good production it is necessary to have the herd checked up for ovary troubles. This examination gives you the following information.\n\n1st: Each animal is examined for pregnancy seven to eight weeks after breeding. If she is not pregnant it gives information on the condition of the genital organs.\n\n2nd: It reveals the actual conditions of those animals giving trouble as a result of ovarian diseases and about eighty percent of these can be corrected.\n\n3rd: It saves a large loss of dairy time by picking out and treating those cows and heifers that are served and stand for several months without showing signs of estrus although they are not pregnant.\n\nIn other words it is good herd bookkeeping and lets you know what each animal is doing instead of working in the dark.\n\nYou have been very fortunate in not having much udder trouble in your herd.\n\nThe above outline coupled with the recent report on the herd blood test, I believe, completely covers the situation at the present time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.H. Jagger\nbe erected where we could isolate our heifer calves at least until after they had been bred and were due to freshen before bringing them back to the main barn. This of course would involve some expense which the school cannot make and unless the Department is ready to assist in this regard we must continue with the amount of isolation we can readily use and by careful disinfecting control the spread as much as we possibly can.\n\nAs I have stated before our best cows are those affected and we cannot do without the milk supply and as according to medical advice there is no danger, it would not be advisable to do away with at once six of our best cows unless the Department is prepared to replace these with cows with just as great a capacity for milk production and of as good breeding. These animals also would have to be tested before coming on the farm.\n\nI trust this will make the matter clear and I would be glad to do whatever the Department sees fit so long as it does not take away from our milk supply which is so essential to the school.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nA. R. Lett,\nPrincipal.\nINDIAN OFFICE\n\nMr. A. Strang,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Strang:\n\nRegarding the letter of enquiry from the Department through you about the barn situation, I have written to Dr. MacKenzie of the Health of Animals Branch asking him for a copy of the report sent into Ottawa by their Inspector Chester who was sent to look into the situation regarding our hogs. This report has gone into Ottawa and a paragraph from Dr. MacKenzie's letter follows.\n\n\"In reply, I regret to state we have not a copy of this report in this office. The report was on the 16th instant forwarded to Dr. George Hilton, Veterinary Director General at Ottawa, who is the head of this Branch, and I suggest that your department gets in touch with him. I am sure that Dr. Hilton will be pleased to give your Department any information he can respecting the case.\"\n\nIf the Department can get into touch with Dr. Hilton they would be able to clear the situation much better than I could. I have also to state that in connection with the dairy you might find herewith enclosed a report from Dr. Jagger who, as you know has been regularly visiting the herd and who is in a position to speak authoritatively. I would also suggest that the Department get into touch with Dr. E. S. Archibald, Director of Experimental Farms at Ottawa in regard to the situation among dairy herds due to the Bang Organism. As Dr. Archibald is directly and always in touch with this phase of the dairy situation he will also be able to explain matters to the Department by personal interview. I have notified Dr. Archibald to expect to hear from the Department.\n\nRegarding the school barn situation I might say that we have had three reactors but with the last test we have had two more new cases. As we have no great facilities for isolation it is hard to properly take care of the spread of this disease. Dr. Jagger has many times suggested that a barn or house should\nSir:\n\nI herewith beg to acknowledge receipt of departmental letter dated January 15th, in regard to the voucher I forwarded to you amounting to $131.70 in favor of T.H.

Lytton B.C.\n\nNature of disease Dietary ailment\n\nAction taken On arrived at farm, superintendent, the Rev. Mr. Lett, informed me that the hogs took sick about Nov. 1st, there being about 70 hogs on the premises at that time. The sickness was confined to the small hogs of about 2 months old. Dr. T.H. Jagger of Vancouver came to the farm on Nov. 18th and up to that time 6 had died, and he suggested lack of sodium content in the food. This was added to the food but the hogs still died. On Nov. 25th internal organs of one dead pig were sent to Dr. Bruce, Pathologist at Seanch. He diagnosed the case as haemorrhagic septicaemia, and in a few days Dr. Jagger came and inoculated the hogs with haemorrhagic septicaemia aggresin.

KENNETH CHESTER Inspector.\n\n(ATTACH COPIES OF ALL ORDERS AND OTHER PAPERS RELATING TO THE CASE)\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6467, file 888-14, part 1)\n8 more had died, and on my visit to the premises there were 5 more sick. The hogs were well bred Berkshires. All the symptoms I could find were stiffness in the legs, and pain if almost any part of the body was touched. There was no patches on the body, no discharge from the eyes, no cough and no diarrhea, in fact the stool was normal, though in one hog I thought there was constipation. They had a normal appetite.\n\nThe hogs were fed on garbage from the institution, mixed with shorts. The garbage was well cooked. The older fat hogs, the boar and sows, which have all been quite well, (except one sow that Mr. Lett said died a month ago, but in a different manner, this one seemed to get gradually got thinner and weaker, he thinks from some obscure cause) have been, and are now fed on garbage alone, without any shorts. There have been no hogs purchased or brought on to the premises for three years. The farm is quite isolated on the Thomson River, 4 miles from Lytton, and no garbage is brought on to the farm. There are 140 Indian children in residence on the premises, with teachers, attendants, etc.\n\nThe hog pen is fairly clean, the pens have concrete floors, with not enough bedding in my opinion. I found no evidence or symptoms of hog cholera, and evidently from the non-success of the agression, the trouble is not hemorrhagic septicaemia, and as the sickness is confined to the small hogs I came to the conclusion that the trouble was of a dietary nature, caused by some irritant in the garbage, but not violent enough to affect the mature hogs. I went to the kitchen of the institution\n\n(Sgd.) KENNETH CHESTER\n\nInspector\nwith Mr. Lett, and interviewed the cooks, but could not find the particular irritant. Finally I suggested that they take 6 of the little pigs that are now well, put them in a pen by themselves and feed them on shorts and skim milk only for a month, and if none of these take sick, I thought it would be a fair inference that the cause of sickness was in the garbage.\n\nAs I was also conducting the annual Accredited herd test of the dairy cattle I had to return to the premises 4 days later, and on that date I was informed that no hogs had died while I had been away, and in fact I thought the sick ones looked better. I also requested that they put more bedding in the pens, and as the weather was very mild for this time of the year, the pens seemed damper than they should be, and the trouble might be caused by that. The mature hogs were still all well.\n\n(Sgd.) KENNETH CHESTER\nInspector\nI am enclosing for your information in regard to this disease a leaflet.\n\nI may say that I am communicating with Dr McKenzie, the officer in charge of the work of this Branch in British Columbia, and am asking him to do anything he can to assist in arriving at a definite diagnosis in case other fatalities occur.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nVeterinary Director General.\n\nencls.\nA F MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st February, file 165-0-14, and I regret to find that a copy of our officer's report concerning an investigation of sickness in hogs on the premises of the St George's Indian Residential School, Lytton, B.C., was not forwarded to you.\n\nI have had a copy made, and enclose it herewith, and in this regard would say that I do not consider the inspector was justified in coming to a conclusion that the diagnosis made by the pathologist of haemorrhagic septicaemia was not correct.\n\nThere is no question that the organism producing that disease was isolated by Dr Bruce, as, otherwise, he would not have come to that conclusion. I may say, however, that it is not unusual to find that organism in the tissues of our domestic animals even though the disease may not be present. This is due to the fact that this particular organism only becomes disease producing under certain definite conditions.\nOttawa, February 27, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nUpon receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, enclosing communication you had received from the Principal of the St. George's Indian Residential School, the Department wrote Dr. George S. Hilton, Veterinary Director General, with reference to the report forwarded to him regarding the sickness among the hogs at the above named institution.\n\nDr. Hilton has written Dr. MacKenzie, the officer in charge of the work of the Health of Animals Branch in British Columbia, and has directed him to do everything possible to assist the Principal in eradicating the disease that has been prevalent among the hogs. It appears that Dr. Bruce, Pathologist at Saanichton, B. C., diagnosed the disease among the hogs as haemorrhagic septicaemia. In this connection I enclose, for the information of the Principal and yourself, a leaflet regarding this disease.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA.

I, however, wish to make this statement that I fully appreciate your difficulty and your lack of desire to do away with your reacting cows, especially if these are amongst your heaviest producers, yet at the same time I fully appreciate your concern regarding the feeding of the milk from infected cows to the children in your school. This latter difficulty however seems to me could be readily overcome by pasteurization, but the future of your herd is going to depend largely on your effectiveness in isolating reactors and maintaining a negative herd as a non-reacting unit.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDirector.\nFebruary 15, 1934.\n\nRev. A.R.Lett,\nPrincipal, St. George's Indian Residential School,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of January 31, together with copy of one from Dr. Jagger, has been referred to us by Dr. Archibald.\n\nIn this connection, I would say that we have had wonderful results in our herds from the application of the blood test for the eradication of contagious abortion. Starting in 1928 we put all of our herds on this test and immediately there were only a few reactors; we disposed of them at once. In three or four years we segregated reacting animals and saved their calves from these to put into the negative herd. We kept this up for three or four years in some cases until the herds were properly built up again but in 1933 we disposed of the last of our reacting animals and now have abortion-free herds on all of our farms.\n\nMuch of the credit for this work must be given to the Health of Animals Branch of the Department of Agriculture with which branch we had the closest cooperation in this work. They have recently issued a publication on abortion in cattle covering this system of eradication of disease and offering a service similar to that which they have given us to the rank and file of breeders in the country, provided they are prepared to carry out certain conditions and regulations. I am asking the Animal Diseases Research Institute, Health of Animals Branch to forward you a copy of this bulletin and I think you will find many of your questions answered therein and I would suggest that you take advantage of their offer and put your herd under their supervision.\n\nAs you will note, the blood samples will be taken by your local practicing veterinarian and in your case they would be forwarded to Dr. Bruce at the Animal Pathological Laboratory, Saanichon, B.C., for examination and report.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDominion Animal Husbandman.\nCentral Experimental Farm,\nOttawa, February 23, 1934\n\nMr. A.

S. Archibald, Director of the Central Experimental Farm, Ottawa. Mr. Archibald has written two letters recently to Rev. Mr. Lett, with reference to the action taken at the Central Experimental Farm in cleaning up the same disease as is now prevalent in the dairy herd at the St. George's School. It is hoped that the advice given by Mr. Archibald will assist Rev. Mr. Lett. The Department would appreciate if you would keep us informed from time to time regarding the condition of the herd.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. Strang, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B. C.\nMr. A. Strang,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B. C.\n\nDear Mr. Strang:\n\nRegarding the sickness among the hogs, I was able, through an article in a farm paper to place this evident disease as a shortage of mineral content in the feed. I have, therefore, procured a few hundred pounds of ground limestone which is being fed, and has completely changed our situation in regard to the hog pen. I have reported this change to the Health of Animals Branch and I feel this disease has now been eliminated.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nA. R. Lett,\nPrincipal.\nSir:\n\nI herewith beg to acknowledge receipt of departmental letter dated February 27th, in reference to the sickness among the hogs at St. George's Indian Residential School.\n\nI am enclosing a letter from Mr. Lett, the reverend principal, which will speak for itself.\n\nAs you will see the disease has been eradicated.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A.

C.\n\nDear Mr. Strang:\n\nRegarding the barn situation here and the reports which I have received from the Department of Agriculture at Ottawa. The Department of Agriculture stipulates the dividing of the herd as a necessary method of dealing with the disease prevalent. We are unable to do this having no second barn on the school farm, nor any means of dividing the pasturage.\n\nWe are however, with what isolation available, making the best of the situation, keeping our calves away from the main herd and will if possible, isolate these in the pasture.\n\nWe are also butchering wherever possible and note that the Department calls for a quarterly blood test of those cattle not affected. I shall, therefore, ask Dr. Jagger to make these tests as he is the most capable veterinary to whom we have access. We have still six cows reacting to the test and shall exercise every care to keep them away from the remainder of the herd and also in so far as it is possible, keep the milk supply from these cows out of the school.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nA. R.

The Department will approve of Dr. Jaggers again visiting the herd in three months' time, to take blood samples and test them.

Should it be necessary, after that time, for the school to have a further visit from the Veterinary, it is considered that they should be responsible for the payment of his fees, etc., from their farm receipts.

Mr. Hives, Principal of the St. George's Residential School, which reads, in part, as follows:\n\n\"The matter of obtaining meat is a very serious situation, and yet it should not be, and would not be if I had a thousand dollars to buy twenty head of cattle. Instead of which, I have to sit by and see the Jew come in and buy them from the Indians. If there is a thousand dollars in the coffers of New England Company, I do not know of any better way it could be spent than by buying cattle. We have the feed to fatten them, and there is no more profitable way of disposing of cattle feed than by feeding it. If therefore you can possibly send us a thousand dollars from New England Company fund, will you please write me by air mail, so that if possible I may get ahead of the Jew and safeguard our meat supply for the winter.\"\n\nIt is rather difficult for us to decide if it is either advisable or necessary to make the expenditure requested by the Principal. The last information that we have regarding the livestock at the St. George's School indicated that there should be sufficient to meet the needs. I should appreciate very much having your comments on the Principal's request.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.

MacKay,\nCommissioner of Indians for B.C.,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgement letter No. 315-7-920 relative to my letter to Mr. Hoey, in which I asked for a special grant with which to buy beef cattle. Below is a list of the number of cattle attached to St. George's School.\n\n2 bulls\n4 heifer calves 6 mths to 1 year old\n5 \" \" under six months\n5 \" \" 1 to 2 years old\n4 \" \" 2 to 3 years old\n15 cows.\n\nYou may see what our situation is, and how impossible it is to supply ourselves with beef from our own herd. I do not know when the last report went in to the Department regarding our cattle, but we have had to buy beef most of the year, and we shall have to continue doing so for sometime. It is extremely difficult purchasing beef cattle, unless one has the ready cash with which to pay for them. Had we the cash now, I might be able to buy some, but buyers, (mostly Jews) come around and offer cash to the Indians, and they get the cattle. The result is, we have to buy our beef from the retailer, and pay high prices. This school cannot afford to do that. During the past year we have met our current expenses with the bare per capita grant. Whatever extra grant we have had from the New England Company special grant has been used to meet extraordinary expenses in the matter of replacements and repairs. In other schools such expenses are met from special grants from the Department.\n\nIn a pamphlet just received from M.S.C.C., there is an item, herewith attached, which clearly states that the per capita grant has to be supplemented by another $30.00 per capita, which they depend upon receiving from the Church people, as well as clothing and footwear for all girls in their schools and boys up to eleven years' age.\n\nWe have met our current expenses with the per capita grant, but I assure you, sir, we have had to be on the verge of stinginess, and there has been little chance to waste anything.\n\nI do hope we shall be able to receive the special New England Company grants, which the school is really in need of.\n\nI expect to be in Vancouver next Thursday, and would like to call on you at that time.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRec'd C.O. Office Nov. 3/42.\n\n\"Chas. F. Hives\". Principal.\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 26th ultimo, File 165-0-14, with reference to the supply of cattle to St. George's Indian Residential School, I enclose herewith copy of Mr. Hives' letter of the 2nd instant to me, and to advise that he called on me yesterday when this subject was discussed at some length.\n\nThere appears to be a shortage of beef in western Canada and, at the prevailing high prices, it is not likely that this situation will improve to any appreciable extent for some considerable time.\n\nMr. Hives states that he is in a position to purchase beef cattle from Indians in his locality at a fair price and has plenty of feed on the school farm to make the feeding of the cattle quite profitable.\n\nUnder the circumstances, if the funds could be provided, I am prepared to recommend that Mr. Hives be given the $1,000.00 with which to purchase cattle up to that amount as opportunity arises. I suggested to Mr. Hives that, as he has the necessary lands, range and other facilities available to raise beef cattle for school purposes, he should proceed to do so, using the amount required, if provided, to some extent to purchase foundational stock.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa,\nNovember 14, 1948.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your recent request for $1000.00 from New England Company funds to enable you to purchase cattle, it has now been decided to allow this amount and a cheque will go forward under separate cover. At the present time there is a balance in the New England Company account of $2734.00 and with the $1000.00 deducted there will still be a balance of $1734.00. From information recently received, it is extremely doubtful if any further payment will be made by the New England Company and consequently you will realize that there is not much money left. As soon as you have made the purchase, you should let me have full particulars regarding the number and type of animals that you bought.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, March 2, 1943.\n\nDear Mr. Hives:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of February 22, in which you intimate that you have for sale one Clydesdale stallion and three pure-bred young mares.\n\nI can personally see no objection to the disposal of these horses, provided you are convinced that Clydesdales are no longer serviceable in the district. If these horses are to be sold, however, it has occurred to me that it might be more profitable to dispose of them in B.C. rather than on the prairies. Freight rates are high and we are being constantly reminded to do everything humanly possible to avoid unnecessary railroad traffic. In communicating with Commissioner MacKay in respect to this matter, I have intimated to him that if there is no sale for the horses in B.C. either he or you should communicate with Mr. C.P. Schmidt, Inspector of Indian Agencies, Calgary, Alberta.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend C.F. Hives,\nPrincipal,\nSt. George's Residential School,\nLyttton, B.C.\nOttawa, March 2, 1943.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C.,\nBox 70, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nI am enclosing herewith, for your information, copy of a letter received by this Branch from the Principal of the St. George's Residential School.\n\nI can see no serious objection to the disposal of the surplus horses at this school, provided you are convinced that Clydesdales are not serviceable in this particular district. I have been informed by one of the officials here that the same matter came up a number of years ago. The Indians at that time expressed a desire to secure Percheron rather than Clydesdale, not because Clydesdale were not suitable for ordinary farm work but because they were too slow for riding. In any event, if the horses are to be disposed of, it would be desirable to dispose of them in B. C. and thus save freight charges. If, however, there is no market at present available for horses at the Coast, it might be advisable to communicate with Inspector C. P. Schmidt, Calgary, Alberta, in respect to the matter.\n\nEncl.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nRev. C. F. Hives,\nPrincipal\n\nFeb. 22, 1943\nLytton, B.C.\n\nDear Mr Hoey:\n\nI was talking to Commissioner MacKay last week on a matter relative to some horses we have, and which I think we should dispose of. He thought I should write you direct and place the matter before you.\n\nWe have a pure bred, registered Clydesdale Stallion, six years' of age, and three pure bred young mares two and three years' of age. They are all very fine animals. I think the idea was to try and get the Indians to breed their mares to the Clydesdale, but they do not seem to favour the idea. I quite see their point, for I rather think a Clydesdale is too heavy for this mountainous country. They like the Percheron, because they are quicker. However, I am sure the Clydesdale would be favoured on the prairie or flat country. They are all valuable animals, and I would like to dispose of them to the best advantage. The selling value I would place on them is Stallion $250.00 Mares each $150.00\n\nI would be very much obliged if you would keep this matter in mind, and if possible make an opening for us to dispose of them.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr R.A.

Now, I found here some instruments, but not enough to make a band. There was a band at this school at one time, before the present principal, Rev. A. Lett, took charge, but some of the instruments must have been lost, as at present there are not instruments enough to make a band. I approached Rev. Lett, with a view of having some more instruments bought, but he told me that this was an impossibility for him, as the capital grant is barely sufficient to purchase the necessaries of food, clothing, etc., for the children, without allowing for any luxuries. So, there is no hope to have the necessary instruments paid for out of the school funds. Before I came here I occupied a position similar to the one I occupy here at the Fraser Lake Industrial School. There I had a very successful band. The instruments were nearly all second-hand ones, and I remember the prices paid for them.\n\nTo make this band a success, and even a possibility, I would need three more instruments, and the prices would not be more, for the three of them, than from $25.00 to $75.00.\n\nWould it be asking too much to ask you that you take this matter up with the Department, and present the situation, and ask for the granting of the sum mentioned above, in order to enable me to go ahead with the band? You will agree with me that it is a very good thing for the school in general, and for the boys in particular, to have a band. I have seen the good effects of a band in several schools, both white and Indian, and I am sure that it would be a boon for this Institution.\n\nI trust you will see fit to endorse this request.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6467, file 888-17, part 1)\nSt. George's Industrial School\nSupported by the New England Company\n(The oldest English Missionary Society, founded 1649)\n\nLytton, B.C., Jan 16/24\n\nMr. H. Graham,\nIndian Agent,\nSyilx\n\nDear Mr. Graham\u2014\n\nEnclosed you will find application from Mr. King for a small appropriation for the purchase of Band Instruments with which to fully equip a Band.\n\nUnder Mr. King's instructions I have no hesitancy to say that the Boys will make good. I desire therefore to endorse his application.\n\nI trust you will use your influence in forwarding the cause.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. A. R. Lett\nIN INDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE\n\nLytton, B. C.,\n\nJanuary 18th, 1924.\n\nSir,\n\nI herewith beg to enclose letter from the house and bandmaster at St. George's Industrial School, together with an accompanying letter from the principal asking for some assistance towards purchasing some new instruments for the band.\n\nI might state that some four years ago a band was started at St. George's School, but was dropped on account of not having anybody to train them. We have now Mr. Ockoney who is a professional band master, and who was recently at Fraser Lake Indian School, where he had an excellent band.\n\nI have heard the children here and consider that in the short time that he has had them under training, they are doing excellently, but lack instruments. They have one instrument there that is too big for the boys.\n\nThe Indians are always so fond of music that it is really a drawing card, and I would like to recommend that if the Department can only see fit to give them a grant to buy the requested instruments to make the band what it should be, it would be greatly appreciated.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H. Graham)\nIndian Agent.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nOttawa.\n\nHG/MD\nOttawa, January 28, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, enclosing communications from the Principal and the Bandmaster of the Lytton Indian Residential School requesting a grant for the purpose of purchasing some new instruments for the band which has been organized among the pupils of the school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will allow a grant not to exceed $75 in the purchase of the instruments mentioned by the Bandmaster. You or the Principal can make the purchase, it being necessary to obtain competitive prices, and the purchase should be made from the firm quoting the lowest price. Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred, to which should be attached a memo showing the names of the firms asked to quote, and the prices quoted. The above amount is all we are prepared to authorize, and this sum should not be exceeded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH.

GENERAL.\n\nThere are three Cadet Corps organized in connection with Indian Residential Schools in Military District, No.11, namely:\n\nNo. 1077, St. George's (Lytton) Cadet Corps.\nNo. 1102, Alert Bay Cadet Corps.\nNo. 1295, Coqualeetza (Sardis) Cadet Corps.\n\nA brief summary of the training carried out at each school is given hereunder.\n\n2. ST. GEORGE'S (LYTTON) C.C.\n\nSt. George's Cadet Corps, organized February, 1923, is situated at the Residential School some three miles from Lytton, in the interior of British Columbia. The training is supervised by the Principal of the School, the Rev. A. Lett, and assisted by one of the members of the Staff. During the School year 1929-30, 65 boys of Cadet age were enrolled and participated in the training. The boys are keenly interested in the work. At the annual inspection the results showed sound training. The Physical Training and Games, Corps discipline, and signalling were very good. First Aid was above the average, and the Inspecting Officer presented 21 St. John Ambulance Certificates to the Cadets. This percentage, about 50%, or certificates for this branch of the work is considered very high.\n\nThe boys were instructed in the proper use of .22\" B.S.A.Rifles and enter into indoor rifle matches with enthusiasm.\n\nThe Principal of the School is keen on the training as a whole, not only from the point of view of disciplinary effects, but in the production of boy leaders which is the result of the training.\n\nThe Corps has shown marked improvement at each annual inspection.\n\n3. ALERT BAY C.C.\n\nAlert Bay Corps, organized in November, 1923, is situated near the northern end of Vancouver Island, at St. Michael's Indian Residential School, Alert Bay, B.C. The training is supervised by the Principal of the School, Mr. F. Earl Anfield, and instructed by Lt.Commander J.I.Jordan, R.N. (ret.); both of these gentlemen are qualified in Physical Training and as Cadet Instructors. During the School year 1929-30, 55 boys of Cadet age were enrolled and trained.\n\nThe Corps is trained along very sound lines, boys keenly interested. A trophy awarded for competition among Indian School Cadet Corps by the Imperial Daughters of the Empire was won four consecutive years by the Alert Bay Corps and is retained by them. The remarks regarding training generally in para. two above are applicable to this Corps. This Corps, during the year under review, did not reach its usual high standard due to training being hampered by the removal of the entire school to a new residence and sickness.\n4. COQUALEETZA CADET CORPS.\n\nCoqualeetza Cadet Corps, organized in May, 1926, is situated at Coqualeetza Residential School at Sardis, one mile from Chilliwack in the Fraser Valley, B.C. The training is supervised by the Principal of the School, Rev. G.H. Ray, and instructed by Captain Peter F. Irvine, M.M., a member of the School staff. During the School year 1925-30, 40 Indian boys were enrolled and trained. Training is along the lines of \"mass\" instruction rather than specialization. Very sound work was evinced at the annual inspection. This Corps received highest marks for efficiency and will receive the new Shield awarded by the I.O.D.E. Provincial Chapter, of B.C.\n\nThe general remarks re training referred to in para. two are applicable.\n\n5. CONCLUSION.\n\nThe work carried out by the Principals and Instructors concerned has an undoubted value, as an interesting addition to academic studies to students of adolescent age. That the physical education imparted by instructors who have had the advantage of attending the Cadet Instructors' Course in addition to the Normal School Physical Training is thorough, is particularly noticeable to a visiting inspector at once. The advantage of training in First Aid needs no discussion. The inherent interest of the Indian boy to hunt with rifles is made safer by proper instruction in the handling and use of rifles. As stated before, the Indian boy enjoys the training and the results are beneficial.\nSir:-\n\nIndian Residential Schools Cadet Corps.\n\nWith reference to the above mentioned subject, I have the honour to forward herewith a summary prepared by the District Officer Commanding, Military District No.11, (British Columbia), based on the last Annual Inspection Report of the three Indian Residential Schools of British Columbia in which there are Cadet Corps.\n\nIt will be seen from this summary that the instructors in charge are carrying on a valuable work, which it is thought should be brought to your attention.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n(G.J.Desbarats)\nDeputy Minister.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nIndian Affairs Department,\nBooth Building,\nSparks Street,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\nOttawa, November 24th, 1930.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your H.Q.12-S-184 of 15th instant, with enclosure, concerning the valuable cadet work at the St. George's, Alert Bay and Coqualeetza Indian Residential Schools in British Columbia.

I have to request that you will inform the Department of the names and register numbers of the pupils who will be taking up high school work during the present academic year.

I would therefore be pleased if you could see fit to forward Grant for $50 each in respect of the following:\n\nWilliamson Walkem - pupil number 159 - who passed Grade ten examinations.\n\nMargaret McIntyre - pupil number 057 - who passed nine examinations.\n\nBessie Walker - pupil number 086 - who passed nine examinations also.\n\nI am sorry that these applications did not go in at the end of last year but felt that I wished to know their standing before making application. As they were successful I would like if possible to have their Grants for last year 1929 and 1930.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nTo...REV. A.

Nellie Bent was so successful in her grade 9 examinations, reaching an average of 66.3.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nA. R. Lett.\n\nA.R./CF\nDear Mr. Sutherland-\n\nFor the past six years we have had a Provincial Class room in teh Indian School building for the benefit of the children belonging to the outside Staff which room also included in its numbers my own daughter.\n\nOwing to children qualifying for High School this room has approached the time when it must be closed because of insufficient numbers. The four remaining Children who are in grades seven and eight will go to Lytton Public School and will be taken care of there, but there are two boys belonging to the Farm Manager who have qualified for 1st and 2nd year High and who have no place to go and the Father cannot afford to send the boys away from home for further schooling. Mr. Piper is willing to pay a tuition fee of $50.00 each for the boys if they could be allowed to attend the Continuation Class room in this school.\n\nI am sorry I did not take the matter up with you when in Ottawa but there was then the possibility of other provision being made through their friends which did not materialise. The boys will not be any trouble in the continuation class room as they will be entering grades already being taught.\n\nI should be glad of your advice or decision in this matter and if favorable what I shall do with the Tuition money.\n\nIf it is possible for us to tide these Boys over for this year there may be, with sufficient numbers, a Superior School established in Lytton, which next year would take care of the lads.\n\nYours very obediently\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. J.D. Sutherland\nSup. Indian Education,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 9, 1935.\n\nDear Mr. Lett:\n\nI have your letter of the first instant, with reference to the children of Mr. Piper attending the continuation classroom in the St. George's Indian Residential School.\n\nAs a general rule, the Department considers it inadvisable to allow the permission requested by Mr. Piper. No doubt he resides near the school, which is only a short distance from the town. The Department does not see any reason why his children could not go to town each day. Many children in country places go much farther to school.\n\nAre there any other white children residing close to the school whose parents might consider that they should be given a similar privilege if Mr. Piper's children are allowed to attend the continuation class in St. George's School? On receipt of your reply, the matter will receive further consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. A. R. Lett,\nPrincipal,\nSt. George's Indian Res. School,\nLytton, B.C.\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nYours numbering 165-0-22, dated September 9th, regarding the application made to you on behalf of the Piper boys.\n\nThere is no continuation classroom or any High School room in Lytton. We have for some time been trying to arouse sufficient interest in Lytton to take steps to qualify for such a school, up to this time efforts in this regard have not born fruit. Mr. Piper feeling that he could not afford to send the boys away came to me, hence my letter to you.\n\nThere is a fairly efficient correspondence course which the boys could take but such courses at best do not fill the place of a regular continuation class or High School room.\n\nI do not think we are inviting future trouble in having, later perhaps, to object to children attending but I must admit that this situation will leave an opening, and if the Department feels privilege cannot be granted, Mr. Piper will be obliged to arrange otherwise.\n\nThere are no other children at present who are in a position to make application for the same recognition.\n\nThe nearest High School is at North Bend which is thirty miles from Lytton and can only be reached by train.\n\nI will be glad of your decision by return and will be pleased to be governed accordingly.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. J. D.

If he wishes his children to attend during the academic year 1935-36, the matter will have to be further considered at that time. The fact that the children are being allowed to attend during the current academic year should not be considered a precedent.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D.

Instructions issued at different intervals during the last few years have directed attention to the fact that new authority for expenditures must be obtained each fiscal year.\n\nWith reference to the account you enclosed, do you mean that this is the advanced educational grant for the academic year just closed or for the academic year 1935-36? The Department is aware that, in a letter of June, last, we approved of Nellie Bent remaining in the St. George's Residential School for another year. At the time, it was overlooked that she was eighteen years of age.\n\nYou might let me know what are Nellie Bent's future plans.

Quote: \"When the results of the examinations are published, you should advise the Department regarding the success achieved by these four pupils as it will not be possible to allow grant during the academic year 1933-34 for any high school pupil who is unsuccessful in this year's examinations.\n\nOn the strength of the above I made application to you for academic year 1933-34 and received the grant without criticism...likewise expected the same recognition for academic year 1934-35, for which the grant was asked. According to above quotation it would be impossible for me to ask for advanced educational grant to take care of the ensuing year 1935-36.\n\nThis girl has ambitions for teaching, and at present it would seem that her mind is made up to go on with this outlook in ambition. It would, therefore, to my mind, in her case, seem a justifiable expenditure, on the part of the Department, to help the school to purchase books and equipment for her advance.\n\nIf the Department is going to allow themselves to lapse into the position of educating these children only for a forced period of nine years, without being ready to foster voluntary advance, the children's outlook on education would become curbed and would not, in any way, be conducive to cultivate that most needed part of constructive character, responsibility.\n\nPersonally, I feel that a satisfied child is bound to be an asset to the Department as well as all concerned, and there should be no hesitancy in offering such help as has here-to-fore been given.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\nA.

They claim that it is a long time since they were told by the first Governor Douglas that they would soon have a school for their children. About forty years have passed away since then and they are still waiting for the fulfillment of that promise. Capilano, the first chief, to whom the promise was made has long since been gathered to his fathers. His son, Lush, was the next chief. He too has gone to his eternal rest without seeing the school promised so long ago to his father.\n\nNow, Sir, it comes to us to respectfully request a fulfillment of that promise.\n\nThere are three tribes of Indians interested, the Squamish, the Sechelt and the Sliammon. In these tribes there are now more than 400 children.\n\nWe would like to have a Roman Catholic school, convent and college here, at Squamish Mission, where the children can be taught, fed and clothed. The ground is ready to be used for this purpose.\n\nSigned on behalf of the tribes,\n\nChief Harry, Chief Tom, Chief Joe, of the Squamish tribe,\nChief Charley, of the Sliammon tribe,\nChief George, of the Sechelt tribe.\n\nSquamish Mission, August 10th, 1895.\nthese Indians in the matter, and I should be very glad to put them within easy access of the great advantages which flow from education as given in the schools directed by the Department.

A day School would be of very little service to them, and for that reason, as will be seen from the Estimates from this office for \"1897-1898,\" provision was made for an Industrial School for their benefit.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour Ob'dt.

Cowell Esq.\nIndian Superintendent\nVictoria\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI learn that three weeks ago the Chiefs of the Squamish tribe of Indians wrote a letter to Agent Kerley impressing again on him the great need they have of an Industrial School for their children and begging of him to make known at Ottawa their longing for the fulfillment of the promise made them last year.\n\nHad I known it sooner, I would have begged of you to send the request & the Act of Parliament along with the Chiefs' letter.\n\nNo doubt you have not only seconded the petition of the Chiefs but have also supported it by the strongest reasons.\n\nYou are only too well aware that an Industrial School is necessary on that Western portion of the Fraser River Agency. The excuse that there is no money in the treasury is not a real excuse. Money is found to establish other schools, money is found to give a grant of $500.00 for five pupils to the Methodist School of\nCougatiza, on the Pitt River, though\nthe Indian Department should know as well\nas yourself and Mr. Agent Devlin, that most\nof the pupils of the said school are half-\nbreeds who attend the Provincial\nPublic Schools, their white fathers being\nalive and in British Columbia.\n\nThe Honorable Mr. Part, Minister of\nPublic Works, in visiting said school at\nCougatiza, last November could not but\nmake the remark that very few of the\n47 children, inmates of the school, were\nof full Indian blood, and the Principal\nwas obliged to confess to him that he had\ngreat difficulty in finding Indian children.\nI told the Honorable Mr. Parte that the\ncause of such difficulty was that the Indians\nof the Lower Fraser District are nearly all\nCatholics, in fact there are in said district\nmore than three hundred Catholic Indians\nin a total population of about sixteen hundred.\nShould you call upon Mr. Agent Devlin\nI send you a correct census of the\nabove named Lower Fraser Indians from\nYale to the mouth of the river you would\nfind two hundred and seventy seven children\nof school age, 239 of whom belong to the\nRoman Catholic Church, 15 to the Episcopal\nChurch and 25 to the Methodist Church.\nNow such is the case because I am\nliving with those Indians since 1864,\nand then the grant of $500.00 to the\nMethodist School of Cougatiza for\nfifty pupils given to destroy the faith implanted by me and my missionaries in the heart of these Catholic Indians? Or is it given to educate the half breed children of white men cohabiting with Indian squaws?\n\nNow is it that the Hon. Count Dufferin and yourself do not enforce the rule inserted in the Quarterly reports for the Industrial and Boarding Schools? Said rule says that no pupil but of full Indian blood shall be entered on said quarterly reports.\n\nIf this rule were observed, the Government would not have been misled as they have been.\n\nIf a grant be not given this year for the establishing of an Industrial School on the Squamish Reservation opposite Vancouver I am prepared to expose the above mentioned partiality, and will have somebody at Ottawa to ask for an inquiry.\n\nThan the honor to be, &c., &c.\n\nYour humble servant,\n\n(Sgd) Paul Durkee\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6467, file 289-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nBritish Columbia.\n\nIndian Office,\nVictoria, January 5th. 1897.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to inclose herein copy of a letter received from Bishop Durieu of New Westminster, dated 28th. of December 1896, in which His Lordship complains of the increase of grant allowed to the Coqualeetza Home, etc. etc.\n\nHis Lordship, I may say, is anything but just in the statements he makes and is wrong in nearly all his conclusions.\n\nRegarding half-breed children being cared for at Boarding and Industrial Schools I may say that there are many children to be found on the different reserves having all the appearance of half-breeds which their parents state is misleading and assert that they are pure Indians. Others there are whose fathers are\n\nThe Deputy Supt.

December 1893 in reference to last mentioned subject - and would add that I have since that date again reminded them that the schools referred to were for the education of the Indian children only.\n\nI inclose for the information of the Department copy of my letter in answer to Bishop Durieu's communication of the 28th ultimo, and trust that my action may be satisfactory to the Department.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour Ob'dt.

JOS HALL\nPRINCIPAL\n\nIndian Superintendent\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nJanuary 23, 1897\n\nDear Mr. Hall,\n\nI am writing to you in response to your letter dated January 23, 1897. I did not reply promptly to your last statement made to you about the fact that the Hon. Mr. Hall, when visiting our institute, remarked that very few of the 74 children present were of pure Indian blood and that I had difficulty in finding Indian children. This must surely be some mistake, sir. My recollection of what took place is as follows. When the Hon. gentleman was looking over the school, he remarked, \"Surely, there are not all of pure Indian blood.\" I replied, \"No, there are several half-breeds,\" both having the same half-breed mind (for I had never counted them up). He could not be easy to decide between the one class and the other by mere inspection, or without a knowledge of the percentage. I could not tell the Hon. Mr. Hall what proportion each was present. I have a distinct recollection of his intonation and attitude, but cannot explain it now that many of these half-breeds are now elsewhere wards of the government. But before I had time to make a remark to this effect, the Hon. gentleman asked some question respecting the school which I answered. I cannot proceed further at this time because that I had not been able to make the explanations which I felt ought to have been made to prevent misunderstanding which I feared might result from the general and unexplained answer I had given.\n\nThe facts are distinguished. Mr. Hall kept up a running fire of questions which indicated his keenness of observation and desire for information. Many of which I was able to give only partial answers before a further question or remark called for reply. I held him so that I had been in charge of the institute only a few months and that the too many matters connected with it that I had not yet become familiar with and it will be seen how possible it was that my partial answers &c., comprehending questions might be misleading when reported from a standpoint that was not at the moment present to my mind. In this respect I did feel that the visit of the Hon. gentleman was unsatisfactory. It was brief and hurried, so strongly impressed was I with this feature of its unsatisfactoriness that I thought seriously of turning questioning him and gathering a more full into explanations and details of fact which it seemed to me had been made necessary by his questions having been so partially answered.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6467, File 889-1, part 1)\nCHILLIWACK, B.C.\n\nREV. JOS HALL\nPRINCIPAL\n\nSardis P.O. Jan 23, 1897\n\nOnly the pressure of important duties demanding immediate attention prevented me from doing this, and as time elapsed the impression of the importance of doing so became materially less distinct. Had I had the least idea that it was so, I should have been made of sterner stuff, and more capable of dealing with such matters. I have felt that the importance of doing the right thing and explaining was supreme over even other considerations. However, I am not enough from being in such a way as to say that there was any thought in the mind of the Hon. Mr. Smith that he was guilty of that which might be held to be wantonly and unjustly charged by certain Government friends, dishonestly, or in the language of the charge that most of the children attending the Institute and on whom we count a great deal, especially by the school, are half-breed Indians attending the public schools supported by the Provincial Government, and that their white fathers are still alive and residing in British Columbia. Had I thought of this kind had it place in the mind of the Hon. Smith, it is a thousand pities that he has not spoken it out or the fact, and I feel constrained to say that it is only due him that he should have done so. The matter must very quickly have been settled to his satisfaction. If a remark was made by myself to effect that I found it difficult or \"very difficult\" to find Indian children of this kind, I have but the slightest recollection, and cannot prove myself that I did so; it was certainly not in the way of prejudice or otherwise in accepting Government money, however he has no right. It is true that it is often difficult to persuade Indian parents to send their children to an institution of this kind particularly if they live a little remote from its location because they do not like to see them children away from the home life, and the affection of the Indians for their children is very strong, and they like to have them with them. But I had not at the time of Hon. Mr. Smith's visit any personal opinion of the kind. I had been sent out on a recruiting tour, but the matter of having Indians make the remark or not concerned. Great difficulty of getting Indians, whether it was material or not, was not considered. Now has any Indian in the Chase District been interested\nCoqualeetza Industrial Institute.\n\nCHILLIWACK, B. C.\n\nREV. JOS HALL\nPRINCIPAL\n\nSardis P. O. Jan 28 1897\n\nI forward herewith the names of the children of our Institute whom I regard as claimants in the first place and for the reasons set forth. In my communications to the department of the 15th inst., I have indicated some of the facts in the case of those persons whom I had been obliged to investigate. In reflection I have included to furnish the particulars concerning the whole 59 in my last A of the aforementioned 15th inst., and beg to remain\n\nYour faithful servant,\n\nJoseph Hall\nPrincipal\n\nP.S. I ought to add concerning the information I have herein supplied, that I cannot vouch for its absolute correctness in all cases. I have evaded myself of the best sources of information within my reach, and believe that the probable result is the direction of complete accuracy in every instance. Rather than this I cannot go. Besides, this inquiry which has often led up to a knowledge of unpleasant facts has not been superfluous, but has been pursued in the interest of truth.\n\nJoseph Hall\nCHILLIWACK, B. C.\n\nREV. JOS.

MacNeil\nMemorandum\n\nIndustrial School needed for the Indians on the Squamish Reserve opposite Vancouver.\n\nIn the fall of 1894, the Squamish Indians sent a petition to the Honorable the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, the Honorable Mr. Daly, asking for an industrial school on their reserve, opposite the City of Vancouver.\n\nThe above petition was seconded by some gentlemen from Vancouver and by me in writing and was forwarded to the Honorable Mr. Daly by Mr. G. E. Carboold, M.C.\n\nA kind reply was made by the Honorable Mr. Daly on the 21st December last, Mr. Carboold, but no promise was given.\n\nAt the end of August 1895, the Honorable Mr. Daly came to Vancouver with the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, Mr. Hayton Reed. Mr. Reed paid a visit to the Squamish Indians on their reserve opposite Vancouver.\n\nThe Squamish Chiefs, seconded by the Chiefs of Dechell, Shannan, Clakes and Kowalbo tribes along the coast, handed to Mr. Reed a second petition asking for the establishment of an industrial school on their reserve. This petition was again addressed to the Honorable the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, the Indian Chiefs entrusting Mr. Reed to use his influence in obtaining for them the industrial school they most needed for the education of their children.\n\nFew months after they received a favorable reply through Mr. Superintendent of Indians at Victoria, Mr. Vorwell, and the Agent of Fraser Agency, Mr. Frank Deslin. An industrial school was to be established on their reserve.\n\nTo the above communication the Squamish made the following reply:\n\nTo the Honorable\nthe Superintendent Gen. of Ind. Affs.\n\nSquamish November 20th 1895\n\nWe have duly received the letter by which you inform the Chiefs of the Dechell, Shannan, Clakes and Kowalbo tribes that the Government has been pleased to grant us the industrial school we are in a great need for\nthe education of our children\n\nWe hasten to offer you our sincere thanks and the thanks of our people for the grant placed in the Estimates for the construction of the school buildings on our Squamish Reserve.\n\nWe take the occasion to humbly beg that said school buildings be large enough to accommodate at least one hundred and fifty children. There are over three hundred children in the four tribes to be benefited by the said Industrial School.\n\nWe are happy to state that our people were so encouraged to hear that you would give us an Industrial School, that they put their selves at once to work and grub the ten acres we have selected and reserved for the site of the School. We will have the ten acres free of stumps and entirely cleared by the first of April next.\n\nWe remain your humble servants,\n\nHarry + Chief\nTom + Chief\nCharles + Chief\nJoseph + Chief\nJoe + Chief\nJames + Chief\nBishop's Palace,\nNew Westminster, B. C.\nCanada.\n\nNew Westminster, B. C., the 9th December 1896.\n\nThe Honorable Clifford Sifton\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to bring to your notice the advisability and the necessity of establishing an Indian Industrial Boarding School on the Squamish Reservation opposite Vancouver, Burrard Inlet.\n\nFive different tribes, named Squamish, Seskelt, Shannan, Cohoes and Komakko, are living on the Mainland Coast from Vancouver to Butte Inlet, in the Western part of the Fraser River Agency. They are often coming to Vancouver for trading purposes. They number 1150 in all. They have 400 children, 200 of whom are of school age. Not one of them has ever been to school, all are growing up in total ignorance.\n\nThe Chiefs of said tribes many times appealed to the late Government for an Industrial School. Promises were made but never kept. In view of the promises made the Indians cleared away near the ten acres of land they have reserved for a school site, they are still waiting the promised buildings.\n\nThese Indians deserve to be encouraged in the progress they have made in civilization. Their good conduct is of so long a standing the Squamish Village opposite Vancouver is a model of order and cleanliness for which it is much admired not only by the citizens of Vancouver but by tourists and strangers. Their good behaviour has been a credit to the Federal Government and an honor to the City of Vancouver. Some efforts should be made to raise them to a higher standard and an Industrial School is\nBishop's Palace,\nNew Westminster, B. C.\n\nNew Westminster, B. C.,\n\nthe very means to bring their children to a higher state of civilization.\n\nTherefore I respectfully beg that a grant of fifteen thousand dollars be placed in the Estimates and voted by Parliament next Session for the erection of suitable school buildings, and that same be pushed forward at an early date. If said grant was secured this year, I think that I could manage to get the balance necessary to put up buildings suitable for the purpose. It grieves me to see these children growing up in ignorance.\n\nI feel confident that you will take my demand in due consideration and grant it.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nyour humble servant\n\nPaul Durieu\n\nR. C. Bishop of New-Westminster.\nMemorandum\n\nOf the Conversation & had with the Hon. Mr. Varte\nat New-Westminster, November 1896\n\n1. Concerning the Establishing of an Indian Industrial School on the Squamish Reservation, opposite Vancouver.\n\nThis is a long felt want. Five different tribes of Indians scattered on the mainland coast from Vancouver to Butte Inlet, in the Fraser River Agency, number 1150 in all. They come often to Vancouver for trading purposes. They have 200 children of school age; not one of them has ever been to school; all are growing up in total ignorance.\n\nThese Indians many times appealed to the late government for an industrial school; promises were made but never kept.\n\nIn view of promises made, the Indians cleared ten acres of land on their Reserve for a school site, they are still waiting the promised buildings.\n\nThese Indians certainly deserve better treatment. They are an exemplary class and should be encouraged. The Squamish Village opposite Vancouver is a model of order and cleanliness for which it is much admired not only by the Citizens of Vancouver but by tourists and strangers.\n\nTherefore I respectfully ask that an appropriation of fifteen thousand dollars be voted by Parliament at next session for the erection of suitable School buildings and that same may be pushed forward at an early date.\n\n2. Concerning a request for a grant of $6,500.00 to St. Mary's Indian Boarding School for fifty pupils.\n\nThe grant we receive from the Dominion government for said school is sixty dollars ($60.00) only, for each of sixty pupils ($3,600.00 per annum). I have to complain of this diminutive capitulation grant of sixty dollars per pupil.\n\nExperience has proved that such capitulation is entirely insufficient for providing a pupil with board, clothing, washing, mending, books and stationary, doctor's fees, medicine etc., and keeping the school up to the high standard required by the Government and the parents of the children.\n\nI wish that time permitted you to see St. Mary's school. We have...\nErected at our own expense and at a cost of eighteen thousand dollars two separate school buildings: one for girls under the management of four sisters of St. Ann, the other for boys under the direction of two Fathers and two laymen. There is ample accommodation for forty-five children in each school.\n\nWe incurred this large outlay under the impression that the Federal Government would furnish the means of carrying on these schools for the benefit of a Catholic population of 1394 Indians.\n\nA careful census taken this year by my missionaries shows that the Indians living in the valley of the Fraser River from Yale down to its mouth form a population of 1676 souls, 1394 of whom are members of the Catholic Church.\n\nAmong these thirteen hundred and ninety-four (1394) Catholic Indians there are now many heads of families who have been educated at St. Mary's Boarding School established in 1861, upwards of thirty-five years ago. They have raised their education in those schools and to those schools they wish to send their children, 77 of whom are there at present.\n\nThe golden rule of the Federal government being not to disturb the faith of the Indians but to leave them to the guidance of those who have converted them to Christianity, I firmly hope that the government will help their Catholic Indians to have their children educated in the school of their choice and of their faith and place them there on the same terms as the Indian children are admitted by the government into the Methodist Boarding School of Coqualeetza at Chilliwack.\n\nThe Dominion Government having found it advisable to grant six thousand and five hundred dollars for fifty pupils to the Methodist School of Coqualeetza, should grant the same amount for fifty pupils to St. Mary's Catholic School; they are in the same district but 20 miles apart; they are for the same tribe, whose Indians are nearly all Catholics; they give the same common-school industrial education to their pupils. As a proof of St. Mary's School's efficient training, I may mention that the pupils of the Sisters of St. Ann were awarded ten first class and two second class prizes at the Grand Agricultural and Industrial Exhibition held last year at New Westminster.\n\nTherefore in asking for St. Mary's Indian Boarding School a grant of six thousand and five hundred dollars for fifty pupils, I simply ask...\nfor justice, equality and nothing more, and when the matter is reconsidered, I am satisfied the government will comply with my request and place on the estimates of the year 1897 a grant of six thousand five hundred dollars for St. Mary's Boarding School and have it voted by Parliament on its next session. Though it would be farce, all things considered, to allow the capitulation rate of $130.00 for each of 60 pupils, the number at present paid for at the insufficient rate of $60 dollars per pupil.\n\nPaul Durieu, O.M.I.\nP. C. Bishop\nMEMORANDUM\n\nIn reference to the application for a grant for the establishment of an Industrial school at Squamish B.C., made by His Lordship Bishop Durie,\n\nThe undersigned begs to say that there is no school of this class on the Lower Fraser. There is a Roman Catholic boarding school at St Mary's Mission City with provision for 60 pupils at $60 each per annum, and a so-called Industrial School at Chilliwack (Coqualeetza) with provision for 50 pupils at $130, conducted by the Methodist Missionary Society. The Bishop in making his application complains of the increased grant to the Coqualeetza Home.\n\nAlthough nearly all the Indians of the Lower Fraser are shown by the census returns to belong to the Roman Catholic faith, the proportion being about 10 to 1, they have no Industrial school.\n\nThe undersigned thinks that if increased provision could be made for St Mary's Mission, another Roman Catholic school would not be required on the Lower Fraser.\n\nThe grant to the Coqualeetza home of $130 p.e. seems to be excessive for a school of its class, and the undersigned thinks that if a larger number were provided for, the rate of payment...\npayment might be reduced to the allowance made to boarding schools.\nAT THE GOVERNMENT HOUSE AT OTTAWA.\n\nMonday, 1st Day of April, 1895.\n\nPRESENT:\n\nHIS EXCELLENCY THE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL.\n\nHis Excellency, in virtue of the powers conferred upon him by sections 137 and 138, which are added to the Indian Act by section eleven of chapter 32 of the Acts 57-58 Victoria, and by and with the advice of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada, is pleased to order that Section 12 of the Regulations established by the Order in Council of the 10th November, 1894, shall be and the same is hereby repealed, and the following section substituted therefor:\n\n\"12. If any child in an industrial or boarding school should leave such school without permission of the Superintendent General, the Assistant Indian Commissioner, or of the Principal of the school, or should any child who has been allowed out fail to return at the stipulated time, an Indian Agent or Justice of the Peace shall, on information made to that effect by any officer...\"\nof such school, issue a warrant authorizing\nthe person named therein to search for and\ntake such child back to and again place it\nin the school in which it has been previ-\nously placed as aforesaid. But notwith-\nstanding anything in this section, it shall\nbe competent for any employee of the\nIndian Department, or any constable, to\narrest without a warrant any child found in\nthe act of escaping from any industrial or\nboarding school, and to convey such child\nto the school from which it escaped.\n\nJOHN J.

D. McLean\n\nSecretary\nNEW WESTMINSTER, B. C.,\nNov. 28, 1898.\n\nJames A. Smart, Esq.\nSupt.\nDeputy Gen. of Indian Affairs,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nLast January I had several interviews with you on the subject of certain applications made by His Lordship Bishop Durieu, of New-Westminster, to the Department, for Indian School purposes. You will remember that one was for $100 per capita, for 60 children for a Boarding School at Squamish. The other was that the present very insufficient allowance, to St. Mary's Mission School, be increased from $60 per capita, for 60 children, to $100 per capita for the same number of children.\n\nYou seemed very much interested in whatever information I could give you and with the figures of statistics prepared from annual Reports, to support both these applications. From Table of Indian population, which I had compiled, you clearly saw that the school at Squamish is very much needed. You were also shown that in British Columbia it is not possible to keep up an efficient boarding school, one that would be a credit to all parties concerned, with a per capita allowance less than $100, and hence the necessity of doing more than is at present done for St. Mary's B. Schi.\n\nFrom what I could judge, during the conversation, with you, you seemed to enter into our views and expressed the wish to aid us, and you promised to recommend our needs to the Hon. the Superintendent Gen. of Ind. Affairs. You may realize how disappointed the Indians were here, as well as ourselves when the Government refused the grants for Squamish and for St. Mary's.\nHaving been given to understand that it was an impossibility for the Governm't to grant anything this year, we were resigned to the refusal. As, however, a certain other school of this province, which had already a very full allowance, was, this very year, granted an increase in its annual grant, it seems hard to understand why our applications, so reasonable, were totally disregarded.\n\nNow, dear Sir, as the time is at hand when the new estimates are to be prepared, and as your recommendation in the matter of distribution of funds for Ind. Schools is of the greatest weight, I beg to remind you of our two applications, and pray that you would consider them favorably and recommend their acceptance.\n\nAlthough refused this year we were given the hope that next year, at least the Government would grant our requests. In provision of obtaining the required grants next year, Bishop Durieu erected a school building, at Squamish, for the accommodation of fifty children. Considering that the Government found means to materially increase the annual grant to another School, when it had declared that no increase would be allowed, it will surely find means to aid Bishop Durieu in his undertaking to provide a proper school for those Indians who have, so far, been neglected. It lies with the Government now to help the Bishop to provide the necessary food and clothing for the intended pupils. Less than that the Government cannot do for its wards.\n\nTrusting that you will give our request your efficient favorable consideration, I am,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nyou respectfully,\n\nA. Downtonwill O.M.I.\nCoadjutor Bishop (R.C.)\nNew Westminster\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6467, file 389-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nNEW WESTMINSTER, B.C.,\nNov. 28, 1898.\n\nTo The Honorable CLIFFORD SIFTON, M.P.,\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs,\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nI beg leave to allude to the interviews it was my pleasure to have with you at Ottawa, last session, on the subject of two applications, which had been made to the Government. One of these applications was for a grant of $100 per capita for sixty children, for an Indian Boarding School at Squamish, on Burrard Inlet, opposite Vancouver. The other was that the present grant to the St. Mary's Mission Boarding School be raised from $60 per capita, for sixty children, to $100 for the same number of children.\n\nWe went fully into the reasons for both these requests and you acknowledged then the justice of these claims, but you declared that, this year, the Government was forced to refuse all new applications. You stated, however, that when the Government would do something, our requests would be considered among the first. After the refusal experienced, we were not a little surprised, lately, on learning that the Government had, this very year, materially increased the already abundant annual grant of a certain Indian School of this Province, while our two applications had been entirely ignored. The Government's action in behalf of the school in question, gives an additional reason for calling to your mind our requests made before last session. We therefore pray that you will consider our applications and have the grants asked for the purposes mentioned, placed on the\nestimates for the coming session.\n\nI may add that His Lordship Bishop Durieu, relying on the favorable report I had given him of your kindness during the interviews, and in pre-\nvision that at the next year's session, at least, our requests would be grant-\ned, has erected a school building at Squamish, for the accommodation of fifty\nchildren. Surely the Government will not leave him exposed to the impossi-\nbility of opening the school for want of means to care for the intended\npupils. He expresses the hope that you will aid him to carry out his under-\ntaking in behalf of the Indians, your wards, by granting the per capita\nallowance mentioned.\n\nIn the hope that you will accede to our requests,\n\nI am,\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n+ A. Downtonwill O.M.I.\nConjunct Bishop of New Westminster\nOttawa, 7th December, 1898.\n\nMemorandum: Mr. McLean.\n\nPlease let me know the School that Bishop Don-\nterville refers to as having got an extra grant this year, and\nany other particulars, so that I may reply to him.\n\nDeputy Supt.

General.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n9th December, 1898.\n\nTHE SECRETARY,\n\nWith reference to the letters of the 28th ultimo addressed to the Minister and the Deputy Minister by Bishop Dotenwill, renewing applications made by Bishop Dorion and himself for an increased grant to the St. Mary's boarding school and a grant for a proposed boarding school at Squamish, I beg first to quote the following memorandum in respect to the school proposed to be established at that point:\n\n\"Dept of Indian Affairs,\n3rd January 1898.\n\n\"The Secretary. With reference to the application made personally by His Lordship Bishop Dotenwill, of New Westminster, B.C., for a grant of $70 per capita for 40 pupils at a boarding school proposed to be established at Squamish, opposite Vancouver, Burrard Inlet, the Roman Catholic Church agreeing to erect and equip the necessary buildings, I beg to say that in reply to a similar application from the Bishop and Coadjutor Bishop of New Westminster dated the 11th November last the Department stated on the 13th instant that the Superintendent General regrets that no assistance can be given towards this object at present, as it has been decided not to contribute anything towards the establishment of new schools for the Indians either.\"\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6467, file 889-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\neither this year or the next.\n\nThe Bishop will probably urge the necessity for the establishment of a school at Squamish on the ground that the nearest Roman Catholic schools are the St. Mary's boarding school and Kuper Island industrial school, and that these two schools cannot provide accommodation for the Indian children of so large a district.\n\nThe present application might be considered in connection with the request for an increased grant to the St. Mary's boarding school. H.C. Ross.\"\n\nOn this memorandum the minister wrote \"No grant.\" And Bishop Dotenwill was accordingly informed on the 13th January last that the Superintendent General regretted that he did not see his way to altering the decision conveyed to His Lordship Bishop Durien on the 13th December (1897), namely, that no assistance could be given, as it had been decided not to contribute anything towards the establishment of a new school this year nor possibly next.\n\nWith reference to the application in respect to the St. Mary's boarding school, I beg to quote the following memorandum:\n\n\"Dept of Indian Affairs,\n31st December, 1897.\n\n\"The Secretary.\u2014 With reference to the application made personally by His Lordship Bishop Dotenwill, of New Westminster, B.C., for an increased grant to the St. Mary's Mission boarding school, namely, that provision be made for 100 children at $70 per capita, instead of for 60 pupils at $60, as at present, I beg to say that such an increased allowance would put this school on a much higher basis than\n\n(2)\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6467, file 889-1, part 1)\nthan any other boarding school in British Columbia, the other three schools of this class receiving the following grants:\n\n(C.E.) Alert Bay Girls' Home,\n10 pupils at $60;\n\n(Meth.) Port Simpson Girls' Home,\n20 pupils at $60;\n\n(C.E.) All Hallows' Vale,\n30 pupils at $60.\n\nI observe the draft of a letter on file from the Superintendent General to His Lordship Bishop Durien, dated the 28th January last, in which the Minister stated that he could not hold out any promise that during the present fiscal year (1897-98) any changes would be made in respect to the St. Mary's School. At that time Bishop Durien's application was for a grant of $130 per capita for 50 pupils. The present application is, therefore, for a much smaller grant.\n\nIn case it should be desired to make a comparison between the St. Mary's boarding school and the industrial schools in British Columbia, I subjoin a list of the grants to the schools of the latter class:\n\nMetlakahtla, 50 pupils at $120.00\n(i.e. 25 boys at $140,\n25 girls at $100,\naverage $120)\n\nAlert Bay, 35 pupils at 130.00\n\nKamloops,\n\nKootenay,\n\nKuper Island,\n\nWilliams Lake,\n\nCoqualeetza, 80 pupils at 130.00\n\nH. C. Ross.\"\nIt is presumed that the school to which Bishop Dotenwill refers as having received an increased grant during the present fiscal year is the Coqualeetza Home, at Chilliwack. This, however, is not exactly the case. An increase to this school was voted for the year 1897-8, namely, $130 per capita for 80 pupils instead of for 50 as formerly, but the increase in the grant was not paid during that year. The same amount was voted for the present year, and one quarter has been paid at that rate, namely, from the 1st of July last.\n\nH.C. Ross\nOttawa, 17th December, 1898.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo, reminding me of interviews in January last on the subject of certain applications made by His Lordship Bishop Burke for Indian school purposes; one being a request that a grant of $100 per capita be provided for 60 children at a boarding school at Squamish, the other that the present grant to the St. Mary's mission school be increased from $60 to $100 per capita for 60 pupils.\n\nIn reply I beg to remind you of my letter of the 13th January last, with reference to the application for a grant to establish a boarding school at Squamish, stating that the Superintendent General regretted that he did not see his way to altering the decision conveyed to His Lordship Bishop Burke on the 13th December 1897, namely, that no assistance could be given towards the establishment of a new school this year nor possibly next.\n\nWith reference to the application on behalf of St. Mary's boarding school, I beg to say that to increase the grant to this school would be to put it on a much higher basis than any other boarding school in British Columbia; and on the 13th January last you were informed that after giving the matter full consideration the Superintendent General regretted that he could not meet your wishes.\n\nI may add that the Department is not disposed to alter the decision conveyed in the letters above quoted.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRt Rev.

As you\nwill see frequent applications have been made since\n1894 for this purpose. I also forward file 119,704\nin which His Lordship, Bishop Durieu, transmits a\ntabular statement showing the B.C. population, the\nschool grants and the children of school age, &c.\nFrom it you will see that there are 450 R.C. children\nin the Fraser River Agency with boarding school pro-\nvision for only 60. The Methodists who had only 28\nchildren of school age had provision made for 50\nchildren at $150. This statement was prepared 2\nyears ago and although the census has not changed to\nany great extent, the number of Methodist children pre-\nvided for has been raised to 80 pupils, while the\nAnglicans remain the same.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6467, file 889-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, 14th April, 1899.\n\nMemorandum for the Minister,\n\nHereunder is a memorandum from Mr. Benson respecting the application for a grant to a school at Squamish, Burrard's Inlet. He refers in the memorandum to an Industrial school but I observe in a communication of the 11th November, 1897, Bishop Purdon asked simply for an ordinary boarding school grant of $50 a year for sixty children, he agreeing to erect and equip the necessary school buildings.\n\nI observe that in a letter of the 4th December, 1897, Mr. Vowell recommended that the Bishop's proposal be accepted, as he considered that the terms offered were most reasonable and as he knew \"that the Indians in that locality are anxiously looking for the fulfilment of the promise made to them to that end some time ago by Mr. Hayter Reed when he visited the Coast as Deputy Superintendent General.\"\n\nI find that in September, 1896, a petition was received from the Chiefs of the tribes of the Squamish Mission in which it was set forth that the school had been promised forty years ago by Governor Douglas and they were still waiting for it, and in which it was asked that a convent and college should be founded \"where the children could be taught, fed and clothed.\" Mr. Reed acknowledged this petition in these words:\n\n\"I beg to inform you that your application is approved of, and an item to provide for a school at that place will...\"\nwill be inserted in the estimates which it is hoped will be passed by Parliament.\"\n\nNaturally the Indians inferred that something in the nature of a boarding school was to be established, and in a communication of the 20th November, 1897, the Chiefs expressed their pleasure and asked that the school be made large enough to accommodate at least 150 children; they intimated that the Indians were so pleased that they had put themselves at once to clear 20 acres of land which they had selected and reserved as a site for the school.\n\nOn receipt of this communication Mr. Keed wrote Mr. Vowell to disabuse the Indians of their impression of the character of the proposed school as he had acted under the impression that it was a day school that was asked for.\n\nWhatever may have been Mr. Keed's impression, the Indians made a very clear request for a school in which their children would live, and he as clearly expressed in writing his approval in addition to the verbal promise he made according to Mr. Vowell's statement; and no explanation which could be offered will ever convince these Indians that they have been dealt with in good faith.\n\nI venture to submit that the Department having so far committed itself, the best course to pursue would be to act upon Bishop Durien's proposal to build and equip a boarding school upon the Department's providing the usual contribution for sixty pupils. I don't think we can make any increase in the boarding school rate unless we are prepared to increase the rate all round.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6467, file 889-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nHouse of Commons\n\nOttawa June 16th 1894\n\nHon.

We cannot understand why the government does nothing to help our children to rise out of their ignorance.\n\nWe have grown tired to write year after year to the Indian department begging for aid for the purpose of educating our children. You are our member, you know our situation and our wants. So you, we come again and entreat to you our intercession that justice be done us, and that a grant be voted this coming session for the boarding of our children in the school which our Bishop has built adjacent to our Reserve. You alone can obtain this grant for us. All our petitions to the government have been in vain; they have been ignored by the Indian department.\n\nWe hope therefore, that you will exert so well your influence during your stay in Ottawa this year, that you will obtain the grant we wish to be applied in the only useful way of educating our children that is, in a boarding school.\n\nWe have the honor to be, Honorable Sir,\n\nYour humble and thankful servants,\n\nChief of Squamish tribe\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6467, file 889-1, part 1)\nOTTAWA, 15th June, 1890\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant forwarding a communication addressed to you by the Chiefs of the Squamish tribe of Indians of British Columbia, in further reference to their application for the establishment of a boarding school on their reserve; and in reply I beg to say that it is regretted that nothing can be done in this direction at present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Rev. Paul Durieu of New Westminster,\nand myself, then his coadjutor, have applied to you for a grant in favor\nof an Indian Boarding School at Squamish Mission, opposite Vancouver. Our\napplications were refused every time.\n\nNow, as successor to the late Bishop Durieu, on the see of New-\nWestminster, and being animated with an equal desire to further the advan-\ncement of our natives, I feel it my duty to take up the matter where it was\nleft by him at his death.\n\nWith unwonted energy the late prelate had succeeded in erecting\na suitable building to accommodate fifty boarders and he was fortunate enough\nin securing a good teaching staff. We mentioned this to you when we\nlast asked for a grant. The Indian Supt., Mr. A.W. Vowell, and the agent for\nthe district, Mr. Devlin, can both testify to the good condition of the build-\ning and the excellent quality of the teaching staff. You may easily under-\nstand what a drain the outlay of over $5000 Dollars, required for the work,\nwas on the resources of a very poor diocese, like ours. Nevertheless, we did\nnot hesitate to make this appeal in the interest of the Indians, in the\nhope that the Government would come to our aid for at least the boarding\nof the children, who, after all, are the wards of the same Government.\n\nIn your refusals you gave us ground to expect a grant this year. The\nIndian chiefs themselves have again petitioned you, through the Hon. Mr.\nMaxwell, Member for Burrard, for a grant, and their letter must have\nreached you ere this.\nIn the correspondence which was held on the subject of this grant, two years ago, statistical data were referred to and reasons sufficient were adduced to convince you of the necessity of the grant asked for. Again, in the personal interviews it was my honor to have with you and with the Deputy Supt. Gen., at Ottawa, about the same time, both of you were satisfied that reasons more than sufficient existed that an allowance should be made, on the basis of Boarding Schools. Needless therefore that I should enter again into details in the matter.\n\nIt remains for me simply to renew the request made in preceding applications, namely, that you would place on the estimates for the coming year a grant for boarding fifty children, at the Indian Boarding School, at Squamish Mission, Burrard Inlet.\n\nIn the hope that this time my request, made in the name of your deserving wards, supported by the Hon. Member for Burrard, will be granted, and wishing you and the Government whom you represent in regard to the Indians, whose interests we shall never abandon, long life and prosperity,\n\nI am,\nHonorable Sir,\nYours very truly,\n\nA.

Smart,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYou are aware that in the course of the past two years the Rt. Rev. Bishop Durie of New Westminster and myself, then his coadjutor, have repeatedly applied to the Government for a grant for a Boarding School at Squamish. In November 1858, when we had appealed to the Honorable Minister of the Interior and Superintendent of Ind. Affairs, we informed the Honorable Gentleman as well as yourself that we had erected a fitting school house large enough for fifty boarders and that we had secured a good staff of teachers and all that we required them, and had good reason to expect that the Government would be pleased to give a sufficient grant to board the children.\n\nWe desire to remind you that we have experienced refusal after refusal. Pursuant, however, to a passage of your last answer Dec. 17, 1858, No. 122,057, wherein you stated that assistance could be given only after the expiration of last year, I come to renew the application formerly made for a grant for boarding fifty children at Squamish School.\n\nAs I succeed the Rt. Rev. Rt. Durie in the see of New Westminster, it behoves me to take up and continue his work among the Indians of the Province. I should be wanting in my duty did I not resume the matter of the Squamish School where he had left it at his death. I have therefore appealed again to the Honorable Minister, the Dept.

Moreover, in 1895 the Chiefs forwarded a petition in which was set forth that although the school had been promised 40 years ago they were still waiting for it, and it was asked that a \"convent or college should be provided where the children could be taught, fed and clothed.\" Mr. Reed acknowledged the petition in these words:\u2014 \"I beg to inform you that your petition is approved of and an item to provide for the school at that place will be inserted in the estimates which it is hoped will be passed by Parliament.\"\n\nOn the Chiefs expressing their pleasure at the reply, Mr. Reed wrote to Mr. Vowell to dispel the Indians of their impression as to the character of the proposed school, as he understood that it was a day school that was asked for.\n\nWhatever may have been Mr. Reed's impression, the Indians made a very clear request for a school in which their children could live, and his reply was such as to lead them to expect that their request would be entertained. No explanation which could be offered to these Indians would ever\u2014in the face of the former Deputy's action\u2014convince them that they were being dealt\ndealt with in good faith. But, apart from this consideration, my view is that there is a real necessity for a boarding school at Squamish; and I think that the per capita grant should be made. I understand that the Bishop of New Westminster has erected a school at the expense of the diocese, and that all that is asked for is a grant for the maintenance of the pupils. I observe that requests made at different times have been for a larger grant than is usually made to boarding schools in British Columbia, namely, $60 per capita. I do not think, however, that we can increase the grant unless we are prepared to deal with the whole question of the adequacy or inadequacy of grants to boarding schools in British Columbia.\n\nI would recommend that $3,000 be provided in the supplementary estimates for the current year, to enable the Department to pay a per capita grant of $60 for 50 pupils at the school.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6467, file 889-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nDear Mr. McKenna:\n\nI enclose File No. 122,050 with your memorandum of 6th inst., dealing with the Squamish Boarding School.

Although the Department is not favorably disposed to any change it would like to obtain reports on the working of this school from yourself, the Inspector and the Agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nSecretary\n\nA. W. Vowell, Esq.\nIndian Supt.\nVictoria, B.C.\n273366\nBritish Columbia Inspectorate,\nVancouver, B.C.,\nMarch 31, 1905.\n\nA.W. Vowell Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to report, as directed by you, regarding the petition sent to the Department by the Squamish Indians requesting the conversion of the Indian Boarding School at Squamish into an Industrial School.\n\nI visited the institution on Friday March 17, inspected the pupils and the premises very carefully, and found all clean bright, and in good condition. But for the following reasons I could not recommend the Department to grant the prayer of the petition:\n\nFirst\u2014I do not consider the situation suitable for an Industrial School. Not sufficient land, there being only 14 acres, and only part of that suitable for cultivation, and this is close to the City limits of North Vancouver, which is building up very fast, and an Industrial School is not best so close to a town. Then, as is the case with the Indians on the False Creek Reserve, I fear it will only be a short time before the town people of North Vancouver will agitate for the removal of these Indians from their town, thus to spend a large sum of money there would be unwise.\n\nSecondly\u2014The present buildings are not sufficient to carry on an Industrial School, and suitable out-buildings would be required.\n\nThirdly\u2014The Principal and Staff do not wish the change to be made, and the Indians presented the petition without their knowledge.\nThe parents, well to do, who have children in the Boarding-School, are supposed to occasionally supply shoes and stockings, and, once in a while, articles of clothing. The Indians would like to be relieved of this, and think that the enlarged grant for an Industrial School would release them from further help.\n\nThe Squamish Boarding School is doing excellent work, the children are small, and I would respectfully recommend that it be continued as a Boarding-School.\n\nShould the Department desire to establish an Industrial School in this Agency, St. Mary's Mission on the Fraser, is in my opinion the place. A Boarding School has been operated there, for the welfare of the Indians for many years; where there is sufficient good land, and very substantial buildings. The farm is well stocked with cattle, and well supplied with all kinds of farming implements.\n\nI have the honor to remain\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector.\nIndian Office, New Westminster, B.C.,\nMarch 16, 1905.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, No. C-4, 407, informing me that a petition has been received by the Department from the Squamish Indians for the conversion of the Squamish Mission Boarding School into an Industrial School and requesting me to furnish a report in regard to the working of the Institution.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that the work done by the Principal and her staff of assistants in educating and caring for the Indian children committed to the charge of the Institution, has been of a most satisfactory nature as a boarding School; but the parents are most anxious that the pupils should, in addition to the branches now taught, have an opportunity to learn such trades as are taught in Industrial Schools so that when they leave the school they will be in a position to make a good living for themselves and those who may be depending upon them. This, however, the management is unable to attempt without the additional grant allowed by the Department to Industrial schools, in fact complaint is frequently heard that the grant at present received from the Department is insufficient for the maintenance of the Institution as at present conducted without attempting anything in the way of an industrial school.\n\nThere are at present fifty-seven pupils (26 boys and 31 girls) at the School.\n\nA. W. Vowell, M.O.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nVictoria, B.C.\nThe Sisters in charge own about fourteen acres of land upon which the School is built, and the Squamish Mission reserve adjoining the School property contains thirty-eight acres; these two parcels might be considered too limited an acreage for a permanent industrial school; but, from the way the price of land in that locality is advancing, I am of the opinion that in a very few years this School property might be sold for a sum sufficient to build and equip an industrial school on one of the Squamish reserves at Squamish river where they would have plenty of good land, and in the mean time the available land at the present School might be cleared up and used for farming purposes.\n\nIf I may be permitted to make a suggestion in regard to the conversion of boarding into industrial schools, I would say that it appears to me that St. Joseph's Mission School would be the most suitable of any in the Agency for that purpose. They have plenty of farming land, good buildings, stock and farm implements, and pupils, after attending either the Squamish or Sechelt Schools for a few years, might be transferred to it, if they were desirous of acquiring trades, &c.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Office Victoria B.C.\n\nApril 5th 1905.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th of Feb. last, No. 122050, in reference to a petition that had been received from the Squamish Indians asking for the conversion of the boarding school at that place into an industrial school, &c.\n\nIn connection with the above I have the honor to forward herewith Mr. Indian Agent McDonald's report of the 16th ultimo, No. 420/4, and a report today received, from Revd. A.E. Green, Inspector of Indian Schools, B.C., expressing their respective views on the subject.\n\nOn the 14th ultimo, accompanied by Mr. Indian Agent McDonald, I visited the Squamish Indian Mission Boarding School where I found everything in perfect order, the dormitories sweet and clean, the pupils all looking healthy and satisfied with their condition, and reported to be giving very good satisfaction. There were at that time 31 girls and 26 boys being cared for and educated. During portion of the day I was present at their educational exercises, when their performances in the different branches being taught were creditable.\n\nIn my conversation with the Sister Superior I learned that the proposition in regard to the conversion\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6467, file 889-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nof the boarding school into an industrial school did not emanate from the management but from some of the Indian parents who have, from time to time, been in the habit of supplying extra clothes and boots, &c., for their children.\n\nThese Indians are pretty well off and like to see their children well dressed, &c., Some of them, it seems, object to so contribute, although they realize that the amount paid for the support of their children at the boarding school is not sufficient to admit of anything but the bare necessaries in the line of food and clothing being furnished by the Management.\n\nThey have been informed that the per capita allowance for Industrial Schools is much greater than that for Boarding Schools and think that if their children were pupils of the former they would not require contributions of clothing, be it ever so little, from their parents. There are some no doubt, who, taking a more broad minded view, would be pleased to have their children instructed in all the Industrial branches, &c., &c.\n\nThe present pupils are all very small, and for reasons given in Mr. Inspector Green's report I would not recommend that the proposed change be carried out.\n\nShould it, however, be contemplated to establish another Industrial School in the Agency I have no hesitation in endorsing the suggestions of the Agent and the Inspector that it be located at St. Mary's Mission which on account of facts stated is in every way suitable for the maintenance of such an establishment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSupt. of Indian Affairs,\n\nV. B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6467, file 389-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 22nd February last, in which you ask the Department to reconsider its decision in regard to the conversion of the Squamish boarding school into an Industrial school I beg to say that as you were advised by me on the 26th of that month full reports were asked for from the Superintendent, Agent and Inspector on this subject. These reports have now reached the Department and in the opinion of all three of these officers it is not deemed advisable to make the suggested change.\n\nThe school authorities did not ask to have this done. The idea of converting the boarding into an industrial school emanated from the Indian parents who wished to be relieved of all expense in connection with the care of their children at the Institution, as the per capita grant paid boarding schools barely sufficient for maintenance and management and the parents have from time to time been asked to contribute clothes, etc., for their children.\n\nIt is not the present policy of the Department, as you have been previously informed, to increase the number of industrial schools at present, and were it disposed to do so, Squamish would not be considered a suitable\n\nR.G.

But I am strongly of the opinion that not more than sixty children should reside in this building, those with the seven members of the Staff, are all that can be well accommodated. And as some of the children appear to be none too strong constitutionally, it is not well for them to be overcrowded. I consider it a mistake to have the white children in the school.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n(Sgd.) A.E. Green,\nInspector.\nOttawa, October 5, 1911.\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to draw Your Grace's attention to existing conditions at the Squamish Mission Indian Boarding School.\n\nOn August 2nd this institution was visited by the Departmental Inspector and an enrolment of 70 pupils was reported. The Department provides a grant for 50 pupils and an examination of the building made sometime ago shows that there is only accommodation for 46.\n\nAs Your Grace is aware under the new agreement by which the per capita grant was increased to $100.00 it is agreed that sufficient accommodation is to be provided for the number of children enrolled.\n\nThe Inspector reports that there are two half-breeds and ten whites in attendance at this school. It will be seen that the presence of these twelve children must be detrimental to the health of the Indian children in whose interests the school was primarily conducted. If the management desires to continue to receive increased per capita grant as provided for in the agreement it will be necessary for them to discharge at once these twelve pupils and the number of Indian pupils should also be reduced as soon as the matter can be satisfactorily arranged.\n\nMost Reverend Neil McNeill,\nArchbishop of Vancouver,\nVancouver, B.C.\narranged without any hardship to those concerned.

Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 5th in reference to the Squamish Mission Indian Board School and the Inspector's Report thereon of August 2nd I beg to say that I have visited the school and questioned the Superior in charge, and that there are at present no half-breed children in that school. The Superior declares that there are no white children sleeping in the dormitories of the Indian children, that there are not more than 50 Indians in those dormitories, which are three in number, that these three dormitories were approved by the Inspector for accommodation of 46 children, and that the white children\nare separated both in sleeping and in class work. A new school was created for white children on the Convent grounds some months ago on my recommendation, and the teacher in this school has nothing to do with the Indian children. This new school opened in September.\n\nI shall look into the matter again more carefully and if I find that the regulations are not observed I shall put matters right.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. McNeil\n\nOttawa\nOttawa, November 6, 1911.\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nI beg to thank Your Grace for your prompt reply to the Department's letter of the 5th instant regarding the attendance of whites and half-breeds at the Squamish Mission Boarding School.\n\nI have the honour to be, Most Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMost Rev.

Nous voulons que le gouvernement comprenne cela et nous fasse justice.\n\nNous esp\u00e9rons, mon Sir, que vous plaidiez notre cause au mieux que vous pouvez et que les pauvres soins de M.M. s'efforcent de faire obtenir un palais. Comme les autres, auront au moins de quoi agrandir leur pauvre petite maison, o\u00f9 elles sont actuellement entass\u00e9es comme de vraies sardines.\n\nC'est dans cet espoir et en vous promettant le concours de nos pri\u00e8res et celles de nos enfants que je me dis\n\nVotre tr\u00e8s humble serviteur,\n\nPour Aimee de Marie\nProvince\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6467, file 889-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nNorth Vancouver Indian Boarding School.\n\nSchool opened January 1879, in a small wood building put up by Indians under direction of late Bishop Laverie.\n\nSchool enlarged same year at the Sisters' expense. Four years later, 1883, a new wing was added again at the Sisters' expense too.\n\nAt the present time the building is too small to accommodate all the children of the tribe; though 50 enrolled, there are about 20 of age to be admitted that we cannot accept for want of room.\n\nFor these 25 years the Sisters have furnished lodging to an average of 50 children with the only help of the Grant per Child, which hardly covers the food expenses. Meanwhile the school has been burdened with heavy taxes and the Sisters receiving no salary have been obliged to work like slaves to make the two ends meet.\n\nIf the Government does not want to build a new school the Sisters wish the Department to pay them a salary with which they would be able to make the necessary improvements. Otherwise the staff cannot continue the work under such circumstances.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to thank you for the bonus of $60.00, you so kindly sent me, and which I received a few days ago. May God reward you for all that you do for the welfare of our school.\n\nAll the pupils, both day scholars and boarders are enjoying very good health; the former attend school quite regularly.

Feb. 4/22.\n(Original on 119704-1.)\n\nLastly, I am making an appeal in behalf of the\nIndian School in North Vancouver. The Department in all\nfairness should give them additional help or build them\na new school. At present the children and the Sisters\nare packed like the proverbial sardines. For lack of\nfunds they cannot better conditions. As at St. Mary's\n(Mission B.C.) their little garden and orchard are heavily\ntaxed. The per capita grant is barely enough to supply\nthe children and Sisters with food. It is only by\nappealing to the charity of other institutions that they\ncan make ends meet. These hardworking and self-sacrificing\nwomen are the servants of the Government; why should they\nbe forced to beg, in order to be able to carry on their\nnoble work?\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to advise the Department that I have received information from Sister Mary Amy, Principal of the Squamish Indian Residential School at North Vancouver that she is leaving for a holiday and has transmitted her charge to Sister M. Alix who is able to conduct the school and will act as Principal during her absence. The Rev. Sister in her letter trusts that there will be no objection to that proposition. The period of the vacation has not been mentioned.\n\nBoth Inspector Cairns and I have given our approval to this vacation subject to the concurrence of the Department as we are satisfied that Rev.

It is believed that the present building has been in use for nearly thirty years and is becoming more and more decayed, the foundations are caving in in places, and the building is regarded more or less as a fire trap. The present building is a wooden frame building.\n\nDuncan C.

He makes them play hard in the playground and work hard in the school rooms and the pupils seemed to be a cheerful crowd. I regret to say the Mission school at North Vancouver is the reverse and would like to see Brother David take hold of it for awhile.

Barry, dated May 21st and 22nd, 1931, on his inspection of the SQUAMISH INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on File 167-1-6.\n\nMilk:\n\nThis has to be bought. Children who have been ill and a few others get two cups of milk daily. The other children do not get milk to drink.\n\nI consider that far more milk should be bought, and at least one cup given to each child daily in addition to the milk used in the other foods. In addition, the children should in my opinion get plenty of eggs, when they are at low prices as at present. They are now less than 20\u00a2 per dozen.\nOttawa, June 25, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector G. H. Barry, in a report on his inspection in May, last, of the Squamish Indian Residential School, draws attention to the milk being furnished for the use of the pupils. He states that this has to be bought and that the children who have been ill and a few others get two cups of milk daily, while other children do not get milk to drink.\n\nI have to request that you will take this matter up with the school authorities and impress upon them the necessity of obtaining an adequate supply of milk, as this is a most important item of the pupils' daily diet. The Inspector also recommends that more eggs be supplied for the pupils' use. You might also discuss this matter with the school authorities. Please furnish a report regarding the arrangements that will be made for a more adequate supply of milk and also to furnish the pupils with eggs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n519 Metropolitan Bldg.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 25th ultimo Mr. Inspector G.H. Barry's report that pupils of the Squamish Residential School need more milk and eggs, had Mr. Barry enquired further he might have found that the food given to the pupils is inadequate in other ways also.\n\nI have written you today in this matter in reply to your letter of the 14th inst., file 167 - 1 - 3 and will await a reply thereto before taking it up with the Reverend Principal.\n\nI have the honour\n\nto be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 14th inst. advising me that the pupils of Squamish Residential School had been provided for at $5 and the per capita grant raised to $70.00.\n\nI have hesitated to make any unpleasant representations regarding this School but this increase in grant gives me the opportunity of pointing out that the pupils are insufficiently fed, and respectfully suggest that any increase is contingent upon a great improvement in this respect.\n\nIt is difficult to keep a close check on the food supply as officials are courteously but none the less effectually prevented from any close investigation and one is naturally desirous of avoiding any unpleasantness with the reverend principal who has been in charge so long.\n\nThe only meal I have actually seen was one at mid-day which consisted of a piece of bread and a raw carrot. It may have been a fast day, and I have not since been successful in actually seeing a meal on the table.\n\nMr. William of Squamish Reserve advised me that he sent his son to the school and in one month lost ten pounds in weight and stated that during this time was not given a bath. The Chief is quite reliable but the boy may have exaggerated about the lack of a bath.\n\nAndrew Paulll states that children whose parents live on Mission Reserve run home at recess to get food. He asked me to report on this matter but he exaggerates everything so much that he defeats his own object. If even a tenth of his statements were correct, the situation needs remedying.\n\nMiss Gerry, travelling nurse has the same difficulty as I have in investigating anything at the School and she reports that the food supply is unsatisfactory.\n\nMr. G. Barry, Inspector of Schools, who recently made his first visit to Squamish School, reported that the children should have more milk and eggs so evidently the appearance of the children prompted this report as I did not see him before he visited the School.\n\nIf the Principal has not already been advised of the increase in grant I respectfully suggest that she be advised that it is conditional upon her giving Miss Gerry full authority and co-operation in examining the food at any time. If there is nothing to be remedied, the Principal can have no objection.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n(F.J.C.Ball)\nIndian Agent\n\nRussell T. Ferrier Esq.,\nSupt.of Indian Education\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 30, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 2491 of the 20th instant, with reference to the Squamish Indian Residential School. Please inform the Sister Superior that the increases in pupilage and in per capita grant are entirely contingent upon a constant sufficient supply of nourishing food for the pupils. You may also inform her it is understood that the Department's officers must have full cooperation at all times in determining what food is being supplied.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n819 Metropolitan Bldg.,\nVancouver, B. C.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to advise that the Squamish Residential School has its full complement of pupils and there are ten others, mostly orphans, who should be placed in the School if accommodation can be found for them. The Reverend Principal states that by placing the Sisters in another building on the property, room could be made for at least ten pupils in the rooms occupied by the Sisters at present. If the Department would increase the grant to include these pupils, it would take care of a number of children who have been left without their parents' protection. I understand that it has been suggested in other Agencies that those children who come from good homes be returned to them to make room for such cases as this, but it would be impossible to find any homes in this Agency where the children could be returned without detriment. The same over-crowded condition exists in the other Residential School in this Agency at Sechelt.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(F.J.C.Ball),\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 3, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your 2665 of the 28th ultimo, recommending an increase in the pupilage at the Squamish Residential School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, owing to lack of funds, it is regretted that the increase requested cannot be provided.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n319 Metropolitan Bldg.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant advising me that the pupilage of Squamish Residential School could not be increased as requested to sixty.\n\nI have duly received your advice of July 14th, File 167-1-3, instructing me that the pupilage had been raised to 55 and the per capita grant to $170.00. The School authorities have been so advised and also that it was contingent upon an improvement in the food supply. I may say that the Principal, the Reverend Sister Mary Amy, is absent on extended leave and the acting principal is co-operating whole-heartedly in this matter. The milk and egg supply have been doubled and meat is now given at least once and sometimes twice a day. Vegetables and fruit have also been increased and if the present standard is maintained, the children will be well fed. The Principal advises me that she is distinctly disappointed that the pupilage is not raised to sixty and they have re-arranged class rooms and sleeping accommodation so that a number of orphans can be accommodated. The Principal says that when the Deputy Minister visited the school last, they were advised that if room could be found for sixty pupils, the grant would be raised accordingly. I do not know when this took place, certainly not since I have been agent here so I am only repeating the Principal's statement.\n\nHowever, if your decision could possibly be re-considered in view of the number of applicants awaiting admission and the pupilage raised to 60, it would take care of some deserving cases. Of course there are always four or five at school who do not show on the quarterly returns and for whom no application for admission is made. There are always a few cases which they feel compelled to accept without extra payment.\n\nAs was to be expected, School Inspector Mr. G.H. Barry, advised the Principal that bathing facilities were inadequate and to ask for further accommodation. There is only one bath for about thirty boys and the Principal has applied for another bath for the boys. There are two baths for the girls. Personally I consider three shower baths would be more suitable in every way and would not take up any more room than one bath. I mention this as the Principal is writing you direct in the matter.\n\nE/HM.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\n\n(F.J.C.Ball)\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 17, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, in further reference to the request for an increase in the pupilage at the Squamish Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, as our Appropriation for Indian Education was considerably reduced this fiscal year, it is regretted that the Department will be unable to allow a grant for any pupilage in excess of 55, the number which you were informed in official letter of July 14th, last, would be allowed as from April 1st, last.\n\nIt is noted that there has been a decided improvement in the type and quantity of food supplied the pupils and that the children are now being well fed.\n\nIt is noted that the Principal will take up the matter of the providing of more bathing facilities for the pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nSecretary.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n519 Metropolitan Bldg.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nSquamish Residential School,\nNorth Vancouver, B.C.,\nMarch 9th, 1933.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nUp to the present time we have been receiving a grant for 55 pupils whilst we had actually 57 enrolled, and 60 present all the time.\n\nAccording to recent arrangements following the completion of a home for the Sisters, we have now ample room to accommodate more boarders. I therefore beg the Department to raise the number from 55 to 70.\n\nKindly forward my request to the Department, and as soon as I know the answer I will make the alterations that will be needed for admission of new boarders.\n\nHoping to hear of a favorable answer soon, I remain, dear Sir,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n(Sgd.) Sister Mary Amy,\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. F.J.C. Ball,\nIndian Agent,\nRogers Bldg., Vancouver.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to enclose herewith copy of a letter received from the Principal of the Squamish Residential School, North Vancouver, which is self-explanatory.\n\nThe Sisters have erected a fine building near the school where except for the usual night staff on duty, they will reside, thus leaving space in the school which has been taken up by living quarters. The new building is advertised to have cost $55,000.00 and is much larger than the school itself.\n\nI realize the necessity of conserving funds in each department, and on this account am forwarding the request without recommendation. The school building is old, and the greatest care has to be exercised at all times to prevent fire.\n\nThe standard of education here has presumably been reported upon favourably by the school inspector but in my opinion it is not much use for boys over ten years to attend a school managed by Sisters. This is no reflection on the Squamish School Sisters who are all earnest, hardworking ladies, but the boys turned out from the school are undisciplined and generally of little account afterwards. They do pretty much as they please at school and need the firmer hand of male control. I think the Sisters realize this too, although I have never discussed the matter with them.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(F.J.C.Ball)\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnclosure:-\n\nB/HM.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 23, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, enclosing copy of a communication which you received from the Principal of the Squamish Indian Residential School requesting grant for an increase in pupilage.\n\nIn reply I have to say that we will have no funds during the coming fiscal year to provide for an increased number of pupils at this school. I, therefore, regret that it will not be possible to comply with the Reverend Sister's request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n203-6 Rogers Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF MR. INSPECTOR BARRY ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE SQUAMISH INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL ON MARCH 23 and 24, 1933.\n\nGeneral: Per Capita Grant is at present being drawn for 55 children. I have recommended in an earlier part of this report several changes in partitions in classrooms and dormitories. These should be undertaken in any case; but should they be completed there will be available accommodation in the way of sleeping and classroom space for an additional 15 children.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Missionary in North Vancouver has had a long talk to me about the state of things on the Indian Reserve there. He informs me that there are more than sufficient children to fill this school if so increased in accommodation. I wish particularly to recommend that the number of pupils authorized to draw Per Capita Grant here be increased to a total of 70. This will take care of those who should be resident in the school, and make it possible for the Church to carry on this school without loss, while at the same time feeding the children in a proper manner. It must be remembered that there are no cows here and milk as well as many of the other foods must be purchased.\n\nMS. G. C. PERRY, INDIAN COMMISSIONER FOR B.C., IN FORWARDING MR. INSPECTOR BARRY'S REPORT, COMMENTS AS FOLLOWS:\n\nIncreased per Capita and Pupilage:\n\nFor the reasons above mentioned, and in view of the present state of the residential school building, with its inadequate accommodation, it is considered that the suggestion to increase the pupilage of this school is involved more or less in and should be approached in connection with the question of a more adequate building as petitioned for by the Indians. The building has often been referred to as a \"death-trap\" and \"fire-trap\" and what not? Why increase the number of resident pupils under these conditions? To patch up this old building and to carry out the suggestions of the resident Missionary, laudable as they may seem, would be but a make-shift, resulting in less efficiency and larger expense.\nOttawa, May 8, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to a per capita grant for an increased pupilage at the Squamish Indian Residential School, referred to in report on your inspection of this school in March, last, I have to say that, owing to our Appropriation for the current fiscal year being considerably reduced, it is not possible to provide any increase in pupilage at residential schools or to carry out any extensive repairs at residential or day schools. The various matters referred to in your report on the Squamish Residential School have been noted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. H. Barry, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nP.O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\nSeptember 7th, 1933.\n\nDear Mr. Ball,-\n\nHaving inspected the Squamish Indian Residential School, I believe that, owing to its bad condition, the building should be abandoned. My proposal would be to close the school at the end of the academic year, viz., about June 30th, 1934.\n\nPlease let me have your views on this matter, stating if you consider any new day schools would be required to provide educational facilities for the children who have been attending the residential school. If you consider one or two day schools would be necessary, you should suggest where they should be located and the approximate cost of erecting them.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nHAROLD W. MCGILL\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n203-6 Rogers Bldg.,\nVancouver, B. C.\nSeptember 7th, 1933.\n\nDear Mr. Perry,\n\nI enclose, for your information, a copy of a letter which is being directed to Mr. Indian Agent Ball.\n\nI would appreciate receiving any comments that you wish to make regarding the proposed closing of the Squamish Indian Residential School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nHAROLD W. MCGLL\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nEnc. 1.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nVictoria, B. C.\nOttawa, October 2nd, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI desire to draw your attention to the Deputy Superintendent General's letter of the 7th ultimo, to which no reply has yet been received. The Department would appreciate your reporting at once with regard to the suggestion that the Squamish Residential School be closed at the end of the current academic year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. J. C. Ball Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n205-6 Rogers Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 7th instant with reference to abandoning the Squamish Indian Residential School.\n\nA full report in this matter will be forwarded after careful consideration from all angles, especially as to future arrangements for the pupils who are in residence there at present. This refers of course to those who either have no homes or whose parents are unfitted to take care of their children or are living in remote reserves.\n\nThe suggestion regarding day schools will also be investigated fully before the report is forwarded.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(F.J.C.Ball)\nIndian Agent.\n\nDr. H.W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated September 7th, instant, covering copy of your letter of the same date, No.167-1-1, addressed by you to Mr. F.J.C. Ball, Indian Agent at Vancouver, in regard to the proposal to close the Squamish Indian Residential School at North Vancouver.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that reply to your letter has been deferred for a short time pending the inspection of the school by the District Inspector of Indian Schools for British Columbia, as I had understood from Inspector Barry that he would be making his regular inspection and I preferred to await the result of his observations and consider them before replying to your letter.\n\nI now have the honor to transmit herewith Inspector Barry's letter of September 28th, instant, together with his report, the contents of which will, it is thought, enable you to decide whether or not it would be agreeable to the Department that the Church authorities should be approached with a view to ascertaining on what terms their new building could be acquired, on the one hand and, on the other hand, what arrangements could best be suggested with respect to the termination of the residential school and the adoption of a day school system, in the event of the Department abiding by its decision to discontinue the use of the old building, or being unable to provide a modern residential school building of its own.\n\nFrom my own experience as Indian Agent for seven years in the Vancouver Agency I believe that Inspector Barry has stated the position very fairly and sincerely. I gathered, however, from our recent conversation during your trip to Victoria that a change of educational policy was being contemplated by the Department in which the Indian Day School system would probably in the future be emphasized in preference to the expenditure of heavier expenditures on residential school maintenance and operation. It is not quite clear to me why the proposal to close the Squamish Residential School is related in any way to the policy referred to or if such closure is wholly on account of the reported condition of the old building. As the latter appears to be the case, it is considered that the reshingling and improvements to the old building which have been recently done as recited by the Inspector would seem to justify the Department at least in permitting the reverend Sisters to carry on at the old building for a sufficiently suitable time in which to enjoy the benefit of these improvements.\n\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI can...\nI can say without hesitation that during my tenure of office at Vancouver I was greatly pleased with the excellent service given at this school. The general progress, the homelike atmosphere, the kindly treatment of the children, the generally carefree demeanour of the pupils as well as the absence of trouble such as truancy or lack of discipline were marked features of this institution. The Inspector has found similar conditions there and has reported on them. For these reasons I feel quite reluctant to recommend any drastic changes that would possibly leave the Sisters beyond the pale of some form of recompense by way of ensuring the continuity of their school work if they are disposed to carry on under the Department's policies and direction.\n\nI shall be pleased to discuss the situation fully with Mr. Agent Ball and with the Sisters at North Vancouver, but before doing so I would like to have, if possible, the reaction of the Department to Inspector Barry's report and suggestions, so that the matter might be approached from the Department's viewpoint.\n\nThe matter of erecting one or two Indian day schools would, in my opinion, have to be carefully approached, inasmuch as it would involve a survey of the children who attend the residential school and of the conditions under which they would have to be cared for if the residential school were closed, and such day schools established in its stead.\n\nWhile Inspector Barry and I are in favor of Indian day schools being placed in certain reserves under favorable conditions, it should be pointed out that the nearness of the Squamish reserves to the Cities of North Vancouver and Greater Vancouver makes it necessary to safeguard the pupils by giving them the best possible supervision and care, and up to now the residential school has afforded this protection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.

This latter building has been lately repaired and reroofed, and is I believe in good structural condition for some years to come.\n\nI am quite unable to recommend the erection of one or more Day Schools in the Vancouver Agency, as such schools would not be able to supply the peculiar needs of the children at present attending the Residential School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGerald H.

The work there undertaken was never satisfactory, and has been removed to make the present Primary Room. This room has also been freshly decorated inside, has six large windows, a Blackboard of about 26 x 18 feet (a careful tally made morning and afternoon) and is itself about 38 feet by 40 feet.\n\nThe large room used by the Primary Children last year, in the Auditorium Building is now used by the Senior Grades, and is a great improvement on the small room at the head of the stairs used by these grades last year. The Intermediate Grades are in the same room as last year.\n\nThese changes have solved the various difficulties with regard to classroom accommodation mentioned in my last report.\n\nThe Classroom Registers are kept with very great care.\n\nGENERAL\n\n(Under this heading, the Inspector should report upon the classroom activity generally and offer any suggestions for improvement.)\n\nSenior Room: Teacher Sister M. Hieronymie. 20 Single Desks.\n\nGrades 5, 6, 7, & 8. See Classification by Grades.\n\nReading: Grades 7 and 8 are working together on a combined course as outlined in the Programme of Studies for B.C. Grades 5 & 6 are also combined for a Reading Programme in which they are starting Canadian Reader Book 5. They will also work through the Reading Exercise Work Book for Grades 5 & 6, and read Canadian Corona Reader Book 2 later in the year.\n\nArithmetic: The teacher is using Stone's Advanced Arithmetic with Grades 7 and 8 as she has no other suitable book. She is working through Sheffield and Brown's Book 2 Arithmetic with Grades 5 and 6.\n\nThe present stage of knowledge of the children in this subject was tested with the All-Canada Test.\n\nGrade 8 made a Mid Score of 29, the Norm being 37.\n\nGrade 7 made a Mid Score of 23, the Norm being 32.\n\nArt: Good work was done towards the end of last term.\n\nLanguage and Nature: I have asked that particular attention be given to the exercises in the various Work Books.\n\nGeneral: This inspection being for special purposes and the children being only just back from the vacation, I did not give any tests. Two out of the three in last year's Entrance of Grade 8 Class passed. They are now at home. The teacher's control is very good. There are no children in this year's Entrance Class.\n\nThis is a very satisfactory room, the children are bright and the work being done is of a very high order; it is well up to Provincial Standards.\nIntermediate Room: Teacher: Sister M. Sacred Heart. 16 Single & 16 Double Desks.\n\nGrades: 2, 3, and 4. See Classification by Grades.\n\nReading: Grade 4 are reading from Canadian Reader Book 4 at present; but will later read from Corona Reader Book 2, and will use the Reading Exercise Work Books. Grade 3 are at present using the Third Canadian Reader; but will later use the Corona Reader Book 2, and Reading Exercise Work Books. Grade 2 are reading from the Corona Reader Book 1.\n\nArithmetic: Grade 4 are starting Long Division. They know the Multiplication Tables to that of 15's. Grade 3 are working Short Problems of Multiplication and Division on the Tables to that of 15's. Grade 2 are working Addition and Subtraction.\n\nLanguage: Grades 3 and 4 are working the exercises in the English Usage and Composition Books.\n\nNature: Grades 3 and 4 are working from the Nature Exercise Book 1.\n\nSinging: These Grades are taught to sing.\n\nGeography: New Poster Work should be started, when the Department has provided the necessary material. I suggested Indian and Swiss Posters to be made in the journey around the World.\n\nArt: Cream and Grey MANILLA paper is required and has I understand been requisitioned for but has not been sent. This was asked for as the children can use the cheapest paper, Manilla, better than the more expensive papers. The Sisters complain of a difficulty in obtaining these necessary supplies from the Department.\n\nGeneral: This is a very good group. The teacher has very good control; but is a little old fashioned in her method of handling the class.\n\nPrimary Room: Teacher Sister M. Catherine. 35 Single Desks.\n\nGrades 1A and 1B\n\nReading: Reading has just been started with the Beginners of Grade 1B. They know about 25 words. They are using a very poor Primer called Two Little Indians, supplied by the Department. I have used white boards to teach with such poor material without other means, and the teacher is using Blackboard methods which I demonstrated to her last year. Grade 1A are reading the Corona Primer very well indeed and will finish Primer 2 by the end of December. Some other Readers will then be necessary; but the Department does not seem to supply the books I state are necessary, so I do not know just what to do. This class should read six or seven short First Readers during the year. AND THIS IS A MINIMUM. Dr. Gates suggests between 15 and 30 during the last few months in Grade 1.\n\nNumber Work: Grade 1B are reading and writing the numbers to 12. Grade 1A are working the Combinations and Separations to 10. The Department has supplied books called Individual Arithmetic Books A & B, for this Room; but these books are nearly useless, as the work is not taken up in the recognized manner, the Combinations being quite separated from the Separations instead of being linked with them just as closely as is possible.\n\nWriting: The Writing Manuals supplied by the Department are not suitable for B.C.Schools, or for that matter for any Primary Classes. We have excellent Grade 1 Manuals produced here in Vancouver, the Revised Maclean of which Book 1 is suitable for the children in this room.\nPrimary Room (Continued)\n\nGeneral: Sister M. Catherine is doing very good work with these children. I have suggested that she use the Beacon Charts as well as teach from the Blackboard by the \"Look and Say\" method.

The parents of some of the children in the Residential School do not reside all the time on the local Indian Reserve.\nBuildings: The school buildings as previously reported are very old. The foundations have however been put in fair shape by the staff of the school. This was reported last March.\n\nThe roof reported by me as in a very poor state of repair has now been reshingled at the expense of the Sisters. This is being finished in a few days. It was about half completed when I visited the school. The men working on the building report that the school was built in a very strong manner. This means that when the new roof is finished the school will be from a structural point of view as good for a number of years to come.\n\nOne of the partitions placed in the old building by order of the Indian Agent, and recommended for removal in my last report, has been so removed. A good Primary Classroom has thus been made available as this is being used by Sister M. Catherine, as mentioned above, for the Beginners and Grade 1 children. The room has a good set of blackboards, is well lighted, and has been painted inside.\n\nA new bath and toilet should be constructed on the Boys' side of the school. This was gone into in my last report.\n\nThe new roof is costing the Sisters something over $210.00\n\nManual Training:\n\nMr. C. J. Merrick, the late Manual Training Instructor of the North Vancouver Schools, has been appointed as Instructor here in the place of Mr. R.H. Shockey. Reference is requested to my report under this heading made after my inspection of May 23rd and 24th of this year.\n\nThe class consists of 7 Juniors who work from 1 to 2.30 P.M. and of 10 Seniors who work from 2.30 to 5 P.M. on Fridays.\n\nThe new Instructor has rearranged the room, which is about 50 feet by 40 feet and contains 12 large benches, so that he can demonstrate to the pupils and all can see him. The Blackboard is now properly located, and is of sufficient size. A good series of Demonstration models prepared by the Instructor is on view.\n\nI have gone into the matter of the course to be followed with Mr. Merrick, and have also had conferences with the Director of Technical Instruction for this Province, Mr. John Kyle, who has helped us with his advice on many occasions. It is hoped that Mr. Merrick will be able to make a success of this work.\n\nThe tools are being handed over to his care in not better than \"Fair\" condition. As a matter of fact, I was sorry to find that the tools were in such a poor state. The last instructor does not appear to have looked after them lately. These tools will now be put into as good a condition as possible, considering their present state.\n\nThe following are now required for this Class:-\n\n| Item | Quantity |\n|------|----------|\n| 2 only 6 inch Screw Drivers | 1 Quart Walnut Stain |\n| 1 Pair 6 inch Pliers (Bernard) | 1 Quart Light Oak Stain |\n| 2 Gallons Boiled Oil | 1 Quart Dark Oak Stain |\n| 1 Gallon Light Mineral Oil | 2 Gallons Turpentine |\n| 1 Oil Stone Mill White (Fine) Washite | |\n| 5 Pounds Glue Hard, (Le Pages) | 3 Tins Number 32 |\n| Paints | 1 Quart White (Glossy), 1 Pint Red, 1 Pint Brown. |\n| Nails:- | 2 Pounds 1 inch finishing. 5 Pounds 1\u00bd inch finishing. |\n| | 2 Pounds 2 inch finishing. 5 Pounds 2 inch finishing. |\n| | 2 Pounds 1 inch finishing. 3 Pounds 2\u00bd inch finishing. |\n| 1 Dozen Saw Files 5\u00bd inch Extra Slim Taper. | |\n| 1 Dozen File Handles for 10 inch Files. | |\n| Lumber:- | 500 feet White Pine; 200 feet of assorted Oak, Maple, and Satin Walnut. |\n\nA Yale Lock is required for the door of the Manual Training Shop.\nVocational Training: The girls continue to receive instruction in Cooking, Mending, Darning, Sewing, etc., as reported previously. The boys work in the garden, and do other work about the school. As reported previously, three Singer Sewing Machines are in use, and another is needed when there are funds for such a purpose.\n\nHealth: There is nothing further to report under this heading at the present time. The health of the children has been good.\n\nLaundry: There is a definite lack of drying accommodation at this school; but I am not prepared to make a recommendation for the expenditure of funds on this at the present time. The Sisters have provided a new electric washing machine since my last report. There are twelve old and ten new tubs in use for the washing of the clothes.\n\nFire Protection:\n\nWith reference to my last report under this head, I may say that I am informed by the Matron that the Fire Chief on one of his visits to the school told the Sisters that the Fire Buckets were not of much or any use. They have therefore been discarded. I should like to see these buckets kept filled with water, and placed in suitable positions about the building. There are eight Soda Type Extinguishers, which the Fire Chief has tested I believe. They were refilled in March last by the Janitor. Fire Drills are held regularly. The Fire Chief inspects about once a month.\n\nDormitories: The Dormitories are all very neat and perfectly clean. A new small dormitory for six of the little girls has been fitted up. The dormitory used by the little boys is rather crowded, there being 12 beds (two of which are not in use at the present time) and a Sisters bed in a room of about 25 feet by 20 feet and of average height of perhaps 10 feet. I do not think that more than the ten being used by the boys at present should be left here, the other two being moved to the other boys' dormitory, even if that room is fairly full now.\n\nDining Rooms: I still consider that the children are being fed in a very satisfactory manner, and would refer the Department to previous reports if any information is required at the present time about the food. I am informed that my advice about more milk has been acted on, and that the children receive at least a cup of milk each day.\n\nFarming: There are about three acres of garden and orchard, which is very well cared for by the gardener, and the boys. Fruits and vegetables of all sorts are grown and used by the children in the school.\n\nClothing: The children are well dressed in suitable clothes. These children are as well dressed, and probably better dressed, than is the case in any other Indian school in B.C.\n\nKitchen: This is clean. There is nothing to add to previous reports.\n\nWater Supply: The water supply is abundant, and is of first rate quality as it is supplied from the North Vancouver City mains. The pressure is of course good.\n\nLight: The lighting is by electricity supplied from the North Vancouver City mains.\n\nHeating: The three hot air furnaces in the basement supply sufficient heat to the different parts of the old building. The Auditorium Building is heated by a large wood burning heater.\nFinancial Statement:\n\nPeriod March 31st 1932 to April 1st 1933.\n\nReceipts:\nContributed by Government $8210.96\nFrom other sources 705.00\n\nTotal Receipts: $9015.96 $9015.96\n\nExpenditure:\nSalaries $2250.00\nExtra Labour 32.90\nFood 2383.14\nClothing 936.95\nFuel and Light 574.76\nBuildings & Repairs 275.20\nEquipment & Furniture 231.32\nFarm & Garden 168.16\nTransport & Travelling 742.32\nMiscellaneous 283.16\n\nTotal Expenditure $9015.96 $9015.96\n\nPeriod April 1st 1933 to June 30th 1933.\n\nReceipts:\nGovernment Per Capita Grant $2189.38\n\nTotal Receipts $2189.38 $2189.38\n\nExpenditure:\nSalaries $570.00\nClothing 275.08\nFood 926.67\nFuel & Light 75.23\nBuildings & Repairs 35.40\nHouse Equipment 45.52\nFarm & Garden 577.93\nTravelling Expenses 141.32\nMiscellaneous 69.06\n\nTotal Expenditure $2189.38 $2189.38\n\nGeneral:\nPer Capita Grant is at present being drawn for up to 55 children. I wish to again refer the Department to the recommendations contained in my last report. All the milk and a large quantity of the foodstuffs have to be purchased. Should it be decided to move any of the Indian parents to other parts of the Indian Reserves additional children will probably have to be provided for at this Residential School. I should certainly like to see the numbers entitled to draw Per Capita at this school increased to 70 as reported in my previous report on the school. The school is being conducted in a very satisfactory manner indeed by the Sisters of the Child Jesus. These Sisters have made every effort to follow my suggestions for the better administration of the school. I have never been able to accept the views held by the local Indian Agent with regard to this school. He has told me that he considers that amongst others the Squamish Indian Residential School should be closed. Why I am quite unable to imagine, as it is one of the best small Indian Residential Schools in this Province. I am informed by the Assistant Indian Commissioner that the Department is considering closing this school as from the end of June 1934, and have therefore the following recommendation to make for the information of the Department.\nGeneral Recommendation:\n\nThough the old school building here is not very well arranged for a school, the newly shingled roof, and the newly arranged Primary Classroom, make it possible to carry on the school in these buildings for a number of years still. The foundations have been repaired as reported at various times and the school is kept in a perfectly sanitary and neat state. The Manual Training and Senior Grades are accommodated in the Auditorium Building, which belongs, I understand, to the Indians. The original building of this school was constructed in a solid manner, and I have every reason to believe that it will last another eight or ten years at least.\n\nThe question arises as to what should be done with the children should the Department close the present Residential School. In my opinion the provision of a three room Day School, or of several Day Schools, would in no way take the place of the present Residential School. Six of the children come from the Musqueam Indian Reserve, Point Grey, and there are a number of Indians and children from homes where they can not be properly looked after, at present in this school. The provision of suitable Day Schools is in my opinion quite out of the question, as it would take a three room school in North Vancouver, and probably two other one room schools to absorb the children, and then the orphans, etc., would not be accommodated.\n\nI wish to strongly recommend that the school be continued as at present till the Department finds itself in a position to build a new school for these Indian children, such school to be a modern Residential School to accommodate about 100 children.\n\nIf the Department will not consider such a course as that outlined in the last paragraph, I would recommend that negotiations be entered into with the Sisters of the Child Jesus, and the Roman Catholic Church to take over for the time being the new building just completed on a site adjoining the old school. This new building is of cement and brick veneer construction, and has been completed this year at a cost of about $50,000.00. A photograph of this building which has been designed as a PRIVATE SCHOOL and CONVENT is attached for information. I have inspected the whole of this new building on two separate occasions and consider that there would be plenty of room for sixty children. There are two classrooms divided by folding doors, two large dormitories, a smaller dormitory and a number of small rooms for either senior children or the Sisters. There is a very fine set of administration offices, and the usual dining rooms and kitchens, etc. The whole building is of modern design, and splendidly fitted for a School, for which of course it was designed. I am of the opinion that very satisfactory arrangements might be made with the Sisters to lease this building for the time being, till a new Indian Residential School be erected.\n\nI am quite unable to recommend the expenditure of public funds on the construction of one or more Day Schools at the present time in this locality. I do wish to strongly recommend the taking over of the new building from the Sisters of the Child Jesus on terms satisfactory to them and the Department.\nOctober 7, 1933.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nI discussed letter from Mr. Perry with D.

I decided to await further instructions from the Department in regard to this matter inasmuch as you were away when Inspector Barry made his official inspection in accordance with an itinerary which he found it necessary to follow. When I hear from the Department on the subjects which I have written about I shall be in a better position to discuss the matter both with yourself as well as with the school authorities, if this course would be found necessary. There would be no objection to your making report of your views to the Department in the meantime if you so desire. I hope, however, that we shall be able to reach an amicable solution in due course.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) C.C.Perry,\n\nP/AC. Asst.Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nF.J.C.Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n203-6 Rogers Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\n203-6 Rogers Bldg.,\nVancouver, B.C.,\nNovember 3, 1933.\n\nSr.:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of September 7th last requesting a report on the Squamish Reserve School building.\n\nThis building has two class rooms 27'x30' and 21'x30' respectively, a kitchen, four dormitories, two dining-rooms for the children and one dining-room for the priest on Mission Reserve who boards at the School. There are also a chapel and several other small rooms used for reception, sewing, office, etc.\n\nIt is heated by three furnaces, two are in good condition, one will need renewing shortly. A new furnace was installed last Winter.\n\nThe building is on city light, water and sewage systems.\n\nThe Sister of Instruction of the Child Jesus own the building and have charge of the school, the Reverend Mother Amy being principal since the School was built.\n\nIt was built in 1898 and opened in 1899. There are three bath-rooms which are decidedly inadequate. There are four wooden fire-escapes, two being ladders. It is of frame construction, is in poor condition and foundations are unsound. The building was re-shingled last month, the cost being paid from the grant. There are fifty-eight children in residence, evenly divided between boys and girls, and ranging in age from six to sixteen. There is also a day school, the class room being in the Auditorium building built four or five years ago from Squamish Band funds. This is detached from the main building as are also the laundry and living quarters of the Sisters.\n\nOf the fifty-eight children boarding at the School, forty have one or both parents living on the Reserves at North Vancouver\u2014Mission, Capilano or Burrard, six are from Musqueam Reserve, six from distant reserves and six are orphans or have been abandoned by their mothers. Of the forty who have parents on the reserves adjacent to the school, about one-half of them have no mother to take care of them either because of death, or living with another man than her husband, or in the insane asylum, or too sick. These children have fathers living on the Reserve.\n\nIf the residential school is closed, the auditorium referred to above would be large enough to take care of all the present pupils as day scholars, certain alterations....\n\nHarold W. McGill, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nalterations, not extensive, would be necessary and presumably the permission of the Squamish Band would have to be obtained. The space in this building is at present wasted to a large extent. The manual training class use one room which is more than twice as large as necessary and other rooms are seldom used at all.\n\nThe Musqueam Indians have no school. There are twenty-four children of school age in this Band, about half of them being scattered among various schools. A small day school would take care of these.\n\nIf the neglected, orphaned or otherwise uncared for children of Squamish Residential School could be accommodated elsewhere, the situation might be met by a small school being built and equipped on Musqueam Reserve, and the auditorium used as a day school, then the present residential building could be abandoned. If the auditorium can not be used, a new day school building could be erected for $5,000.00. The Musqueam School would cost approximately $1,500.00.\n\nThe two day schools would need at least three teachers, one of them at Musqueam, the other two at Mission No.1. This would mean that the parent or parents would have to support about forty of the children at present in residence at the school.\n\nI enclose a copy of Mr. Perry's letter on the subject.\n\nI have heard nothing from Mr. Perry since that letter and now forward the report as per your instructions.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEnclosure:-\n\n(F.J.C.Ball).\nIndian Agent.\n\nB/HM.\nOttawa, November 13, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your 15/31303 of September 29th, last, with reference to the proposal to close the Squamish Indian Residential School. After consideration of your report and that of Mr. Agent Ball, which has been received recently, the Department has decided that this school may continue in operation for the present. Even with the addition of one or more day schools to replace this institution, it would be difficult to provide educational facilities for a number of the pupils who are stated to be orphans. It is noted, from your letter, that excellent service is given at this school by the Rev. Sisters. In view of the reports referred to above, the Department will approve of the continuing of the Squamish Indian Residential School in operation for the present, and no further action need be taken in the matter. Mr. Agent Ball is being informed accordingly.\n\nFurther, the Department is not prepared, at the present time, to consider the taking over of the new building owned by the Sisters of the Child Jesus, as suggested by Mr. Inspector Barry.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B. C.\nOttawa, November 13, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, furnishing a report with reference to the closing of the Squamish Indian Residential School at the end of the present academic year. A communication has also been received from Mr. C.C. Perry, Assistant Indian Commissioner, dealing with the matter.\n\nAs it now appears that reshingling and improvements have recently been carried out by the Rev. Sisters and that good work is being done in the classrooms, no steps need be taken at the present time for the closing of the school at the time above mentioned. The Department will have no funds to provide the cost of erecting day schools to replace this institution. The matter will therefore be considered closed for the present. The Assistant Commissioner is being so informed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n203-6 Rogers Building,\nVancouver, B.

The interior of the building is spotlessly clean.\n\nThe children seemed healthy and happy.\n\nAt one time all the Sisters resided in the school building, but recently a new building has been built as a residence for the Sisters, and the majority of the staff is now living in this separate residence. There is, therefore, more space in the school, and, as they have no trouble in obtaining children, the Sister Superior requested that the pupilage be increased from 55 to 60. I informed her that this could not be done just now but that she might write next Spring.\nSir:\n\nI have received a request from the Squamish Residential School that I ask the Department to increase the grant paid them from $5 to $60, as they have 62 in residence, and have had over 60 for many months. They say this matter was discussed with Mr. Phelan when he visited the School, and that he recommended that they apply for the increased grant for the coming fiscal year.\n\nThe Sisters have recently expended rather a large amount of money on improvements at the School, both inside and out. In a separate report I am placing before the Department their request that shower baths be installed, as the bathing facilities are extremely limited.\n\nThe matter of an increased grant has been taken up before as you will no doubt recollect, but in view of the above circumstances, it is being again placed before you for your consideration.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C. Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6467, file 889-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDr. McGill.\n\nIn a letter just received from Indian Agent Ball he forwards a request from the Principal of the Squamish Indian Residential School for an increase in the pupilage from 55 to 60.\n\nThe Agent points out that the Sisters have recently expended rather a large amount of money on improvements at the school building - both inside and outside.\n\nThe per capita grant at this school is $170, less 5%, and to increase the pupilage would mean an expenditure of $807.50. Funds for the purpose could be provided from our Appropriation for the next fiscal year, and in view of the management's action in placing the building in as good condition as possible and the further fact that pupils are available, I would recommend that the pupilage be increased to 60 from April 1st, 1936.\n\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, March 21st, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 10th instant, it has been decided to increase the pupilage at the Squamish Indian Residential School from 55 to 60. Grant for the increased number will be allowed from April 1st, 1936. Please inform the Principal.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n203-6 Rogers Bldg.,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nPP/O'M.\nVANCOUVER HEALTH UNIT\nREPORT FOR MONTH OF NOVEMBER, 1936.\n\nInspector of Schools, Mr. G. H. Barry, was in this Agency during the month, and inspected the Squamish Residential School and Day Schools, Sechelt Residential School, and Sliammon Day School. In the past few years there has been an extraordinary improvement in the Squamish School. All kinds of improvements in the building, both interior and exterior, have been made, and this seems to have reflected itself upon the general conditions at the school, which a few years ago were in very bad odour. When authority is delegated to subordinates, and operations left in their hands, troubles and abuses soon creep in, and ruin any institution, but quicker in a school than anywhere else.\n\nF. J. C. Ball.\nIndian Agent.\nOn the 24th instant I visited the Squamish Indian Residential School at North Vancouver with Inspector Barry and Mr. F.E. Anfield. Visits were made to all the classrooms and the pupils seen at their work. Other departments of the school, including the dormitories, dining room and kitchen, were also inspected, and everything found to be spotlessly clean. The food served was of good quality; the mid-day meal for that day consisting of meat, beans, potatoes, bread, milk etc.\n\nW.H.

She has endeared herself to several generations of Indians, besides all who come in contact with her, and I believe the Department would wish to show some official recognition of her long and faithful services.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(F.J.C.Ball)\nIndian Agent.\n\nHarold W. McGill, Esq., M.D.\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to inform the Department that Reverend Mother Mary Amy, Principal of Squamish (St. Paul's) Indian Residential and Day Schools, North Vancouver, has resigned. A letter from his Excellency Archbishop Duke confirming this resignation and nominating Sister Mary Alix as Principal is forwarded herewith. These changes are endorsed by Inspector Barry and are recommended for favorable consideration.\n\nOwing to the highly satisfactory services rendered by the Reverend Mother Mary Amy as Principal over a long period of years, I should like to suggest that a letter of appreciation be directed to her by the Department.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

The Director of this Branch is today communicating with Reverend Mother Amy and expressing the appreciation of the officials here for the contribution she has made to the cause of Indian education over a period of forty years.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

There are very few people, even in missionary effort, who have succeeded in establishing such a record of faithful and unselfish service. It is my hope that your retirement from the principalship of this school will enable you to spend many enjoyable and happy years of leisure and well deserved relaxation.\n\nWith very best wishes for the future,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\n\nReverend Mother Mary Amy,\nSquamish Indian Residential School,\nNorth Vancouver, B. C.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 20, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 15th instant enclosing Inspector Barry's report regarding his inspection of the Squamish Residential School on January 23 last.\n\nThe report has been carefully considered and the following action should be taken at once:\n\n1. Inspector Barry and yourself should interview the Reverend Mother Provincial of the Sisters of the Child Jesus at an early date and arrange with her to nominate a competent Principal to take charge of this school.\n\n2. At the time of your visit to the Mother Provincial you should point out that the Department must insist on adequate wooden fire escapes being erected at the earliest possible date.\n\n3. The Reverend Mother Provincial and the Principal of the school should be advised that the enrolment must be reduced to a number approximating that for which grant is provided; namely, 60.\n\nWith reference to No. 1, I may say that in addition to the contents of Inspector Barry's report the Department has noted that there have been several cases of truancy at this school in the past month or so. While truancy is not always the fault of the school management at the same time our experience shows that in the majority of instances there is some laxity at a residential school when several cases of truancy occur within a comparatively short period.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nRegarding No. 2 and No. 3 the Department has in mind the fact that this is a very old building and consequently there must be considerable fire hazard in spite of the many precautions that are no doubt taken. Consequently every possible effort must be made on the part of the management to protect as far as possible the lives of those entrusted to their care.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nI visited Squamish Residential school on the 3rd. Two new fire escapes will be built during the summer holidays as an added precaution. On Sunday the 9th I received a wire from Father Cornell saying I was urgently needed at Sechelt school. This proved to be in connection with pupils leaving school to rejoin their parents in Washington where they were berrypicking. One does not know what a wire of that kind may mean, especially one arriving on Sunday and I could not contact the school to find out whether there was serious trouble there. I managed to get there but felt that the need was not so urgent as the wire indicated.\n\nF. J. C. Ball,\nIndian Agent.\nCONVENT OF THE CHILD JESUS\nNorth Vancouver, B.C.\n\nAug. 8, 1940\n\nM.P.

Barry after his visit to the school last January, I beg to inform you that the deficiencies pointed out in the said Report have been satisfactorily remedied.\n\n1. Old fire escape ladder is replaced by steps.\n2. Pupilage reduced to 63.\n3. Disciplanarian objected to by the boys removed.\n\nCaptain Barry had an explanatory talk with the Principal of the School and myself lately. Said he is personally satisfied with keeping Sister Alix in charge of the school for the length of time she has been nominated.\n\nHoping this explanation will find favour with you and the Department, I beg to remain, Dear Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nSister Gabriel, Provincial Sisters of the Child Jesus\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6467, file 889-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nAugust 7, 1940.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nIn accordance with your previous instructions I visited the Convent of the Sisters of the Child Jesus in North Vancouver yesterday, August 6th, and had a long conference with the Provincial Superior, Rev. Mother Gabriel and Sister Mary Alix, Principal of the Squamish Indian Residential School.\n\nThe reasons leading to my submission of a report on this school under date of January 26, 1940 portions of which were of an adverse nature were gone into with care.\n\nThe Reverend Sisters agreed with me that there was reason for the adverse nature of at least part of my report. They pointed out however that since I reported on their school the following changes had been made:\n\n(1) New fire escapes had been constructed.\n(2) The number of pupils in residence had been reduced.\n(3) The Sister in charge of the supervision of the boys had been sent to another school and a better qualified Sister placed in her position.\n\nIn the above ways the Sisters had done their best to carry out the wishes of the Department and improve the conditions complained of in my report.\n\nIt was further pointed out to me that Sister M. Alix had been named as Principal of the Squamish Indian Residential School to replace Rev. Mother M. Amy before the latter had been recalled as Provincial by the appointment of Rev. Mother Gabriel. I was further informed that under the ordinary rules of the Community the nomination of Sister M. Alix as Principal of the residential school and Superior of the Sisters there was for a period of three years.\n\nI explained to the Rev. Mother and Sister Alix that I was satisfied with the changes which had been made to carry into effect the wishes of the Department, and that as far as I was concerned I should not press for the nomination of a new Principal.\n\nThe Rev. Mother Gabriel is writing to the Department a brief report of my visit and asking I understand that Sister M. Alix be permitted to remain Principal of the Squamish Residential School for the balance of the three years of her term.\n\nUnder the circumstances and considering the changes made in the school administration, appointment of a new boys' supervisor, etc., I would recommend that Sister Alix be permitted to remain Principal of the school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nImmediately following receipt of your letter of February 20th, last, I visited the Squamish Indian Residential School and discussed with the Rev. Mother Provincial and the Rev. Principal the subject matter of your letter, and Inspector Barry's report of his inspection of the School on January 23rd, 1940.\n\nThe Reverend Sisters assured me that the additional fire escapes proposed would be constructed and that the pupilage would be reduced in accordance with the wishes of the Department. The Rev. Mother Provincial requested that no action be taken with respect to a change in the Principalship until after the close of the term, when the subject could be fully discussed with Inspector Barry. I agreed to this arrangement and enclose herewith the Inspector's report of his conference with the Rev. Sisters regarding this and the other matters on which the Department requested that action be taken.\n\nI have no objection to Rev. Sister Alix continuing as Principal of the school, but I have suggested to Inspector Barry that he keep a close check on its administration and carry out an inspection before the close of the current calendar year.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl /AC\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 20, 1940.\n\nRe: Squamish Indian Residential School.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 14th instant and also a report on the above noted school dated August 7, 1940, submitted to you by Inspector Barry.\n\nIt is noted that you have issued instructions to Inspector Barry to keep a close check on the administration of this institution and to undertake an additional inspection prior to the end of the current calendar year. In view of all the circumstances, this action on your part is acceptable to the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nBox 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nBox 444,\nVancouver, B.C.,\nDecember 12, 1940.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nBox 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nSome weeks ago you asked me to make a brief survey of the pupilage of the Squamish Indian Residential and Day Schools to determine whether or not the children involved could be accommodated in a Consolidated Day School.\n\nThe attached nominal rolls of the children now attending the Squamish Indian Residential and Day Schools have been prepared for me by the Reverend Sister Mary Alix, Principal of the schools in question. The following are summaries which it is hoped will be of assistance to you and the Department in coming to a decision in this matter.\n\nThe Squamish Day School pupils attend the Residential School classes and as far as academic work is concerned, receive exactly the same education.\n\nAt present there are twelve boys and fourteen girls in attendance at the Squamish Day School, while in the Residential School there are twenty-seven boys and thirty-four girls. The classification of these children by grades is as follows:\n\n| Grades | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |\n|--------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Day School Boys | 6 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n| Girls | 5 | 1 | 1 | 5 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |\n| Residential Boys | 10 | 2 | 0 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 2 | 0 |\n| Girls | 18 | 4 | 1 | 5 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n\nIt will be seen from the above that the children are fairly evenly distributed between the grades, with the majority of the Residential School pupils in the primary grades.\n\nIt is of extreme importance in considering the possibility of the establishment of a Consolidated Day School to take the place of the present Day and Residential Schools to consider the home conditions of the children at present on the roll of the Squamish Indian Residential School. The following tabulation will set forth in a brief manner the information given on the nominal rolls:\n\n| Boys | Girls |\n|------|-------|\n| 1. Both parents dead. | 3 | 0 |\n| 2. Father dead. | 3 | 6 |\n| 3. Mother dead. | 1 | 1 |\n| 4. Deserted by mother | 2 | 1 |\n| 5. Deserted by father | 1 | 1 |\n| 6. Deserted by both parents | 1 | 0 |\n| 7. Parents separated | 2 | 0 |\n| 8. Mother dead, father deserted | 1 | 1 |\n| 9. T.B.-infected home | 0 | 1 |\n| 10. No suitable home | 0 | 1 |\n| No special remarks | 13 | 22 |\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6467, file 889-1, part 2)\nFrom the above it will be easily seen that at least half of the boys and about one-third of the girls need Residential School care in any case.\n\nThe following tabulation will give a clear picture of the location of the homes from which the Residential School pupilage is drawn:\n\n|                | Burrard Inlet | Squamish Mission #1 | Squamish River Musqueam | Uncertain |\n|----------------|---------------|---------------------|-------------------------|-----------|\n| Boys           | 5             | 13                  | 1                       | 8         |\n| Girls          | 7             | 19                  | 3                       | 3         |\n\nBriefly, I may say that Burrard #3 Reserve is located in or near the Lynn Valley District, some eight miles from the present Squamish Residential School. There are good roads joining these places. The Musqueam Reserve is located near Point Grey, some fifteen miles from the present Squamish school, on the Vancouver city side of Burrard Inlet. Transportation of the Musqueam children to a Consolidated School at Squamish would involve far too great a distance and also the crossing of the new Lions Gate Suspension Bridge. Squamish River Indian Reserve is located at the head of Burrard Sound, some forty miles by water from North Vancouver. Where Squamish is given as the location of the home, it should be understood that this includes the local Reserves in the vicinity of the present Squamish Indian Residential School.\n\nAttached you will find a roll of ten children discharged from the Squamish Residential School during the past year, all these children were fifteen years of age or over. Two were in Grade 4, two in Grade 5, three in Grade 6, and three in Grade 8 at the time of discharge. These children would appear to have received on the average a satisfactory training in the academic subjects.\n\nI regret that it is quite impossible for me to recommend the establishment of a consolidated improved Day School in North Vancouver to take the place of the present Squamish Indian Residential and Day Schools. Two main reasons may be given for this conclusion:\n\n1. It would be practically impossible to arrange for the satisfactory transportation of the children involved when the distance to the Musqueam and Burrard #3 Reserves are taken into account. In no system of consolidation could the children from the Squamish River Reserve be included.\n\n2. A very large proportion of the children at present receiving their education at the Squamish Indian Residential School are exactly those who, from the nature of their home and family conditions, must of necessity receive their education at a Residential School.\n\nI trust that the above information will be of assistance to you and to the Department in coming to a final decision and that the present Squamish Indian Residential and Day Schools may be allowed to continue to function as such.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6467, file 889-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n| Children's Names | Names of Parents & Reserve | Age |

Moreover, a large percentage of the children would, in any event, require residential school care because of unfavorable home and family conditions.\n\nIt will be recalled that the establishment of a Day School on the Musqueam Reserve to care for those children for whom there is no room in the Squamish Residential School has been provided for in the 1941-42 Estimates on Departmental instructions.\n\nI would recommend that the existing arrangements be continued.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n| Children's Names | Names of parents & Reserve | Age | Grade | Remarks

I have not yet had an opportunity of seeing Father Dunlop, but I have already spoken to Sister Mary Alix, the Principal of the School, and I do not think there is any ground for serious complaint. Sister Alix advises me that she gave definite orders that no child is to be punished by the Sisters without reference to her first, and she will investigate why her instructions were disregarded.\n\nFred, J.C.

This is the chief complaint against the School by the Indians.\n\nWith regard to manual training, this is only a temporary arrangement. Mr.Goumain has done quite well for the short time that he has been teaching. I agree also with Mr.Gray's suggestion to remove the large platform and will try to have the Sisters' consent to this. Of course, the building does not belong to us, so we can only suggest, and not order, alterations in the building.\n\nIndian Agent\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am enclosing herewith Mr. Indian Agent Ball's letter of July 5th, regarding Inspector Gray's report covering his visit to the Squamish Indian Residential School on June 30th, 1944.\n\nIt will be noted that Mr. Ball agrees with the Inspector's remarks regarding the short periods devoted to education and the long periods to religious instruction.

Presumably Mr. Ball has discussed this question with the Principal and the time has been reduced.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnc.\nThe Schools have closed for the holidays and there is an uncanny quiet in the Residential Schools. A boy scout troop started by Rev. H.F. Dunlop, O.M.I., at Sechelt Residential School, has caused much favourable comment, especially when they were brought to Vancouver for some Church exhibition.\n\nF.J.C. Bell,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nDuring a meeting of the Squamish Indian Council on the 24th instant, the Chief and Secretary spoke to me during an interval regarding the training of the Indian school children in farming - not with any idea of making farmers of them, but that they would take more interest in using any arable land on their Reserves for vegetables, feed, etc., and for raising smaller domestic animals.\n\nOur Reserves in this Agency are not suitable for farming as a livelihood as they are too small and much of the land is rocky hillside.\n\nThey mentioned that although the present school owned by a religious order is unsuitable for such instruction having been built in the City of North Vancouver, the time has come for a new school to be built as that school is over 40 years old, is a frame building and antiquated, with no proper place for exercise or play, and because of its construction is a great danger from fire. It is also too near the Reserve and too near the Cities of Vancouver and North Vancouver which means that the pupils are able to play truant without much opportunity of stopping it.\n\nThe Squamish Band has a large Reserve of 4046 acres at Chekamus No.11 about 55 miles from North Vancouver. There is enough good land on this Reserve which could be used for farming instruction, and the School would be far enough from the Reserve that the children would be under better control.\n\nI advised the Chief and Secretary that there was not much hope of new construction at present, but promised to bring the matter before you for consideration if and when the building of new Residential Schools is contemplated. If some reply to their enquiry could be given, it will be appreciated. This matter was not discussed by the Council as a whole, as it was thought to be one which should not be publicised at the present time.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6467, file 889-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, 5th October, 1945.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI enclose a copy of letter which has just been received from Indian Agent Ball. I doubt if the Minister would favourably consider following the suggestion made in this communication. However, before placing the matter before him I would like to have a report from you indicating your opinion of the situation as outlined by Indian Agent Ball.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nYour File 167-1-1\n\nI have your letter of October 5th enclosing a copy of a letter received from Mr. Indian Agent Ball wherein he refers to certain suggestions made at a meeting of the Squamish Indian Council regarding the replacement of the Squamish Indian Residential School by a new school on a more suitable site and where instruction in elementary agriculture could be given.\n\nI may say at once that I can see no immediate need for a move along the lines suggested. This is not to say that our existing setup is not in need of improvement. It seems to me, however, that before a decision with respect to any change of importance is made that a complete school survey of the North Shore Reserves and possibly the Sechelt Reserve should be undertaken. This is not possible with our present staff but could receive attention following the appointment of a new School Inspector to the existing vacancy.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\n/KT\nOttawa, November 3, 1945.\n\nMr. F.J.C. Ball, Indian Agent,\n416 Federal Building, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of September 28, with reference to the Squamish Indian Residential School. The contents of your communication have been discussed with the Director, and I may say that we do not see any immediate need to move along the lines suggested. On the other hand, it is quite possible that our existing set-up requires improvements.\n\nWe hope to have a new school inspector by next Spring and he could then make a careful survey of the whole situation in your agency and submit a report that could be studied before any decision is made to change.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nCOPY SENT TO COMMISSIONER MacKAY\nMy dear Mr. Phelan:\n\nThis is a small school and in very poor condition. It gives the impression of an orphan long neglected, if not completely abandoned, by its foster parents. Had it been in the hands of any other group of workers but a community of Reverend Sisters, I doubt if it would not be, after these many years, in complete ruin.\n\nIt is possible that your Commissioner has been hoping for a new school, but knowing the attitude of the Minister's office, I doubt if this will ever come to pass. Under the circumstances, I think the building is worth saving and should be completely repaired. This, I think, can be done for around $6,000 to $8,000, and the Department should not hesitate in providing this amount in the next year's estimates.\n\nFor the present, school desks and sewing machines should be replaced as needed and the per capita grant should be increased by 15 pupils. This would provide adequate education for children who are now asking for admission and who cannot be accepted on account of the difficulty of feeding and clothing an extra 15 pupils, when no funds for such purpose are provided by the Indian Department.\n\nI do not think that the grant is up to standard, although I am not sure about the matter. But should I be right, I think you would do well to raise it immediately to conform with other schools of your Department.\n\nThe library should also receive some attention as the books are very few in numbers and not of a quality to interest children in the formative years.\n\n(over...)\nThe Sisters have been very patient with the Department and have not asked what it was their right to expect in the matter of yearly grants for general repairs, and I think that this attitude on their part should not be forgotten.\n\nThanking you in anticipation I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nOttawa, 13 September 1946.\n\nRev. J.O. Plourde:\n\nWe are in receipt of your letter of the 10th instant with reference to the Squamish Indian Residential School.\n\nWith reference to your recommendations, we submit the following information:\n\n1. We are noting the request for $8,000 for repairs and for an increase in the pupilage. These matters will be reconsidered when we are preparing our appropriation for the fiscal year 1947-48.\n\n2. The per capita rate at this school is $170.00 plus the special payment of $15.00 per capita. Consequently it conforms with the per capita rate on other Indian Residential Schools in British Columbia.\n\n3. Indian Commissioner MacKay was authorized two weeks ago to purchase school desks that are required. We are prepared to replace the sewing machines when requested by the principal through the office of the local Indian Agent.\n\n4. Arrangements will be made to supply additional books for the school library.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J.O.

There is now a waiting list of fourteen new pupils, whose parents are very pressing to have them placed in school; this would bring our number up to eighty.\n\nWe have a dormitory and a community room which formerly were for the Sisters, that we could use as dormitories for those extra children who are asking admission, but before doing so, I would like to have assurance that the Indian Department would consider it necessary to raise our grant from sixty to seventy-five pupils.\n\nI trust that you will give the above due considerations as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"Sister M. Michaella\"\nD. M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nVancouver.\n\nI enclose two copies of a letter from the Sister in charge of the Squamish Indian Residential School relative to an increase from 60 to 75 for the per capita pupilage grant.\n\nIn view of the lack of facilities to accommodate both residential and day school pupils, the extra space which could be provided in the above school would help greatly to mitigate the present shortage.\n\nOn the tabulation of approximate air space of dormitories I have shown the cu.ft. space per pupil, which in no instance approaches the minimum requirement.\n\nThe additional 6942 cu.ft. available with use of the unused dormitory and the community room would provide 500 cu.ft. of air space for 14 children, being the difference between the 66 now enrolled and the estimated total of 80 to be admitted.\n\n(H.

M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n24-10-47.\n\n1. With reference to the above, please be advised that this date, the writer accompanied by a Matron, Miss Marion Hollett made a patrol to St. Mungo's Cannery, New Westminster District, B.C. The purpose of this patrol was to apprehend and return to the Squamish Indian Residential School in North Vancouver, a delinquent Indian girl, Dorothy Lewis who was not fifteen years of age. This child, the daughter of Mrs Maggie Lewis of Capilano Indian Reserve, West Vancouver had run away from home at an earlier date, disobeying her mother's wish that she return to school.\n\n2. Accordingly upon arriving at the Cannery where the subject was reputed to be staying, enquiries were instituted at the Main Office and the subject's Mother contacted at work in the Cannery. From the latter it was learned that the girl was staying in #29 of the Cannery Worker's quarters. She was forthwith contacted there and apprised of the fact that she was about to be returned to school.\n\n3. Upon arrival at the Residential School in North Vancouver, the subject was handed over to the Mother Superior of the Sister's in charge of that Institution. It is not intended to enter any prosecution against the Mother for the daughter's failure to return to school as she is a widow and quite destitute and further is unable to effectively control her offspring.\n\nCONCLUDED.\n\nCOPY OF THIS REPORT HANDED DIRECT TO THE INDIAN AGENT.\n\nsigned\n\n(M.A. McDonald) 14701\n\nThe Indian Commissioner for B.C.\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nFORWARDED for your information.\n\nVancouver\n30-10-47\n\n(R.

Indian Section.\n\nPROVINCE British Columbia.\n\nDATE November 12, 1947.\n\nRE: Leonard CAMPBELL & Donald JOHNSTON - North Vancouver, B.C.\n\nP.E. & Theft from St. Paul's Ind. Res. School.\n\n(JUVENILE INDIANS)\n\n1. Relative to the above mentioned subject, please be advised that a complaint was received at this office during the PM of the 3rd inst. to the effect the St. Paul's Indian Residential School at North Vancouver had been broken into the night or early morning of the last inst.; at which time a quantity of goods had been stolen.\n\n2. A patrol was made immediately to the School, and a check revealed that the locker-room adjoining the kitchen had been broken into through a narrow window on the North side of the building. Dents in the casing of the window signified that an iron tool or bar had been used to break away the casing so that the window could be opened. The Principal of the School advised that a close check of the stock in the cooler and the kitchen revealed that 10 lbs. butter, 4 lbs lard, 8 jars peanut butter, 2 can syrup (5 lb. size), 3 boxes weiners, 2 meat loaves, & 10 2 lb. packages of Br. Sugar had been stolen. It appeared evident that the only motive behind this S.E. was the fact that food-stuffs were the only thing stolen or tampered with; which gave rise to the suspicion that none other than Indians were likely to have perpetrated this offence.\n\n3. Questioning of the School staff, and other persons who reside adjacent to the School revealed nothing of a tangible nature. However, the janitor of the School advised that he had heard from some of the pupils of the School, that two young Indians namely Archie Gonzales & Roger Guss had committed the offence, it was not possible to gather any information to substantiate this however.\n\n4. The B.C. Provincial Police detachment at North Vancouver, B.C. were contacted, who advised that they had received the complaint on the last inst., but had as yet not been able to gather any information which would indicate who had committed the offence. Arrangements were made with this Force to make a check of the Reserve at North Vancouver the AM. of the 4th inst., when Indians would be questioned in an effort to gather information in respect to this matter.\n\n5. Accompanied by Cst.R.A.McDonald, a patrol was made to North Vancouver the AM. of the 4th inst., Cst.D.Payne of the Prov. Police was contacted who went with us to make enquiries into this complaint. It was decided that two brothers namely Walter & Leonard Campbell would first be questioned. These youths are Indians, who reside with their mother Mrs. Albert Hanson at the foot of Pemberton Ave., North Vancouver in a small shack on the waterfront. In calling at this address the writer was met at the door by Walter, this individual was in a very hostile mood, he refused to carry on conversation, and refused us admission...\n\nCONTINUED...\nREFUSED US ADMISSION to the house; in view of this subject's demeanour it was decided that a search of the house should be carried out, while the writer returned to North Vancouver, B.C., for a search warrant, the other members remained at the address. A search warrant was obtained from Mr. F.J. Bayfield and an immediate search was made of the premises referred to.\n\n6. In conducting the search, nearly all the goods which were stolen from the School were recovered. Leonard Campbell admitted without any prompting at this time that he had been responsible in committing the offence, naming as his accomplice Donald Johnston, who resides on the Capilano Indian Reserve. Other articles recovered in making the search included an electric iron (new), two automobile Fog Lamps, Flashlights and a large quantity of cigarettes. These items had been stolen in B.E.E., at or from other business establishments in the North Vancouver District; the Provincial Police having received the complaints which were being investigated at the time.\n\n7. Leonard Campbell was apprehended at this time, and with this prisoner a patrol was made to the Capilano Indian Reserve to the residence of Thomas Johnston. The subject Donald Johnston was questioned as to the part he had taken in committing the theft from the School, he readily admitted the fact that he had been implicated. A small quantity of part of the goods stolen was recovered from this address, which included some of the Br.Sugar, Butter, Lard etc. This subject was also apprehended and with Campbell was taken to the Prov.Police Detachment at North Vancouver where charges were laid by the Provincial Police in connection with the B.E.E. Theft from the North Vancouver Indian Residential School. The Provincial Police laid six other charges of B.E.E. Theft against these two, with respect to the theft from Garages, Stores & Parked cars which had occurred within the past few weeks.\n\n8. Appearing in court on the 5th.inst., the cases against these Juveniles, who are each seventeen years of age, was transferred from the Juvenile court to the Police Court; they pleaded \"Guilty\" to all the charges, and were remanded for sentence to Monday the 10th.inst. On this date they again appeared, at which time Campbell was sentenced to serve one year in the Oakalla Gaol, Johnston was fined $50.00, and sentenced to time spent in custody, in default of payment of the fine to serve 60 days Oakalla Gaol.\n\n9. Leonard Campbell had a previous record of B.E.E. having been sentenced to 18 mo. during 1946, this however, was reduced to 6 months on appeal. In passing sentence, undoubtedly the court took into consideration the fact that Johnston had no previous record, coupled with the fact that he is a juvenile.\n\nCONVICTED\n\nCOPY OF THIS REPORT HANDED DIRECT TO THE INDIAN AGENT.\n\n(W.A.Griffin) Cat. #10571.\n\nFILE NUMBERS, HEADING AND MARGINAL REFERENCE ARE TO BE PROPERLY FILLED IN.\nRe: Donald JOHNSON & Leonard CAMPBELL (Juv.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Squamish Indian Residential School\n\nOn checking the return for the quarter ended March 31st, 1949, there was an enrolment of 77 at the above mentioned school, and an average attendance of the same number for that particular quarter.\n\nThe authorized pupilage at this school is 70, and as the Department expects that there will be 500 cubic feet of air space per pupil in each dormitory, we wrote Superintendent Taylor and asked him to advise us of the number of cubic feet in the dormitory, in order that we could decide if we would be justified in requesting the Minister's approval to increase the authorized pupilage.\n\nThe information we have received indicates that the total cubic feet is 32,767, and on this basis there would only be sufficient air space for slightly over 65 pupils.\n\nUnder these circumstances, we feel that we would not be justified in increasing the pupilage, but if you have any further representations to make regarding the matter, we will be pleased to hear from you.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nPP/ST Chief, Education Division\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nYour file 889-1 (E1)\nRe: Squamish Indian Residential School\n\nI refer to Mr. Phelan's letter of October 27th concerning the application of the Principal of the above mentioned school for an increase in the authorized enrollment to 77. In view of the limited dormitory space I cannot recommend the increase requested by the Principal.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nAIR MAIL\n\nNovember 4th, 1949.\n\nMr. H.E.

Your File 15-11-1 (167)\n\nWe are in receipt of the December Quarterly Return for the above school, and this shows an average attendance of 79, which is 9 over the authorized pupilage.\n\nWe are allowing the supernumerary grant for the extra 9 children for the December quarter, but in view of previous correspondence regarding the pupilage at this school, the Principal should be notified that within the next few weeks, the enrollment is to be decreased to the authorized number.\n\nPP/ST\n\nBernard W.

Neary, Esq.\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour letter of December 14th announcing an increase in our per capita rate was very welcome indeed. There are so many things we had to do without, because we could not afford them during the current year's expenditures, blankets and mattresses need to be replaced, and clothing to be got for the children. The adjustment cheque which we received already, will help us considerably. Therefore, I sincerely thank you, and the other Officials of the Department, who considered this increase for us.\n\nLast June, I asked Mr. Taylor, our Indian Agent, for a supernumerary grant, as we usually have eight to ten over our pupilage. He told me that he asked for an increase in pupilage. To date, we have not received either; I would greatly appreciate it if we could have a supernumerary grant.\n\nYours very gratefully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nJune 23rd, 1950.\n\nSister Mary Michellis,\nSquamish Indian Residential School,\nNorth Vancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Sister Michellis:\n\nI was very happy to meet you, the other Sisters, and your children last Tuesday.\n\nThe short time I spent at your school did not permit me to look over the premises very carefully, but your happy and healthful looking children was an indication to me of the work you are doing with regard to health and physical education. I would like you to express to Mr. Strain and his assistant, Mr. Cummings, my sincere appreciation on the fine results which they have achieved.\n\nEnclosed please find some pictures which I took while I was there.\n\nI can see that your school is in great need of a better playground, but in conversation with Inspector Davey, I understand that this whole matter will be taken up in the very near future.\n\nWith kind personal regards,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nI.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Squamish Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1940.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated January 2nd, 1941.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the Squamish Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31st, 1941.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated March 31st, 1941\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Vancouver Indian Office\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Squamish Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1941.\n\nPrincipal Sister M.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereon.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Squamish Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1942.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated June 30, 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this [Date] 19[Year]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Agamianish Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1942.\n\nPrincipal Sister M.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and ascertainable by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended 1943.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 1943\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5.

The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Squamish Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1943.\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated December 31, 1943.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this date.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Squamish Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: Sister M.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Squamish Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31st, 1944.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated March 31st, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRepr.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Squamish Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: Sister M.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Squamish Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: January 25, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at ...........................................\n\nthis .................................................. 19 ...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Squamish Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31st 1945.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated January 2 1945.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19 .\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Squamish Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1946.\n\nPrincipal Sister M. Alice\n\nDated April 4th 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at ...........................................\n\nthis ........................................... 19......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I A 403\nRepr.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Squamish Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated July 2 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Squamish Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30th 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 3rd 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated January 3, 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Vancouver this 7th January 1948\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence during quarter entered in the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payments be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Squamish Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1948.\n\nPrincipal: Sister M.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Squamish Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1942.\n\nPrincipal: Sister M.

ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Squamish Residential School School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1950.\n\nPrincipal Sister M.

C. Mc Donald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg leave to apply to the Department of Indian Affairs for a grant of $530.00 to defray the cost of purchasing and installing two furnaces in our School, which has been heretofore heated by means of wood stoves; but these, besides giving a very irregular heat, are most dangerous especially with Indian children, who more than once came very near setting the building on fire.\n\nAnother thing to be considered is this. Firewood is rather scarce at the present time, and is likely to become more so in the near future, owing the growth of the City of North Vancouver, and very soon coal will be the only fuel used; so I think it will be more economical with the two furnaces than it would with about fifteen stoves.\nSir,-\n\nI have the honor to forward herewith a letter, dated the 4th instant, No. 556/IO, received from Mr. Agent McDonald, of the Fraser Agency, B. C., with application, of the 22nd ultimo, addressed to him by the management of the Squamish Mission Indian Boarding school asking for permission to incur an expenditure of $530.00 in having two hot-air furnaces installed in the institution, the estimate of which will be found herewith. I concur in the statement made by the Agent that the furnaces would be more economical than are the large number of stoves now found necessary to properly heat the buildings during the cool months of the year besides being far safer and more satisfactory on the whole.

LIMITED\nBRANDON \u2014 MANITOBA\n\nMANUFACTURERS OF\nTHE \"EVER-READY\" FIRE EXTINGUISHER\nA PERFECT FIRE ENGINE\nADAPTED TO THE NEEDS OF CITIES, TOWNS AND VILLAGES OR WHEREVER A FIRE ENGINE IS NEEDED\n\nBRANCH OFFICE AT CALGARY, ALBERTA\nWe herewith present our catalogue of the already famous Chemical Fire Extinguishers, known as the \"Ever-Ready,\" because of their quick action, both as regards moving to the scene of fire and the promptness with which they put out the blaze.\n\nFor rapid work, and for positive fire-extinguishing efficiency they have no equal, and we can recommend them to all communities where there is considerable fire exposure.\n\nFor small towns where it is impossible to maintain a fire department, this machine is one of the greatest preventives of property ever invented. For farmers, who may be and usually are, away from any means of protection against fire, this machine is indispensable, and often saves many times its cost in a short space of time. It affords security, too, for wherever these machines are, there is a feeling of relief against the ever-present dread of fire where there is no protection such as this \"Ever-Ready\" machine affords.\n\nLook through the following pages, examine the engravings of this machine in various sizes and select the size you would like to have protect your property. Then write us telling us what you think will suit your wants and we will be pleased to give you prices and all information.\n\nThe Ever Ready system differs from the ordinary acid soda type in that we use liquefied carbonic acid gas as a source of pressure instead of the ordinary soda. The well-known extinguishing powers of this gas. The Ever Ready system chemical engine generates carbonic acid gas within the tank by the use of sulphuric acid and soda and on discharging the machine the whole chemical mixture, generally containing uncentrated sulphuric acid, is thrown out by the discharge.\n\nThe superior efficiency of a chemical stream is not due to the chemical employed but is due only to the carbonic gas generated by the chemicals.\n\nThe Ever-Ready system has removed the principal objection to the chemical engine, i.e., the damage caused by the discharge of a dirty corrosive chemical mixture from the engine. We discharge nothing but carbonic acid gas and water under high pressure. We discharge more efficiently of a chemical stream without using chemicals at all and we therefore claim to do no damage with our discharge.\n\nWe build a first-class engine in every respect and we guarantee the workmanship and material to be the very best. Our tanks are of seamless steel lined with black tin. Our arrangements for handling the discharge are perfect and our refilling pump makes it possible to keep up a continuous stream of carbonated water on the fire for several hours as there is enough gas carried in the machine to discharge the whole contents several times.\n\nOur gas cartridges are made to our own order in Pittsburgh and are filled with pure carbonic gas, in the square inch more than four times the load they have to carry. All Ever-Ready engines are equipped with the necessary apparatus to discharge dry gas alone or any mixture of gases and water that may be desired.\n\nThe trucks and gears are built by experienced men and the best steel material is used. Any defects that may develop we will cheerfully repair and we stand behind our engines. To put the whole matter in a few words, we guarantee our engine to be perfect in every detail, and, as under our contract, we obligate ourselves to ship the engine and test it thoroughly before asking payment.\nThe \"Ever-Ready\" Fire Extinguisher, \"Double Fifty\"\n\n(Two 50 gallon tanks, U.S. measure)\n\nThis machine is constructed of selected oak and high grade steel, thoroughly inspected in every way, and fitted to bear the strain of heavy use without damage. The tanks\u2014two in number\u2014contain 50 gallons of water each, and it is the only engine made which can have the tanks filled to full capacity, all others being about two-thirds filled, a feature which is of great importance when it is required to throw the full weight of the fire extinguisher on the fire.\n\nAll other machines using soda and sulphuric acid are destructive to property, and we claim for this machine that it uses liquid carbonic gas in its pure state, and can be repaired easily. Other machines using sulphuric acid destroy any article it comes in contact with. This is well known that sulphuric acid will dissolve and destroy any article it comes in contact with. Our machine uses a harmless fluid which does not destroy property but does put out the fire.\n\nEach engine is fitted with two 50 gallon tanks containing two gallons fluid extinguishers, four gas lamps containing two gallons of liquid gas each, sufficient to discharge about seven tanks of water.\n\nThe machine is fitted for two horses, weighs 2,600 pounds, has standing room for the operator with hand railing at rear. Each tank is fitted with a safety valve, and the pressure gauge and hose pipe can be filled with the other tank, which is a feature which is not on other machines. The gauges indicate the pressure and are under positive control, a valve stopping the gas at exactly the right moment. The hose pipe is also turned off by a lever, leaving the operator free to turn the engine, enabling the operator to reach almost any point without height necessity. The hose reel is of our own design and so attached to the water supply that leakage is done away with. The reel runs easily and allows the hose to pay out without clogging. A finely finished and perfect machine in every way and fully guaranteed.\nThe Village Fire Extinguisher\n\nThis machine is very similar in construction to the machines shown on the preceding pages except that it has but two wheels and is designed to be drawn by hand instead of by horses. Its capacity is about five gallons (15.2 liters), and when fully equipped ready for use weighs about two pounds.\n\nThe wheels are 42 inches high and, on account of their large diameter, the machine is easily moved long distances. The tank is mounted on a heavy base and is provided with a hand pump and hose, four feet of hose, and is in every respect an ideal machine for the purpose for which it is constructed. Write for prices.\n\nThe fire extinguisher is filled with hand water being poured into the tank through a funnel which we supply.\n\nIn cases where fire exists, but its location is indefinite, the nozzle of the hose is placed through a hole in the partition wall and the gas released will find its way and put it out, because the gas rises naturally, and cannot be prevented from taking the shortest route to the fire.\n\nAll parts of our machines are interchangeable, and in case any part should become damaged or broken we can replace them quickly.\n\nWe offer these machines at a price of $35 each in addition to the amount sent with each machine at the ruling market price.\n\nGas tanks will be refilled by us at seventy-five cents a pound. The cost of this gas is cheaper than using soda and acid.\n\nWe can distribute a ten-gallon tank for $10.00, while soda and acid machines would require one gallon of acid and 50 pounds of soda at a cost of about $2.50.\n\nWe refer you to any who are using our machines to give particular attention to the testimonials on page 16.\n\nMachines are painted red with gold stripe. We can supply the water tanks included if so ordered.\n\nThe fire extinguisher is ideal for places that need it in use by a regular or volunteer department, we advise the painted tank be used because they are easy to keep clean.\n\"Ever-Ready\" Double Hand Engine\n\nThis machine is built only to order and the tank capacity can be made any number of gallons from thirty to 600 for each tank. One tank can be filled with water while the other is being used upon the fire; the exhausted tank being refilled by hand the same as our \"Village\" machine.\n\nWrite for an estimate, telling us your requirements, and we will quote price on a specially built machine to fit your needs.\n\nTo Operate the \"Ever-Ready\"\n\nOpen the discharge valve\u2014THAT'S ALL! There is nothing to get ready\u2014it is \"Ever-Ready.\" Simply open the valve. When the fire is out shut the valve and the rest of the charge is left to me again. You keep this up until the extinguisher is emptied, and quench a hundred important fires with one charge. This is impossible with any other extinguisher on the market, as it is necessary to wholly discharge any chemical extinguisher once it is brought into action.\n\"Ever-Ready\" Hand Fire Extinguishers\n\nMade in two sizes\u20142 and 5 gallons U.S. measure.\n\nThese extinguishers are furnished with each machine and when empty can be exchanged for full ones at any of our offices.\n\nThey are highly fluid, dry strong, and a small fire engine in themselves, but they will also prevent a fire from spreading.\n\nPrice, 2 gallons, $8.00; 5 gallons, $12.00.\n\nAlways in stock.\n\nTO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN,\n\nThe Brandon Fire Engine Co., Ltd.,\nBrandon, Manitoba, Canada.\n\nWe have had occasion to use your fire extinguishers, which we found very efficient, and found them to be very good even in severe weather conditions. We have not had occasion to use them again, but we are sure they would have been of great service to us if we had needed them.\n\nWe consider the 2 gallon machine a very useful and satisfactory fire extinguisher, and would recommend it to anyone who has seen or used it.\n\n(Signed) JOHNSON & CO.\n\nFor McClelland\n\n\"Ever-Ready\" Warehouse Truck Fire Extinguishers\n\nThis engine is constructed on a solidly built truck, for covering about easily in factories and large buildings, and in case of possibility of the water in the tank freezing during cold weather it may be easily moved to another part of the building. The truck is fitted with a hose reel holding up to 18 or 24 gallons of S. O. S., provided with no. 3 inch hose, nozzle and hose guide.\n\nPrice, either size, $100.\n\nThis truck can be made any size or capacity to suit conditions.\n\nPrices on request.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 64/47, file 889-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe \"Ever-Ready\" Automatic Standpipe Fire Extinguisher\n\nParticularly in homes, churches, schools, stores and similar places, where fire is liable to occur.\n\nCan be operated instantly by raising the ring and placing it on the hook on any floor, thus saving the value of any base red you might have to throw.\n\nEver Ready Fire Extinguisher Co., Ltd.,\nBrandon, Man., January 24th, 1907.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI had occasion to test the efficiency of your stand pipe system recently, and I am glad to say that it worked admirably throughout.

Haldane Lock, Chief of the Fire Brigade.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6467, file 887-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nExtracts from the Press\n\nTHE BRANDON FIRE ENGINE IS PERFECT\n\nA Brandon industry in which there is every reason to look for great expansion is the Brandon Fire Engine Company.\n\nThe company's greatest claim on applause thus far is that it is not superior to anything manufactured by any other chemical fire fighting apparatus.\n\nDuring the previous week the company had a demonstration at its Ninth Street showroom, and a very deep interest was taken. Mayor Adolph Schmitz, Mr. J. W. West, and Mr. A. West, and among others were Provincial Fire Inspector, Mr. H. M. Murray, Engineer of the McIntyre Mills, Winnipeg, Mr. W. F. G. Macdonald, Secretary of the Manitoba Board of Underwriters, and many others interested in fire-fighting apparatus.\n\nThe test was broadcast over the airwaves, and condition one of the experts present, in speaking of the apparatus, said:\n\n\"This demonstration convinces me that you have here probably the best chemical fire apparatus in Canada.\"\n\nThe Brandon company has been steadily improving its apparatus until it is now conceded by experts that the extinguisher is practically perfect in every detail.\n\nAs well as manufacturing chemical engines for general fire protection in cities, towns and villages, the company also makes portable extinguishers for protection for installations in isolated blocks, and portable extinguishers for small apparatus for private houses and farm buildings.\n\nIn the test this week strong streams were thrown onto a large fire, and the work was perfect.\u2014Brandon Daily Times, January 24th, 1924.\n\nAN EFFECTIVE FIRE EXTINGUISHER\n\nShortly before noon today fire was seen leaping from a storage room on the wall of the printing-room of The Times. After the fire was spread it was found necessary to call out the brigade as the building of The Times Company's works being contiguous, their four galleries filled with oil and piping runs all through the building, with sixty feet of hose on each floor. It is understood that the fire would have been extinguished from any floor by simply pulling a wire which starts the system. The same result is given whether inside or outside the building. It will throw a stream of water and gas on to the fire, and Mr. H. M. Murray, McCord & Co., Cross, representatives of the company, put a stream from the bottom of the mill to the top against a strong wind on Tuesday after-\n\nnoon while giving an exhibition of practice. It will maintain its pressure from start to finish, entirely out of sight of the firemen to extinguish. This chemical fuel is harmless to goods of any description, which is one of the great advantages of the apparatus, and is considered by experts as a very satisfactory one and the directors of the mill are to be congratulated on securing this system.\n\nNEW FIRE APPARATUS\n\nThe Okotoks Review, May 7th, 1924.\n\nThe Okotoks Milling Co. had a new fire apparatus installed yesterday. It is a system of liquid carburet gas, furnished by the Brandon Fire Engine Company, and known as the Ever Ready Fire Fighting Apparatus. Each fire engine is so equipped with piping runs all through the building, with sixty feet of hose on each floor. It is understood that the fire would have been extinguished from any floor by simply pulling a wire which starts the system. The same result is given whether inside or outside the building. It will throw a stream of water and gas on to the fire, and Mr. H. M. Murray, McCord & Co., Cross, representatives of the company, put a stream from the bottom of the mill to the top against a strong wind on Tuesday after-\n\nnoon while giving an exhibition of practice.

I was not there when the alarm was given, but was on the ground a minute or two afterward. When I got there I found that the boys had the engine running and were doing their best to put out the fire. The fire was in the printing office and was going in good shape when they came. They had the hose connected to a hydrant and had much water, and the whole interior of the place was filled with water, looking bad from the first.\n\nNow, coming back from a chief fire, and every body who saw the work she did, had in praise of it. We all thought that the fire would have been put out herself last night.\n\nThere is another shop is next door and if the fire in the printing office had got beyond control I don't think we could have saved it.\n\nI am writing this just to let you know what we think of your fire extinguisher. We have never had any trouble with the hiders, which by the way, we are always will.\n\nWishing you every success and prosperity.\n\nYours truly,\n\nC. H. JACKSON,\nChief of O.K.

We do not use acid or soda, or any chemicals whatever; we use carbonic acid gas to put out fires, the water merely serving as a medium to carry the gas to the seat of the fire.\n\nWe throw out of all our extinguishers a stream twenty times as effective as any equal volume of water.\n\nOur principal, in a few words, consisting in the application of liquid carbonic acid gas to a tank of water as a source of constant pressure and the utilization at the same time of the well known extinguishing powers of this gas.\n\nThe ordinary chemical engine, or chemical extinguisher, by the use of sulphuric acid and bicarbonate of soda, together with the water in the tank, is thrown out when the extinguisher is brought into action.\n\nThe Ever Ready extinguisher discharges nothing but clean water, charged with carbonic acid gas.\n\nEvery fireman in the land knows to his cost the damage done by corrosive discharges of the ordinary chemical.\n\nThe discharges from the Ever Ready does no damage, it will not soil the most delicate fabric.\n\nAnother Important Comparison\n\nOnce the ordinary chemical extinguisher is brought into action it must be thoroughly discharged before it can be reloaded. You can use any portion of the contents of the Ever Ready and save the remainder for future use.\n\nWhat We Claim for the Ever Ready\n\nWe have no desire to disparage the merits of other extinguishers they are all more or less efficient, and have saved thousands of lives and millions of dollars from destruction by fire. We state, however, and are prepared to prove our statement, that we have the latest development of the carbonic acid gas extinguisher.\n\nThere has been practically no improvement in the carbonic acid gas extinguisher in a quarter of a century. All manufacturers still cling to the acid soda method of generating gas within the apparatus. This involves the discharge of a dirty dangerous corrosive mixture of carbonate and sulphate of soda, with generally a proportion of unneutralized sulphuric acid.\n\nThe Ever Ready discharges only carbonic acid gas dissolved in clean water, and claims to have all the advantages of the chemical stream without any chemicals.\n\nWe claim to have the only extinguisher in which the pressure is under absolute control. There is no extinguisher, except the Ever Ready that can be entirely discharged without the reduction of pressure, and the consequent loss of efficiency.\n\nIt is necessary in all acid soda extinguishers to wholly discharge the contents of the tank when once the acid is allowed to mix with the soda solution.\n\nThe pressure in every acid soda extinguisher is an unknown quantity, and varies with the purity and conditions of the chemicals used.\n\nThe pressure in the Ever Ready is under absolute control, and does not rise when the discharge is shut off to a dangerous point as in all acid soda chemicals. In fact it does not rise at all, but stands at the point it is set for whether the machine is discharging or not.\n\nA Few Pertinent Facts\n\n1. Since the discharge from the Ever Ready is a stream of gas to one of water, and as the gas is even more effective in extinguishing fires, it is evident that the volume of liquid to be discharged from an Ever Ready to extinguish fires is less than one twentieth of that required for a system using water only. This means one twentieth of the water damaged.\n\n2. We have demonstrated that the Ever Ready system is the most efficient, the most reliable and the most up-to-date system of protection against fire that has ever been invented.\n\n3. We use the very best material that money can buy in the construction of our apparatus.\n\n4. Our system has the most unqualified endorsement of every practical fire fighter who has seen it.\n\n5. All our apparatus is thoroughly tested before leaving the factory, and is installed by expert workmen.\n\n6. Our apparatus is guaranteed to do all, and more than all we claim for it.\n\n7. We will reduce your insurance premiums.\n\n8. We send an expert to instruct you how to use it and test it.\n\nThe \"Ever-Ready\" Fire Extinguishers\n\nVery Interesting Display of Fire Fighting Apparatus at the Fair\n\nA very interesting display of fire fighting apparatus is made at the provincial fair by The Brandon Fire Engine Co., of which John Empey, of 10th avenue west, is manager, of the Calgary branch. The 'Ever Ready' fire extinguisher is a perfect fire extinguisher adapted to the need of cities, towns, villages or wherever a fire engine is needed. For small towns where it is impracticable to maintain a fire department, it is especially adapted as a property preserver, while to the farmer it is indispensable, and often saves many times its cost. The Ever Ready system differs from the ordinary acid soda system in that liquefied carbonic acid gas is used as a source of pressure as well as utilizing the well known extinguishing powers of the gas. There is no discharge of dirty corrosive chemical mixtures from the engine, which is one of the chief objections to the chemical engine.\n\nThe tanks are made of seamless steel, lined with black tin and the workmanship and arrangement for discharge and refilling are as perfect as the highest skill can make them.\n\nThe Ever Ready \"Double Fifty\" is a perfect machine, fully equipped with a 100 ft of inch hose, two four-gallon hand extinguishers, four gas drums,\nAbsolutely Perfect Fire Protection for Churches, Hotels, Schools, Stores\n\nMANUFACTURED BY THE BRANDON FIRE ENGINE CO., LTD.\n\nFrank Kelley, Esq.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs representative of the Ever Ready Fire Extinguisher I am addressing you in reference to supplying the Squamish Indian School and Church in North Vancouver with some of our apparatus. I paid a visit to the school yesterday afternoon; was informed by the Reverend Superior in charge that I should have to apply to you in regard to any perquisites necessary for the Institution.\n\nOur system of fire protection, as explained in the enclosed catalogue, should appeal to your Department very considerably. The Brandon Fire Engine Co., Ltd. in furnishing a destroyer of fire use nothing but the pure liquid carbonic acid gas in addition to pure water, as you are aware the ordinary chemicals in all fire extinguishers consist of sulphuric acid and soda which generate a carbonic gas, but the great fault with these ingredients is that when combined they form a gas which destroys a fire nevertheless the two compositions have not sufficient time...\nWhen being mixed for fire purposes to thoroughly dissolve, consequently, the undissolved sulphuric acid and soda are discharged with the water and gas; whatever they touch they burn or stain, causing a damage.\n\nIn our system there are no damaging materials to follow the discharge. A hand, by dipping mops of wet cloth with our water is first of all non-effective\u2014as all the gas carbonates the water\u2014so clean, doing no more damage than what would do pure water, and very much cheaper, as to discharge a four gallon extinguisher will cost but $2.5 whereas the proportions of soda and acid would cost $10.\n\nI am sure that you will appreciate the merits of our system, and am writing to ask the privilege of placing say four hand extinguishers in the Squamish school and Church and out buildings.

The other schools depend entirely\nupon the open windows and, in some instances, ventilating trap-doors\nin the ceilings of the dormitories only.\n\nAs regards hospital accommodation, all the schools are well\nequipped in this respect, having separate rooms for this purpose\nand in some instances outside buildings.\n\nAll the schools have sufficient land for farming or gardening\nwhere it is necessary that these occupations should be taught,\nand some of them have carpenter-shops, where instructions are given\nin the rudimentary principles of house building and general car-\npenter work is given.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6467, file 889-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe schools are all in a good state of repair, with the exception of the Alberni school, in which the plastering on some of the walls needs considerable overhauling. The class room of this school is a very poor affair indeed, but the principal has been advised that he is to receive a grant of $1100 from the church for the construction of a new class room, which is to be built during the coming summer. The class room of this school is outside of the main building.\n\nI would recommend that the schools be allowed to receive the increased grant on the 1st of April and that they be given a limited time to make any necessary alterations in order to bring them up to the required specifications.\n\nDetails in connection with the different schools are enclosed herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nV.P.

Welch, O.M.I.,\n58 Blackwood St.,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nSquamish Mission\n\nIndian Boarding School\n\nNorth Vancouver, B.C., April 20th, 1880.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to write you confidentially about my Financial Statement. So far\u2014That is for 3 years\u2014I have succeeded with the Grant and some little donations to cover my expenses; but this past year, owing to the high cost of living, I could not.\n\nStill this I would not mind so much were it not for some repairs that must be done immediately. There are the foundation of school which threaten to collapse and the drain for the waste water. Two weeks ago I had a carpenter around the building and he said that approximately the job would cost $200.00, and I have not the first cent to begin with, since I am behind.\n\nWhat shall I do? Borrow at 5%? This I cannot do, for I do not want to run into debt.\n\nWell, dear Sir, let me make an appeal to the generosity of the Department to help me in such bad straits. I know they cannot raise the Grant of our school without raising the others, but this help they will not refuse to a poor man who has devoted nearly all his life to the welfare of the Indians and felt so badly the lack of funds at the present time.\n\nHoping my humble request shall be granted and thanking you before hand I remain\n\nYour very respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6467, file 889-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI beg to forward, herewith, a communication received from the Rev. Sister Mary Amy, Principal of the Squamish Mission Indian Boarding School, in which the Writer makes an appeal for financial assistance to enable her to repair the foundation of the School Building and also the Sewerage System.\n\nI frequently visit this School and I can assure you that everything possible is being done for the mental and moral benefit of the Indians.\n\nThe building, as stated in the communication referred to, is in need of repair and also the sewerage system, and I would respectfully recommend that, if possible, favourable consideration be given the Principal's appeal.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMay 27, 1920.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, with reference to repairs to the foundation and sewerage system of the Squamish Mission Indian boarding school.\n\nI regret that our appropriation is so limited, that it is difficult to find funds for these and many other needed improvements. This, however, appears to me to be a case in which the Indians should interest themselves. The various Squamish bands, for whose benefit the school was erected and is being conducted, have a capital fund of $86,244.13, and the amount of interest at the present time to their credit is $7,478.50. I feel confident that if you laid the matter before them and used your influence with them, they would agree to perform these very necessary repairs, and have the cost charged to either one of these funds.\n\nKindly do so, and let me hear from you. In the meantime you might acknowledge this letter and let me know whether you can probably carry out this request.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nPeter Byrne, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nIndian Boarding School\n\nNorth Vancouver, B.C., May 5th, 1890\n\nDear Sir:\n\nA few weeks ago I took the liberty of writing to you asking you a bonus in favor of the Squamish Indian School, for you know that owing to the cost of living, it is impossible to have any spare store in the buildings and that the school building is threatening to collapse at any time if the basement is not repaired immediately.\n\nDear Sir, I am certain that you do not want any accident to happen nor the school to be closed.\n\nIn order to prevent this I make another urgent appeal to the kindness of the Department.

The Sister Superior will be financially in a better condition than in the past years, as the payments mentioned above are being made direct to her.\n\nI regret that the school authorities will have to rely upon their own resources for these needed improvements.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

I believe Mr. Cairns mentioned this in his report.\n\nI have also been informed that the matter was brought to the attention of my predecessor, the late Indian Agent Byrne, but I do not know whether he brought the matter to the Department's attention or not.\n\nSince visiting this school I have received a letter in the same connection from the Chief of the Fire Department of North Vancouver, of which the following is a copy:\n\n\"FIRE DEPARTMENT\nNorth Vancouver, B.C., Dec. 5, 1922.\n\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe St. Paul's Schools,\nKeith Rd. West,\nCity of North Vancouver.\n\nI wish to draw your attention to the absence of fire escapes on the above school building, in order to provide proper escape for the inmates in case of fire.\n\nHaving in mind the construction and age of this building, and the fact that boys and girls are sleeping on the third floor in certain wings, with the only access being over the usual stairway which leads to a passage in the centre of the building, and in all probability would be completely cut off for this use, you will agree with me that the result in the event of fire would be nothing short of disastrous.\n\nAs the majority of the inmates are Indian children I trust that your Department will have sufficient interest in the matter to give it your immediate attention.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n(sgd) W. Murphy,\nChief of Fire Dept.\"\n\nI would recommend that suitable fire escapes be provided for this institution, and if this recommendation is approved by the Department, I shall appreciate being instructed to call for...\nSir,\n\n...in order that we may ascertain what the cost of an installation of fire escapes would be, which information would later be given the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.C.

It has been suggested that wooden outside stairs be built, allowing an exit through a room which is convenient to the dormitories and is easily supervised. If you and the Rev. Sister Superior are satisfied that this type of fire escape is adequate, you are authorized to purchase the material necessary, after securing competitive prices, and to engage a carpenter competent to erect the stairs.\n\nIf such equipment is deemed unsuitable, you will please make a recommendation to the Department, after securing an estimate of the cost of the fire escape desired.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Improperly charged.\n2. Charged when installed, no attention after.\n3. Discharged at a fire and re-charging overlooked.\n\nOur service takes care of such matters and gives the best possible assurance that your extinguishers are always in good working condition and ready for all emergencies on the moment.\n\nThis Company's service seal and charge labels attached to extinguishers, are officially recognized and thoroughly endorsed by Underwriters and Fire Department Officials. Seals are so adjusted as to make it an impossibility for any person to tamper with extinguishers without breaking the seal. Labels show at a glance the condition at all times.\n\nEnclosed rate card proves that we can give this at a cost that is actually less than you can re-charge extinguishers yourself, not counting your employees time on same. In addition to this you are assured that they are looked after in the proper manner and thoroughly inspected every three months. Every inspection is reported to you in detail and a copy of same forwarded the Underwriter's Association.\n\nWe are pleased to quote on General Fire Inspection service covering, Fire Alarm Gongs and Batteries, Fire Hose, Racks, Fire Doors, Fire Escapes, Hydrants and would welcome an opportunity to bid on any fire fighting appliances you may be installing on your premises in the near future.\n\nThanking you in anticipation of your favorable consideration,\n\nYours truly,\n\nFire Protection & Supply Co.\n\nOUR SERVICES APPROVED BY THE B.C.

Perry, Esq.,\n407 Holden Building,\nCity.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nRegarding Fire Extinguishers at present installed at St Paul's School, North Vancouver, we are pleased to quote you at follows:-\n\nRecharging & Inspection Service per annum,...$1.25 each Including Chemical Extinguisher.\n\nEnclosed letter explains the above service in detail. Our \"General Fire Inspection\" service, should you care to adopt same, would cover the whole Fire Equipment with the following charges.\n\nFire Alarm System,..........................$2.50 per annum.\nThe system is thoroughly inspected every three months. Batteries and Gongs tested, gong clappers and mechanism lubricated.\n\nFire Hose (per Hose) ......................... $1.00 per annum.\nAll couplings, valves, nozzles and gaskets examined every three months and water run through at least every twelve months. This greatly increases the life of hose.\n\nFire Pails Cleaned out and refilled once every three months. Per Pail, ......................... 25\u00a2 per annum.\n\nA written report is made the day following each inspection. Report also covers any fire equipment such as Fire Escapes &c. A fire drill will be carried out at each inspection and pupils instructed in the use of various appliances installed.\n\nAwaiting your further commands, we remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nFIRE PROTECTION & SUPPLY CO.\n\nO. L. L.\nSupt.\n\nEncl. INSPECTION DEPARTMENT OF FIRE PROTECTION & SUPPLY CO.\nReverend Sister:\n\nRegarding inspection made this afternoon, in company with the Fire Chief, we beg to make a report covering the Fire Protection, and respectfully submit suggestions as follows:\n\n**FIRE ALARM GONGS:** In very poor condition. Wiring in places defective and circuits installed in series, making upper gongs weak.\n\nThe whole system should be re-wired and present electric light switches replaced by standard Fire Alarm Switches.\n\nAt least two additional gongs should be installed, as those on upper floors are small, and we very much doubt if the children would be awakened by them in an emergency.\n\n**FIRE EXTINGUISHERS:** In good condition but need re-charging. These extinguishers must be re-charged periodically to be efficient and ready for instant action.\n\n**FIRE HOSE:** The fabric of same is very much deteriorated. Should be replaced by hose of less bulk. Present size is very heavy and would prove most difficult for a Sister or Child to handle in case of fire.\n\n**FIRE ESCAPES:** There are no outside escapes. The only way of exit is down the stairway. Position of this stairway, through the centre of the building, would make this a very risky way of exit in case of fire, as the chances are that smoke and flames would make descent impossible. Outside escapes should be provided, two from the Girls' Dormitory and one from the Boys'. Either permanent stairway escapes, or automatic ladders could be used.\n\nAs suggested by you, we phoned Mr. C.C. Perry, who advised our writing you covering a requisition regarding this matter. We are sending Mr. Perry a copy of this letter also.\n\nThanking you for courtesies extended the writer, we remain,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nFIRE PROTECTION & SUPPLY CO.\n\n[Signature]\n\nO.L.L./S.\n\nSupt.\n\nINSPECTION DEPARTMENT OF FIRE PROTECTION & SUPPLY.\nC.C.Perry Esq.,\n403 Holden Bldg.,\nCITY.\n\nFeb.20th.1923.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed please find copy of letter mailed to the Sister Superior of the St. Paul's School, North Vancouver.\n\nMay we respectfully venture to point out that the Fire Protection of the premises is in a very serious condition.\n\nWe hope that you will not think us presuming in any way by stating the facts in this manner, but the dangerous state existing from a life-saving point of view is really most serious indeed, and we feel that it cannot conscientiously be overlooked. It is therefore that we consider it our duty to draw the matter to your attention.\n\nThe writer hopes to have the pleasure of calling on you in the immediate future. Advice or suggestions that we are able to offer, in Fire Protection and Prevention matters, is entirely at your disposal without any obligation to you in any way what-so-ever.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFIRE PROTECTION & SUPPLY CO.\n\nO.L.L./S.\nSupt.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nOUR SERVICES APPROVED BY THE B. C. FIRE UNDERWRITERS ASSOCIATION.\nFIRE GUN is made in Canada under the supervision and is recommended by Underwriters Laboratories. Each extinguisher bears the official label of inspection and approval.\n\nFIRE-GUN is furnished in the following finishes: Polished Brass and Red, White, and Black Enamel. Each extinguisher is put up in individual sealed cartons, complete with bracket or holder.\n\nFor Sale by\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6467, file 889-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nFire-Gun as a Protection against Fire Danger\n\nFIRE-GUN is a hand fire extinguisher. It puts out little fires before they get to be big ones. The small fire is the great menace. Almost invariably the big fire comes from a little one. Where that danger exists FIRE-GUN should be on guard.\n\nIn FIRE-GUN we have produced a new liquid pump which is positively double acting from the first stroke until it is absolutely empty, thereby overcoming the great defect found in others which are only double acting when nearly full.\n\nThe mechanical construction of FIRE-GUN is so perfect that it never pumps air. It never splutters or dribbles, but shoots a solid stream thirty or forty feet. FIRE-GUN is built to stand rough usage. All parts are so strong and well protected that it never leaks or fails to operate. New from the factory or after standing for years, it shoots a faster, steadier stream than any other hand extinguisher.\n\nAfter all, the supreme test is, how quickly can the fluid be shot into a fire. Due to the reliability of our pump and its perfect mechanical construction, FIRE GUN is emptied in about half the number of strokes required by any other one quart type extinguisher.\n\nFIRE-GUN FLUID is effective where water is useless. It will not deteriorate, is a non-conductor of electricity, does not freeze at 50 degrees below zero, and will not damage machinery or delicate fabrics.\n\nImmediately it strikes the heat it forms a heavy blanket of non-combustible gas which crowds out the air and puts out the fire. It is, therefore, especially effective on burning liquids such as gasoline, kerosene, kitchen fires of burning fats, etc., or rapidly burning materials, such as celluloid; of fabrics, such as cotton-burlap and cloth; or combination of these, such as waste saturated with oil; and on all electrical fires.\n\nINSURANCE DISCOUNTS ALLOWED BY ALL RATING AUTHORITIES\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that during a recent visit to the Squamish Indian Mission Boarding School at North Vancouver, my attention was called by the Mother Superior, to the fact that the fire-extinguishers, which have been in use there for some time (6 in number) were in need of re-charging and whilst inspecting the premises, with the city Building Inspector, and fire-Department's officials, the service of the Fire Protection & Supply Co., of Vancouver, B.C., was brought to my attention in this connection.\n\nI beg to submit herewith a file having reference to this subject and would recommend that authority be given me to have these extinguishers re-charged, if it is the intention of the Department that this be done.\n\nThe letter of Charles Mulvey, dated 21st of February, will outline the customary charges for this service.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.G. Perry,\nIndian Agent.\n\n[Seal]\nSecretary,\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, March 22nd, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, enclosing correspondence which you received from the Fire Protection & Supply Co., Vancouver, regarding the fire equipment at the Squamish Indian Boarding School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may arrange to have the 6 fire extinguishers which are in use re-charged and placed in good condition. You should also arrange to have the fire alarm gongs thoroughly overhauled and any repairs required carried out. If necessary, the system should be re-wired and 2 additional gongs installed on the upper floors to replace the present gongs which are too small for the purpose.\n\nRegarding fire hose, I beg to say that the Department will be prepared to authorize the supply of the quantity of hose considered absolutely necessary for the purpose, also any nozzles, couplings, etc., required.\n\nIn the carrying out of the above repairs, alterations and purchase of new fire equipment, the cost should be kept down to the lowest possible point, and in the making of any purchases competitive prices should be obtained. We are not prepared to authorize a regular inspection service.\n\nRegarding the fire escapes, I beg to refer you to official letter of December 30th, last, in which you were requested to make a recommendation to the Department after securing an estimate of the cost of the fire escapes desired.\n\nYou should arrange to have the extinguishers, fire gongs and fire hose overhauled and placed in good condition as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Perry,\nIndian Agent,\n404 Holden Bldg.,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn response to your letter of the 18th instant, I have inspected the building and plumbing work referred to.\n\nThe floor of the building has recently been repaired and is approximately 1/4 inches out of level at the water intake which would naturally trap the water, causing it to freeze and burst the pipe.\n\nRe Plumbing:\nI find the laundry tubs at the South east end of the building to be 1/2 inch out of level, which would trap the water making it impossible to drain the pipes.\n\nOn the North east side I find that the plumber has put in the tubs running with the floor, while being approximately 1/2 inches out of level forms a trap, causing the pipes to burst when frozen.\n\nThere is plenty of fall to the waste pipe to carry off the water and they are properly vented.\n\nMr. Young claims that the floor has settled since he put in these tubs, and although he claims the fault is not his, he is willing to put the plumbing in good condition providing the floor is made level.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(signed) J.W.

It had been found following the installation of the traps, that portions of the plumbing had been frozen and pipes burst; and upon investigation it was discovered that while two small sags were found in the pipe which prevented the pipes from emptying when the water was turned off during the frosty period, it was also found that the reason for the pipes sagging in this way was that a new floor had been put in by the school authorities in the laundry room, immediately prior to the installation of the traps, which were found to be half an inch out of level at the south-east end of the room, being one and a quarter inches out of level on the north-east side, thus forming traps in the piping which caused them to burst. This condition has now been corrected, and I am submitting herewith the account for the same, together with a copy of the inspector's report and an abstract of tenders, which were asked for by Mr. School-Inspector Cairns and myself, in personal interviews with the companies tendering. I would recommend payment of the account.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.G.

The Department views this programme with favour and agrees that the best site would be on that part of the reserve nearest to the school. Please get in touch with interested members of the Band and have a rough sketch prepared indicating the size and accommodation which should be provided in the building. This should be submitted to the Department with a recommendation as to the method of erecting the building, i.e., by contract or by day labour. You should also secure as accurate an estimate as possible of the total cost, including furnishings.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nChas. C.

In September, 1923, we supplied 24 desks and 4 rear seats for this school. I have to request that you will state whether the desks now asked for are absolutely required at the present time or not. I may say that our funds are extremely limited and, unless the desks are absolutely required to carry on the classroom work successfully, we would not be prepared to supply same during the present fiscal year. After taking this matter up with the Principal, please furnish your report as to whether the supplying of these desks can stand over for the present or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

In reply I have to inform you that there are many pressing claims upon the Appropriation for Indian Education and the various building requirements have to be considered in order of urgency. You should inform the council that their representations have been noted but that, at the present time, there are no funds available for the purpose.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D.

Quotation in respect of these quantities being \u00a377.30 put up. (Seventy Seven Dollars Thirty Cents).\n\nWe would advise that Mr. Percival has gone very thoroughly into the matter of these furnace repairs, and are quite satisfied that when necessary repairs as outlined are supplied to the different furnaces, they will again be practically as when originally installed, although from a heating standpoint, Mr. Percival's proposal of installing the Hercules Furnace would be much more efficient insofar as replacing the #6-20B Series as previously mentioned.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. T. McArthur & Co., LTD.\n\nPer.\n\nHSH/LG\nI have the honour to advise the Department that I have received from the Rev. Principal of St. Paul's Indian Residential School, North Vancouver, a request for expenditure in connection with the overhaul and repair of furnaces at the residential school. It will be noted that the work is under way and that the Rev. Principal is seeking reimbursement of the cost. I would point out that these items have been included in my Agency estimates for the fiscal year 1928-29, so that it may be considered in that connection should the Department be unprepared at present to provide an appropriation for this work from current funds. I would recommend that the Department's favorable consideration be given to this request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(C.G.

Your instructions regarding the submission of accounts have been carefully noted and will be duly carried out.\n\nWhile on the subject of the official name of this school, I beg to enclose herewith a page from the City of Vancouver telephone book, where it will be seen that the Roman Catholic authorities have listed this school as St. Paul's and the same name is used in the City of North Vancouver as well. I would point out that I have reminded the Reverend Sisters in charge of the school of the official name as desired by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(C.C.Perry)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSquamish Residential School\nNorth Vancouver B.C.\nOct. 17th 1927.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour circular dated Oct. 6th reached me in due time. In reply I beg to say that there are two fire escapes in the girls' dormitory, the doors of which are not fastened and open outside, besides two staircases.\n\nFor the boys' dormitories there is only one fire escape located in the big boys' dormitory, with two windows opening on it. The little boys' dormitory is only five spaces from this fire escape, it is true; but in case of emergency another fire escape would be needed.\n\nWe have a sufficient number of fire extinguishers set at strategic places and the children are drilled occasionally. Our engaged man sleeps in a cottage not far from the main building and has a telephone.\n\nBefore retiring, that is about 10 o'clock, two Sisters visit the basement, furnace and kitchen. Besides, winter not being very severe in B.C., we very seldom keep fire going during the night.\n\nHoping that these explanations will prove satisfactory, I am, dear Sir,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6467, file 889-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, October 25, 1927.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, reporting on the fire equipment in connection with the Squamish Indian Residential School. We are requesting Mr. Agent Perry to furnish a report regarding the installation of fire equipment in connection with the junior boys' dormitories, and to forward an estimate of the cost and type of equipment he would recommend be installed. When we have his report, consideration will be given to the installing of another fire escape for the use of the dormitory occupied by the smaller boys.\n\nWe note that there are a sufficient number of fire extinguishers, which are placed at convenient points throughout the building. I shall be pleased if you will see that the chemicals in these extinguishers are in good condition, and if any refills are required, you should arrange to see that same are installed. Accounts covering the cost of any new refills for the extinguishers should be handed to Mr. Agent Perry to be certified by him in the usual manner and forwarded to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Sister Mary Amy,\nPrincipal,\nSquamish Indian Residential School,\nNorth Vancouver, B.C.\nOttawa, October 25, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received a communication from the Rev. Sister Superior of the Squamish Indian Residential School relative to the fire escape facilities at the school. She states that there is only one fire escape for the boys' dormitories, which is located on the big boys' dormitory, with two windows opening on to it and that the smaller boys' dormitory is only a few paces from this fire escape, but that in case of emergency another fire escape is needed.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will enquire into the fire escape facilities at this school and furnish a report regarding the installing of another fire escape for the use of the junior boys. Please state the type of escape you would recommend and the cost of installing same. The Department will expect you to give this matter your early attention.\n\nWe are authorizing the Principal to obtain any refills required for the fire extinguishers and to hand the account therefor to you, which you should certify in the usual manner and send to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

C.

This work, which was authorized by departmental telegram dated February 9th, instant, is now being carried out and will be completed with the work of the Auditorium.\nOttawa, March 8, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 23rd ultimo, I have to inform you that an accountable Indian Education cheque for $450 is going forward by today's mail. This is for the sewage disposal scheme for the Squamish Indian Residential School. I should be grateful if you would make an early accounting for these funds, as the fiscal year will soon be ended.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

Manager.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6467, file 889-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of Departmental letter of the 8th March instant, No. 167-1-5, covering cheque for $450 sent to me for the wages in connection with the construction of the Squamish Indian Residential School portion of a joint sewerage disposal system with the Squamish Auditorium Building through the Mission Reserve No. 1, to the City of North Vancouver sewer outfall. In this connection I beg to transmit herewith Voucher No. 3056, attached to which are returns of labor for the weeks ending February 25th, March 10th, and March 17th, amounting to a total of $429.35 leaving an unexpended balance to date of $10.65, which amount is being returned here-with by Bank Draft No. 342, as the Fiscal Year closes in a few days.\n\nWhen the sewerage work was recommended, it was estimated that the cost would be approximately $600.00, $450.00 of which would be charged against the Schools Vote and $150.00 against the Squamish Auditorium building. The latter connection was made at a less cost than estimated viz: $130.30. The School portion, however, will exceed the amount asked for, for when the estimate was given the City Engineer gave Mr. Shockley to understand that excavation to about five (5) feet depth only would be necessary whereas on proceeding with the undertaking no less than twelve feet were found necessary to excavate, several feet of depth of which excavation was through hard compressed clay almost amounting to hardpan which, with boulders to remove, made the work much more difficult and protracted.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMarch 26, 1928.\n\nIt is expected that the work will be finished by about March 28th. - 29th., but the cost will exceed the estimate by\n\n1. Cost of vitrified pipe, as per Voucher 3051 - $134.50\n2. Cost of cement, as per Voucher No. 3050 - $7.60\n3. Cost of labor from March 19th. to 24th. as per return herewith, Voucher No. 3057 - $279.20\n4. Also cost of labor for March 26th. to about March 28th.)\n\nThe Vouchers for the pipe and cement are sent herewith numbered 3051 and 3050. The labor returns for the week ended March 24th. are sent herewith attached to Voucher numbered 3057. I shall thank the Department to have the cheque sent to me for labor payments as soon as possible.\n\nI trust that the action taken to carry the work through to completion as early as possible will be approved. To have left the sewer half-completed would have greatly increased the menace caused by the inundation by sewerage from the boarding school of a considerable portion of the residential part of Squamish Reserve, as well as leave dangerous excavation open with menace of accidents.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(C.C.

H. Shockley, the Vancouver contractor who had charge of the work in question, that Mr. Andrew Paul, one of the payees, who is also Secretary of the Squamish Band of Indians, requested him to advance the labor payments under these returns as the Indians were hard pressed owing their having to wait for their money from Ottawa and that Mr. Shockley had granted their request. The two cheques above mentioned therefore have been endorsed by me in Mr. Shockley's favor and the wage receipts for all payments made to the workers and duly witnessed are sent herewith attached to the vouchers and returns. I trust that this action will be satisfactory to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\n(G.C.

In reply I beg to say that I consider these desks necessary in order to insure uniformity in the classrooms, as the children boarding in the Residential School and the pupils of the Indian Day School are mixed in the different rooms according to the grades they are in. The new building which is being used as a Day School accommodates some ten or twelve pupils of the Residential School (Beginners) while the other two classrooms in the Residential School take all pupils from grade 2. to grade 8. Besides this some would-be boarders will have to content themselves with being day pupils only, as there is no room available for them in the Residential School.\n\nThe desks asked for will be No.5, and would cost $6.50 each and are manufactured by the East Pipe and Foundry Co., Vancouver, the same firm that supplied the desks under competitive tender as previously supplied.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 12, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 6th instant, I beg to say that you may order 6 No. 5 desks for the Squamish Indian Day School from the Tait Pipe & Foundry Company, Vancouver.

C., dated May 21st and 22nd, 1931, on his inspection of the SQUAMISH INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on File 167-1-6.\n\nLaundry:\n\nThere are two small boilers heated by a small fire. The cement in which these boilers are set is badly cracked. There are 12 tubs for washing the children's clothes. All the work is done by hand. The drying room is heated by a very small box heater. A much larger heater is very badly needed. This would not cost very much, and would help to dry the clothes in a much more satisfactory manner.\n\nKitchen:\n\nThe kitchen is clean. A new kitchen range is required. The old one is now worn out. The one supplied should be of modern design with warming ovens and large enough to supply the needs of about sixty people.\n\nDrainage:\n\nThe school is connected by sewerage pipes with the North Vancouver system. The bath accommodation is very poor indeed. There is only one bath on each side, (one for boys and one for girls). This only permits of a child having a bath once in two weeks which I do not consider sufficient. At the same time, I do not quite see where more baths could be put without building.\n\nThe toilet system is worse even than that of the baths. The boys' toilets are of a very ancient design. They are safe enough from a health point of view; but there is no toilet near the boys' dormitory. They have to go down to the basement even at night.\n\nThe wash rooms on girls' and boys' sides are kept very clean.\n\nGames: The children play all sorts of games. There is a covered shed for the boys. I would recommend that a swing and two climbing ropes be authorized. All that is wanted is about 50 feet of thick rope. The swing can be made at the school.\nOffice of Inspector of Schools,\n\nJuly 16, 1931.\n\nW.E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe attached correspondence has been forwarded to me by Mr. Indian Agent Ball of the Vancouver Agency. I do not know why Mr. Ball wishes me to take the matter of the repairs to the two laundry boilers at Squamish Residential School up with the Department in Ottawa. It appears to me to be very obviously the work of the Indian Agent.\n\nIn my report on the Squamish Residential School I referred to the laundry in the following terms:\n\nLaundry: There are two small boilers heated by a small fire. The cement in which these boilers is set is badly cracked. There are twelve tubs for washing the children's clothes. All the work is done by hand. The drying room is heated by a very small box heater. A very much larger heater is badly needed. This would not cost very much, and would help to dry the clothes in a much more satisfactory manner.\n\nA copy of the report on the Squamish Residential School was forwarded to you on June 8th 1931.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools.\nIndian Affair Department  \nOttawa Canada\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nWhen our worthy inspector Capt. G.H. Barry visited the school last May he could not help noticing that the buildings though kept in good repairs were far from being up to date. In the laundry, for instance, the two boilers and wringers have to be replaced immediately. Would you kindly send tenders to examine the work that has to be done, and oblige.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nSister M.

Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to inform you that the boys play room is in very poor condition, in fact the condition of the floor does not afford safety and cannot be used until completely renewed. The walls too are very dilapidated.\n\nI therefore ask you to send tenders to examine the building, and at the same time apply for the lumber necessary for this urgent reparation; the work will be done by the big boys of the school under the direction of Mr. Goumain, our workman.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nSister Hieronymie\nActing Principal\nSir:\n\nThe Squamish Residential School has made strong representations to have the laundry repaired also the boys' play room.\n\nThe laundry is referred to in the accompanying correspondence and I find it requires two boilers complete with brickwork and two wringers. The boilers are cracked beyond repair and the wringers are worn out. I have obtained prices which are as follows:\n\n2 wringers @ $20.00.............$40.00,\n2 boilers complete @ $45.00....90.00,\n\n$130.00\n\nThe playroom requires lumber only, the work can be done by the school workman and the larger boys without cost. I have not had anyone look at this as it is impossible to say what will have to be renewed until the floor, etc. is taken up but I believe $50.00 would cover the cost of material required to make it safe and respectfully recommend that these jobs be authorized.\n\nEnclosures:-\n\nB/HM.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 9, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 2693 of the 2nd instant, with reference to replacements at the Squamish Indian Residential School. You may secure, from suitable sources of supply, two wringers and two boilers for the laundry, at an estimated total cost of $130. You may also purchase $50 worth of lumber to repair the flooring in the playroom. Please ask the school management to be responsible for all installation or labour costs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nSecretary\n\nF. J. C.

Barry advised the Principal that bathing facilities were inadequate and to ask for further accommodation. There is only one bath for about 30 boys and the Principal has applied for another bath for the boys. There are two baths for the girls. Personally I consider three shower baths would be more suitable in every way and would not take up any more room than one bath.

All precautions are taken against fire and a new furnace was installed recently.\n\nSome of the Council reported that the roof was unsafe. Would it be possible to have the Public Works Department make an examination of it? I cannot say personally whether there is any danger, but I think it is largely imaginary.\n\nOf course many things could be pointed out as needing repair or re-building, if funds were available.\n\nRegarding the question of returning children home who have been brought from other agencies to this School, the children have been recruited from various places, but on the other hand, some of the Squamish Indians are attending other schools.

Ball,\n822 Metropolitan Bldg.,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn recent years it has been necessary to make many expensive repairs to keep the school in an inhabitable condition; furnaces had to be replaced, foundations had to be renewed, dormitories and class rooms had to be altered, play rooms repaired; and now our laundry which is in a ruinous condition, requires not only immediate repair, but an entire transformation of structure. We therefore appeal, through you, to the Government for aid. Twelve sanitary wash tubs and a urier are necessary and I have confidence that you will obtain them for us.\n\nWith this assurance I wish to thank you in advance for same.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFEB 16 1932\nSir:\n\nI have received the enclosed letter from the Principal of the Squamish Residential School and have advised her that as funds are extremely limited, it is doubtful whether any money is available for repairs to this school. I doubt whether it would warrant much expense as it appears to be such an old building.\n\nIf you consider the wash tubs and drier can be supplied during the present fiscal year, I will obtain prices but the Principal asks for an entire transformation of the laundry which will be expensive.\n\nThe Department is no doubt fully aware of the condition of this School but if not, I shall be pleased to make a detailed report upon it.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(F.J.C.Ball).\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnclosure:\n\nB/HM.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 2, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th ultimo, enclosing a communication from the Principal of the Squamish Indian Residential School in which he requests that wash tubs and a dryer be supplied.\n\nIn reply I have to say that our funds are extremely limited and, in view of the recent orders for strict economy, I regret that it will not be possible to supply this equipment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.R.

Res. Architect,\nDept. Public Works, Canada,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Inspection Furnaces, etc., at the\nIndian Industrial School, North Vancouver, B.C.\n\nOn August 16th I inspected the heating plant of the above\nbuilding. This plant consists of three hot air furnaces, as\nfollows:\n\n1 Sunbeam of 55,000 ft. capacity,\n1 Enterprise of 30,000 ft. capacity,\n1 Vulcan of 30,000 ft. capacity.\n\nThese furnaces are in a very fair state of repair, but under\nthe conditions which they are installed they would be subjected\nto a large amount of corrosion, as the basement floor is of\na clayey nature and is not cemented.\n\nOn the Enterprise furnace the outside shell had been cut out\nto allow the smoke pipe to pass through, and the hole had not\nafterwards been stopped up. There were also some parts of this\ncasing coming open. I pointed this out to the attendant and he\npromised that he would get some sheet asbestos and cover them\nup. There were also some small cracks in the front, which I\nrecommended to be stopped and filled with furnace cement.\n\nThe Vulcan furnace is new and in good condition, but there has\nbeen a new bunker built, one wall of which is much too close to\nthis furnace. I pointed this out to the attendant and Mother\nSuperior and they promised to remove it to a new position and\ncover the side nearest the furnace with some old sheet iron\nwhich was on the premises. The smoke pipe from this furnace is\ntoo close to the woodwork, unless it is covered with sheet\nasbestos, which I was promised would be done at once.\n\nThe Sunbeam furnace is in good condition, except the firebars,\nand a new set of these have been ordered.\n\nThis is a very old school, constructed of wood, and every\nprecaution must be taken to prevent fire. The whole place is\nin a very clean condition, but has a damp smell which the\nopenings left in the furnace casings must have conveyed up to\nthe building.\n\nThe approximate cost of materials for repairs mentioned above\nis Ten Dollars ($10.00).\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nT.

There were also some parts of this casing coming open. He states that he pointed this out to the school authorities and that he was promised that the repairs required would be carried out.\n\nHe further states that there was a new bunker built, one wall of which was much too close to the \"Vulcan\" furnace. He pointed this out to the Sister Superior, and states they promised to remove it to a new position and cover the side nearest the furnace with some sheet iron. He states that the smoke pipe from this furnace is too close to the woodwork, and that the school authorities promised that it would be covered with sheet asbestos.\n\nIt is further stated that a new set of firebars was required in the \"Sunbeam\" furnace, and that these had been ordered.\n\nHe states that, as this is an old school, constructed of wood, every precaution should be taken to prevent fire, and I would request that, on the occasion of your next visit to this school, you will see that the recommendations of the engineer who inspected the boilers are carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.

Replacement of this furnace, properly installed, will cost $748.00 and although the balance of the appropriation for this School is insufficient to meet the full cost, I would recommend that the expenditure of whatever funds are available be approved, the School to meet the balance of the cost.\n\nFor W.S.

Taylor)\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6467, file 889-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sister Superior,\n\nAt your inquiry, we have made a thorough examination of the furnace and equipment in the East wing of the school.\n\nThe furnace is past repair, prematurely, owing to an unbalanced system. The existing pipes etc., expanded end not fit for further use. I would point out that the pipes etc., are the original and probably have done duty to three or more replacement furnaces. It is definitely clear, that it never has at any time given proper warmth for the amount of fuel used. We suggest moving the many improvements you are making also enlarging of class rooms, etc., that it is very necessary that a planned new heating system be installed.\n\nA larger supply of warm air to the class rooms and dormitory, also return air from same. The wooden cold air duct from class room taken out and replaced with a larger capacity metal duct to be transferred to dormitory, and the special duct over sawdust bins and angle toward breezeway at point of entry into class room to not interfere with heavy load around furnace. A larger supply to class room, and a special duct vertical to Dormitory bringing in heat and distributing heat north and south directions. A duplicate furnace to the one installed last year in the East wing a Sunbeam #1048 all cast 24\" firepot will handle the efficiently. Replace other existing leaders with piping and angles etc. Also new and larger return air pipe from ducts to furnace. New heavy 22 Gge smoke pipes, and angles.\n\nOur estimate for this job with complete coal burning equipment supplied but left on of furnace and your sawdust burner installed with new fire-bricks $7465.00 Seven hundred forty eight dollars.\n\nAs there is considerable work to be done on this job and school opening very soon we would appreciate your earliest reply as we will give you precedence so has to complete before school opening.\n\nYours Very Truly\nTomlinson Heating & Sheet Metal.\n\nPer George Tomlinson Sr.\n\nC.O.P.Y.\nSeptember 15th, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Squamish Indian Residential School\n\nThe above mentioned school is Church-owned, and Indian Commissioner Arneil advises that the furnace is beyond repair.

In this connection it is noted that you have arranged with the Marshall-Wells Company to install a new furnace at a cost of $90.00. Your action in this matter is approved. I would request that you forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the furnace, before the middle of March, next, in order that payment can be made from our Appropriation for the current fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. P. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n203-6 Rogers Bldg.,\nVancouver, B. C.\nWith regard to the lack of proper accommodation for the senior pupils, I beg to report that in my opinion no time should be lost in changing the partitions in the upper part of the new manual training and auditorium building. All that is necessary is to move the present partition between the manual training shop ten or twelve feet over to the side on which the primary room is located, and then move the partition of the new senior room to a position at right angles to about ten feet into the manual training shop from the position formerly occupied by the partition between the manual training shop and the primary room. These moves which would not cost much will give two good sized classrooms and a slightly smaller manual training shop than we have at present. Why this was not done at first, a couple of years ago when the senior pupils were brought from the old building I do not know. The Indian Agent appears to have arranged for the erection of this and another partition, whose very single examination of the building would have shown that no such partitions should ever have been erected. Neither he nor the Department consulted me in this matter and the consequent result is that money will now be required to undo the mischief then carried out. THIS MATTER IS VITAL AND NEEDS ATTENTION BEFORE THE HOT WEATHER. The other new partition erected by the instructions of the Indian Agent in what was the old senior classroom, see Paragraphs 2 and 3 of my report on this school under date of January 25th and 26th, 1932, should be taken out at once and the room used as a classroom for the home study of the resident boys. The necessary fire escape ladder recommended in paragraph 3 of the same report has not been constructed and will not be needed when this room returns to a classroom, as it will not be then any more of a fire trap than the rest of this old school. The paragraphs mentioned above are those on the page of my last report headed Buildings.\n\nA new bath and toilet should be constructed on the boys' side in a room off the boys' dormitory formerly used by one of the staff. None of these recommendations will run into large sums of money. Much of the work can be done by the boys under a well qualified manual training instructor, and I would ask that this be considered in making an appointment to such a position in the future, should the Department agree with me in my recommendation under the heading of manual training below.\n\nFire Protection: There are two hydrants with hose,\nwhich has been tested. There are also eight chemical extinguishers, and a number of fire buckets. The extinguishers have been tested. THE FIRE BUCKETS WERE EMPTY when I visited the school. On the occasion of my last inspection, it was found that these buckets were empty, and I recommended that they be filled with water, and in some cases sand. I also recommended that the shelves on which these buckets rested should be lowered so that the big children could lift the buckets off the shelves and use them in case of fire, which they could not do able to do at present as the shelves are too high. This was all reported to the Department in January 1932; but no action seems to have been taken. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE FIRE RISK BE REDUCED AT THIS SCHOOL. It is a very old building, and if it ever takes fire I do not believe that much could be done to save it, even with modern engines. It is, therefore, very important that extinguishers and buckets be kept charged and available in case of the discovery of the beginning stages of fire. There are four fire gongs. Fire drills are held regularly and that carried out when I visited the school was quite satisfactory. The Fire Chief visits the school from time to time.\n\nDormitories: All the dormitories are kept in a perfectly neat and clean condition. I have made some recommendations above as to the creation of two new dormitories for the children, one boys' and one girls', in the rooms used up to this as dormitories for the Sisters of the Child Jesus, who were not actually teaching in this school and who have now gone to their new Convent.\n\nI notice that there are four beds in which two children sleep together. These eight small children should under the rules of the Department have eight beds, and I would ask the Department to enforce this very necessary rule.\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector Barry, in a report on his inspection, in March, last, of the Squamish Indian Residential School, draws attention to the lack of proper accommodation for the senior pupils. He states that changes should be made in the partitions in the upper part of the new manual training and auditorium building. It appears that all that is necessary is to move the present partition between the manual training shop approximately twelve feet into the boys' side on which the primary room is located and to move the partition of the new senior room to a position at right angles and about ten feet into the manual training shop, from the position formerly occupied by the partition between the manual training shop and the primary room. The moving of these partitions, which, it is considered, could be carried out with little expense, would give two good-sized classrooms and a slightly smaller manual training shop. Further, it appears that a partition which was erected in what was the old senior classroom should be removed and this room used as a classroom for the home study of the resident boys.\n\nThe Department does not appear to have any record regarding the installing of the partitions as at present located. It is considered that the change in location of these partitions, as outlined above, should be carried out at the earliest possible date, before the hot weather begins. No doubt, the work could be performed by the older boys, under the supervision of the manual training instructor, without expense to the Department. Should the boys be unable to do this work, I would request that you furnish the Department, as soon as possible, with an estimate of the cost.\n\nIt is recommended that a new bath and toilet be constructed on the boys' side, in a room off the boys' dormitory, formerly used by one of the staff. The Inspector states that the greater part of the work could be done by the boys, under the manual training instructor. You might inform the Department as to the cost of any materials and any outside labour required in installing the bath and toilet.\n\nI may add that we have no funds specially provided for alterations or repairs at this school, and, if any large expense is necessary in the moving of the partitions or the installing of the bath and toilet, we would not be prepared to authorize same.\n\nMr. Barry found that the fire buckets were empty when he visited the school. He recommends, also, that\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n203-6 Rogers Bldg.,\nVancouver, B. C.\nthe shelves on which these buckets rest be lowered, so that, in the event of fire, the older children could lift the buckets off the shelves - which they are not able to do, as at present the shelves are too high. The boys of the manual training class should be able to lower these shelves to the right height, and you should instruct the Principal and staff to see that the fire buckets are kept filled with water and, in some cases, sand, in order that they will be ready for immediate use. It is very important that all steps be taken to reduce fire risk in this school. The Department will rely on you to see that the staff keep all fire equipment in good condition and ready for use.\n\nRegarding the dormitories, the Inspector states he noticed that there were four beds in which two children sleep together. There should be a separate bed provided for each child, and I would request that you draw this matter to the attention of the Principal. She should arrange, as soon as possible, to supply the extra beds required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 5th instant with reference to Mr. Barry's report on the Squamish Residential School at North Vancouver.\n\nThe question of moving the partitions in the auditorium building was discussed with the Reverend Mother Principal some time ago but she was not enthusiastic about it. However this is a very small alteration and will be attended to if the Principal still wishes it.\n\nAs it is contemplated to dispense with the services of the present manual training instructor, I respectfully suggest that no alterations be made by him at the present time. While at Sechelt the boys who have had only a year or two training would be quite capable of doing this work, the Squamish boys could not do it.\n\nRegarding Paragraph 3, I reported two years ago that bathing facilities at the school both on the boys' and girls' side were inadequate and recommended shower baths such as we installed at Sechelt. They have proved a great success there and the Principal said every pupil in the school could have a daily bath in forty minutes, whereas bath-tubs mean practically a day's work and consequently they are not taken as frequently as they should be. I have also been advised that two children use the same bath water sometimes, which is most unsatisfactory.\n\nI regret I can not agree with the Inspector that \"the greater part of the work could be done by the boys\". They know little about carpentry and nothing about plumbing and even the manual training instructor can not do plumbing. On account of the cost of installing new plumbing fixtures in this old school, you ruled against the proposed shower baths and presumably such ruling would apply also with regard to baths and toilets.\n\nRegarding the fire buckets, these shelves will be lowered and the Reverend Principal advised to appoint some one to see that they are always filled. The Fire Department's inspector at North Vancouver who visits this school regularly when he visits the public schools, says these fire buckets are the only ones in the City of North Vancouver schools and he doubts their usefulness.....\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nusefulness. He says sand would not be advisable as it is useful only in garages and places where gasoline fires occur, but in any fire at this school it would have little effect. The fire extinguishers are re-filled and kept in thorough good order at all times and the school is only a few hundred yards from the fire hall.\n\nWith regard to the last paragraph, this was taken up with the Reverend Principal before Mr. Barry visited the school and I was advised that it was only a temporary arrangement which has been adjusted.\n\nThe various partitions which the Inspector found in the main school were built by the school janitor without expense to the Department.\n\nThe Reverend Sister Mary Amy, Principal, has recently built an exceptionally fine building which completely eclipses the school in every way. This building I understand is used as a home by the sisters who teach at the school. They formerly lived at the school and their removal has made extra space available in the school building for more pupils. I believe Inspector Barry has recommended increasing the pupilage to seventy, but this should be given the most careful consideration as there are several reasons why it would be inadvisable. I presume the Department would make full investigation before granting any such increase.\n\nInspector Barry might call on me occasionally when he visits schools in this Agency and discuss things before he makes his reports so that matters which have already been dealt with by the Department are not reported again as new business, causing confusion and unnecessary correspondence.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6467, file 883-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nExtract from Requisition for School Material dated July 8th, 1935, from the Principal of the Squamish Indian Residential School.\n\nOriginal on File 167-1-4.\n\n2 Singer Sewing Machines (Recommended by Mr. Phelan)\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\n*Ottawa, November 12, 1935.*\n\n**SHIP TO:** Rev.

An Order-in-Council has recently been received for this amount and a cheque for $350.00 is being forwarded to the Fred Welsh Company. The statement forwarded with your account showed that the total cost of the showers was $400.00. As stated above the Department is paying $350.00 of this amount and returning, unaided, the account of the Reliance Lumber Company.\n\nIt is considered, in view of the information contained in your letter of September 20 last, that the Principal will be quite willing to pay $54.30 from school funds.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nF. J. G. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n416 Federal Bldg.,\nVancouver, B. C.\nSquamish Residential School\n\nI was also present at a fire drill of the whole school, which was well and expeditiously carried out by both the girls and boys. When the water was turned on through the fire hose the pressure was very insufficient. This matter, has however, been taken up by Inspector Barry. Altogether this school appears to be very satisfactory. The Sisters in charge have the best welfare of the pupils at heart, and I was very pleased with what I saw.\n\nW.M.
