Such Loan to be applied to the purposes indicated by the Council, namely, the construction of the railroad through British territory from Canada to the Pacific, and the improvement and enlargement of the Canadian canals; and to be raised at the same time and in equal proportions with the Canadian unguaranteed Loan for the same objects, on the understanding that Canada abandon all claims on England on account of the Fenian Raids.\n\nThe Earl of Kimberley further observes that Her Majesty's Government will enable the Canadian Government to assure the Dominion Parliament that any recommendation made by Canada to terminate the Articles of the Treaty numbered 18 to 25 inclusive, and likewise Article 30, in conformity with Article 33, will be acted on; that they have no hesitation in declaring that the greatest deference would be paid to the expression of the wishes of the Dominion, signified by Addresses from both Houses of the Dominion Parliament, and that those wishes would certainly be attended to, subject of course to the necessary reservation of Her Majesty's discretion to take into consideration, in the interests of the whole Empire, the state of Her relations with Foreign Powers at the particular juncture.\n\nThe Committee of the Privy Council feel that although Her Majesty's Government have been unable to accede to their proposition in full, it is nevertheless their duty, in the interests both of Canada and the Empire at large, to accept the modified proposition of the Earl of Kimberley, and they will accordingly be prepared to propose to the Canadian Parliament the measures necessary to give effect to those clauses of the Treaty relative to Canada.\n\n(Certified)\n\nWm.
