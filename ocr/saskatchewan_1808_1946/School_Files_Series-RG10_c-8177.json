I need hardly state that in such a small school with such large attendance, maintenance of the building presents quite a problem. We have been suffering greatly for lack of skilled help. Only recently have I been able to get assurance that I could get sufficient help to carry out this work. It is recommended, therefore, that consideration be given to painting the exterior of the above school and also re-decorating the interior. The metallic ceiling needs painting; also the woodwork in general needs painting. It is proposed to enamel the tops of the school desks.\n\nAs I have been able to locate and have set aside the materials listed on the attached requisition, I would ask that authority be given to proceed with this work immediately. There will have to be some shingle work done on the roof as well but I have some shingles on hand to take care of this item. It is expected that labour costs (Indian) will amount to approximately $300.00. If we can get started on this right away, there will not be a great deal of interruption as far as the class is concerned.\n\nPlease advise by return mail if work authorized and also forward accountable cheque in the amount of $300.00 towards the labour, it being understood that I will be permitted to purchase the materials locally as merchants concerned have been asked to hold these supplies pending your reply.\n\nT.

I wish to inform you that this work has now been completed and the classroom has taken on an entirely new appearance. While on this particular job I took advantage to have all the ropes renewed on the windows with new sash cord. The ropes had become rotted and for some years past it was not possible to lift the windows without putting a stick under them. Some lifts were also renewed at the same time at the Cornwall Island West School. Work in both cases has been done in a very satisfactory manner.\n\nT.L.

The entire north and east walls of the building let in no light whatsoever nor does any light come in from the south side of the building. The result is that until the sun gets around to the west, very little light enters the building and during the afternoon the east half of the class room is still dark. One suggestion was offered some time ago by Mr. Doucet to install windows on the east wall of the building. I hesitated to give this point very serious consideration because we would eliminate our blackboard space by putting windows on this side of the building. Consequently, we would be up against the usual problem of a draughty class room from so many windows on both sides of the building. In addition, the cost of installing windows would run to considerable sum. I was hopeful, when this discussion was under way, that in a not too distant future we would have electricity on the Island and, of course, the proper solution to our problem would be to install lights in the class room.\n\nI am happy to say that at this writing most of the homes on the west end of Cornwall Island are lighted by electricity and the power is already less than 100 yards from the west end School.\n\nIn view of the above, it would be appreciated if authorization would be granted to have a sufficient number of lights installed in the class room to take care of our lighting problem. I am quite sure that the total cost of installing the lights will not be in excess of what it would cost us to put windows on the east side of the building. Your views in this matter would be appreciated at an early date.\n\nT. D.

MELAN.\n\nRe: Lighting Cornwall Island West Indian Day School.\n\nFour plans come to mind to rectify the lighting deficiency at the Cornwall Island West Indian Day School.\n\n1. Have two windows cut in the East wall, above the blackboard.\n\n2. Install fluorescent lighting.\n\n3. Install electric lights of the ordinary type.\n\n4. A combination of No. 1 and No. 3.\n\nPrices were obtained for the electric lights.\n\nTwo plans were suggested:\n\n1. Install six No. K 714-48 4 lamp fluorescent fixtures. This would amount to $353.00 including inspection fees.\n\n2. Install six 14\" glassware of 200 watts each at $134.00, including all fees. This would consume 1200 watts.\n\nThe first would give 75% more light than No. 2.\n\nAs No. 2 is the usual system installed in schools, it could be considered as sufficient. I would, however, recommend a third plan.\nInstal a two lamp K 714-48 fluorescent at $231.00. The consumption of electricity would be 360 watts as compared to 720 (#1) and 1200 (#2). Its lighting power would be approximately 1/3 more than No. 2 while the cost of operating would be about 1/3 of No. 2.\n\nThe original cost would be $97 more than No. 2 but this would soon be offset by the consumption, and give a light much easier on the eyes and would cause less shadows.\n\nI would, therefore, recommend the installation of 6 K 714-48-2 lamp fluorescent fixtures. I would supplement this as soon as possible by perforating two windows above the blackboard. (The windows at the present cannot be done due to labour conditions).\n\nThis cost of the lighting should not exceed $231.00.\n\nA.J. Doucet,\nTraining Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nReferring to your file 33-4-5 (WT) in connection with the installation of lights at the Cornwall Island West School, I am enclosing herewith letter from the Elco Electric in Cornwall offering three different prices. This matter was discussed with Mr. Doucet during his recent visit to the Agency.\n\nPlease advise, at an early date, your pleasure in this matter.\n\nT. L.

The reason I am having this receptacle installed is that it might be possible some time we would require a plug-in for the purpose of operating a projector for educational films or the like.\n\nAn account will go in covering the work as noted on the Purchase Order and a separate account will go forward covering the installation of the receptacle.\n\nT. L. Connah,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nAuthority under your file 33-4-5, September 24th, 1946, has been received allowing $12.00 per month for the Cornwall Island West School teacher's living accommodation.\n\nAs you know, Miss Leaf now has electricity installed in her home and has added many conveniences such as refrigeration, etc. In addition, fuel prices have risen considerably. The teacher, Miss Kelly, has full use of the entire house.\n\nAs the entire household expense falls on Miss Leaf, she would appreciate receiving a higher monthly rate than quoted above. Would you consider up to $20.00 monthly to cover this item. It is possible I can settle for less.\n\nT. L. Bonnah,\nIndian Agent.\nJanuary 28, 1948.\n\nMr. T.L. Bonnah, Indian Agent,\nP.O. Box 937, Cornwall, Ontario.\n\nWe have your letter of the 23rd instant with reference to increasing the allowance for living accommodation for the teacher of the Cornwall Island West School.\n\nWe infer from your letter that the owner of this house is living in the building and while the teacher may have free run of the house, at the same time it should only be necessary for us to pay for one room. The mere fact that the owner has installed certain conveniences for herself and which the teacher can take advantage of does not appear to be sufficient reason to justify an increase.\n\nBernard F.

There are very nice Indian homes in this vicinity and we should have no difficulty in hiring women teachers as good boarding facilities are available.\n\nThis school has a good many more years of life in it and when the playground has been drained it should provide a good school plant.\n\nTeacher.\n\nMiss Margaret Kelly; thirty-nine years of age holding a First Class Quebec Certificate.

Bonnah,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nBox 987,\nCornwall, Ontario.\n\nCornwall Island West Indian Day School\n\nIt would seem evident that Miss Kelly is doing a good job under some considerable difficulty at the Cornwall Island West School. We have made a careful check of her enrolment and average attendance since the beginning of the academic year. A summary is as follows:\n\n| Month    | Enrolment | Average |\n|----------|-----------|---------|\n| September| 45        | 41.30   |\n| October  | 46        | 42.60   |\n| November | 45        | 41      |\n| December | 45        | 43.46   |\n| January  | 42        | 40.34   |\n| February | 42        | 40.52   |\n| March    | 42        | 39.54   |\n| April    | 45        | 42.14   |\n\nIt would seem evident that an extra classroom at this school will have to be given top priority. If Parliament meets in September, I will make strong representations that an amount be included in the Supplementary Estimates for this Division for the addition of an extra classroom at this building.\n\nPlease find attached a pupil-age survey form which I would like to have completed and returned here so that we may best decide the type of extra accommodation to be provided at this school. If\nMiss Kelly has completed a similar form previously, it will not be necessary to complete another.\n\nBernard P. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nIn connection with the attached Requisition for School Supplies for the Cornwall Island West School, you will note the teacher has requested an oil burning stove for the classroom. We have attempted to heat this school in the past with a coal burning Quebec heater unit. During my early years here, I recall that very little satisfaction was obtained with heating from this method. I think the biggest trouble was in trying to obtain the services of a satisfactory person to look after the fires. Since the war and even up to the present time, employment has been fairly good off the Reserve with the result that it is getting more difficult all the time to find someone who will take an interest in this matter and see that the classroom is heated before the pupils arrive in the morning. The teacher lives quite some distance from the school.\n\nIf your office would authorize the purchase of an oil burning unit, it would be necessary for us to install a large capacity storage tank of at least 500 gallons. In this way, the teacher could turn it low during the night and bring the heat up a lot quicker in the morning. An oil burning unit sufficient to handle a 7,000 cu. ft. capacity would be required.\nI am passing this information on to you in the hope that it might be possible to purchase such a unit and storage tank to be installed before class resumes in the Fall. Should you have funds for the purchase of such a unit, it will, of course, be necessary to alter the fuel requisition and cancel any coal and wood ordered for the Cornwall Island West School. I believe it would be possible to obtain fuel oil from a dealer in Cornwall.\n\nPlease let me have your views concerning the above.\n\n[Signature]\n\nT. L.

George, Rupert's House and Moose Factory, and that the same might be allowed for Ft. Hope if arrangements could be made for a school there. I wrote the missionary in charge of Ft. Hope but have not yet received an answer. I understand however that the grants were payable for the first 4 mentioned, as day schools are carried on at those places. I have just received the half yearly statement from our bankers, the Royal Trust Co., I find no amounts credited for day schools. What is the explanation? Is it for lack of reports?\n\nI think I handed to you or forwarded to the Dept. the report for Albany day School; and Moose day School is conducted in conjunction with the boarding school. I do not know whether the Principal has given a report of the day school at Moose or whether the reports of Ft. George & Rupert's House reached you. I would be glad to receive an explanation.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJohn G. Moosonee\nAugust 30th, 1922\n\nFort George\n(James Bay Road)\n\nWe, the Chief & Councillors (4) at Fort George, are writing you on behalf of all the Fort George Indians to thank you for the help you have rendered us all along, but we are extremely sorry that neither doctor nor medicine came this summer, for we have suffered much from an epidemic which came from the South.\n\nWe are glad to state that not a single child has been lost to death this past winter, for pneumonia and smallpox were plentiful, but we do not know what it will be like this coming winter; for fires destroyed much country last summer.\n\nWe desire to tell you our thoughts regarding our children, for they are many. We wish that there could be a school here where some of them could be placed like what is done for children in the South; for, though they are taught while we are at the post in the summer, they cannot go to school every day, since we have to go off from time to time to hunt for food ourselves.\n\nFish & birds have been very scarce this summer, so that made it all the harder during the time of sickness.\n\nThere are over 100 children connected with Fort George Post who are of school age, & we hope efforts will be made that they may be taught.\n\nWe again thank you for all your help in the past & trust you will grant us the future request.\n\nWe send greetings,\n\nS. the Chief Peter Waskitikum\nalso Joseph Rappas\nJohn Matinawakum\nJimmie Tom\nWilliam Snowboy\n\nCouncillors\n\n(Translator W.C.W.)\n\nIndian Affairs.

Scott Esq.,\nDeputy Officer General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nIn connection with the enclosed letter, I may say that the Chief and Councilors of the Fort George Band of Indians approached me on my visit there in August regarding better school facilities for their children and in the course of the discussion mentioned the advisability of a boarding school such as that at Moose Fort. I pointed out to them the difficulties of maintaining a boarding school, especially in the way of fresh or country meat and that it would be necessary for them to help as much as possible if such a school were established in order that it might be a success. I asked them to give the matter further consideration and to write to Ottawa, if they finally desired to have such an institution and this memorial is the result. There is no doubt that there are a large number of children both at Fort George and elsewhere whose pupils could be drawn and that a boarding school would be a great benefit.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Church of England first occupied these regions in the decade of 1850-60 and have been in continued missionary occupation since that time. One of our chief stations at Fort George has recently been occupied by Roman Catholic missionaries. We understand, however, that the Anglican Bishop of Moosonee has lodged a formal petition with your Department for an Indian Residential School to be located at Fort George, or other suitable point in the region, to be administered by the Church of England. The Executive Committee M. S. C. C. endorses this application of the Bishop of Moosonee and considers the fact of its lodgement with your Department as a sufficient interim safeguard of our interests in the regions affected, viz: the East coast of James and Hudson's Bay.\n\n(Sgd.) S. Gould,\nGeneral Secretary.\nOttawa, Sept. 4, 1924.\n\nDear Bishop Anderson:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, with reference to the situation at Fort George.

J. G. ANDERSON, D.D., BISHOP OF MOOSONEE, COCHRANE, ONT., DATED MARCH 25th, 1930.\n\n---\n\nOriginal on 74-72.\n\n---\n\nAttached please find a copy of a statement showing the Indian population at Fort George, James Bay, and the Indian and Eskimo population at Great Whale River, worked at present as one mission district, from which could be drawn pupils for a boarding school at Fort George.\nOctober 5, 1930.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nDr. Hamilton, Indian Agent, had an interview with me today and appeared fairly well satisfied with the teaching activity under Rev. Canon Griffin at the Fort George Indian Day School. The church is used for classroom purposes and Dr. Hamilton thinks that a suitable school should be erected without delay. He suggests a log building, on a day labour basis. I have made a note for next year's Estimated.\nMEMO:\n\nDr. Scott\n\nTwo weeks ago the Venerable Archdeacon A. L. Fleming visited the Department and had an interview with Mr. Williams. He stated that the church contemplated enlarging their mission at Fort George so that approximately twenty Indian children could be accepted as boarders. In other words they hope to start a small residential school. He asked the Department for assistance. Archdeacon Fleming was informed that next year there would be very little done as far as new buildings were concerned and that in the second place from the Department's standpoint we were not very sure if the northern schools for the Indians were worth while. He promised to come back to Ottawa at another date and lay the matter before you.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nJames Bay Agency,\nMoose Factory,\nJanuary 1/31.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIf your Department has made any arrangement with regard to a school at Fort George I would be pleased to know it is. That post has a large number of children of school age and I would like to see them have a chance to get an education. Mission schools are to my mind a mistake, both from an educational and a financial point of view. They are expensive and as a rule the teacher employed is not qualified to teach or has too many duties assigned to him.\n\nA public or day school at Fort George would fulfill all requirements, would cost much less to build, maintenance much less, and efficiency much greater. My experience with mission schools is very disappointing, and I cant recommend them.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir:\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department allows a grant for teaching services at the rate of $50 per teaching month, which is paid direct to the Church authorities upon receipt of returns showing the attendance, period taught, etc. These returns are forwarded at the end of each quarter. The last return received was for the quarter ended June 30, 1930. This return showed there was an enrolment during that quarter of 52 pupils, but their attendance was very irregular. The question of erecting a suitable school building was discussed with you during your visit to the Department in October, last. It is doubtful whether funds can be provided to erect a new building this year.\n\nYour suggestion that this school be conducted independent of the Churches has been noted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

S. C.C. is interested in the residential school at that point, I thought I would write to you and, if necessary, you could refer my letter to whoever supervises the day school activity.\n\nSince the residential school has been recognized by the Department, the attendance at the day school has decreased to such an extent that, for the last few quarters, only three Indian children have attended. This number is so small that it does not justify the Department continuing to allow the salary for a day school teacher.\n\nNo doubt, arrangements can be made to have the three children who have been attending the day school enrolled at the residential school. I would appreciate it if you would advise Miss Nesbitt at once that the day school will not be in operation for the academic year 1937-38.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

No. 72-1-1, asking me to advise Miss Nesbitt, teacher at our Fort George School, that the Day School will not be in operation for the academic year 1937-38.\n\nIn this connection I beg to state that Miss Nesbitt was due to leave this School on furlough on or about the 22nd inst., and that Miss Vera Calvert Rutherford, a fully qualified and experienced teacher, has been appointed to take her place. Miss Rutherford, and the Rev. B.S. Greene, B.A., and Mrs. Greene, and another lady worker, left Moosonee for Fort George July 15th, and the agents at this School who were due their furlough this year would come out by the boat which took the newly appointed agents in.\n\nAs the Day School does not come under our Commission's jurisdiction, but is managed by the Diocese in which it is located in direct cooperation with your Department, I am furnishing our General Secretary with a copy of your letter, so that he may discuss with Bishop Fleming the subject matter of the same. I have no doubt that you will hear from the General Secretary in the matter in due course.\n\nIn the meantime I am notifying the Rev. Principal Greene of your decision that the Day School will not be in\noperation during the coming academic year.\n\nShould the three Indian children now attending as day pupils be enrolled as residential school pupils, I assume that the regular per capita grant will be paid for them in addition to the grant which is now being paid for 35 pupils.\n\nIf your Department can, by any means, authorize an enrolment at this School of not less than 50 pupils, it will relieve our Commission of the heavy burden of anxiety they now carry in meeting the operating cost of the same. The accommodation is available, and as the School was provided at the expense of our Church, we feel justified in asking for this additional help in this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/KH\nMoose Factory Sept 9th 1927\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe-Fort George Day School.\n\nMr. Green had a letter from you to the Commission in which you instructed the Day School to be closed and the pupils taken in to the Res. School. Mr. Green understood from his letter from the Commission that these pupils were to be taken into the school and paid for by the Department. I told him that I thought it was the intention of the Department that these pupils attend the Res. School as Day pupils.\n\nI do not know whether the Department has been paying the salary of a day school teacher or not, but there has not been any day school at Fort George since the Res. School opened. The Day school pupils have been taught in the class room with the Res. School pupils. I told Mr. Green to carry on in this way and if he was allowed anything for teaching these pupils in the Res. School he would be notified.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.H. Tyner\nJuly 18, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI desire to refer you to official letter of August 3, 1937, with reference to Fort George Indian Day School.\n\nYou will note from that letter that the Department is not providing any salary for the teacher of the Fort George Day School from June 30, 1938.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes\nSecretary\n\nRev. Canon S. Gould, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n604 Jarvis St.,\nToronto, Ontario.\nJuly 18, 1938.\n\nRt. Reverend Sir:\n\nI desire to refer you to official letter of August 2, 1937, enclosing copy of a letter of June 23, 1937, addressed to Rev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.\n\nOn reference to official letter of August 2, you will note that the Department is not allowing any salary for the teacher of the Fort George Indian Day School after the end of June, 1938.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes\nSecretary\n\nRt. Rev. A.L. Fleming, F.R.G.S.,\nBishop of the Arctic,\n604 Jarvis St.,\nToronto, Ontario.\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nUpon checking up our 1938 per capita grants for the Indian Schools under our jurisdiction, I find we have not received in full, the per capita grants for the FORT GEORGE School, for the September and December quarters of 1938.\n\nI shall be glad to receive these as soon as convenient.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMarch 15, 1939.\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, with reference to the non-receipt of the per capita grant for the Fort George C. E. Indian Residential School for the quarters ended September and December, 1938.\n\nOn reviewing our files, it is found that the returns for these quarters have not yet reached the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nR. A. Williams, Esq.,\nAccountant, M.S.C.C.,\n604 Jarvis St.,\nToronto, Ont.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nAfter the destruction by fire on the 26th ultimo of our Society's Indian Residential School at Fort George, our Commission gave prompt consideration to the possibility of having an Indian Day School operated there until a new Residential School building could be provided. The building used as a \"Parish hall\" was understood to be immediately available for this purpose, but to make certain of this a telegram was despatched to the Rev. Principal Hamilton, part of which read as follows:\n\n\"WIRE POSSIBILITY OF OPENING DAY SCHOOL IMMEDIATELY USING PARISH HALL AS CLASSROOM (STOP) STATE NUMBER PUPILS AVAILABLE ALSO FULL LIST EQUIPMENT REQUIRED\"\n\nIn reply to that telegram, the Rev. Principal Hamilton wired as follows on the 24th instant:\n\n\"SCHOOL OPENS IMMEDIATELY APPROXIMATE ATTENDANCE TWENTY FOUR REQUIRE SCRIBBLERS TWELVE DOZEN, PENCILS SIX DOZEN, ERASERS THREE DOZEN, RULERS THREE DOZEN, REGISTER, CHALK, BLACKBOARD, DRAWING SCRIBBLER TWELVE DOZEN, CRAYONS TWENTY FOUR BOOKS READERS MARY JOHN AND PETER TWO DOZEN, GARDEN OF SERIES TWO DOZEN, SPELLERS TWO DOZEN, ARITHMETIC ONTARIO BOOKS ONE TWO DOZEN, BOOK TWO ONE DOZEN, NATURE AND LANGUAGE BOOK ONE TWO DOZEN, BOOKS TWO HALF DOZEN, BOOKS THREE FOUR, THREE COMPLETE SETS GRADE SIX TEXTS INCLUDING ALL WORK BOOKS FOR ONTARIO CURRICULUM, ALL WORK BOOKS CONNECTED WITH ABOVE LIST STAFF NUMBER ONE.\"\n\nThe telegram was not punctuated, and the punctuation marks have been inserted by me to assist you in understanding the equipment required.\nThe last three words, namely \"STAFF NUMBER ONE\", I understand the Principal to mean that only one agent will be required to operate the Day School. Mrs. Jeffrey who was on the staff at the Residential School before it was destroyed by fire, is a fully qualified teacher, and she will be available for the teachership of the Day School.\n\nI am not aware of any certain means of transportation by which the list of materials desired could be sent through to Fort George at once, but it will be appreciated if you will approve the opening of the Indian Day School, and provide the materials listed. They should be addressed to the Rev. Howard B. Hamilton, Fort George, P.Q., c/o Hudson's Bay Company, Moosonee, Ont. If the materials are forwarded at once there is a possibility that a plane might take them through from Moosonee to Fort George. Failing this, or any other means of transportation, they would be taken through by the first boat crossing the Bay after navigation opens.\n\nIt has just occurred to me that the Rev. Principal Hamilton's telegram does not mention any report forms, and in case he has none of these I would suggest that a liberal supply be forwarded with the other items listed.\n\nThanking you in advance for your kindly cooperation in this important matter,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTBRW*WS\nSecretary of the Commission.\nDECLARATION OF HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD FOR PURPOSE OF COST OF LIVING BONUS, (AUGUST) 1941\n\nThis declaration must be completed in triplicate by full time employees claiming \"Head of Household\" status if compensation is less than $108.00 per month, and all married women in the Service in receipt of a salary of less than $2,100.00, and filed with the Department.

I am sorry that we did not address our letter of November 4th to the correct department at that time.\n\nWe have completed the forms you enclosed with your letter on behalf of Miss Quirt from the information we have on file and trust this will be sufficient for your purposes. We shall appreciate it if you can make Miss Quirt's cheque payable to the Indian & Eskimo Residential School Commission as we have certain monthly deductions to make from her salary at her request and with communications so difficult to maintain with the Fort George School, this will not be possible for us to do otherwise. As you no doubt know there is one winter mail to this school, and possibly three boat trips during the summer and it will greatly help us if the cheque can be made payable to this Commission.\n\nTrusting that this matter can be arranged, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH.A.

During the year following the fire, and during the time of rebuilding, we were operating a Day School, with the authority of your office to do so.\n\nIf you have not already been notified by the local Indian Agent, or the Indian & Eskimo Residential School Commission, Winnipeg, to the effect that the only Day School activities now carried on at Fort George, are in direct connection with the Residential School programme, for those children who are able to attend a Day School throughout the year, I take this opportunity of giving that notification.\n\nSince this is the case, there will be no Quarterly Returns forthcoming from Fort George, as indicated in your letter there should be.\n\nTrusting this letter will straighten out the situation satisfactorily I remain\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal,\nRev. H. B.

Under the circumstances it was unnecessary for you to forward any day school return.\n\nThe payment of salary to the day school teacher will be discontinued.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend H.

Jeffrey, Teacher, Fort George C. E. Indian Day School, Fort George, P.Q.\n\nIn February last, at the request of Dr. Westgate, we forwarded a supply of classroom material and textbooks for the day school at Fort George.\n\nSince then, we have received a requisition from the above school which contains many articles already supplied. Therefore, in order to avoid duplication, I would suggest that you prepare, and forward through the office of your local Indian Agent, a new requisition for the textbooks and classroom materials which you will require for the academic year 1943-44. The necessary forms for this purpose are enclosed.\n\nI am also enclosing a copy of our circular letter dated March 30th to teachers of Indian day schools, and a blank Report Form No. I.A. 415 which I would ask you to complete and return to the Department at the earliest possible date.\n\nI am requesting our Stationery Branch to mail to your address a Daily Register.\n\nR.

J. Orford,\nIndian Agent,\nMoose Factory, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. Orford:\n\nDue to the fact that I was asked to write out a requisition for immediate needs in the Day School, and also send out a requisition for the year 1943-'44, there has apparently been some reduplication in filling the orders. Hence I have been asked to make out a further requisition covering what we need for the year 1943-'44. Enclosed you will find the completed requisition.\n\nAlready there have been some invoices reach me of articles and books that have been sent. Where the full amount has been sent, that article has been dropped from the requisition. Where it has only been partially filled, I have placed the same article on the requisition again, but have ordered just enough to make up the required amount.\n\nAgain I would call your attention to the need of a Duplicator or some type other than a Hectograph. I would appreciate it greatly if the Department could see fit to provide us with such equipment, as it would greatly facilitate the work in the school. All other articles on the requisition are self-explanatory, and consist of the minimum equipment required to carry on satisfactorily.\n\nTrusting that this requisition meets with your approval, I remain\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nDaily Register ordered from Sta.

Indian Affairs\n\nDear Sir,\n\nContinuing my visit among the Indians, I am happily surprised to see an Indian school which has opened here and sixteen pupils attending; and I hope this number will be doubled before long. I had the intention to apply to your Honorable Department for a school next summer, but went there to thank you for the good year we have amongst these people. The weather tells me that she applied for a grant of money, very small in fact, for the purpose of building a school house, I judge this, very necessary, because I find out that over twenty children are living close to this place the whole year round, and so, are able to attend to school the whole year.\n\nIn the name of their families and in my own, I beg your Honorable Department to get\na salary sufficient for keeping this school open during the whole year. The people are willing to do their share about how much they appreciate the benefit of a school. So, hoping that you will take my humble request in consideration and grant it of remain Yours\n\nJ.

Temiscamingue, has written the Department asking that the school at Hunter's Point, of which you are in charge, be kept open during the whole year.\n\nWhen application was first made for a school there, the Department was given to understand that the Indians only remained in that neighborhood for three or four months during the summer and that they left in the fall for their hunting grounds.\n\nBefore the Department can consider the question of establishing a permanent school there it would require further information respecting the habits of these Indians; whether they are nomadic or permanently settled at Hunter's Point, the number of children of school age in the band and whether they are regularly attending the school now. The Department would pleased if you could give it this information.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nSecretary.\n\nMiss Lucy Street,\nTeacher,\nHunter's Point, Que.\nHunter's Point\nAug. 7 - 87\n\nJ. D. Maclean Esq.\nDep. Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of July the 26th requiring information respecting the habits of these Indians, I may say they are permanently settled at Hunter's Point. There are twenty-one children of school age.\nand rain they appear at nine o'clock in the morning.\n\nIt is the opinion of all the settlers round here, that if a school were permanently established here, many of the families who have left Hunter's Point would return, and so add greatly to the number of school children.\n\nWe are not yet in our new school house, but expect to be in the course of a week or so.\n\nAs all the traffic...\nand eighteen have attended school regularly during the past month, and promise to continue doing so all year if the school is kept open longer than the three months as was intended.\n\nThey all speak English and seem to be most interested in their studies.\n\nIt astonishes me to see how punctual they are in coming to school, as most of them have to travel in canoes and in spite of wind...\nis carried on by water,\nand only in canoes or\nships, there has been\ngreat difficulty in bring-\ning the lumber here.\n\nMr. Jones mentioned to\nme the other day, he had\nonly intended loaning his\nbuilding to us for a week,\nand by the time we\nwere settled in the new\nbuilding, we would have\nhad the use of his for\nsix weeks, and he thought\nsome remuneration should\nbe made by the Govern-\nment, say he only charged\nfor five weeks at the\nrate of $25 per week.\n\nI told him I would write and explain the matter, and see what could be done. 316114\n\nIf you decide to have the school kept open, would you kindly send some requisition forms, as there are several books etc., needed badly, but refrained from asking sooner thinking I could manage for a time.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nS. Street.\nOttawa, September 10th, 1907.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nMr. Benson,\n\nA request has been made that the Department continue the school at Hunter's Island during the winter months and I would like a report from you as to the advisability of this.\n\nD. S. G. I. A.\nOttawa, September 11, 1907.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nWith reference to the request to continue the school at Hunter's Point during the winter months, I beg to say that I do not consider the Department is in a position to do so this winter.\n\nThe school was opened there during July, last, for the summer months, and the teacher was only engaged for that time. There is no school building at this point and all we could do was to put up a temporary shell, which would be quite useless in the winter. The Department has made no provision for this school, and, although the Indians live in the neighborhood most of the year, they have no reserve there, and I cannot find that any steps have been taken to procure one for them.\n\nBefore the department could establish a permanent school there, it would require a school site, which would have to be obtained either by purchase from the Quebec Government or from someone who has taken up land. In addition to this provision would have to be made for the erection of a permanent school building and for the salary of a teacher. As all building material has to be brought in by small boats from the railway.\nrailway line, $1,000 at least would have to be provided for this purpose and not less than $350 for a teacher's salary, and even this amount would not secure the services of one with proper qualifications.\n\nThere are quite enough children in the school at present to justify the Department in providing for its reopening and continuance next summer. Father Nelles, of Mattawa, who called at the Department yesterday, told me that it would have to be closed this winter but that he would like provision to be made for carrying it on permanently after that.\n\nIndian Affairs.

[signature]\nDeputy Minister of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nHaving recently returned from a visitation of the Indians & Books on North River, at a point near Hunter's Point, Que., I wish to show in their behalf to ascertain the steps necessary to be taken in order to secure the reopening of the school there. It is about five years since it was closed. The causes that led to that misfortune have passed away. The house, store, post office & farm at the point have passed into the hands of Archie Perrier whose influence & example are helpful to the community there. There are 27 children of school age within easy reach of the school. 25 of these have Indian blood, indeed all except two girls of our missionary C.C. Kellerman who spends the summer months...\nThe School House built & furnished by the Department are there all ready for use. The need is very great with an increasing number of children growing up without any public means of education. I understand that an order was given to Mr. Robinson at Wolf Lake permitting him to remove the furniture up to Wolf Lake. I saw him there the other day; he did not want the articles that he had no intention to undertake their removal.\n\nI am in a position to say that in some form or other an attempt will be made to give at least the elements of an education to these children in behalf of their people. I apply for the use of this equipment pending the opening of the school & the employment of a properly certified teacher. Of the 27 scholars of school age 16 are Protestants & 11 Roman Catholics. Of course all will be welcome & no interference with their religion.\n\nI am the minister of St. Andrew's Church, Matawin & Moderator of the Presbytery of North Bay and...\nhave the oversight of the mission work carried on by the Presbyterian Church among the Protestant Indians at Station, Carleton's Mills, Kipawa, North River & Wolf Lake. I have the means in hand to give elementary instruction to these children for a few months each year furnished me by an American summer visitor; they will not be left to grow up entirely destitute of education but of course it would be much the most satisfactory way to have the Department reopen the school through a fully qualified teacher.\n\nI can do you desire supply you with fuller information as well as references to public men who know the whole situation.\n\nI am\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRev.

When the school was previously conducted there it was not a success and there would not appear to be even now sufficient Indians to justify the Department in establishing a school, and this Department, of course, is not in any way responsible for the education of the half-breeds in the Province of Quebec. However, should a school be established for the half-breeds the Department would be prepared to pay tuition fees for any Indian children who might attend.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nE.D.

This school was established at that time on your recommendation. The Department understood that these Indians were all Roman Catholics and Roman Catholic teachers were appointed after consultation with Rev. Father Evans. The Department also supplied some material and the Indians erected a building which was used for school purposes.\n\nRev. J. W. Mitchell of Mattawa now applies to the Department for the use of this building and furniture for a school for the Indians and half-breeds in that neighborhood and states that he has money available towards payment of a teacher.

If the facts are as stated the Department would be prepared to give the use of the building and the furniture and also pay a fair proportion of the salary of the teacher, if there are Indians to attend.

I do not know of who taught there were Roman Catholic Miss Smith and Miss Evans, while another Miss Ryan was a Protestant.\n\nI have gone over the names of children of school age there and consulted with the Rev.

As you are aware, this Department has no responsibility for the education of white or half-breed children of the province of Quebec, but solely for the Indians. When this information is received the matter of a grant can be decided upon. In the meantime, in view of your report, the Department will grant to the white trustees who may be appointed the use of the present building and furniture, upon the understanding that this does not involve any obligation for the payment of a grant until such time as the information above referred to is received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

He says that it would even be doubtful if any of the children would attend if there, as they have a summer school at Wolfe Lake.\n\nThe school is in operation with one Indian in attendance. As it is not likely that we will require the building at Hunter's Point in the near future I see no objection to allowing the whites to have the use of it, but\nbut, as for the Department assuming a portion of the salary of the teacher, I think we should wait until we see what likelihood there is of any more Indian children attending. It is only right that the Department should pay a tuition fee for any Indian children that do attend, but unless there is a fair number enrolled it could hardly be expected to make an annual contribution. Dr. James was informed on the 2nd ultimo that the Department could not be responsible for the education of half-breeds in the province of Quebec and it is presumed that many of the children enrolled belong to this class. I think if the Department allows them the use of the school and the appliances and pays a tuition fee for any Indians that might attend it will be doing all that could reasonably be expected under the circumstances.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

While Catholics, the most of us have Indian blood and being the big majority of the residents in this district, we wish to have a catholic teacher. But as we are not Catholics and as we know that they are a few families who are protestants who send their children to that school we are disposed to have religion taught but only after school time.\n\nSo we expect to get a favorable answer, and have no trouble with our neighbours in this affair.\n\nHere is following the list of our children:\n\n| Age | To go to School |\n|-----|-----------------|\n|     |                 |\n\nIndian Affairs.

The teacher is hired by the white trustees and this Department contributes the sum of $250.00 per annum towards her salary, which is paid quarterly upon receipt of returns showing the attendance of the Indian children only. The return for the quarter ending September 30th, last, showed an enrolment of 14 pupils, with an average attendance of 12.\n\nThe Department also furnishes the books and school supplies required for the Indian children only, upon receipt of requisitions from the teacher for the supplies she requires.\n\nA new school building was recently erected, towards which the Department contributed the sum of $300.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMr. James Stanger,\nHunter's Point,\nQue.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Oct.\n\ngentlemen,\n\nI have to report that I visited and inspected your school at Hunter's Point, North River, Que., on Friday, 3rd inst., and found everything in satisfactory condition. The teacher, Mrs. Hansen, has been replaced for a few days by her sister, Miss Hansen, who is still better qualified for the required duties. The number of scholars present was eleven, eight girls and three boys. The ordinary grades were all represented. The order was excellent, every indication of efficient work being done. The scholars are now comfortably accommodated, the prospects of the school better than ever. The equipment is meager, consisting of a couple of worn, flexible blackboards with desks sufficient for present attendance, but which may prove insufficient before the term is far advanced. The marked success that has attended the operation of this school since it has been carried on under present conditions merits the most liberal treatment by the Department. Your supplementary grant to meet the greatly increased cost of living is much appreciated. Without it, the generous aid of our American\nSummer visitor Expect-Ryde, Esq., at whose lodge I am at present, a guest; it might have been impossible to secure a teacher. There is great reluctance on the part of many to venture so far into the wilds where they are cut off from communication with the outer world while the ice is forming & breaking up where they can only get out with great difficulty in midwinter. These difficulties led one teacher to draw back after all arrangements were made together to become homeward bound up her work in the middle of her engagement. The present teacher has received much of her education in the schools of the balance of it in the neighboring towns of North Ontario but we suffer from the competition of the higher salaries paid in these other mining regions near at hand. I hope the Department will give due consideration to these difficulties extended to this school its most liberal financial treatment. During the last five years seven of the scholars have passed the Ontario Entrance examinations by going out to Mattawa. The success that has attended its operation has induced me at considerable inconvenience, labor, trouble & expense to continue my connection with the school especially as it is desired appreciated by the natives.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nStanding address:\nRev.

The blackboard supplied is known as hyloplate and comes in lengths from six to twelve feet and is three, three and a half and four feet in width. It can be supplied in any length up to twelve feet.\n\nThe Department will also furnish the school material required for the Indian children, such as books, stationery, etc., upon receipt of a requisition for the teacher showing the supplies required.\n\nIt is hoped that you will continue your interest in this school and it is pleasing to note the success met with by the pupils during the past several years.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFor Asst.

Ross, merchant of Mattawa, will act for the local interests. I have to inform you that the Department has in the past supplied some equipment for the Indian children attending this school, and has paid a portion ($250 per academic year) of the salary of the teacher.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will make a general report on this combined white and Indian school at your convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The pupils are well advanced and they have a very good school-house. The pupils however are not Indians. They may have a trace of Indian blood some of them, but so little as it is not of any account.\n\nI am under the impression that this school should be supported by the Quebec Government. They are white people living in an unorganized district, but there are sufficient children to warrant a school being maintained at this point. If the R.C. Indian Day School and this one were combined it would make a good school, but the parties interested will not listen to that at all. The Indians will not send their children to a school with a Protestant teacher in charge, and the Protestants will not send theirs to a R.C. school. The trouble seems to be in the denomination of the teacher, and the Indians at Hunter's Point are all Catholics.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.H. Lewis\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.\nAsst.

The pupils in attendance are not Indians, and we are, therefore, not responsible for their education. We are of the opinion that the responsibility for the education of these children rests with the Provincial Government. The grant which we allow will be discontinued from the end of the present calendar year. Nearly all the Indians at Hunter's Point are represented to be of the Catholic religion, the greater number of whose children attend the Roman Catholic Indian Day School which is in operation at that point.\n\nWe are informing both the teacher, Miss Hansen, and our local Indian Agent, Mr. Lewis, of the discontinuance of the grant from December 31st, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

It further appears that the Indians at Hunter's Point are Roman Catholics, and that they send their children to the Indian day school which is conducted under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church. The reason for the opening of this second school was that the Indians refused to send their children to the Protestant school.

The same will be paid upon receipt of quarterly returns from the teacher showing the attendance, days taught, etc.\n\nWe have informed the teacher and Mr. Lewis, the Indian Agent, of our intention to continue the grant at the former rate to this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nAlex. Ross, Esq.,\nMattawa,\nOnt.\nOttawa, January 17, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, enclosing a communication from the teacher of the Hunter's Point Combined Indian and White School in which she requests that 12 single desks and a map of Canada and Ontario be supplied.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that an order is being forwarded to the Government Stationery Office, here, to send by express to Miss Hansen, Kippewa, Que., 1 map of Canada, and 1 map of Ontario, mounted on rollers. I shall be pleased if you will inform Miss Hansen accordingly, and arrange with her to accept delivery from the express office when the maps arrive at Kippewa.\n\nRelative to the desks, I would point out that when the building in which this school is conducted was originally erected, the Department supplied double desks sufficient to seat 20 pupils. This was in August, 1908. Since that time we have assisted in repairing the building to the amount of $300, and have allowed a grant for the teacher's salary and classroom supplies for the Indian children. We understand that only a small number of Indian children attend the school, the majority on the returns which the teacher forwards being half-breeds. As you are aware, this Department has no responsibility for the education of half-breed children, and we consider that we are dealing generously with this school in our grant for salary and classroom supplies. The desks which we supplied as mentioned above should still be in a serviceable condition and provide ample accommodation for any Indian children who attend. Our funds at the present time are extremely limited, and it will not be possible to furnish the desks asked for by the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

B.

You will remember that when Dr. James was here last month he told you that a building would be available, and he was written to on the 14th ult. and asked to see that it was got ready for occupation at once.\n\nWhen Miss Street reached her destination she found that there was no accommodation provided. The Indians are at the place and are anxious to have their children educated. Fourteen are ready to attend at once and more later on. The Postmaster has let her have the use of a shed for two weeks, but, as he is cramped for room, he will want it after that date. Some provision will have to be made and Miss Street says that if the Department will allow $150 for material the Postmaster and some of the Indians will build a schoolhouse at once and give their labour free of charge. We can spare the money and, as this is the only thing that can be done, I would recommend that you authorize this expenditure.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Jones is being asked to hand the key to the secretary of the school board.\n\nThe Department will also be prepared to pay a reasonable grant for the tuition of the Indian children in the neighbourhood who may attend the school, but the amount cannot yet be fixed, as the Department has not definite information as to the number of pure blooded Indian children at Hunter's Point. As you have already been informed this Department has no responsibility for the education of whites or half-breeds in the province of Quebec. The information has been asked for respecting the Indian children and when it is received a decision as to the amount of the grant will be arrived at and you will be communicated with. If you are prepared to open the school on these conditions you may do so.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. J. W. Mitchell,\nMattawa, Ont.\n\nAsst.

Rev. Mr. Mitchell of Mattawa has been informed that you are being instructed to hand over the building and equipment to him. You will kindly do so.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

He submitted the decision arrived at in the form of a request to go on record in a letter last Saturday 13th inst., which he showed to me before forwarding. Neither he nor I have yet heard from the Department but as there was a matter of urgency I wrote to write again. The teacher for the school went up to Hunter's Point today. I have just learned from Isaac Hansen by weekly mail tonight that Theodore Hansen refuses to vacate the school house till he is directed to do so by the Department. Would you be kind enough to issue such orders according to understanding conveyed with Mr. James. The occupant has had ample notice already & there should be no further delay. That order addressed to Theodore Hansen under cover of one addressed to Isaac Hansen, Secretary Board, Toronto, Ont., would greatly oblige. There is no mail to Hunter's Point till next Thursday but there is always daily communication with Kippewa at this season of the year. It would thus reach Mr. Isaac Hansen without much delay & aid in getting the school fairly under way before cold weather sets in.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nJ. M. Mitchell\n\nP.S.

The school was opened in a private house on Monday 22nd inst. with an attendance of 16 children Miss Estelle McCreanor herself past Indian, being the teacher. Everything promises well as the Secretary reports to me but Mr. Theodore Hansen refused to vacate the school house till he is personally verified by the Department to do so when so informed. Mr. Secretary School Board Isaac Hansen. Hope this difficulty will be overcome before the cold weather sets in. Only one of the Trustees Mr. Jas. McLaughlin is a white, the other two are half breeds who have had the advent.\nIf some outside education, I saw full blooded Indians at Hunter's Point on the occasion of my visit there, be instituted, no inquiry as to the number of them.

Klock, Sec'y, P. for Pontiac, that Mr. Brabazon had asked you to pay that a deposit of $300.00 should be placed in the hands of Mr. McLean to cover disbursements in connection with the building of a new school house at Hunter's Point, and that you would advise me as to how accounts, if any, should be forwarded and certified. I gave Mr. Brabazon all the information desired regarding the cost of the new building, the fact that the people there would take in procuring the pine logs, squaring them, setting up the shell of the building without cost to the department. I had a careful estimate made by a practical builder at North Bay of the lumber, roofing material, windows, doors, frames, flooring, ceiling, wainscoting, the doors and then secured price\nfrom several Seed & Root factories, saw mills and hardware men, showing that the cost of this material\nflabbergast considerably exceed $350.00 (in fact\nfully $350.00). This I furnished to Mr. Robayon more\nthan two weeks ago but have heard nothing since\nfrom the Department. I went up to Hunter's Point,\nabout 75 miles from here, and was so late that they\nwere now that the School is closed to begin the work\nso that the new building may be ready for occupation\nby September.

Some of the facts of which you are acquainted with since your visit last summer.\n\nAfter your visit last summer we made an effort to secure a teacher but failed entirely until a few weeks ago when we were fortunate enough to secure one. School is going on at present & being held in the church. There are thirteen children attending and there are a few Catholics. Children going to the other school that is the Protestants if you could call such. These thirteen children attending at church.\nam all Catholics and with those other four children would make seventeen or eighteen poor hear in the tents.\n\nThis other school evidently is a Protestant school & is receiving government support at least two hundred a year.\n\nNow this is supposed to be an Indian school but if it is an Indian school it is a Protestant Indian School for the Bible is read there even. There is no fuel what something could be done to help us in paying the teachers & supporting the school since since the teacher alone is costing us \u00a320. a month as I said before there fourteen children attending school in the church at present and after more will attend soon.\n\nNow I feel this is a matter & looked into by the Quebec Government on the subject of Protestant School for Province of Quebec and I also feel with your generous influence my Lord something will be accomplished to assist me in this important work.\nFrustrated to hear from you when you find it convenient and assuring you of our prayers & best wishes and asking for a remembrance in your prayers.\n\nI remain yours,\n\nObdiently,\n\nAlbert Jones\n\nAddress: Hunter's Point\nMattawa, Ontario,\nMay 26, 1917\n\nRev. E.A.

Now as fast as I can learn the school that is wholly Protestant now; although at first it was an Indian school and supported by the government, the teacher being paid by the government. The government is paying two hundred a year yet to that school and only ten or eleven children going there, two children of those being Catholic.\nIt seems unjust that the Catholics should not receive support also since there are more Catholics and seeing the school was strictly Catholic at first evidently there has been some under-current and the change has been unnoticed to the surprise of Indians who ever it is at present in Quebec I don't know. There are fourteen children going to the Church now and there are a few more could be easily induced to withdraw from the other school and it would leave that school on its last legs.\n\nI feel my lord there should be an investigation into the matter and also with your influence in matters concerning education you could have the Indian Department look into this affair since it comes under their jurisdiction this place being a reserve. At present the Catholic families are anxious that something be done and are willing to cooperate with those who shall assist.

The return for the March quarter shows an enrolment of 25, with an average of 16, for whom the Department makes a contribution of $250.00 per annum towards the salary of the teacher. The teacher is not appointed by the Department.\n\nThere is no reason why all the Indians within a reasonable distance should not attend this school.\n\nIt would appear from the Bishop's letter and enclosures that a Roman Catholic school is being conducted in the church, as they object to their children attending the Protestant school, and they claim that the Department should assist them in obtaining a school for their children.\n\nIn 1907 the Department opened a summer school at Hunter's Point for the Grassi Band of Indians and a Roman Catholic teacher was put in charge. This school was conducted until the fall of 1909, when it was closed.\n\nIn July, 1913, the Rev. Mr. Mitchell of Mattawa asked the Department if it would allow the building and equipment to be used for an undenominational school, which was to be conducted for the benefit of the half-breeds and Indians there. The Department gave the necessary permission,\nand the school was re-opened in October, 1913. The present building does not meet the requirements of the school and the Department is making a contribution of $300.00 to assist in the erection of a new building.\n\nAs far as I can make out from the census returns all the Indians in this locality are Roman Catholics.\n\nIndian Affairs.

There has been a delay of about a month in forwarding it because of the lack of mail communication while the ice was breaking up on both rivers & ship pass sake. I am glad to have the matter closed up as it has given me a great deal of trouble. It will be about a month yet before the new building will be occupied.\n\nYours sincerely,\nJ. W. Mitchell\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nI have already accounted for the $300.00 granted by the Department toward the erection of a new School House at Hunter's Point, North River, and having just had the opportunity of visiting and inspecting the building have thought it well to report to you. Of course you understand that the sum granted was totally inadequate to erect it. Much of the material work was furnished from locally. The Colonial Company gave the timber; the work of squaring and transporting it was done by the natives whose children are receiving the elementary education given within its walls supplemented by local friends via two teachers. It is now almost completed but fit for occupation for school purposes and as advanced that it will no doubt be finished before the cold weather sets in.\n\nThe building is 20 x 30 feet built of squared logs set upright about 12 ft. to a ridge-tie roof. It has three windows in each side with...\nWAU BI NING LODGE\nKIPPEWA, P.Q.\n\ndoor in front. It is intended to build a porch the full breadth of the building. It is sealed with matched lumber over felt paper. The interior is about 14 ft. in height. The ceiling of the south end is yet unfinished, but the materials is ordered on the way. The flooring, ceiling, siding, etc., of the interior is of good materials and workmanship. The stove is not yet in place but provisions for the proper heating of the room is now the way. For the first time in the history of the school there is the prospect of the school being comfortably accommodated winter or summer. Since the project was set on foot about three years ago materials and labour have very greatly increased in cost. Had not self-denial and perseverance been exercised on the part of some of those whose children will reap the benefit thereof as well, it would have been impossible to carry this project to completion. The Department will find that in this School House it has received an ample return for its grant in aid.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nJames W. Mitchell\n\nStanding address:\nRev. J.M.

I shall be pleased if you will inform Miss Hansen accordingly, and arrange with her to accept delivery from the express office when the maps arrive at Kippewa.\n\nRelative to the desks, I would point out that when the building in which this school is conducted was originally erected, the Department supplied double desks sufficient to seat 20 pupils. This was in August, 1908. Since that time we have assisted in repairing the building to the amount of $300, and have allowed a grant for the teacher's salary and classroom supplies for the Indian children. We understand that only a small number of Indian children attend the school, the majority on the returns which the teacher forwards being half-breeds. As you are aware, this Department has no responsibility for the education of half-breed children, and we consider that we are dealing generously with this school in our grant for salary and classroom supplies. The desks which we supplied as mentioned above should still be in a serviceable condition and provide ample accommodation for any Indian children who attend. Our funds at the present time are extremely limited, and it will not be possible to furnish the desks asked for by the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

He stated that the Catholic members of the band at that point had put up a shack which they are using for school purposes; also that they had engaged the services of a teacher, Miss Sobeys, without qualifications, and that she has been teaching for nearly a year; He stated that they are paying her $30.00 per month salary and her board and have been supplying the books and stationery required themselves.\n\nThere is a combined white and Indian day school at this point. This Department contributed $300.00 a year ago to help erect a building. The school is managed by the white trustees who engage the teacher, and this Department pays $250.00 per annum towards salary. This school was erected for the benefit of the Indian and white children at Hunter's Point. The Catholic parents refuse to send their children, as they state they are receiving no religious instruction, and, as they desired a school of their own, they went ahead and put up the shack and engaged the teacher. They have 20 children attending.\n\nMr. Stanger requested that this Department contribute a grant to help them put up a suitable building, which would be located across the lake from the present school. They intend to build a log building and ask that we supply the material for the roofing and flooring, and also the desks and stove, pay the salary of the teacher and provide and books and stationery required. I informed him of the contribution the Department had already made for the erection of the building and the amount we are paying towards the teacher's salary and that it was intended that all the Indian children should attend this school. He states that the Catholic parents do not send their children, desiring a school of their own. Father Evain, the missionary who visits this point once a year, drew the attention of the Department.\nment to this matter in August, last, and stated that, as the Catholic Indians form the majority of the band, a Catholic teacher should be secured and religious instruction given. He was informed that, as the present school was managed by the white trustees, this Department had no say in the engaging of the teacher. There are no funds provided for the purpose of contributing to the erection of another school and paying the teacher's salary.\n\nMr. Stanger requested that an early reply be given to his request, and I shall be pleased to have your decision in the matter.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Beeth's stopping place and left there on Monday morning for Kipawa station. I was obliged both ways to pass a night at Mattawa and arrived here last night.\n\nI am enclosing the results of my inquiry which I trust will enable the Department to come to a decision regarding the school question at Hunters Point.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWilliam H. Lewis\nIndian Agent,\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nIndian Agents Office,\nNorth Temiskaming,\nP.Q.\n\nFebruary 2nd, 1921.\n\nSir:\n\nIn reference to the educational matters at Hunters Point Que., I beg to submit the following report.\n\nThere is at present a so-called combined white and Indian day school built largely by a grant from the Dept. of Indian Affairs. The school is built on the east side of a lake, on which side reside most of the white residents of this locality, the Indians living on the west side. It is obvious that when choosing a site for the school the requirements of the white people were catered to in preference to the Indians and the Indian children without exception have a crossing to make on the lake to get to the school which they are unable to do in the summer time without assistance. The white people are mostly all of the protestant religion, and the Indians are without exception of the Catholic religion, and therefore there is considerable friction between them as to which denomination the teacher should belong which is augmented I am led to believe by a good deal of interference on the part of the ministers and priests of the various denominations. The Indians refuse to send their children to the present school as long as there is a Protestant teacher and the white people want have a Catholic teacher, so as the Indians are all Catholics I beg to recommend that a separate school be provided for them or, if the present school is the property of the Department that it be moved to a more suitable site where it would be easy of access to the Indian children.\n\nAt present the Indians are sending their children to a school conducted by a Miss M. Sauve of Chapeau, who is not a qualified teacher but is apparently a very intelligent young lady. She has been teaching since the 6th of Oct. last and up till the present has received no salary whatever. The classes are held in a storehouse and there are 21 children attending, the names and ages of which I enclose herewith. They are all of Indian blood except two or three of whom are willing to pay a fee to have their children's school. The teacher is badly equipped for books for the children, but considering the way they are handicapped they are making fair progress. The teacher has no register but she informs me that these 21 children are very regular in their attendance.\n\nAt the other school which is supported by the Indian funds there are 14 pupils on the roll, who are all white children, and there is 5 or 6 of an average attendance. This school is conducted by a Miss Hansen, daughter of one of the trustees, who is not a qualified teacher. There are 14 underaged 3 of them children that are Catholic, the balance being protestants. It is to be regretted that these people cannot harmonize and run a non-sectarian school as with the number of children at this point a good school could be maintained. It is useless to try and compromise with these people as there has been considerable trouble in the past the only remedy for which is a separate school. Regarding the matter of building a new school, I took up the matter with the Indians who favor building a log building as it would be more suitable for...\nthat country and a good deal cheaper than a frame structure. They are willing to perform all the labor themselves with the exception of a few little jobs which will have to be done by a carpenter. All they ask is the material, an estimate of the cost of which, I beg to enclose. I may say that the rough lumber needed for this building can be obtained from the Shepard and Morse Lumber Co., who have a small sawmill 2 miles from Hunters Point. The furniture which I am led to believe is the property of the Department could be taken out of the other school.\n\nI would also recommend that the grant to the present school be suspended at once as the Indians are deriving no benefit from it, and be given to the school at which the Indian children attend. Miss Sauve has also asked me to find out if the Department will pay her salary and also if she can get some supplies for the school.\n\nI may add that 3 of the Indian families residing at Hunters point were formerly living in this district but they tell me they intend to make their permanent abode at Hunters Point. In making this report I have endeavored to state the facts as I found them but should I have omitted any information the Dept. may require I will be pleased to furnish it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent,\n\nJ.D. McKean Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 9, 1921.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nWith reference to the combined white and Indian school at Hunter's Point, to which this Department contributes a grant of $250.00 a year towards the salary of the teacher, I beg to say that it would appear, from reports received, that the Indians do not avail themselves of the privilege afforded them by this school and, as most of them are Roman Catholics, they refuse to allow their children to attend. The Indians refuse to send their children to the present school so long as there is a Protestant teacher and also as they reside on the west side of the lake, while this school is located on the side opposite to which they reside.\n\nOur Agent, who has forwarded a report regarding the situation at Hunter's Point, states that, while there are fourteen children on the roll of the school, they are nearly all white children and that the school is conducted by Miss Hanson, who is not a qualified teacher. The return received for the quarter ending December 31st, last, shows an enrolment of fifteen pupils. This return is certified by you and shows that, of the children on the roll, thirteen of them are Indians. The Agent states that at present the Indians are sending their children to a school which they have started themselves and that there are twenty-one children in attendance. If the Indian children do not attend the school taught by Miss Hanson this Department could not continue paying the grant towards salary.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will state definitely the number of Indian children in attendance at this school and also your views regarding the present situation in reference to school matters at Hunter's Point.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. W. Mitchell,\nMitchell,\nOnt.\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nWestern Hospital Toronto\nMarch 3rd 1921\n\nI regret exceedingly that this matter is reopened again exactly in the same way as it was about 3 years ago when the matter was thoroughly threshed out. All the more so I am laid up in this hospital the result of a fall before I got home from my visit of inspection to my left leg that cut me out from access to my documents. I have been laid up now about 6 months. The statements in your letter or several of them are entirely incorrect.\n\nIt is not a white Indian School but a union school under the Indians and your department. The children attending with the exception of the McCauldins are Indians in the same sense as those attending the Indian Department in the Separate School Welland. They all have Indian\nIt seems in aiding to finish the new building your agent reports that Mrs. Thomas is not a qualified teacher\u2014a certified teacher could not be got to this school for less than $60 or $70.00 which means no school here. Miss Thomas has similar qualifications & that who have proceeded her there been more successful in passing students than any other young schoolboy which I have heard.\n\nI was aided in getting the school started by Dr. Dennis & Mr. Hutton and in looking for this regard a Roman Catholic lady J. B. Stock in M.P. for Pontiac who is most local. Both of these gentlemen also have the article circumstances visited the Department for their representations. The grant was given the deed confirmed aid has been got from American visitors especially Daniel Ryden of Newburyshire without whose assistance I could not have ventured to ask for the school and without whose aid I fear the school would not be long continued.\n\nMr. Jones has worked after winter got a school for a few months for the Roma Catholic then renewed the effort again this winter. It was under them it broke down before. Some of the children attending the union school all along have been Roman Catholics here still.\n\nThe new building was erected on the side of the old school by the same people when running the Hunter's Post Road hereon. It is situated on Hunter's Patent in yet an excellent spot that could be selected. This month one large family the Adams have here the largest claim to have offspring here & they have been invited over here. That has cut down the other seven.\n\nThis is the first letter that I have been able to write up to date since October. Please excuse. I have written with difficulty I would have replied earlier if able.\n\nS. W. Mitchell\nblood while those who are working in this matter here will one exception take a degree from North American or Indian there no claim on the Department. The Jones family who have been the main agitators are English speaking while Macdonald is a French Canadian. To my knowledge the Indians, tan sons, farmers, aliens settling who have sent their children are native born throughout and within three there all Indian blood has an interest entitled to the consideration of the Department as there of similar standing in Metamora where I spent approximately five years.\n\nAs to the school was started under Roman Catholic auspices led by the Jones family then over into the Royal House at the river Bank. After a short history it lost its doors that were closed down for five years when I got it reopened about seven years ago. It has proved remarkably successful since in passing scholars at the entrance recommendation for a staff attended over ten the interest of those helping children.\nTo attend in aiding to finish the new building your agent reports that Mary Thomas is not a qualified teacher\u2014a certified teacher could not be got to this school for less than $600 which means no school there. Miss Thomas similar qualifications to those who have preceded her there, been more successful in raising children than any other young school teacher I have heard.\n\nI was aided in getting the school restored by Dr. James & Wallawawa Indian Station for this region of a Roman Catholic Phys. J. B. Stock, M.D., P. for Pontiac near Montreal. Both these gentlemen who knew the whole circumstances visited the Department for their representations. The grant was given the last confirmed aid has been got from American visitors officially. Colonel Ryerson of Macdonald visited whose assistance I could not have ventured to ask as still able to without whose aid I fear the school would not be long continued.\n\nMr. Jones has winter after winter got a school for a few months for the Roman Catholics, then renewed the effort again this winter. It was under him it broke down before. Some of the children attending the union school all along have been Roman Catholics too.\n\nThe new building was erected on the site of the old school by the same people when moving the Huron's Post Road passed. It is situated on Huron's Path so is yet so central an area that could be added. This with one large family the Adams have here the first time to have offspring four & I have been invited to assist. That has cut down the other donor.\n\nThis is the first letter that I have been able to get up to write since October.\n\nPlease excuse, I have written with difficulty toward have replaced certain able expressions respectfully,\n\nS. W. Mitchell\nThe Department of Indian Affairs\nParliament Buildings\nEducational Section\nOttawa\nMarch 3rd 1924\n\nMy dear Sir,\n\nI am writing to you in reply to your letter of the 2nd. I forget to indicate the fact that I wrote to you about the same time you wrote me a letter regarding the school. The matter was then fully gone into by Dr. James F. B. Ketchum whom you have had intercourse regarding the matter. The facts were again discussed through the eyes of a French Canadian Roman Catholic.\n\nS. K. Mitchell\nOttawa, March 8, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd ultimo furnishing a report on your visit in connection with educational matters at Hunter's Point.\n\nIn your report it is noted you state that the present school is built on the east side of the lake, on which side reside most of the white residents, while the Indians live on the west side, also that the white people are mostly all of the Protestant religion and that the Indians are, without exception, Catholic, consequently there is considerable friction between them as to which denomination the teacher should belong; also that the Indians refuse to send their children to the present school as long as there is a Protestant teacher, and recommend that a separate school be provided for them near where they reside. It is also noted that there are fourteen pupils on the roll at the Hunter's Point School, all of whom are white children, and that the teacher, Miss Hansen, has no qualifications. It is also noted that you recommend that the grant to the Hunter's Point School be suspended, as the Indians are deriving no benefit from it, and that it be given to the school which the Indians have started themselves and which is being taught by Miss Sauve.\n\nIn connection with your report the Department referred the matter to Rev. J. H. Mitchell, under whose auspices the school at Hunter's Point is being conducted, and I enclose herewith a copy of a portion of the communication received from him.\n\nThere is such a difference in his letter from the conditions stated by you in your report that this matter is again being referred to you, as it is impossible for the Department to arrive at a decision when the reports from Rev. Mr. Mitchell and yourself are so much at variance. A further report from you is desired in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWilliam H. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorth Temiskaming, Que.\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of letter No.35-3-1 of the 8th instant enclosing extract from the report of the Rev.J.W.Mitchell regarding educational matters at Hunters Point,Que. I also note with interest the Rev. gentlemen's comments on this matter. The reason for the variance in the report made by me and the one made by the Rev.Mr.Mitchell is that he is studying the interests of the Protestants and I made my statements in the interests of the Indians. When I made my report on this matter I endeavored to state the facts as I found them, conscientiously and without partiality, and I recommended that a separate school be provided on the strength of section 97 paragraph 2 page 54 of the Indian Act.\n\nAs I stated in my previous report it is to be regretted that these people cannot agree and run a combined school as that would be the best thing that they could do. The whole trouble is caused by the two different denominations which apparently cannot pull together, and as I stated before there is considerable opposition between the ministers and priests of the different denominations. If a report were to be got from Father or some other R.C.priest of that locality he would have an altogether different story to tell than the Rev.Mitchell.\n\nI beg to differ from the Rev.gentleman when he says that the Hansens,Terriers,Adams,and others are of Indian blood as they are native born.The fact of a man being born in the bush doesn't necessarily make an Indian of him,they may have a sprinkling of Indian blood in them but if any at all it is very little. He also states that those mixing in this matter are whites with one exception, I also beg to differ with the Rev.gentleman on this matter.\n\nOn my recent visit to that point I saw all the Indians,that is the Indians within the meaning of the act, and they were all emphatic in their refusal to send their children to the combined school. The man Beaudreau he refers to is a Frenchman alright but he is married to an Andogwin a full blooded Indian woman and he is willing to pay fee to have his children attend a Catholic school. I say also side that in all this agency I do not know of one Protestant Indian whom I recommended a catholic school be provided I did not do so with any motives of malice against the Protestants,but in the welfare of the Indians in my charge which I am led to believe by my copy of instructions to Agents it is my chief duty to do.\n\nI cannot rescind any portion of my previous report as I believe I reported faithfully on conditions as I found them at present. As to conditions 5 or 8 years ago as the Rev.Mr.Mitchell refers to I know nothing, but I do know that at present the Indians are deriving no benefit from the school run under the present auspices.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWilliam Lewis\nIndian Agent\n\nJ.D.McLean Esq.\nAsst Deputy and Secretary,\nDept.of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nIndian Affairs.

Lewis\nIndian Agent,\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nThe following summarizes as briefly as possible the situation at Hunter's Point, where application has been made for the establishment of another school for the children of the Roman Catholic Indian parents.\n\nApplication for this school was made by a delegation of Indians, who visited the Department in January, last, and, in order to get a knowledge of the conditions, Mr. Agent Lewis was instructed to visit Hunter's Point and furnish a report. He states that at present the combined white and Indian day school, towards which the Department gave a grant for the erection to the extent of $300.00 two years ago and to which it contributes half the teacher's salary to the extent of $250.00 per annum, is being attended by white children only. He states that the Indians reside on the opposite side of the lake and are all Catholics, there not being a Protestant Indian in the agency as far as he is aware, and that they refuse to send their children because the teacher is not a Catholic and the school is conducted under Protestant auspices. He states that there is considerable friction between the different denominations, which is fostered, he believes, by a good deal of interference on the part of the minister and priest of each denomination. He recommends that a separate school be provided for the Indian children on the opposite side of the lake from the present building, where the Indians reside, and that the grant to the present school be suspended, as the Indians are deriving no benefit from it.\n\nThese Indians have put up a shack and have engaged a teacher and are carrying on a school. There were 18 Indian children in attendance on the date of the Agent's visit. The Indians are desirous of putting up a new building, as the present shack is not suitable, and they have agreed to do all the work and supply the logs required, but require certain material, such as flooring and windows, to the extent of $250.00 to finish the building, and also request that the salary of the\nthe teacher be paid.\n\nThis matter was referred to Rev. J. W. Mitchell, under whose auspices the present combined school is conducted. His statement is in direct variance with that of the Agent, as he states that there are fourteen Indian children in attendance at the combined school and gives the names of their parents. Mr. Lewis states that he differs from the Reverend gentleman when he says that they are Indians. They may have a slight sprinkling of Indian blood, but, if any at all it is very little. Mr. Mitchell states that the present agitation is engineered on the part of the white people and the Agent states that he saw all the Indians and they were all emphatic in their refusal to send their children to the combined school. A copy of that part of Mr. Mitchell's letter which was in direct variance to the report of the Agent was submitted to Mr. Lewis for a further report and he states that he cannot rescind any portion of the report he made and that he knows that the Indians are deriving no benefit from the school run under the present auspices and recommends that a grant be allowed to assist the Indians to build a school and that the salary of the teacher be paid.\n\nIt is difficult to decide what is best to be done in this matter, but it appears to me that we should be guided by the report of our Agent, as the Indians are very anxious to obtain an education for their children, which is evidenced by the fact that they have already put up a building and engaged the services of a teacher.\n\nThe children attending the present school, whom Mr. Mitchell claims to be Indians, have little or no Indian blood, although locally they are called Indians. We have been contributing a grant towards the salary of the teacher of the combined school for a period of eight years, having made the grant in the first instance at the request of Mr. J. B. Klock, ex-M.P. for Pontiac, and Dr. James of Mattawa, who visited the Department with Mr. Mitchell at that time. The correspondence in the matter is hereunder.\nOttawa, March 31, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant reporting further in regard to educational matters at Hunter's Point.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department, after fully considering this matter, has decided to grant its approval and assistance to the carrying on of school for the Indians residing on the west side of the lake and which will be for the children of Roman Catholic parents. This assistance will be granted on the following conditions, namely:\n\n1. That the Indians themselves will erect a suitable building for the purpose of carrying on the work. The Department cannot undertake to contribute any amount towards the cost of its erection.\n\n2. A salary will be provided for a teacher from the first of April, next, the beginning of the next fiscal year; the amount to be provided will depend upon the qualifications which the teacher possesses.\n\n3. The Department will also provide a suitable stove, blackboards, desks and the school material and stationery, etc., required from time to time. It is expected that the Indians themselves will provide the fuel required.\n\nI should be pleased if you would inform the Indians concerned accordingly and you should encourage them to begin the work of erecting a suitable building and give them any advice you can in the matter. The new building should be erected on a site convenient to the majority of the children and it should be high and dry and easily drained. It is to be understood that this building, when completed, is the property of the Indians, is for the benefit of the children of Roman Catholic parents and that a teacher of that denomination is to be employed. The appointment of teachers, together with the salary allowed, is to be approved by the Department. As the Indians have engaged the present teacher without any reference to the Department and as there are no funds provided for the payment of her salary, she will have to look to the Indians for the amount due her up to the end of the present month.\n\nA requisition has been received for a supply of books, stationery, etc., which is being ordered, to be sent the teacher, from the Government Stationery Office.\n\nYou should explain the conditions under which the Department will assist this school fully to the Indians concerned and advise them in any way you can regarding the erection of a suitable building and have the work undertaken and completed at an early date. I shall be pleased to hear from you when you have had an opportunity to place this matter before the Indians.\n\nWilliam H.

It is hoped that they will put up a building which will be suitable for the purpose.\n\nAs soon as this building is completed, I will be pleased if you will furnish a description as to the size, etc., of the same.\n\nAs the Department has promised to furnish a blackboard and desks, you should take the size of the space reserved for a blackboard, the number of desks required, and, if possible, the sizes.

She will be paid at this rate from April 1st, last, as you were previously advised.

As soon as this return is received, payment of salary and bonus due her at the above rate will be made. She should forward her quarterly returns to you at the end of each quarter and you should certify the same and forward them to the Department in the usual way.\n\nA supply of blank forms is enclosed herewith, which you will be good enough to send to Miss Sauve and, at the same time, inform her of the Department's requirements regarding the preparation of the returns.

Indian Day School.\n\nAs you were informed in official letter of the 20th ultimo, Rev. Father Evain, Ville Marie, Que., has been endeavouring to secure a teacher for this school and the Department informed him that you could be obtained. No reply has yet been received from Father Evain, but this is, no doubt, due to the fact that the new school at Hunters' Point is not yet ready for occupation.\n\nThe Department is today communicating with Mr. Agent Lewis and requesting him to confer with Father Evain, and you will, no doubt, hear from either of these gentlemen in the near future, as it is expected to open this school at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

You are figuring it up at twelve months school in a year and there are only ten months school in a year of ten months at the rate of three hundred and fifty dollars per year would be thirty-five dollars a month and three months at thirty-five dollars a month would entitle me to one hundred and five dollars and you only sent me eighty-seven dollars and fifty cents so there is still seventeen dollars and fifty cents due me.

Indian Day School at Hunters Point, was sent to me by the Rev. Father Evain, together with a few lines asking me to look after the matter.\n\nI was not aware that the Dept. had been in correspondence with the Rev. Father Evain on this subject so I wrote Miss Marcotte to the effect that she would have to apply to the Dept. for her appointment. It was an oversight on the part of the priest in not advising me that she had been referred to him by the Department, so I did not know that she had already made an application.\n\nAs this appears to be the teacher that Father Evain has in view for this school I beg to suggest that her services be secured if she has not already engaged for some other school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nA.F.

The Department has also received an application from Miss Catherine Honan, who is at present teaching the summer school at Bear Island.\n\nAs the matter of securing a teacher was left in the hands of Rev. Father Evain, Ville Marie, P.Q., the Department is not in a position to approve of the appointment of either of these ladies, but will be guided in the matter by the wishes of Father Evain. It might be well for you to correspond with him and obtain his wishes in the matter, and you can then arrange with the teacher whom he selects to begin duties when the school is ready for occupation.\n\nYou will be good enough at a later date to inform the Department as to the name of the teacher who is finally selected by Father Evain for this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Evain, Ville Marie, P.Q., who is the missionary in charge of the district in which this school is located.\n\nFather Evain has been informed that the obtaining of a teacher is left in his hands.

Indian Day School at Hunter's Point rather than that of Miss Marcotte, who has also applied for the position.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that the Department will approve of Miss Honan's appointment, to begin duties when the school is completed and ready for occupation. The salary allowed her will be at the rate of $350 per annum, together with bonus at the rate of $150 per annum during the present fiscal year. It is considered that this will compare favourably with the salaries paid to teachers having the qualifications which Miss Honan possesses in the rural white schools in the surrounding districts.\n\nIf Miss Honan will not accept the position at the above salary you may offer the position to Miss Marcotte at the same salary.\n\nI will be pleased if you will state whether Miss Honan accepts the position as teacher of this school or not, and, if so, the date she begins duties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I gave the preference of the position to my sister, therefore I would be very grateful if my application could be favourably considered in the appointment of a teacher for any vacant school with a salary of not less than $75 per month, and having a teacher's residence preferred.\n\nThanking you for past favours,\nYours faithfully,\nE. Moran\nOTTAWA, February 4th, 1922.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo, with reference to your resignation as teacher of the Hunter's Point (R.C.) Indian day school, and applying for a position in another school at a salary of $75.00 per month.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that we have no vacancies at the present time to which you could be appointed, and are not likely to require the services of a teacher until after the coming summer holidays. It would be advisable for you to make another application in July, next, when, if there are any vacancies, we will be pleased to give your application due consideration.\n\nA communication was received from Mr. Agent Cockburn enclosing the application of your sister for the summer school at Bear Island, and the Department has approved of her appointment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMiss Catherine Honan,\nHunter's Point,\nQue.\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose report of Hunter's Point R.C. Indian day school for the month ending January 31st. This being my first visit to this school since its establishment I beg to advise the Department that the Indians have erected a first class schoolhouse 20ft wide by 30ft long, also two necessary outbuildings. The schoolhouse is well lighted, being provided with 8 long windows, 3 on each side and 2 in the front. The building is warm and comfortable, and is kept very clean. There is also a good supply of firewood on hand. The desks, stove and other furniture are all arranged, and there is accommodation for 36 scholars. The school teacher is well provided with material, and all the supplies sent for this school have arrived in good condition.\n\nI had the opportunity of looking over the work done by the scholars, and was surprised at the rapid advancement made by them. The discipline is first class, and the parents of the children seem to take an interest in sending them to school and keeping them clean.\n\nThe attendance is not very large at present, owing to a few cases of small-pox having developed among the residents of this district, during the early part of the winter. Some of the parents have been afraid to send their children to school for fear they would contract the disease. The disease is now under control, being confined to one family of white people, who are suspected case among the Indians, and all precautions necessary are being taken to prevent its spreading, so it is anticipated that the school attendance will increase in the near future.\n\nThe teacher has requested me to ascertain if the Department will provide 6 window blinds for use at the school, as the windows are exposed to the sunlight, which at times is too strong for the scholars. She would also like some soap and towelling, and a desk for her use in the school, or the lumber necessary to have one constructed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, February 9th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, reporting on the building and work being carried on at the Hunter's Point (R.C.) Indian day school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is pleased to learn that a satisfactory building for school purposes has been erected by the Indians and that the furniture supplied has been well arranged and the building generally is kept in good condition, also that there has been a good attendance of Indian children in the district.\n\nRegarding the teacher's request for certain supplies, I beg to say that you may purchase and have delivered 6 window blinds, complete, of the sizes required, 6 cakes of soap and 6 yards of towelling. Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred should be forwarded.\n\nRegarding a desk for the teacher, I beg to say that it would, no doubt, be cheaper to have this built by a carpenter, and if you or the teacher can arrange to have this done, you may purchase the lumber required. No undue expenditure should be incurred for the purpose, and properly certified vouchers covering the cost of the material and labour in making the desk should be forwarded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

It is hoped that you will continue your services, and I will be pleased to hear from you at an early date stating definitely your intention.\n\nRegarding your request that books, toys, etc., be allowed for prizes for the children at Easter, I beg to say that you may expend an amount not to exceed $5.00 in the purchase of suitable gifts for the children.\n\nIn making the purchase of these articles, you should obtain itemized accounts, in duplicate, from the merchant from whom you make the purchase. You should then certify thereon that the goods were received by you and the prices charged were fair and just, and you should forward these accounts to Mr. Agent Lewis, North Temiskaming, who is being informed of the authority granted you to make the purchase.\n\nThe Department will leave the matter of the purchase in your hands, as you will be in a better position to make a selection of the articles you consider would be suitable for the children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMiss Catherine Honan,\nTeacher, R.C.

Indian day school, in which she states that she is unable to give a definite answer to the request of the Department that she continue her services as teacher. She states, however, that she will be in a position to inform the Department definitely as to her decision at an early date. It is hoped that she will be able to remain.\n\nMiss Honan requests that a small grant be allowed to purchase books, toys, etc., to be awarded the pupils at the closing of the school for the Easter holidays, and she has been informed that she may expend an amount not to exceed $5.00 in the purchase of these supplies. She has been requested to obtain itemized accounts, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred, and to forward these accounts to you. You will be good enough to attach them to proper voucher forms and forward to the Department for payment.\n\nAs soon as we hear definitely from Miss Honan as to whether she remains as teacher, you will be informed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

The matter rests in Father Train's hands and the mail service is so unsatisfactory I have not yet received his answer to my letter dated Feb. 16, 1928. I cannot safely promise, however, to not leave the school in May until my successor arrives.\n\nI take this occasion to advise you that the Stationery Department...\nMEMO.\n\nis not giving satisfaction in forwarding books. In my last request I asked for Wesleyan Indian Grammar. Secured old gram mara that have not been used for the last 20 yrs in Indians and a few old spelling books from some convalescent hospital for soldiers. Needless to say the books are no use to me. I have 3 pupils who should be writing Indians in Indians and therefore require up-to-date text books.\n\nIn my application I omitted to state that I had a 5th Class certificate for Indians and have had 20 yrs experience in teaching in Northern Indians.\n\nThanking you for your favour.\n\nYours etc.,\nC. Donan,\nHunter's Point, Que.\nOTTAWA, March 21st, 1922.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that we will be pleased to have your definite decision as to whether you will remain as teacher of the Hunter's Point R.C. Indian day school or not. It is hoped, however, that you will decide to remain for the balance of the school year at least, viz: to June 30th, next.\n\nIt is noted that you will not leave the school in May until a successor arrives.\n\nAs soon as you have received word from Rev. Father Evain, we will be pleased to have a reply from you as to your intention.\n\nRegarding the grammars and spelling books sent you, it is regretted that they were not satisfactory. We will place an order with the Government Stationery Office to forward to your address 6 Ontario grammars and 3 Ontario public school spelling books.\n\nThe grammars and spelling books which you received may be handed to the Indian children, as the Department does not require them to be returned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Agent\nNorth Temiskaming, Ont.\n\nSir,\n\nEarly in February I received a letter from Father Evans advising me that he had obtained a transfer for me to North Temiskaming; recently he wrote me saying the matter of my transfer rested in your hands (which is equivalent to saying he had authority from the Dept. to transfer me) and yesterday I was informed by Albert Stanger that the school was not vacant.\n\nIn view of such conflicting reports I consider it is in the best interests of the School to advise you that I would like to sever connection with the Indian Service as early as\nMEMO.\n\nMay as navigation open as it does to me. The executive is in no one person's hands and, moreover, my own word is as good as my oath, and I like to deal with people who respect their word. Father Evans engaged me at $40 a m., the Dept. paid $30 and now refuse a transfer to a better paying place.\n\nI have pledged my word, however, to the Department that I shall not leave the school till my successor arrives; it would be a crime to make the pupils lose any more time after losing six weeks last fall but that does not mean that I'll remain for a whole month awaiting the arrival of my relief.\n\nI suggest (if I may take the liberty) that you engage an Ottawa Normal trained teacher. From the Eastern end of that\nMEMO.\n\nAt\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n\nrenowned training schools, you could procure an experienced teacher if the Department would pay a reasonably good salary. I assure you the pupil's ability and good will and application to study warrant the expenditure and trouble. It would be a crime to have such extraordinary ability wasted through the incompetency of a raw recruit to the ranks of the teaching profession.\n\nThank you for past favours and wish you succeed in securing a Normal trained successor for me.\n\nYours Etc\n\nC. Moran\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose a letter received by me from Miss Henan, teacher of the Hunter's Point R.C. Indian day school, in which it appears that she has been mislead, or must have misconstrued some statements made to her by Father Evain from Quebec.\n\nShe states that she was engaged by Father Evain at a salary of $90.00 per month, but as I stated in my letter to the Department of the 25th of January last, I had informed Miss Henan that the salary attached to this school was $350.00 per annum plus the bonus, so it does not matter what Father Evain promised her, she knew before she took up her duties what the Department were prepared to pay. Her desire to be transferred to the school at North Temiskaming was prompted by the fact that the salary was higher here, but as the Department has increased her salary to that paid to the teacher of the Temiskaming school I do not see that it makes any difference which school she is in charge of.\n\nKindly advise me what to do in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D.

I very much regret that I did not forward you the date of my leaving earlier; I was waiting on Father Evans' letter which was delayed in route and contained nothing satisfactory to me. Evidently the man exceeded his authority when he engaged me for North Temiskaming. Hoping you will have no trouble securing a successor and thanking you for past favour.\n\nYours truly,\nC. Moran\nOTTAWA, April 15th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant, enclosing a communication which you received from Miss Honan, teacher of the Hunter's Point Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that in February, last, the Department had a communication from Father Evans in which he stated that he was endeavouring to secure the transfer of Miss Honan to North Temiskaming, and he was informed in reply that the Department desired to retain her services at Hunter's Point, and was increasing her salary to $600 per annum, plus bonus, from the first of the present month, on the condition that she remain as teacher at Hunter's Point. Miss Honan was also informed of the increase in salary offered if she would remain, and she acknowledged receipt of our letter and stated that she was unable to give a definite answer as to whether she would remain or not. Upon being further requested to state definitely as to whether she intended to remain, she informed us that she was still unable to give a definite answer. You were fully advised in this matter.\n\nThe resignation of Miss Honan, dated the 5th instant, has now been received, and it is her intention to vacate the school on the 5th of May, next. We have given her every opportunity to remain on as teacher, but in view of the resignation which she now forwards, we have no option but to accept the same to take effect May 5th, next. We are informing her accordingly, and requesting her to prepare a return showing the attendance and days taught during the present quarter up to the date of her resignation.\n\nWe are endeavouring to obtain the services of a qualified teacher to succeed her and you will be further advised in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Indian Day School to take effect May 5th, next.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that we regret you have decided to give up duties as teacher of this school and that there should have been any misunderstanding between yourself and Father Ewain regarding a transfer to North Temiskaming. There is no vacancy there, and the teacher of that school is in receipt of the same salary as was offered you, viz: $600 per annum and bonus. As you have finally decided to give up duties, we have no option but to accept your resignation, to take effect on the 5th of May, next, and will endeavour to obtain a teacher to succeed you.\n\nYou should prepare a return showing the attendance and days taught by you from the 1st instant up to the date you retire, and you should forward this return to Mr. Agent Lewis.\n\nYour services while in our employ have been satisfactory, and it is with regret that we accept your resignation.\n\nWe are informing Mr. Agent Lewis that you are giving up duties on the 5th of May, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Since the month of September I have received complaints from nearly every family interested in that school.\n\nOne thing that I do know is that she is not able to teach English properly. As she was boarding with an English speaking family, I thought she would soon get the right pronunciation but it does not seem so, she has changed boarding house several times, it does not say much in her favour. Reverend Father Evain who knows the people better than I do has received the same complaints and he is of the opinion that a change is necessary.\n\nI wrote to Miss Gosselin some times ago telling her all the complaints I had received, that most of the families were talking about taking their children away from school if there was no change and that in these circumstances I thought it was better for her to send her resignation to the Department.

C. Indian Day School, I have received the resignation of Miss Mercedes Gosselin. I am in touch with the Rev. Father Ewan and the Rev. Father Paquette, with reference to securing a suitable successor. If, in the meantime, a likely applicant comes to your attention, you might forward the particulars to me.\n\nI should also be grateful for a detailed report with reference to conditions at this point. If you received an application from Mrs. Garfield Jones while at Hunter's Point, please let me know what you think of her.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nZ.

Indian Day School, has forwarded her resignation direct to the Department. I am writing to you, knowing the interest you have in this school, so that you will be informed as to what action is being taken. We have but one application for the position that of Mrs. Garfield Jones, who lives at Hunter's Point. Please let me know without delay if you consider she would be suitable, so that I can reply to her letter. The Rev. Fathers Guy and Paquette, of this city, are endeavouring to find a suitable teacher with both French and English, but it is possible that they will be unsuccessful. Perhaps you could let us have the name of someone who would be satisfactory for the work. An early reply will be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

In application of Miss Garfield Jones, I'll tell you that this lady has a good reputation in the place she has been also in the past, teaching at that school. I like to believe that the people will agree with her. So if there is no other teacher on the list, I am in favor of this Miss G. Jones until next season.\n\nShe cannot teach French, but it is better to have school opened for English only than to leave none.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department should have been informed before this of the inexperience and lack of teaching qualifications of Miss Sauve. As her re-appointment has been approved, it will hardly be possible to make any change in teachers before the end of the present year. A further report should be forwarded late next fall, when, if Miss Sauve's services are not satisfactory, a change could be made after the Christmas holidays.

Indian Day School. He stated that the present teacher, Miss Maria Sauve, is not suitable and requested that a change of teachers be made at the end of the current year, namely, December 31st next.\n\nHe recommends the appointment of Miss Marcotte, Chapeau, Que., and states that this girl is about 27 years of age and has had 6 or 7 years experience.\n\nRev. Father Evain further stated that he had discussed the matter with Mr. Casa, who was prepared to approve Father Evain's recommendation with reference to this school.\n\nI told Father Evain that we would write to Mr. Casa.

Cope, the Indian agent wrote her the beginning of last month notifying her that her service would not be required after the Christmas holidays. No particular reason has been stated only that she is not capable of teaching French. No person of authority has examined her pupils or even questioned her to know what her capabilities are therefore this should be taken into consideration. You have engaged her for the term at a salary of seven hundred and fifty dollars therefore if you dismiss her she will be left without a position. Justice should be shown her.

In the past, the Department has looked to the Indian Agent and the Roman Catholic Missionary of the district for the nomination of teachers. They nominate the services of Miss Christina Nephin, who has been in our employ as teacher of the Brennan Lake Indian Day School, in the same district as the Hunter's Point School, and her services have been satisfactory.

The salary will be at the same rate as was paid Miss Marcotte, viz.: $80 per teaching month. Please advise her of her appointment and arrange that she begins duties on the date above mentioned. I would request that you give her any assistance you can in her work at this school.\n\nI note that Rev. Father Martel, O.M.I., approves the appointment of Miss Nephin.

Would you have another teacher to propose?\n\nThe parents would like the children to be taught in both French and English, seeing that the school is in Quebec and that both languages are equally spoken in this district.\n\nI had to help the Indians of that locality by giving them $100. of my own pocket towards the construction of the school. This will not be sufficient. Could not the Department contribute also to this construction?\n\nThese people greatly need help. The floor, the roof, the doors and windows of that school cost alone, nearly $300.00.\n\nThe same situation exists at the school of Lake Brenner. I went over there and I also collected $150.00 for the construction of their school; but it would still require as much to complete the construction.\n\nHumbly yours,\n\n(SGD) I.

I might point out that the Department approved of a school for the Roman Catholic Indians of the Hunters' Point Reserve on the understanding that the Indians themselves would erect a suitable building for the purpose. Mr. Agent Lewis was informed on March 31st, last, that the Department would not undertake to contribute any amount towards the cost of the erection of this building.\n\nThe establishment of a school at Brennan's Lake was also approved on the understanding that the McLaughlin Lumber Company and the Indians would erect a suitable building for school purposes and provide desks, stove, etc. (reference official letter to you of August 16, 1921.)\n\nThe Department did, however, agree to provide a stove, blackboard, desks and school material for the Hunters' Point school and to pay the salaries of the teachers for both schools and the Department is prepared to carry out its part of the bargain as soon as the buildings are completed.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nA.

The site chosen for this\nbuilding has been cleared and prepared, and I must add\nthat it is very favorable for the purpose. The timber is\nall made and hewed, and at the time of my visit was being\nhailed out to the site of the building. The work did\nnot proceed very much during the summer, as the Indians\nwere without ammunition for ranging or fighting fire, the\nbigger part of the summer, and they also were without the\nnecessary funds to purchase the materials for the\nconstruction. This obstacle has been overcome however\nas the priest at the time of his mission collected\nenough to defray the cost of the material needed. The\ndressed and rough lumber has been purchased, the hardware\nand roofing also, and should be on the ground by this time.\n\nThere is quite a gang working at the building,\nand they expect to have it completed by the first week\nin September. The building when completed will be 20 ft.\nby 28 ft. inside, and loft, from floor to ceiling, and will\naccommodate 36 scholars. It is of hewed log construction\nwith matched lumber floor and ceiling, 3 windows on each\nside and 2 in the front, also a perch on the front. It\nwill be a good building as there are some very handy\nmen working on it. I beg to enclose a list of the\ndesks and other furnishings the Indians ask for to rig\nup their school when completed.

It is presumed that the address to which they should be forwarded is Kipawa, Que., as that is the closest railway station, and arrangements could then be made to have them forwarded to the school from that point. It is noted that it is the intention to arrange these desks in the school room as follows: - two rows of seven on each side and four in the centre. The small sizes should be placed at the front and the larger at the rear.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase and delivery at the school of one box stove, to take 36\" wood, also the stove pipe and elbow required. You may also purchase three serviceable chairs, one water pail and two cups, two wash hand basins, one broom and one cheap school wall clock.\n\nBefore making the above purchases, you should obtain competitive prices from a number of dealers and purchase from the one quoting you the lowest price in each case. After the purchase has been made you will be good enough to forward properly receipted vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred, to which should be attached a memorandum showing the names of the firms asked to quote a price and the prices quoted by each.\n\nRegarding the blackboards, it will be necessary to obtain the size before placing the order, and I will be pleased if you will let me have this information as soon as possible, also the address to which they should be shipped.\n\nThe lesson charts, map of Canada and school bell will be ordered from the Government Stationery Office, and a copy of the Indian Day School Regulations is enclosed herewith.\n\nW.

Study it. The more you know about it, the better you will like it. See Next Page for Full Description.\nDESCRIPTION OF HINGE\n\nRead This Carefully--It is Important.\n\nNo chain is stronger than its weakest link. Also the life of a school desk cannot be greater than the life of the hinge. In the development of the New Globe Automatic our energy was directed toward the elimination of faults in the Hinge.\n\nOUR SUCCESS IS COMPLETE\n\nWe sincerely believe that the Hinge in the New Automatic is the strongest Automatic Seat Hinge ever invented and comes nearer to being noiseless than any other now on the market.\n\nAbsolute noiselessness can only be secured by the use of rubber or leather buffers, or springs and when such parts are used it is only a question of time till they become worn or dislodged and must then be replaced or the desk is too noisy for further use.\n\nThose who have had experience in getting repairs for school desks know how difficult and unsatisfactory it is, and, therefore, the desk that will wear the longest without needing repairs is the most valuable one to the school.\n\nThere are fewer parts in the Hinge of the New Globe than are found in any other School Desk Hinge on the market. This alone reduces the possibility of its getting out of order.\n\nIt does not depend on bumpers or rubber, leather or other material, nor on springs of any kind for its noiseless action.\n\nThe steel balls used in the Hinge are one-half inch in diameter, being twice as large as those used by any other manufacturer, thus giving greater wear resisting qualities.\n\nThe balls in the Hinge of the New Globe are NOT held in position by means of springs, because when such is the case the spring will in time lose its tension allowing the balls to get out of their proper position, or drop out entirely.\n\nIn the Hinge of the New Globe the steel balls absorb no friction and have no wearing contact of iron against iron. In every other so-called Ball Bearing Desk there is a wearing contact of iron against iron.\n\nThe accompanying illustration, Fig. I, will give you a fairly accurate understanding of the great simplicity of the Hinge, and you will note that \"A\" is the Seat Arm; \"B\" shows a portion of the Desk Leg or Casting. When the Seat Arm is in its place, the Ball fits into Socket \"Q.\" The Ball guided by \"A\" moves in Groove \"S\" on \"R\" when the seat is raised or lowered. Ball \"I\" rests in Socket in \"R\" and runs along the inside of the Casting \"B\" at \"S\" between \"J\" and \"K.\" The Casting grows gradually thicker as it reaches the point \"K,\" so that the Ball runs less easily as it reaches the end of its journey. This brings the seat to a gradual stop without jar or noise. When the seat is lowered the ball rolls towards \"J\" where the casting is also thicker. The seat comes to a gradual stop in the same way and for the same reason as when it is raised.\n\nThe office of the Bolt \"F\" and the Cap \"D\" is merely to hold the parts together. The bolt passes through the Seat Arm \"A\" in Slot \"G\" and through Casting \"B\" at \"H.\" The notch \"E\" Casting \"D\" is placed over the Lug \"C\" on \"B\" to prevent \"D\"s\" turning with the Seat Arm.\n\nThe Lugs \"L,\" \"M\" and \"N\" prevent the Seat from raising or lowering beyond the proper position and also carry a part of the weight of the pupil, thus relieving the working parts of some of the strain.\nNew Globe\nAdjustable Automatic Desks\n\nTABLE OF SIZES\u2014ADJUSTABLE\n\n| DESK NUMBERS | 1 or A | 3 or B | 5 or C |\n|--------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Size of Top  | 23\u00bd x 16 | 20\u00bd x 14 | 17\u00bd x 12 |\n| Size of Book Box inside | 22 x 11 | 19 x 9\u00bd | 16 x 8 |\n| Range of Desk Adjustment | 26\u00bd to 32\u00bd | 22\u00bd to 27\u00bd | 19\u00bd to 24\u00bd |\n| Range of Seat Adjustment | 18 to 24 | 11 to 15\u00be | 9 to 13 |\n| Floor Space | 28 to 30 | 25 to 27 | 22 to 25 |\n| Ages Accommodated | 10 up | 6 to 11 | 4 to 7 |\n\nEvery part of our New Globe Automatic and New Globe Automatic Adjustable Desks is made of the very best material procurable of their respective kind. The construction is solid and durable. Woods finished in our special school desk hard oil varnish. Castings finished in black japan, thoroughly baked. Woods are of selected hardwood, kiln dried and seasoned, all joints are dovetailed and glued. Regularly finished rich cherry color or natural back and seat with cherry top.\n\nWhen ordering specify Color wanted.\n\nOur desks are easily and quickly put together, set up and adjusted.\n\nFASTENING WOOD PARTS TO STANDARDS\n\nOur method of fastening top, back and seat to the iron is one of the most important features of our desk. The iron and wood is fitted together, so that the two parts interlock the full length of the contact of wood and metal, thus giving a holding power not obtained in any other way.\n\nTABLE OF SIZES\u2014STATIONARY\n\n| DESK NUMBERS | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |\n|--------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Length of Single Desk | 24 | 24 | 21 | 21 | 18 | 18 |\n| Length of Double Desk | 40 | 40 | 38 | 38 | 36 | 36 |\n| Height of Seat from floor at highest point | 17\u00bd | 16 | 14\u00bd | 13\u00bd | 12\u00bd | 11 |\n| Width of Top of Desk | 10 | 16 | 14 | 14 | 12 | 12 |\n| Height of Top from floor at highest point | 30 | 28\u00bc | 26\u00bc | 24\u00bc | 23 | 21\u00bc |\n| Floor Space | 28 to 30 | 27 to 29 | 25 to 27 | 24 to 26 | 22 to 25 | 21 to 23 |\n| Ages of Pupil Accommodated | Adults | 16-20 | 12-18 | 9-14 | 6-10 | 5-8 |\nTeachers' Desks & Chairs\n\nNo. 123\nCarried in stock in Golden Ash.

Lewis\nIndian Agent\n\nA.F. MacKenzie Esq.\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 10, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 1st instant, I beg to say that the Department is ordering from the Government Stationery Office, one Hyloplate blackboard with chalk trough and moulding for the Hunter's Point Roman Catholic Indian Bay School, to be sent to James Stanger, Esq., Hunter's Point, Que., via Kipawa Station.\n\nI would point out that this board will not give satisfaction unless properly installed and cared for. Hyloplate is made of pulp and necessarily absorbs a good deal of moisture in wet weather and shrinks in dry weather. Consequently, care should be taken in installing this board and having it fitted in the frame in such a manner as will permit of expansion.\n\nIf at all possible, hyloplate should not be installed close to the stove, as, if so, it is subjected to very great heat which cracks the surface. Water should not be used to clean Hyloplate blackboards.\n\nThe Department trusts that you will keep these instructions in mind and have this blackboard carefully installed on its arrival.

Indian Day School at Hunter's Point, Que. The abstract of the tenders I received for these supplies was forwarded with my letter of the 15th of September.\n\nI have been holding this account here for a while, for the reason that the store ordered did not arrive with the rest of the supplies, but I have just been advised by the teacher that it has now reached the school in good condition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D. MacLean Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to letter No.35-5-5-of the 19th, ultimo, I beg to say that I did not visit Hunter's Point as instructed, as the day after I wrote my letter of the 17th of October to the Department, I was advised by Miss Henan, who had arrived at Hunter's Point that the desks and other supplies, with the exception of the stove, had arrived in good condition, and the school was ready for occupation, and would commence on the 17th of October, so I did not think that a visit from me would be of any benefit.\n\nWhen I wrote my letter of the 17th of Oct. to the Dept., I was uneasy from the fact that I had written several times to J. Stanger about the supplies for that school and did not receive a reply.\n\nMiss Henan informs me that everything is progressing satisfactory, only that the attendance is not quite up to normal owing to the prevalence of small-pox in the district. I sent her a copy of the Indian Day school regulations, and I beg to quote an extract from a letter she has written me on the matter.\n\n\"I notice that the Regulations that you sent me contain a clause stating that the teachers salaries are payable every quarter, is that law still in force in Quebec? It is obsolete in Ontario. I was paid every month at Bear Island.\"\n\nKindly advise me if such is the case,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D. MacLean Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nOTTAWA, Nov. 17th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, informing the Department that Miss Honan, who was appointed teacher of the Hunter's Point (R.C.) Indian Day School, had taken up duties on the 17th of October, last; also that the desks and other supplies required to equip the school had arrived and been placed in position. The Department notes that everything is progressing satisfactorily, and it is hoped that when the present epidemic of smallpox subsides, there will be a good and regular attendance.\n\nRegarding the payment of salary, I beg to say that the Department only pays salaries to teachers in Indian day schools at the end of each quarter, upon receipt of quarterly returns of attendance. The school which Miss Honan formerly taught was a summer school only, and opened for a few months in each year, and it is in such cases that salaries of teachers are paid monthly.\n\nI might further point out that we are not guided by the regulations of the Ontario Department of Education in the payment of salaries.\n\nMiss Honan should prepare her return promptly upon the expiry of the quarter, and forward it to you, and if you consider it is correct in every respect, you will certify the same and transmit it to the Department when payment of salary will be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Father Evain, Roman Catholic Missionary for the Lake Temiskaming country, has been instrumental in having erected log school houses at Brennan's Lake and Hunter's Point. The Rev. Gentleman collected what funds he could from the Indians interested, and the unskilled labour was performed gratis.\n\nThe Department promised no assistance in connection with the building of these schools. We equipped them with desks, etc., and are now paying teachers; both causes are flourishing this academic year.\n\nFather Evain has used some missionary money for hardware, doors, windows, etc., and has now submitted accounts of $226.05 and $136.93 for the Hunter's Point and Brennan's Lake Schools, respectively. The Department appoints the teachers and is conducting the schools through the office of Mr. Agent Lewis. They are not strictly missionary activities, and I would be pleased to have your authority to pay these accounts.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOTTAWA, Dec. 15th, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received the enclosed accounts from Rev. Father I. Evain for material supplied and paid for by him in connection with the building of the schools at Hunter's Point (R.C.) and Brennan's Lake. The Department promised no assistance in connection with the erection of these buildings. Father Evain collected all the funds he could from the Indians interested, and the unskilled labour was performed gratis. We supplied furnishings, such as desks, blackboards, stove, etc.\n\nWe are favourably disposed to assist Father Evain to the amount of the enclosed accounts, and, if you consider that they are reasonable and a fair charge, I should be pleased if you would attach them to proper voucher forms, certify the same and forward to the Department in order that payment can be made.\n\nKindly give this matter your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. H. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorth Temiskaming,\nQue.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to enclose voucher in favor of the Rev. I. Evans, for $364.05, being for materials purchased by him for the construction of the Hunter's Point, and Brennan Lake Indian day schools, in the Kipawa district.\n\nIn reference to this matter I beg to say that I was informed that the funds needed for this purpose were collected by the priest from the Indians. The rough lumber required was donated by the Shepard Morse and McLaughlin Bros., Lumber Companies respectively.\n\nOn my visit to the Kipawa during the winter of 1920-21 I explained to the Indians interested that the Department would not authorize any expenditure in connection with the erection of these buildings, but would supply the furniture needed and also pay the salary of a teacher, to which proposition they were very favorably disposed.\n\nThe materials specified in the enclosed accounts has been supplied and used in the construction of the above mentioned schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nS.D. McLean, Esq.\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Dec. 27, 1922.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nIn connection with the accounts which you left at the Department, covering the material purchased by you for the construction of the Brennan Lake and Hunter's Point Indian Day Schools, I beg to say that in order to comply with the requirements of the Auditor General, we are unable to pay these accounts until further particulars are received. The account of Molay Brothers Planing Mills, Arnprior, will require to be itemized, that is, the number of sashes, frames, doors and their sizes as well as the price of each should be stated. If you will be good enough to request this firm to forward you an account in duplicate, properly receipted, showing the details above outlined, and then submit the same to the Department, payment can be made. Their account is returned herewith.\n\nI have also to request that you will state the amounts which you collected for each of these schools, separately, and the total amounts paid by you for the construction of the schools.\n\nYour early attention to this matter will be appreciated, in order that we can settle these accounts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\nAt North Curve Station\n\nJanuary 15th 1923\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose report of the Hunters Point R.C. Indian Day School for the month of January. I find the pupils of this school making good progress, but the school house is cold and the interior needs some renovating.\n\nI am leaving Hunters Point this morning to visit the Brennan Lake School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.H. Lewis\nIndian Agent\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.\nAss't Deputy and Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, Jan. 19, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 13th instant, enclosing a report on your visit to the Hunter's Point Indian Day School. In reply I beg to say that we are pleased to note that the children are making good progress.\n\nWe also note your remark that the school building requires some work to be done on the interior, in order to make it warmer. We will be pleased, at a later date, to receive a report from you as to the work which you recommend should be done to the interior of this building and the cost of the same, in order to make it comfortable during the winter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\n\nW. H. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorth Temiskaming,\nQUE.\nSir:\n\nIn reply to official letter No. 35-5-5 of the 19th inst., having reference to the school house at Hunter's Point, Que., I beg to report.\n\nThis school building is constructed with hewed logs, and the logs forming the walls are standing perpendicularly, and on which account it is a difficult matter to plaster the seams with mortar so that it will stay in place for any length of time. In the case of the building at Brennan Lake, which is also of hewed log construction, the logs forming the walls are laying horizontally, and the seams are plastered inside and out with mortar, which stays in its place and is a finished job, as far as warmth is concerned. I enquired of the Hunter's Point Indians why they did not build their school-house with the timber running full length and they informed me that they were unable to get the timber of the necessary length, and so had to use shorter pieces standing upright.\n\nThe only thing that I see that will make the building comfortable in the winter, is to sheet the interior with beaver board or matched lumber. There is a quantity of beaver board at Hunter's Point that has been left over from lining the church inside. This material is in sheets 4 ft. wide by 10 ft. long, and is being sold at $43.75 per thousand feet, which is cheap when the cost of transportation is taken into consideration.\n\nThere is about 1,000 ft. of this material at Hunter's Point, together with the nails and strips for laying it on, and this quantity should be sufficient to sheet the walls of the school house, which would make the building a good deal warmer.\nI would estimate that the cost of this work would be around $60 to $65.00.\n\nThe beaver board referred to belongs to the Rev. I. Evans, who had it left over after renovating the interior of the church at Hunter's Point last fall, and was left in charge of Mrs. Jones to dispose of to anyone requiring it, at $1.75 per sheet of 40 sq. feet, and the strips at .02\u00a2 per lineal foot, which is the price it cost laid down at Hunter's Point by boat.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, January 25th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant, regarding the lining of the interior of the Hunter's Point R.C. Indian Day School with beaver board, in order to make it more comfortable in winter. Your recommendation that we obtain the beaver board required for the purpose from the supply which was left over from the lining of the church is noted.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the arrangement under which this school was built was that the Indians would erect a suitable building for school purposes, and that this Department would not be called upon to contribute any amount towards the cost. As you were informed in official letter of December 15th, last, Rev. Father Evain submitted an account to the amount of $228.05 for material used in the construction of the building. This account has not been paid pending further particulars from the Rev. Father. In the meantime, we are not prepared to undertake the purchase of the beaver board mentioned by you, or to have the work of putting it on carried out. It may be that Father Evain would agree to turn the quantity of beaver board required over for the purpose, as we are of the opinion that it was supplied in the first instance from funds furnished by the Indians.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will communicate with Father Evain in this matter, and ascertain if he will consent to have the beaver board on hand used for lining the interior of the school building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Fr Evain covering his expenses in connection with the construction of an Indian day school at Hunter's Point. The amount of $452.69 has been paid by Rev. Fr Evain personally.\n\nI am sending Rev. Fr Evain's letter and accounts as received and I would strongly recommend the payment of the latter by the Department.\n\nYou are partly aware of the work carried on by the Rev. Father for the last 23 years and I must say that though in numerous instances he has volunteered for the Indian cause well earned and much needed money, this is the first time that he is asking for reimbursement as his financial situation cannot afford to bear the expenses made for the building of the day school above mentioned and that of Brennan's Lake.\n\nI may add that the constructions were made at the cheapest price possible and though Rev. Fr Evain helped the men he is not asking for any remuneration. Your agent at North Temiscaming can testify to the quality and good condition of the buildings.\n\nFinally, competitive prices for material could not be secured as there was no choice in the different localities where the material was bought.\n\nHoping that you will give this matter your very kind attention and reach an effective solution, I remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The accounts for this material are satisfactory, and the above amount will be paid.\n\nIn connection with the accounts for the material used in the construction of the Brennan's Lake Indian Day School, I beg to say that we agreed to pay accounts for material and freight on same to the amount of $136.93. This included an account from McKay Brothers, of Arnprior, to the amount of $130 and freight $6.93. This account was sent to Father Evain, with the request that he obtain from this firm an itemized statement, in duplicate. The Rev. Father states that he has not yet received the accounts and we are therefore unable to pay the above amount until the statement asked for is received. I shall be pleased if you will request Father Evain to forward the itemized account of McKay Brothers, in duplicate, as soon as possible, when payments will be made of the above mentioned amounts, viz: $228.05 and $136.93, for the material supplied the Hunter's Point and Brennan's Lake Schools, respectively.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Indian Day School at Hunter's Point in the Kipawa district. I paid a visit to this school on the 30th of September last and found everything in good shape. The scholars are making good progress, and attend fairly regularly, and the teacher has a good place to board.\n\nThe school house would be much warmer if a ceiling were put in, and it needs 5 sheets of beaver board to finish sheathing the walls inside. The cost of this work including the materials and labor would be about $55.00.\n\nThe teacher also requested me to supply her with a clock for use in the school. I purchased one for this school 3 years ago, but the teacher says that it has been broken and repaired a couple of times and does not run satisfactory. Kindly advise me if the Department will authorize any expenditure for the placing of a ceiling in this school house.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D.

You should arrange for the purchase of any material and the labour required in having the work done. We note that you estimate the cost will be approximately $55.\n\nYou may also purchase and have forwarded for the use of the classroom an alarm clock of the \"Big Ben\" type.

Indian Day School is in need of repairs, a part of the walls has been covered with beaver board, but it would take 800 ft to finish the walls and the ceiling. The outside of the school would need to be plastered and banked. I would be pleased to know if the Department will give authorisation for this work to be done.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.\nIndian Agent\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, September 20, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, relative to the repairs required to the interior walls and ceiling of the Hunter's Point R. C. Indian Day School.\n\nPlease furnish an estimate of the cost of supplying the quantity of beaver board required and for the plastering and banking of the outside of the school, and the cost of the labour in having all this work completed. When we have this information, consideration will be given as to whether this work can be carried out or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nZ. Casa, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorth Temiskaming,\nP. Q.\nSir-\n\nIn reply to official letter no 35-5-5 of Sept. the 20th I am of the opinion that, to finish the inside of the school with beaver board (laths have to be put on the beaver board that has already been put as there is none) and chinking and banking the outside would cost about one hundred and ten dollars. The transportation of material to Hunter's Point is pretty expensive.\n\nThe outside of the school should be chinked and not plastered as it is made of Square timber.\n\nI will be pleased to know if the Department will authorize this expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, October 8, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, furnishing an estimate of the cost of finishing the walls and ceiling of the Hunter's Point Indian Day School with beaver board and chinking and banking the outside.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, provided you can arrange for the supplying of the material and the labour in having the above work carried out for the sum of $110, as mentioned by you, you may have it done. Our funds are extremely limited and the above is the full amount we can provide to complete the repairs at this school. If possible, you should obtain competitive prices for the supplying of the material, such as beaver board, lime, etc., and the purchase should be made from the firm quoting the lowest price. Please obtain from the merchant who furnishes the materials accounts in duplicate, which you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and send to the Department for payment. You should also keep accounts in duplicate for the labour employed, certify and send them to the Department for payment.\n\nIf you can arrange to have this work done within the sum mentioned, you should have it carried out before the extreme cold weather sets in. Please see that all the work is completed in a satisfactory manner.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nZ. CAZA, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorth Temiskaming,\nP.

You should also state the name of the manufacturer of the desks at present in use at the school. If new desks are supplied, it is necessary that they be of the same type as those at present in use, in order to have uniformity in the seating equipment. In September, 1921, 18 double desks were supplied by the Globe Furniture Company, Waterloo, Ont. It is presumed that the extra desks now required would be double ones. The Teacher should be able to tell you the size and number of each size required and also whether they are double or single.

Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nI have another Mission, Kipawa, which is in need of a teacher. There are at present 10 Indian children ready for school, and a number of younger ones for future years. We have a good school built there with desks installed, a gift of some Hunters who took pity on these children. So if you would give me the authority to engage a teacher for this school, and the Gov. send the books required, it would place our Indian Missions in very good condition.\n\nPlease let me know soon as possible what can be done re these two missions, as I will be returning to visit them about 10th of October and will be in a position to arrange matters.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. E.A. Letang, P.P.\nOttawa, September 26, 1924.\n\nSir,-\n\nThe Department has received a request from Rev. E. A. Letang, P.P., Temiskaming, for permission to engage the services of a teacher for a school at his Mission at Kipawa. He states that there are at present ten Indian children of school age who could attend and that there is a good school building, with desks installed.\n\nPlease furnish a report regarding this request, stating where this school is located, also, whether the children referred to are Indians or halfbreeds. Any information you can give regarding this request for the starting of a school at the point referred to by Rev. Father Letang, together with your views as to whether you would recommend that a teacher be appointed or not, will be appreciated. Please forward any facts you can regarding the condition of the building referred to, also, if the teacher could obtain living accommodation near the school. The Rev. Father states that he is visiting this point about the 10th of October, next, and desires to be informed as to whether the Department will consent to the carrying on of a school or not.\n\nYou might consult the Reverend Father regarding the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. H. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTemiskaming,\nQUE.\nOttawa, September 26, 1924.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nReferring to that portion of your letter of the 22nd instant, requesting authority to engage the services of a teacher for a school at your Mission at Kipawa, and stating the number of children that are available, I beg to say that we are requesting Mr. Agent Lewis to furnish full information regarding your request.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will talk this matter over with Mr. Agent Lewis and as soon as a reply is received, you will be advised as to what action the Department can authorize in having a school opened at the point mentioned by you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. E. A. Letang, P.P.,\nTemiskaming,\nQUE.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6089, file 314-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nOctober 20th, 1924\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to official letter No. 35-10-1 of the 26th of September regarding the request of the Rev. E.A. Letang P.P. of Temiskaming for permission to engage the services of a teacher for a school at Kipawa station, P.Q., I beg to say that this letter arrived after I had left on a visit to the Kipawa so I cannot make as full a report on this matter as I could have done had I received the letter a few days sooner.\n\nThe Rev. E.A. Letang has spoken to me on previous occasions regarding this school, but I did not think that there were sufficient Indian children at this point to warrant the expense of the Department paying the salary of a teacher. There is a good school building equipped with desks, and I understand there has been a school conducted at this point some time ago, but it was closed probably through lack of funds.\n\nThere are about 10 children of school age at Kipawa, Indians and half-breeds, and some white children. I would recommend that the Department pay a portion of the salary of a teacher and the white people pay the balance, and conduct a combined Indian and white school. Kipawa is situated on the C.P.R., and the school house is close to the station, and a teacher would have no difficulty in securing first class living accommodation near the school. I will also communicate with the Rev. Father on this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nOttawa, October 23rd, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, regarding the request of Rev. E. A. Letang, P.P., of Temiskaming, for permission to engage the services of a teacher for a school situated near Kipawa Station and for a grant to assist in carrying on the work.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that if this school activity is started by Father Letang it is to be conducted as a combined Indian and white school. We note that there are about ten children of school age - Indians and half-breeds - and a number of white children who could attend. This Department will provide a grant at the rate of $200 per annum as its share towards the payment of the salary of a teacher, and will also provide the Indian children with the text-books, stationery, etc., which they require. It is noted that there is a good school building, equipped with desks, etc., in which to carry on the work, and that the teacher would have no difficulty in securing good living accommodation in the school. You should inform the Reverend Father of the amount that will be allowed by this Department as its share of the teacher's salary. This grant will only be paid during such time as there is a sufficient number of Indian children in attendance to warrant its continuance.\n\nFather Letang should submit through your office the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher whom he engages to carry on the work. Quarterly returns showing the attendance of the Indian children only, should be prepared by the teacher and forwarded to the Department through your office in the same manner as is done in the case of other Indian day schools. Please inform the Department of the date the school opens, the number of children who will attend, also any information you may have regarding the building and equipment provided. This school will be known as the Kipawa Combined White and Indian Day School. It is presumed that the Reverend Father can arrange with the white people and half-breeds to pay the balance of the salary and the other expenses involved in conducting the school.

I visited the Indian families and they all promised to send their children to school as soon as possible. Some of the reasons given to me for not sending them sooner are that they are not properly clothed, others are living too far and the intention to move closer to school. There are twelve Indian and half-breed children of school age, but these people are so careless that I believe Father Letang will have a very hard job to get them to send their children to school. I believe that the efforts that he is making are well deserving the help the Department is giving him. It is only after a good trial that we will know what can be done there. The building used for the school is neat and plenty large enough. The school teacher, a bright young lady is well pleased so far and is anxious to get more pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.D.

Hoey Esq,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa,\nOctober 23, 1941.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nFor some years past the Department has been allowing a grant toward the salary of a teacher at the Kipawa Combined School.\n\nI am now advised that there are no recognized Indian children attending this school and consequently it will not be possible for us to justify any payment toward the cost of the school.\n\nIt is quite possible that there may be halfbreed children attending the school but the education of halfbreeds is not the responsibility of this Department.\n\nI should appreciate hearing from you in the matter immediately.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. H.E. Letang,\nTemiskaming, Que.\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nDept. of Welfare Training\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI received your communication of 23rd inst. re grant toward the salary of teacher for Kipawa School.\n\nThe contents of your letter gave me quite a shock and indicate that I am in a very difficult situation. I was appointed in charge of Kipawa mission (severed from Temiskaming) in Sept. 1946. I found the school had been operating for three years previous and was made aware of the conditions under which it was maintained. I may add here that results were eminently satisfactory - even marvelous. The other districts, Hunters Point and Brennan Lake have schools carried on under same provisions.\n\nAs I did not receive any notice of any proposed change of program, I naturally presumed the same procedure would be followed, and engaged a teacher for 1941-42 (Sept. 25th June 30) at same salary as was paid in previous years, although all other wages and salaries have been increased! As your department does not pay any salary for Sept., I personally advanced the sum of $30.00 at end of Sept. to pay teacher's expenses for that month.\n\nNow you inform me that no salary will be paid.\nby your Department\u2014which means that I am personally responsible for her year's salary. It is an organized district. No family in Kipawa owns any property\u2014they are squatters on Crown lands\u2014therefore no basis on which one could collect school taxes or fees. For several years most of them were on relief. This year J.R. Booth is still operating in the Kipawa area and there will be employment.\n\nYou indicate that a report claims that there are no Indian children in that area. They are just as Indian there as at Hunter's Point and Brennan Lake, for they are the same families. I admit that they are not pure Indians but they cannot be designated as Half-Breeds\u2014there is no such family in that district. About three generations ago several Scotch, English and French lumberjacks and trappers settled on Kipawa Lake and married Indian women. Their children married Indian women so that one could say that the great majority are 1/4 and even 1/8th Indian. I think I know where the report re Kipawa came from, and from what I can learn that party has shown a continual prejudice against that particular school\u2014for what reason I cannot find out. Again, this year several families have come down from Brennan Lake and taken residence near Kipawa village, and their children are now attending Kipawa School.\n\nI present these facts to let you know the conditions there, and the difficult position in which I find myself. I trust that you will appreciate the same, realizing that I had not received any previous notice of change of policy and therefore had acted in good faith. Yours very truly,\n\nH.E. Letang\nOttawa,\nNovember 3, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th ultimo with reference to the Kipawa Combined School. In view of your statement that there are now no Indian children attending that school I wrote to Rev. H.E. Letang, Temiskaming, Que., and I enclose, for your information, a copy of his reply.\n\nI should appreciate having a detailed report from you in regard to the points mentioned in Father Letang's letter. I refer particularly to the sentences which read:\n\n\"They are just as Indian there (Kipawa) as at Hunter's Point and Brennan Lake for they are the same families. I admit that they are not pure Indians but they cannot be designated as half-breeds.\"\n\nAn early reply will be expected.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. Z. Caza,\nIndian Agent,\nNotre Dame du Nord, Que.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to official letter no 35-10-1 of the 3rd inst, I beg to inform the Department that about 10 years ago, I made a report to the Department that a certain number of families who did not in my opinion have the status of Indians were on the list of Kipawa Indians and I was told to put them off and this was done.\n\nWhen I write about the Kipawa Indians, I mean also the Indians of Hunter's Point, Wolf Lake and Brannan Lake because as Rev. Father says they are all of the same tribe.\n\nOf the persons mentioned above I will give a few examples: Mr. Robinson, a pure white man who died only a few years ago married an Indian woman, he had a large family, two of his sons are married and living at Brannan Lake, another is married and he is living at Hunter's Point.\n\nAlso Mr. Samuel, living at Kipawa, he is still living and gets his pension from the Quebec Government. He is a pure white man, married an Indian woman and he has a large family, some of his children are married.\n\nThere is also the Mongrain family or families. The first to come was a white man, he is now dead and his widow is getting her pension from the Quebec Government. This is Roch Mongrain's grandmother. They had a large family also and many sons are married.\n\nEversince I have put these persons off the list of Indians, I called them half-breeds.\n\nIf the Department will refer to the reports of the Brannan Lake and Hunter's Point School, it will be seen in the\nSpace left for remarks that more half-breeds than Indian children attended these schools, since the last few years.\n\nI would be pleased to know if the copy of Rev. Father Letang's letter should be treated as confidential.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.A. Hoey Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa,\nNovember 14, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 5th instant with reference to the status of the pupils attending the Kipawa Combined School.\n\nYou should prepare a report showing the status of each family who has children attending either the Kipawa, Hunter's Point or Brennan Lake School.\n\nThis information should be available when Inspector Thibault next visits your Agency and should be fully discussed with him in order that he may submit a report to the Department.\n\nIn the meantime it has been decided to continue the payment of the salary at the Kipawa School for the current academic year. Inspector Thibault will no doubt visit your Agency before the end of June next and as a result of the information that you give him we will be able to make a decision regarding the academic year 1942-43.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. Z. Gaze,\nIndian Agent,\nNotre Dame du Nord, Que.\nOttawa,\nNovember 14, 1941.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo with reference to the Kipawa Combined School. It has been decided to continue the usual payment to this school for the current academic year. Before the end of June next it is hoped that Mr. Thibault, Inspector of Indian Agencies for the Province of Quebec, will have an opportunity of visiting the Temiskaming Agency and at that time he will investigate thoroughly the status of the various families who have children attending the Kipawa, Hunter's Point and Brennan Lake Schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

I told him that any children from a white father and Indian mother were not considered as Indians, so that the Department had no responsibility towards such children; those having an Indian as father were recognized, even when the mother was white.\n\nI told him I could not recommend paying a teacher full time when the four known Indian children altogether had only attended school from five to seven weeks at most.\nOttawa,\nJuly 15, 1942.\n\nMemorandum for file:\n\nAttached is an extract from Inspector Thibault's report on the Kippewa Combined School. I also had a visit yesterday from Rev. J.A. McKennirey, Temiskaming, Que. In addition to the 4 pupils who Mr. Thibault states are Indians, Father McKennirey states that additional ones should also be considered Indians; namely, Marie Janbone (father Bernard Janbone), Pat, Francis and D. Robinson (father Joe Robinson). Father McKennirey pointed out that if we withdraw our support completely it will mean that the school will have to be closed and he made a special request that we continue to give some assistance. We have been allowing this school an amount of $600.00 a year (10 months at $60.00 a month). I stated to him that I would recommend to Mr. Hoey that for the academic year 1942-43 we limit our assistance to an amount of $400.00.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nJuly 31, 1942.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nOn my return to the office Mr. Phelan advised me of your conversation in connection with the Kippawa Combined School. It has been decided to allow an amount of $400.00 during the academic year 1942-43. At the end of June, 1943, the teacher should submit a list of the names of the recognized Indian children who will likely attend the school during the academic year 1943-44 and it will then be decided what amount can be allowed during that fiscal year. In preparing the quarterly returns the teacher should only include on them the names of the recognized Indian children attending the school. I may say that the information that we have received indicates that the attendance of the Indian children during the past year has been very unsatisfactory. I should, therefore, appreciate any efforts that either you or the teacher can make to ensure regular attendance of these Indian children next year. If their attendance continues irregular it will not be possible for us to consider renewing the grant for the academic year 1943-44.\n\nA copy of this letter is being forwarded to Indian Agent Caza.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

E. A. Letang, Temiskaming, has arranged for the opening of a school near Kippena Station to provide educational facilities for the white and Indian children at that point. The services of a teacher, Miss Florence Morin of Mattawa, Ont., have been secured, and the school will open at once. This school activity, which has been started by Father Letang, is to be conducted as a combined white and Indian school. It is stated that there are about 10 children of school age - Indians and half-breeds - and a number of white children who will attend.\n\nThe Department is providing a grant at the rate of $200 per annum as its share towards the payment of the salary of the teacher, and will also provide the Indian children with the text books, etc., which they require. Father Letang has arranged for a building to carry on the classroom work and for the supplying of the desks and furnishings. The Department will continue payment of the grant towards the teacher's salary during such time as there is a sufficient number of Indian children in attendance to warrant same.\n\nI have to request that you will visit this school at the earliest opportunity and assist in any way that you can to encourage a good attendance of the Indian children and give any assistance you can to the teacher in her work. In this connection, I would refer you to official letter of October 23rd, 1924, addressed to the late Agent, Mr. W. H. Lewis, which, no doubt, you have in your possession. After visiting the school, please furnish a report as to the arrangements which have been made for the carrying on of the work as regards building, equipment, attendance, etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Father Evain that a school should be established for the Indians living at Lac des Quinze in Temiskaming, I beg to say that we have no definite information as to the number of Indians living off the reserve there. I understand that there are a few living about Klock's Depot and the Hudson's Bay Post on the lake.\n\nMr. Agent Renaud should be written to, as suggested by Father Evain, and asked to give full information regarding these stragglers. We have a school on the Temiskaming Reserve, but it is too far away for the Indians from Lac des Quinze.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Benson\nOttawa, March 25, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nRev. Father Evain of Saint Sauveur de Quebec has forwarded to the Department a letter from Mr. James Klock, who has a farm at Lac des Quinze, Timiskaming, in which he states that there are twenty-one children at and around Archie's of age to attend school and that the Indians are anxious to have a school.\n\nThe Department would like to have a full report from you in regard to these Indians. In your report kindly state the band to which these Indians belong, the number of families and the number of children of school age; whether they are permanently located at this point; whether there is any building suitable for school purposes available and, if so, on what terms it could be obtained, and also whether there would likely be a sufficient attendance to justify the Department in establishing a school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Mr. Renaud thinks that there would be an average attendance of at least ten or twelve children for the summer months and he recommends that a school should be opened at this point.\n\nMr. Renaud thinks that he can get a house large enough for a class-room for about $5.00 a month and the supplies on hand at Long Point could be moved up. He also informs me that there is an educated Indian woman at Temiskaming, Mrs. Thivierge, who would be quite competent to carry on the work.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Kindly obtain an agreement from the owner to allow the Department the use of it for the time the school is in operation! You should state whether any repairs are needed to the building and, if so, give an estimate of the cost of having them made. The Department is not, however, prepared to spend much for repairs, if it pays rent for the building. You should also make arrangements to have the supplies and equipment at the Long Point School moved up.\n\nThe Department will approve of Mrs. Thivierge being placed in charge of this school and she will be paid for her services at the rate of $50.00 a month for the time the school is open.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

H. Lewis,\nIndian Agent.\nSir-\n\nI have met Mr. Inspector lately and he was telling me that some Indian Day School are being closed owing to the need for economy. I would be pleased to know if there is to be any change in my agency or if the Brannan Lake Indian Day School, the Hunter's Point Indian Day School and the Long Point Indian Day School are to be reopened in September with the same teachers who have made application to teach again in their respective school.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nA.F.

In this regard, I would refer you to official letter of September 28th, 1932. I presume that this school has been closed for the months of July and August. It should be understood that the Department can only allow salary for ten teaching months in each academic year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\nSecretary.\n\nZ.

If there are any supplies that might be stolen from the school, you should arrange for properly storing them.\n\nEarly next year you should write the Department stating when you would recommend re-opening the Long Point School as a seasonal school. In view of the complaints that have been made by different Indians regarding the teacher, it is felt that, when re-opening the schools next year, it would be advisable to make a change in the teaching services and you should consult the missionary at that point and submit for our consideration the name of a qualified teacher to take charge of the school during the summer of 1938.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

She is not a qualified teacher and in view of the number of highly qualified teachers that are at present out of employment it is practically impossible for the Department to justify the selection of an unqualified teacher for any of our schools.\n\nYour letter recommends that this school be re-opened on May 1. Please let me know for how many months you consider it should be in operation. Also let me know if there is living accommodation for the teacher at the school, or the approximate cost of board and room. As soon as you reply an endeavour will be made to secure a qualified teacher to take charge of the school for the coming summer.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nZ. Caza, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNotre Dame du Nord, Que.\nSir-\n\nIn reply to official letter no 35-4-5 of the 23rd inst., I am of the opinion that the Long Point Indian Summer School should be in operation for 5 months, according to the informations I have, the Indians will be nearly all at Long Point in the first week of May and they never leave for the bush before the month of October.\n\nPriest\n\nThe Missionary has a house at Long Point that is always at the disposition of the teacher and the church is used for a class room. I believe that there should be a school house there for the Indians. I propose to visit Long Point with the Inspector when he next comes here and will report later on this matter.\n\nOnly Indians are living at Long Point and there is no place where a teacher could board.\n\nThe best way for the teacher to travel is by C.P.R. to Angliers Que. From there she will have to go by water to Long Point, a distance of about 17 miles. There is no regular boat making this trip but she can always find means of getting there without trouble. The teacher could inquire from Mr. Dulude, the Station Agent who will advise her. I called him by phone today and he says he will be pleased to give all the help possible to the teacher.\n\nR.A.

Please consult him at once and let me know the name, age and qualifications of any teacher whom he wishes to nominate.

Caza, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNotre Dame du Nord, Que.\nThe Long Point Indians are better in health than they have been for the last two or three years, they are all living on relief and they seem to believe that this is to last forever. Last year the Indians came out of the bush too late to open a summer school but this year they are pretty near all at Long Point, I expect to see the Rev. Father Martel, the Missionary in a day or two and take up with him the question of opening a summer school this summer if possible.\n\nZ. Case,\nIndian Agent.\nTo the Indian Affairs Office:\n\nGentlemen:\n\nMr. J. Caza, Indian agent, don't look after his work; he has a store and he puts all his time in that store; he doesn't look after his Indian affairs work.\n\nWe've been telling Mr. Caza 3-4 years now to have a good school teacher here at Long Point. There are about forty children who would go to school here at Long Point, all Indians.\n\nAt Hunters Point there's only 2 or 3 family Indians there, all French & English. If Indian Dept. pays for the teacher there make an investigation. But not by Caza, nor missionary priest. They will favor French every time.\n\nI find that very strange Mr. Caza is giving rations to young men, single men, and who are able to earn their living.\n\nI am a cripply man and I need help from the Dept. But not just now yet. I will need it next spring only.\n\nWe want you to replace the agent but not Frenchman, we want Englishmen for Indian agent.\n\nI am yours truly,\n\nXavier Hunter\nNotre Dame du Nord Que, March 12th, 1942\n\nSir-\n\nThe Long Point Indians are inquiring if they are going to have a summer school next summer.

The information contained in your letter is so indefinite that no decision can be made. In your letter of June 14, 1938, you advised me that there were only three or four families residing at Long Point. Has the number of families increased? Are they all recognized as Indians? How many children are there of school age? Is a building still available?\n\nPlease let me have a reply to this letter answering the questions that I have submitted and the matter will then receive further consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

The house would be supplied without any rent to pay.\n\nThe chapel would serve school purpose during the summer and a rent of $10.00 a month will probably be asked as in the past.\n\nFor teacher, I have the application of Miss Bernadette Wabie, recommended by Rev. Father Martel. She is not a qualified teacher but knowing the Indian language very well (She is Indian) I believe she would do well at Long Point as most of the people there, the children as well can only speak Indian.\n\nIn my letter of June the 14th, 1938, this report was made after a visit of Rev. Father Martel to Long Point and informed me that mostly all the Indians were away.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Affairs.

While I realize that qualified teachers are scarce, I believe that if we re-open this school we should have someone more qualified than Miss Wabie to take charge of it. Her training was quite limited and I feel that there would be practically no use in operating the school with her as teacher.\n\nPlease discuss this matter again with Father Martel with a view to ascertaining if some better qualified person could be secured.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

THIBAULT,\nDated July 8, 1942.\n\nLONG POINT.\n\nFrom the annexed list, we count 29 children of school age; there is no summer school now, although I understand that a teacher was there some years ago, and used the small church as school, the Department paying then to the Missionary a rental of ten dollars per month, the teacher using the missionary house to live in. There is good work to be done amongst those families who are living together during the summer months; if we could get someone to stay there for the summer months only, not so much as a school teacher for the children as for the purpose of showing them to be clean, to cook food and bread properly, knitting useful articles and also how to sew and make over the army clothing being sent there. For that purpose, I would strongly recommend the services of Miss Bernadette Wabie, daughter of B. F. Wabie, Chief of the TIMISKAMING Band, of Notre Dame du Nord. I understand that she has not gone far enough in her studies to qualify as a regular school teacher, but she is certainly qualified to render the Indians great service in the manner above described, under any title we may retain her services for next summer months; she could live in the missionary's little house, and arrangements could be made easily with Father Martel, the missionary, for the use of the chapel. Miss Wabie has impressed me, since my first visit to the Nedelec Reserve, as a clean, bright and intelligent person, a perfect house-keeper, a hard worker with a happy disposition; being an Indian herself, and interested in the welfare of the Indians, she could render them good service.\n\nI would recommend that next summer this suggestion be tried out, and I would be surprised if we did not get satisfactory results from the enterprise.\nOttawa, July 8, 1942.\n\nRE: Inspection of Timiskaming Indian Agency.\n\nSCHOOLS - LONG POINT\n\nFrom the annexed list, we count 29 children of school age; there is no summer school now although I understand that a teacher was there some years ago, and used the small church as school, the department paying then to the Missionary a rental of ten dollars per month, the teacher using the missionary house to live in.

Lamothe,\nIndian Agent.\nRe: Inspection of Timiskaming Indian Agency\n\nThe Long Point Indians feel abandoned as they now have no school, having burnt down. A teacher's desk and a chair will be required, as well as a world's man; if it is decided to send the same, it should be shipped only about next 1st of May 1945. C/O J.M. Lamothe Indian agent, by C.P.R. freight to Kippewa, P. Que.\n\nJude Thibault,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nWelfare:\n\nThe moral of the Indians from Long Point is very poor, and the reason is attributed to the lack of a school and a good teacher.\n\nH. Lamothe,\nIndian Agent.\nMr. Thibault\n\nWould also discuss Longue Pointe situation with you.\n\nD.V.\nDec 14/45\nWelfare:\n\nIn the near future the Indians of Long Point will receive family Allowances. As they have no school the Department should have one built as soon as possible. Diversion should be sought for Indian children of the Notre Dame du Nord Reserve in the form of a skating rink.

P. A. Roy, inspecteur.\n(Translation)\n\nTo the Dept. General of Indian Affairs,\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to call your attention to the official report which during the month of July last submitted to the Hon. G\u00e9d\u00e9on Gu\u00e9rin, Sect. of Education for the Province of Quebec, on the general condition of the Indian school at St. Isidore de la Jeune-Lorette, County of Quebec, which ought to have been forwarded to you with the two statements which accompanied it.\n\nIn that report it is stated that this school is satisfactory on the whole, which however is not the same as saying that the results obtained are satisfactory, for the general character of every school ought to be in accordance with Article\n13 of the school regulations.\n\nNo doubt the present teacher, Miss Josephine Dubois, has used all the activity and energy of which she was capable and that with the zeal and devotion of which she has always given proof; but her constant efforts have been useless against a powerful obstacle and always the same thing: too large a number of pupils for one teacher, with the result so that the actual standard of this school in respect to results obtained has always been for several years been only medium.\n\nUnder such circumstances I consider it my duty to unite my efforts with those of the Rev. Mr. Giroux, priest of the parish in which the school is situated and chaplain to the Indians, in soliciting from the Government an annual grant of two hundred dollars to pay for the services of...\na second teacher who would be engaged as assistant, which course would result we are certain would result in a great deal more real progress being made by the pupils than has been the case in the past.\n\nI hope this request will be favourably entertained.\n\nLewis\n\n6th Aug. 1894\n\nP.S.

El fourniront \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole sept \u00e0 huit enfants, ce qui portera le nombre \u00e0 plus de 80.\nSi avec 200 dollars de plus par ann\u00e9e, nous pourrions payer une seconde institutrice et nos enfants pourraient recevoir une instruction s\u00e9rieuse, la maison et l'\u00e9cole \u00e9tant divis\u00e9e en deux.\n\nParce de ces consid\u00e9rations, nous nous adressons \u00e0 vous avec confiance, esp\u00e9rant que notre demande sera trouv\u00e9e juste, pour obtenir 400 dollars au lieu de 200 pour le soutien de notre \u00e9cole.\n\nEt vos requ\u00e9rants ne c\u00e9deront de payer.\n\nG.

General\nof Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nThe humble petition of the\nundersigned respectfully sets\nforth the following facts:\nThat the school at the\nHuron Village of Lorette receives\nevery year $150 from the government.\nThat with this sum it\nis impossible for us to employ\nmore than one teacher.\nThat for several years there\nhave been too many pupils for\none teacher, which interferes with\ngeneral progress and keeps\nthe school in an inferior state.\nThat you can see by the\nofficial reports that the number\nof the pupils is sometimes as\nhigh as 75 with an average\nattendance of from 60 to 70.\nThat this autumn the\nnumber of the pupils will be\nstill greater, because three families\nwho had been living on the\nQuarante Springs Reserve\n2\u00bd miles from the Huron Village\nhave returned to reside here.\nThis will add seven or eight to\nchildren to the school, which will bring\nthe number up to more than 80.\nThat with $200 additional\na year we should be able to pay\na second teacher and our children\nwould receive thorough instruction,\nthe school house being divided\nin two.\n\nIn view of these considerations\nwe apply to you with confidence,\nbelieving that our request will\nbe found to be met\u2014to obtain\n$400 instead of $200 for the\nmaintenance of our school.\nAnd so our petitioners will\never pray.\n\nGuil.

What she asks is fair, and I cannot do otherwise than recommend her request.\n\nI enclose also a petition, signed by the Missionary and the Chiefs of the tribe, soliciting a grant of $250 for a second teacher; also a letter from the Provincial School Inspector in regard to the matter.\n\nBe good enough to observe that the number of the pupils\nis too great for one teacher to give them the necessary instruction.\n\nI submit the whole, reminding you of our interview at the Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac in Quebec, where you represented to me that a new system would be established in regard to the Lorette School. I trust that your Department on being advised of the facts will be glad to accede to the request made in the petition which I send you, as the schools have been open since the first days early in September and as it is absolutely necessary that we should conform to the necessities of education.\n\nEnclose all in the present letter, which deals with only the overpayment, in order to facilitate immediate action by the Department.\n\nYours,\n\nAntoine O. Berton,\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th September last enclosing a petition from the Missionary and Chiefs in which they ask for a further grant of $300 to pay the salary of a second teacher for their school, and also enclosing a letter from the Public School Inspector on this subject; and in reply I beg to say that I regret that there are at present no funds available for this purpose.

Ils auraient bien pourtant assez souffert du manque d'instruction que, du leur nombre, ils n'ont pas eu le loisir jusqu'\u00e0 ce jour.\n\nJe suis pleinement convaincu de tel \u00e9tat de chose et il me semble que le D\u00e9partement devrait faire un effort surhumain pour qu'une question comme celle-ci, d'importance sup\u00e9rieure et de civilisation, ne soit laiss\u00e9e en seul instant de c\u00f4t\u00e9 et que quand m\u00eame les estim\u00e9s suppl\u00e9mentaires ne seraient pas b\u00e2ti \u00e0 cette session, le D\u00e9partement devrait trouver un moyen de r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir cette question de suite afin de faire droit au besoin actuel d'imp\u00e9rative d'une seconde institution.\n\nQuant au local, nous en avons un facile et convenable dans notre \u00e9cole actuelle et il ne faudrait que peu de d\u00e9bours\u00e9s pour en faire un local de premi\u00e8re classe.\n\nJe crois de mon devoir de bien mettre au courant de ces faits, esp\u00e9rant que le D\u00e9partement trouvera le moyen de nous obtenir une seconde institution cette ann\u00e9e m\u00eame.\n\nJ'ai l'honneur d'\u00eatre,\n\nMonseigneur,\n\n[Votre signature]\n\nAgent des sauvages.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant in further reference to the necessity for a second teacher for the Lorette Indian School; and in reply I beg to say that the Department would like to know the smallest salary for which an assistant could be obtained, as it would like, if at all possible to assist this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Supt:Genl:\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nA.O.

(RG 10, Volume 609C, file 317-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nMonsieur,\n\nPar votre lettre du 15\n\nCourant relative \u00e0 une seconde institutrice \u00e0 \u00eatre appoint\u00e9e pour l'\u00e9cole des sauvages de Lorette, vous me demandez quel serait le salaire le moins \u00e9lev\u00e9 d'une assistante.\n\nJe dois dire de suite qu'une assistante dans le sens de votre lettre ne peut \u00eatre qu'une institutrice dipl\u00f4m\u00e9e.\n\nAfin d'arriver plus vite \u00e0 une solution de cette question qui int\u00e9resse tous les sauvages d'une mani\u00e8re toute particuli\u00e8re, j'ai eu Mlle Josephine Dub\u00e9au, l'institutrice actuelle qui conna\u00eet la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'une seconde institutrice, j'ai eu aussi une institutrice dipl\u00f4m\u00e9e et disponible dans le moment. Apr\u00e8s cette entrevue, je suis en position de dire que l'on doit tenir les deux institutrices sur un m\u00eame pied d'\u00e9galit\u00e9. Mlle Dub\u00e9au, l'institutrice actuelle consent elle m\u00eame \u00e0 r\u00e9duire...\nson salaire de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 permettre aux enfants l'avantage obligatoire de recevoir l'instruction qui leur est indispensable et qu'elle ne peut leur donner convenablement, ou le trop grand nombre d'\u00e9l\u00e8ves qui fr\u00e9quentent la classe. Je dis de suite que les bonnes dispositions de Melle Dubois assurent \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole des avanc\u00e9es de Lotte, les services d'une institutrice mieux renomm\u00e9e, plus instruite, poss\u00e9dant bien l'artifice et sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 l'institutrice actuelle.\n\nJusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent, Cependant Melle Dubois payait \u00e0 m\u00eame les $200.00 qu'elle recevait les frais de chauffage et d'entretien de la classe, \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s $35.00 par ann\u00e9e. En r\u00e9duisant son salaire \u00e0 $150.00, les d\u00e9penses de chauffage et d'entretien devront \u00eatre sold\u00e9es par le d\u00e9partement.\n\nJe puis donc suffire au d\u00e9partement de fixer \u00e0 $150.00 le salaire des deux institutrices, qui est certainement le moins \u00e9lev\u00e9 que l'on peut trouver, \u00e0 la condition que les frais de chauffage et d'entretien soient pay\u00e9s par le d\u00e9partement.\n\nMelle Dubois consent \u00e0 r\u00e9duire son salaire, parce qu'\u00e9tant deux institutrices, elle aura moins de travail.\ntravail, moins de fatigue et par cons\u00e9quent, elle aura plus de temps pour donner \u00e0 ses \u00e9l\u00e8ves une instruction beaucoup plus soign\u00e9e.\n\nL'installation du local ne co\u00fbtera que peu de choses; car il est d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9tabli devant le d\u00e9partement que l'\u00e9cole actuelle est divis\u00e9e en deux parties qui conviennent exactement au besoin actuel.\n\nDans les circonstances et d'apr\u00e8s mes observations, je ne crois pouvoir suffire \u00e0 rien de mieux au d\u00e9partement qu'en mettant ces deux \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution rendrait un immense service \u00e0 l'administration de la tribu.\n\nLes classes auront n\u00e9cessairement le 1er Septembre. Il faut donc que le d\u00e9partement s'emporte de r\u00e9gler cette question de suite, maintenant \u00e0 installer le local et \u00e0 faire toutes les d\u00e9marches n\u00e9cessaires pour que, d\u00e8s le commencement de Septembre, les Classes soient effectivement ouvertes.\n\nJ'ai l'honneur d'\u00eatre,\n\nMonsieur,\n\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\n\nAntoine D. Racine\n\nAgent du camp.\nTranslation\n\nJune Lorette,\n19th July 1875.\n\nHarley Reed Esq.,\nDeputy Chief Secretary\nIndian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nSir:\n\nIn your letter of the 15th inst., relative to a second teacher to be appointed to the Indian school at Lorette, you ask me what would be the smallest salary for an assistant.\n\nIn order to arrive at a solution of this question, which is of great interest to the Indians, I have had the privilege of seeing Dubois, the present teacher, who knows the necessity for a second teacher. I also have a teacher with a diploma and available at present. Having had this interview, I am in a position to say that the two teachers ought\nto be put on the same footing.\n\nMiss Dubcan, the present teacher,\nagrees of her own accord to a\nreduction in her salary so as to\nallow the children the necessary\nadvantage of receiving instruction\nthat is indispensable to them\nand which she could not properly\ngive them owing to the large\nnumber of pupils attending the\nschool. I can say therefore\nthat the good kind concession\nof Miss Dubcan guaranteed to\nthe Delian school at Delte\nthe services of a teacher more\nexperienced, better educated,\nknowing English better, and\nsuperior to the present teacher.\n\nUp to the present time,\nhowever, Miss Dubcan has\nbeen paying out of the $200\nreceived by her the cost of\nheating and maintaining the\nschool\u2014about $25 a year.\nOn her salary being reduced to\n$150, the cost of heating and\nmaintenance ought to be borne by the Department.\n\nI can therefore suggest to the Department to fix the rate of salary at $150 of the two teachers at $150\u2014which is certainly the lowest at which teachers could be obtained on condition that the cost of heating and maintenance be borne by the Department.\n\nMiss Dubois agrees to a reduction of her salary because with two teachers she will have less work, less fatigue, and consequently she will have more time to give her pupils careful instruction.\n\nThe preparation of a school class-room will require only a few things; as the Department is already aware, the present school is divided into two parts that will answer exactly the present requirements.\n\nUnder the circumstances...\nand after studying the matter,\nI can suggest nothing better\nto the Department than the\nputting of these views into action,\nwhich will be of great service\nin the instruction of the tribe.\n\nThe school must open\non the 1st September. It is\nnecessary therefore that the\nDepartment should make haste\nto settle this question by\nauthorizing me to get the\nclassroom ready and to do\nwhatever is necessary so that\nat the beginning of September\nthe classes may be regularly\nopened.\n\nTruly,\n\nAntoine O. Bastien\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th ultimo in further reference to the appointment of a second teacher for the Lorette Indian School. And in reply I beg to say that the Department will agree to your proposal to pay each of the two teachers $150 per annum.\n\nThe school rooms may be put in order and the necessary articles purchased and fuel needed for heating the school will be paid for by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nA.O.

(RG 10, Volume 6090, file 317-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMonsieur,\n\nJe ne peux pas r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 votre lettre du 2 ao\u00fbt courant relative \u00e0 l'appointement d'une seconde institutrice et que je viens de recevoir. Vous me dites dans cette lettre : \"the school room may be put in order\".\n\nDans ma lettre du 19 juillet dernier je disais que l'installation du local me convenait que peu de choses \u00e9tant d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9tabli, j'omettais de dire que le local adjoint \u00e0 la salle de classe actuelle est en ce moment occup\u00e9 par M. Hamel, un blanc \u00e0 qui les chefs, conjointement avec le Missionnaire, avaient permis d'occuper cette partie de la maison d'\u00e9cole \u00e0 titre de salaire comme chantre \u00e0 l'\u00e9glise du Village Huron. Il me suffira, avec l'autorisation du d\u00e9partement, de notifier M. Hamel de laisser le logement sous huit jours afin de faire les s\u00e9parations n\u00e9cessaires.\n\nQuant au local lui-m\u00eame,\nLe chef m'avait suff\u00e9r\u00e9, il y a d\u00e9j\u00e0 quelques mois, lorsqu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 question d'une seconde institutrice, de faire r\u00e9parer les man\u0153uvres (premier) de la maison d'\u00e9cole pour faire le local de cette seconde classe.\n\nR\u00e9flexion faite, la chose n'est pas praticable. Ce grenier n'a pas plus de six pieds de hauteur et pour lui donner une hauteur raisonnable, il faudrait \u00e9lever les poutres du ch\u00e9non du toit, ce qui entra\u00eenerait \u00e0 ce ch\u00e9non, de la solidit\u00e9. D'ailleurs, malgr\u00e9 ces travaux, il serait impossible d'en faire un local convenable, hygi\u00e9nique, conforme aux lois qui gouvernent les maisons d'\u00e9ducation dans notre Province. M. Roy, Inspecteur d'\u00e9cole pour le District de Quebec m'a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 la m\u00eame chose et il s'est montr\u00e9 tout \u00e0 fait hostile au projet d'installer une classe dans un grenier.\n\nEn outre, les frais de r\u00e9paration, bois, peinture, main-d'\u0153uvre etc., contiennent $210.00 d'apr\u00e8s une estimation que j'ai fait faire par des ouvriers comp\u00e9tents.\n\nLe d\u00e9partement a \u00e9t\u00e9 assez gracieux d'accorder une seconde institutrice qu'il ne faut maintenant souffrir qu'aux r\u00e9parations strictement n\u00e9cessaires et les moins dispendieuses. C'est pourquoi il\nOn faut songer comme local, qu'au logement actuellement occup\u00e9 par M. Hamel dans la maison d'\u00e9cole. Il n'y aurait qu'un mur de division \u00e0 d\u00e9molir et \u00e0 refaire un peu de pl\u00e2trage et de peinture avec en plus quelques pupitres et quelques chaises, en tout une d\u00e9pense d'\u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s $30.00 pour faire un local tr\u00e8s convenable.\n\nDans les circonstances et afin de ne pas retarder l'ouverture des classes en Septembre prochain, il faudra notifier M. Hamel que nous avons besoin du logement qu'il occupe pour l'ouverture de la classe et \u00e0 faire ex\u00e9cuter de suite les quelques r\u00e9parations requises \u00e0 ce logement, r\u00e9parations qui peuvent \u00eatre faites dans huit jours.\n\nLe d\u00e9partement bondera bien me donner par le retour de la malle, si possible, l'autorisation bonne \u00e0 cet effet et je m'empresserai de remplir ma oblit\u00e9ration.\n\nJ'ai l'honneur d'\u00eatre,\n\nMonsieur,\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\nAntoine O. Basile\nAgent des Sauvages.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant; and in reply I beg to say that by your letter of the 10th instant the Department understood that there were two rooms which with slight repairs could be used for the 2 classes in case the second teacher was engaged. It now however appears that one of these is in occupation of Mr. Hemel, and as the room will be required for the second teacher you are hereby authorized to demand possession of the same from Mr. Hemel, and to have the necessary repairs made and purchase the desks, benches etc., which you state will cost about $30.00.\n\nThe Department never contemplated going to the expense of fitting up the attic.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent,\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nA.O.

Fort en respectant absolument la d\u00e9cision du d\u00e9partement, nous avons pri\u00e9 notre agent M. A. O.

Scott suggested and directed in the name of the Dept. that the system of the division of the classes at the village school should be changed\u2014this change to take place on the 1st Nov. next.\u2014with all respect for the decision of the Dept., we urged your Agent, Mr. A.C. Baxter to offer for some days carrying out the desire of the Dept. and to forward to the Dept. the following remarks which we have the honour to make.\n\nWe believe that the present division of the classes into separate\nClasses for boys and girls has advantages over the division into classes of \"more advanced\" and \"less advanced\"; and this for the following reasons:\n\n1. The girls generally attend the classes until a more advanced age, and ought to receive in many respects an education different from that of the boys.\n\n2. They (the girls) are generally more docile, more easily disciplined, applying themselves more to study than the little boys; and experience has been found that being taught with the little boys in the same class distracts them from their studies no matter how intelligent the teacher may be.\n\n3. The boys ought more especially to learn the English language, and the girls to study French more; by uniting them, or separating their respective studies would suffer.\n\n4. Before the present division\nof classes into separate classes for boys and girls; several girls had left the school; and since the present system has been established, they returned to their studies and the school and have made very good progress.\n\n5. That under these circumstances nearly all the parents of the pupils have requested us that it would be better to continue the present system of the general division of classes of boys and girls, and that if this system were to be changed they would withdraw several of their children from the school, especially their older daughters.\n\n6. The day after Mr. D. C. Leatta visited the school at the village, Mr. Roy, Inspector of Provincial Schools, made his annual visit to the village school and expressed himself as strongly in favour of the present division into separate classes for boys and girls, seeing himself...\nthe marked progress resulting from this division since his visit of last summer. The Inspector authorized an increase to use his name and his experience in favour of the observations that we have been wont to make.\n\n7. Inasmuch as this system, in operation for only two months, has already produced very satisfactory results and as the experiment does not appear to advantage our petitioners believe that it will be better to not to alter the present system of separate classes for boys and girls, and so not to interfere with the progress already made nor to cause many of the children to leave the school; and your petitioners, acting thus in what they believe to be the best interests of the education generally of the children of the village, pray you to be kind enough to consider their present request and do what is right and proper thereabout.\nMonseigneur,\n\nLors de votre derni\u00e8re visite \u00e0 Lorette, le 14 Novembre dernier, vous avez ordonn\u00e9 au nom du D\u00e9partement de faire \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole du Village Huron certains changements que vous connaissez et qui devaient \u00eatre mis \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution le 18 Novembre. Le jour m\u00eame, le Missionnaire et les Chefs m'ont pri\u00e9 de diff\u00e9rer ces changements \u00e0 quelques jours, me disant qu'ils pr\u00e9paraient une requ\u00eate au D\u00e9partement \u00e0 l'effet de laisser les classes telles qu'actuellement organis\u00e9es.\n\nCette requ\u00eate vient de m'\u00eatre remise et je vous l'exp\u00e9die en cons\u00e9quence.\n\nJ'ai cru devoir user de cette d\u00e9f\u00e9rence vis-\u00e0-vis le Missionnaire et les Chefs, c'est pourquoi j'attendrai la r\u00e9ponse du D\u00e9partement avant de mettre \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution l'ordre que vous m'aviez enjoint.\n\nJ'ai l'honneur d'\u00eatre,\n\nMonseigneur,\n\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\nAntoine V.

For the past twelve years I have taught the Huron School and I never heard of any complaint before. I have however the satisfaction of being able to state that I have always done my duty and I have never allowed insubordination in my class. Discipline and order are maintained in my school and I secure their obedience and respect by respecting and loving my pupils, but, Sir, I beg sincerely to state that to my mind they would rather favour a certain other mistress to my injury, which your sense of justice will not allow.\n\nI should like to ask a favour from you.

Bantien, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nJeune Lorette, P.Q.\nMonsieur,\n\nJ'ai l'honneur de vous transmettre ci-inclus, mon rapport du mois d'ao\u00fbt dernier concernant l'\u00e9cole des sauvages de la Plume dans mon afrique.\n\nJ'ai l'honneur\n\n[Votre signature]\n\n[Signature]\nGeneral Remarks.\n\n25th November, 1898.\n\nOn the occasion of my visit to the school on the 25th November last the discipline in the boys' class appeared less defective. There were only 12 pupils present. I am still informed by the Missionary and the School Inspector, Mr. Roy, that Miss Dub\u00e9au, being very old, and having a long time ago lost her authority over the pupils, it is impossible for her to maintain discipline in her class, as desired by the Department, which specially drew my attention to this subject.\n\nIn the girls' class, conducted by Miss St. Amand, the discipline leaves nothing to be desired.\n\nAntoine O. Bastien,\nIndian Agent.\n\nJeune Lorette, 9th December, 1898.\nJeune-Lorette, 25 Novembre, 1898.\n\nNo.-152,168\n\nMonsieur le Secr\u00e9taire,\n\nD\u00e9partement des affaires des Sauvages,\n\nOTTAWA.\n\nMonsieur,\n\nJ'accuse r\u00e9ception de votre lettre du 15 Novembre courant m'informant de la plainte de F\u00e9licit\u00e9 S\u00e9bastien, \u00e9pouse de Charles Couture, au sujet de ses enfants qui fr\u00e9quentent l'\u00e9cole des Sauvages de Lorette.\n\nJe vois que cette Dame Couture pr\u00e9tend que ses enfants ont le droit, \u00e0 titre de sauvages, de fr\u00e9quenter gratuitement l'\u00e9cole des Sauvages de Lorette. Je pr\u00e9tends que non. Cette dame Couture est une sauvagesse, il est vrai, mais elle est mari\u00e9e \u00e0 un blanc, et, contrairement \u00e0 ses pr\u00e9tentions, ses enfants ne sont pas sauvages et n'ont pas le droit de fr\u00e9quenter gratuitement l'\u00e9cole du Village.\n\nDe plus, en demandant \u00e0 son mari le paiement de la contribution de 50 cents par t\u00eate pour ses enfants qui fr\u00e9quentent l'\u00e9cole du Village, j'ai suivi les instructions du D\u00e9partement contenues dans sa lettre du 18 Ao\u00fbt 1896, No.-142,515, m'autorisant \u00e0 agir ainsi. Je r\u00e9f\u00e8re le D\u00e9partement \u00e0 cette lettre, ainsi qu'\u00e0 toute la correspondance contenue sous ce num\u00e9ro, 142,515.\n\nLe D\u00e9partement a d\u00fb remarquer dans la copie de l'avis que lui a transmise Madame Couture, que je demandais le paiement des contributions pour les ann\u00e9es 1897-98 et 1898-1899. Je n'ai pas collect\u00e9 cette contribution, l'an dernier, pour deux raisons:\n\n1o.-Parce qu'il n'y avait que quelques blancs qui fr\u00e9quentaient l'\u00e9cole, l'an dernier, et que \u00e7a ne valait pas la...\npeine de collecter seulement ces quelques centimes.\n\n2e.-Parceque le Secr\u00e9taire de la Municipalit\u00e9 de St.-Ambroise, pour la m\u00eame raison, ne m'avait transmis aucun compte pour les enfants sauvages qui demeurent sur la r\u00e9serve appel\u00e9e \"40 Arpents\" et qui fr\u00e9quentent une des \u00e9coles de la dite municipalit\u00e9.\n\nComme M. le Secr\u00e9taire m'a transmis, il y a quelques semaines, le compte pour ces enfants sauvages qui fr\u00e9quentent les \u00e9coles de la municipalit\u00e9, tel que dit ci-dessus, je me suis empress\u00e9 de notifier les parents des enfants blancs qui fr\u00e9quentent l'\u00e9cole du Village, d'avoir \u00e0 payer imm\u00e9diatement la contribution de ces deux ann\u00e9es pour leurs enfants, esp\u00e9rant ainsi n'avoir \u00e0 faire qu'une seule correspondance par laquelle je transmettrais aussit\u00f4t que per\u00e7u, le montant de ces contributions en m\u00eame temps que le compte de M. le Secr\u00e9taire de la dite municipalit\u00e9.\n\nJe dois ajouter que j'ai vu Madame Couture \u00e0 ce sujet. Elle a compris sa m\u00e9prise, \u00e9tant oblig\u00e9e d'admettre, qu'au sens de la loi, ses enfants ne sont pas sauvages et n'ont pas le droit de fr\u00e9quenter gratuitement l'\u00e9cole des Sauvages de Lorette, puisqu'aussi, tous ceux qui sont dans le m\u00eame cas sont oblig\u00e9s de payer. Elle m'a demand\u00e9 quelques semaines de d\u00e9lai.\n\nJe crois que le d\u00e9partement approuvera ma conduite \u00e0 ce sujet, et voudra bien m'informer de sa d\u00e9cision. Je lui transmettrai le tout aussit\u00f4t que j'aurai per\u00e7u le montant, ce que je vais faire avec toute la diligence voulue.\n\nJ'ai l'honneur d'\u00eatre, monsieur,\n\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\n\nAgent des Sauvages.\nJeune Lorette, 25th November, 1898.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant informing me of the complaint made by Felicite Sebastien, wife of Charles Couture, in reference to her children who are attending the Indian School at Lorette.\n\nI notice that Madame Couture claims that her children are entitled, as Indians, to attend the Indian School at Lorette without payment. I claim that they are not. Mrs. Couture is an Indian woman, it is true, but she is married to a white man, and, notwithstanding her claim, her children are not Indians and have no right to attend the Village School without paying.\n\nMoreover, in asking her husband for payment of 50 cents a head for their children to attend the Village School I was carrying out the instructions of the Department contained in its letter of the 16th of August, 1896, No. 142,515, authorizing me to act in this way. I refer the Department to this letter, as well as to all the correspondence on number 142,515.\n\nThe Department will be good enough to remark that in the copy of the notice which I sent to Madame Couture, I asked payment for the years 1897-98 and 1898-1899. I have not collected this contribution for last year for two reasons:\n\n1st:- because there were only a few whites in attendance at the School last year and it would not be worth while to collect only a few cents, and\n\n2nd:- because the Secretary of the Municipality of St. Ambroise for the same reason did not send me any account for the Indian children who live on the Reserve called \"40 Arpents\"\nand who attended one of the schools of the said Municipality.\n\nAs the Secretary has sent me some time ago the account for these children who attended the Municipal Schools, as above stated, I was authorized to notify the parents of the white children who attend the Village School to make immediate payment for these two years for their children, hoping by this means to avoid correspondence and that I would be able to transmit as soon as received the amount of the contributions, along with the account from the Secretary of the said Municipality.\n\nI also add that I have seen Madame Couture on this subject and explained matters to her, which she understands, and was obliged to admit that according to law her children are not Indians and have no right to attend the Indian School at Lorette for nothing and that all those who are in the same position are obliged to pay. She has asked for a few weeks' delay.\n\nI think the Department will approve of my conduct in this matter, and I should like to be informed of its decision. I will transmit the amount as soon as I receive it, which I will endeavour to obtain with all diligence.\n\nI have, etc.,\n\nAntoine O. Bastien,\nIndian Agent.\nOTTAWA, 2nd December, 1896.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo, with further reference to the complaint made by Madam Couture that her children are entitled to attend the Indian school at Lorette free. In reply I beg to say that the Department approves of your action in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.D. McLean\n\nSecretary\n\nA.O. Bastien, Esq.\nIndian Agent,\nJeune Lorette,\nQue\nMonsieur le Secr\u00e9taire,\n\nD\u00e9partement des affaires des Sauvages,\n\nOTTAWA.\n\nMonsieur,\n\nEn r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 votre lettre du 22 Novembre courant relative \u00e0 l'assurance propos\u00e9e de la maison d'\u00e9cole des Sauvages de Lorette, j'ai l'honneur de vous transmettre les renseignements que j'ai pu me procurer du Missionnaire de la tribu, le R\u00e9v\u00e9rend M. Giroux.\n\nCette maison d'\u00e9cole a \u00e9t\u00e9 b\u00e2tie en 1869 ou 1870, alors qu'un M. Howe, je crois, \u00e9tait D\u00e9put\u00e9 Surintendant-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des affaires des Sauvages. La b\u00e2tisse a \u00e9t\u00e9 construite par le D\u00e9partement et a co\u00fbt\u00e9 de $600.00 \u00e0 $1000.00 environ.\n\nEn faisant quelques recherches, le D\u00e9partement pourrait, je crois, trouver toute la correspondance entre lui et M. M. Boucher, alors Missionnaire des Hurons, se rapportant \u00e0 la construction de cette b\u00e2tisse \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de 1869 ou 1870.\n\nDepuis cette date, i.e., au mois d'ao\u00fbt 1892, une allonge a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e0 la b\u00e2tisse au co\u00fbt de $212.54, pay\u00e9s par les fonds de la tribu huronne, tel qu'en fait foi la correspondance sous le Num\u00e9ro 93077, ce qui porterait la valeur actuelle de la dite b\u00e2tisse \u00e0 environ $1200.00.\n\nJ'ai l'honneur d'\u00eatre,\n\nMonsieur,\n\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\n\nAgent des Sauvages.\nTranslation.\n\nJeune Lorette, 30th November, 1895.\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 22nd instant, relative to proposed insurance of the Indian School at Lorette, I have the honour to forward the information that I have been able to receive from the Missionary, Rev. Mr. Giroux.\n\nThis School-house was put up in 1869 or 1870. At that time, I believe, that Mr. Howe was Deputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs. The building was erected by the Department and cost from $800.00 to $1000.00.\n\nBy making some searches the Department could, I believe, find all the correspondence between him and the late Rev. Mr. Becher, then Missionary to the Hurons, relating to the construction of this building between 1869 and 1870.\n\nSince that date, that is to say, in the month of August, 1892, an addition was made to the building at a cost of $212.54, paid from the funds of the Huron Tribe, as will be shown by the correspondence on file No. 98077, this would place the actual value of the building at about $1200.00.\n\nI have, etc.,\n\nAntoine O. Bastien,\nIndian Agent.\nOTTAWA, 5th December, 1896.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to previous correspondence relative to the lack of discipline in the boys' division of the Lorette school, I have to request that you will kindly inform the Department particularly on this point in your monthly reports.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\n\nA.O.

Bastien, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nJeune Lorette, P.Q.\nOTTAWA, 24th March, 1899\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your report on the Lorette Indian school for the month of February last; and in reply I beg to say that the Department regrets to note that Miss Dubois still fails to secure proper discipline in her class.\n\nIt has occurred to the Department that possibly if Miss St Amand were given the boys class and Miss Dubois the girls, better results might be obtained. The Department would like to have your views on this subject, and it would be pleased if such an arrangement could be carried out, as Miss Dubois being an old employee, it would prefer not being compelled to ask for her resignation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nSecretary\n\nA.O. Bastien, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nJeune Lorette, Que\nOTTAWA, 17th April, 1869\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that the Department has received a communication from the Rev. Guil. Giroux and four of the Huron Chiefs of Lorette in which they state that they wish to have the present teachers of their school replaced by teaching Sisters who are willing to take charge of it. Before deciding this question, the Department would like to have a report from you in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nSecretary\n\nA.O. Bastien, Esq.\nIndian Agent,\nJeune Lorette, Que\nMonsieur le Secr\u00e9taire,\n\nD\u00e9partement des Affaires des Sauvages,\n\nOTTAWA.\n\nMonsieur,\n\nPar votre lettre du 24 Mars dernier, vous me demandez si, en changeant les institutrices de classe, c'est-\u00e0-dire, en donnant la classe des gar\u00e7ons \u00e0 Melle St.-Amand et la classe des filles \u00e0 Melle Dub\u00e9au, nous ne pourrions pas obtenir un meilleur r\u00e9sultat, \u00e9vitant ainsi le renvoi de Melle Dub\u00e9au.\n\nDans mon humble opinion, ainsi que, me basant sur les remarques de M. le Missionnaire, de l'Inspecteur, et sur mes observations personnelles, je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait remarquer au D\u00e9partement, Melle Dub\u00e9au qui fut autrefois une bonne institutrice, n'a plus, vu son grand \u00e2ge, sa m\u00e9thode vieillie d'enseignement, la capacit\u00e9 voulue pour maintenir la discipline dans aucune classe et encore moins conserver l'autorit\u00e9 qu'une institutrice doit avoir sur les \u00e9l\u00e8ves, autorit\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire au progr\u00e8s bien compris.\n\nJe m'en ai aucun doute, ce serait compromettre le succ\u00e8s obtenu dans la classe des filles par Melle St.-Amand que d'y introduire Melle Dub\u00e9au. Melle St.-Amand est ma\u00eetresse de ses \u00e9l\u00e8ves sur qui elle a toute l'autorit\u00e9 d'une excellente institutrice. La discipline dans sa classe est excellente et il n'y a aucun reproche \u00e0 lui faire, de l'avis du Missionnaire et de l'Inspecteur. D'un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, Melle St.-Amand aurait beaucoup de la mis\u00e8re \u00e0 reprendre l'ascendant sur les petits gar\u00e7ons, que Melle Dub\u00e9au a perdu.

Hudon, assistant-missionnaire qui a toujours port\u00e9 un grand int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole, ainsi que de celui de M. l'Inspecteur d'\u00e9coles Roy. C'est une contradiction regrettable et on aurait d\u00fb faire une distinction, ce qui m'aurait \u00e9vit\u00e9 le d\u00e9plaisir d'attirer l'attention du D\u00e9partement \u00e0 ce\nsujet. D'ailleurs le D\u00e9partement peut se convaincre, en r\u00e9f\u00e9rant \u00e0 sa lettre du 6 octobre dernier, \u00e0 mes rapports mensuels d'\u00e9cole depuis le mois de novembre 1898; aux rapports de M. l'inspecteur Roy ainsi qu'\u00e0 la lettre du 18 avril aussi dernier que c'est M. l'inspecteur Roy qui, seul, avons fait remarquer le manque de discipline et de progr\u00e8s dans la classe des gar\u00e7ons tenue par Melle Dub\u00e9au, la mauvaise m\u00e9thode de son enseignement et qu'elle f\u00fbt remplac\u00e9e par une institutrice bien qualifi\u00e9e. Je ne sache pas qu'aucune plainte ait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par nul autre que ce soit, du moins aucune n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e devant moi.\n\nLa requ\u00eate dit aussi : \"Ces soeurs auront plus d'autorit\u00e9 sur les enfants\". Je l'ignore et je ne suis pas assez clairvoyant ni comp\u00e9tent pour d\u00e9cider cette question. J'avoue n\u00e9anmoins qu'elles devront avoir plus d'autorit\u00e9 que Melle Dub\u00e9au n'en a dans la classe des gar\u00e7ons.\n\nJ'ai remarqu\u00e9 aussi que les signataires de la requ\u00eate ne parlent pas des d\u00e9penses consid\u00e9rables qu'occasionnera le changement propos\u00e9. Vu qu'il n'y a pas de couvent dans la paroisse de St.-Ambroise de Noreste, il va falloir donner \u00e0 ces religieuses enseignantes un logement dans la maison d'\u00e9cole actuelle qui devra subir des changements dispendieux, sans compter grand nombre d'autres r\u00e9parations co\u00fbteuses au rez-de-chauss\u00e9e, peinture, etc.\n\nAu cours de la conversation que j'ai eue avec M. l'inspecteur d'\u00e9coles Roy, il m'a fait remarquer que dans la Province de Qu\u00e9bec, en vertu du Code de l'Instruction publique, article 227, l'institutrice est engag\u00e9e \u00e0 l'ann\u00e9e qui finit le 30 juin, et si l'on doit, si l'on veut la remercier de ses services, lui donner deux mois d'avis avant la fin de son en-\nLorsqu'il y a une cause valable de renvoi, pour incapacit\u00e9 ou autrement, cet avis n'est pas requis.\n\nLe D\u00e9partement comprend qu'en faisant les remarques ci-dessus, toute bas\u00e9es qu'elles sont sur la justice, l'observation et la stricte v\u00e9rit\u00e9, je me mets dans une position excessivement d\u00e9licate vis-\u00e0-vis le missionnaire et les Chefs dont je ne voudrais pas encourir la disgr\u00e2ce. Aussi, j'esp\u00e8re qu'en les informant du r\u00e9sultat de cette question, le D\u00e9partement voudra bien les mettre sous l'impression qu'il a agi de son propre chef, sans que mes remarques y aient contribu\u00e9 pour quoi que ce soit.\n\nJ'ai l'honneur d'\u00eatre,\n\nMonsieur,\n\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\n\nAgent des Sauvages.\nJeune Lorette, 5th May, 1899.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir:\n\nIn accordance with your letter of the 26th April last, forwarding me a petition addressed to your Department by the Rev. Guil. Giroux and four of the Huron Chiefs of Lorette, in which they state that they desire that the present school Teachers be replaced by religious teachers, I have the honour, in returning you the petition as requested, to report as follows:\n\nMr. Roy, Inspector of Schools, who resides at St. Am\u00e9broise de Lorette and whom I wished to consult in the matter, was absent on official inspection and I had to wait until his return, which delayed my reply to your letter of the 26th, received on the 28th of April last.\n\nIn the second paragraph of this petition it is stated \"For some years we have received complaints more or less well founded as to the discipline and the teaching of the Teachers, etc.\" I regret that the Missionary couched this phrase in terms so general as to lead one to believe that complaints had been made, and especially against Miss St. Amand, who conducts a class remarkable in all respects according to the acknowledgment of the Missionary himself and of the Rev. Mr. Hudon, Assistant Missionary, who has always taken great interest in the School, as well as of Mr. Roy, the School Inspector. This contradiction is to be regretted and a distinction ought to have been made which would have saved me the unpleasantness of drawing the attention of the Department to this matter.\n\nBesides,\nBesides, the Department can satisfy itself by referring to its letter of the 6th October last, to my monthly school reports since the month of November, 1898, to the reports of Inspector Roy, and to my letter of the 18th of April last, that it was Mr. Roy and [illegible] alone remarked the want of discipline and of progress in the boys' class conducted by Miss Dubeau, the bad method of teaching and that she ought to be replaced by a well qualified teacher. I do not know of any complaint having been made by any person else whomsoever\u2014at least none has been made to me.\n\nThe petition states also \"These sisters would have more authority over the children\". I am not aware of it and I have not sufficient insight nor am I competent to decide that question. I acknowledge, nevertheless, that they would have more authority than Miss Dubeau has over her class of boys.\n\nI observe also that the signers of the petition do not speak of the considerable expense that the proposed change would necessitate. As there is no convent in the Parish of St. Ambroise de Lorette, it would be necessary to give these religious teachers lodging in the present school-house, which would have to be changed at some expense without considering the great number of costly repairs to the ground floor, painting, etc.\n\nIn the course of a conversation that I had with Inspector Roy the latter remarked to me that in the Province of Quebec under the Code of public instruction, Section 227, the school teacher is engaged for the year that ends on the 30th of June, and that, if it is desired to dispense with her services, she ought to be given two months' notice before the end of her engagement. When there is a valid cause for dismissal for incapacity or otherwise, this notice is not required.\n\nThe Department will understand that in making the foregoing\nforegoing remarks, all based as they are on justice, observation and strict truth, I place myself in an exceedingly delicate position in respect to the Missionary and the Chiefs, whose disfavour I should not like to incur. Also I trust that in informing them of the decision in regard to this question the Department will be kind enough to give them the impression that it has acted of its own motion, without being influenced by any remarks from me.\n\nI have, etc.,\n\nAntoine O. Bastien,\nIndian Agent.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 16th May, 1899\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nRe petition of Missionary and Huron Chiefs of Lorette to have the present teachers of their school replaced by the Sisters.\n\nMr School Inspector Roy in his report on the Jeune Lorette school for the year ended 30th June, '98, stated that he found the discipline in the boys' class very bad and that he had been obliged on several occasions to speak to the teacher about her want of control over the pupils and the unsatisfactory results obtained. Mr Agent Bastien was written to in the matter of the complaint made against Miss Dub\u00e9au, the teacher of the boys' class and he reported that she, being very old, had lost her authority over the pupils and that it was impossible for her to maintain discipline in her class. The teacher was written to on this subject and informed that unless a marked improvement took place the question of continuing her in her present position would receive serious consideration.\n\nMiss Dub\u00e9au, having had charge of this school for a number of years and conducting it with fair success, the Department did not wish to act harshly towards her and was willing to give her every opportunity of obtaining better control over her pupils, in which I regret to say, judging by the reports received, she has not succeeded. I might mention here that in '95, Miss Dub\u00e9au voluntarily consented to the division of her salary to pay for the services...\nof an assistant, and Miss Elizabeth St Amand was appointed in September of that year, both teachers receiving a salary of $150 per annum, $300 being the sum voted for the school.\n\nMr Bastien, the Agent, and the Inspector, report favorably of the manner in which Miss St Amand conducts her class, and there does not appear to be any reason for her dismissal. Miss Dub\u00e9au should, I think, be retired from the 30th June next, and I understand from Mr Bastien's report that she will be entitled to a retiring allowance from the Quebec Government, as she has been teaching for over 25 years. He also states that she is comfortably off, being worth $4000 or $5000.\n\nIn the petition referred to the Indians ask to have the Sisters placed in charge of this school, and Mr Bastien, to whom the petition was referred for report, states that he observes that the signers of the petition do not speak of the considerable expense which the proposed change would necessitate. As there is no convent in the parish of St Ambrose de Lorette, it would be necessary to give the religious teachers lodging in the present school house, which would have to be changed, at some expense, without considering the great number of costly repairs to the ground floor, painting, etc.\n\nIf the Department feels disposed to go to any additional expense in connection with this school, it seems to me that it would be better that the money should be expended in securing the services of a properly qualified head teacher for this school, as\n$150 is not sufficient compensation for a competent teacher. The Hurons of Lorette pay about $75 or $80 a year for school material, fuel and inspection of their school and their capital would not stand a much larger expenditure as they have only about $4500 to their credit.\n\nThe return for last quarter shows an enrollment of 75 pupils and two teachers are required for a school of this size, who should hold recognized Provincial certificates of qualification.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

She also states that she has not been officially notified to the above effect and that if this took place she would find herself without employment. She says that she has still two years to put in as teacher to entitle her to a pension, and that she does not like to give up her situation to make room for others, as she claims that she has always given satisfaction and thinks that she deserves some recognition of her services on the part of the Department. She would like some information on this matter at once.\n\nNo. 1 of this file was charged to the Supt. Genl. on the 16th May last, but speaking from recollection, there seems to be good grounds for the rumors reported by Miss Dub\u00e9au, as the Rev. Mr. Giroux, missionary at Lorette, is most anxious to have the Sisters installed and to get rid of the present teacher. Miss Dub\u00e9au is an old and faithful servant of the Department, but she has apparently lost her authority over the boys, who were under her charge and the Agent agrees with the priest that a change...\nshould be made. Up to within a year ago, the reports from the Inspector and the Agent were very favorable to Miss Dubois, and it is only lately that a change has been asked for.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Bastien, the Agent of the Department, informing me that he has received instructions from your Department to notify me that my service as teacher will not be required after the 30th June next as my school is to be placed in charge of religious teachers at the end of the school term.\n\nI cannot interfere in this matter. Only let me tell you that I am deprived of a position that I have held for thirteen years, and which gave me an honourable living although the salary was not very large. I hope therefore that your Department, which has always shown itself so just in its treatment of me each time that I had good reasons to offer, will not abandon me altogether.\n\nI am old, and it is too late to make engagements. As I am an old servant of your Department and as I am conscious of always having done my duty, I dare humbly to pray that you will grant me one year's salary. You will not be able to believe how much service that will be to me, and it will afford your Department the opportunity of acknowledging the sacrifice that I have made during long years in following my noble but hard profession of teacher.\nConfident that you will do justice to a just demand,\n\nI have the honour to be,\nYour humble servant,\nJosephine Dubeau,\nTeacher.\n\nSew.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 2nd June, 1900\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nSome time ago a petition was received from Rev. Guil. Giroux and some of the Huron Chiefs asking to have the Lorette school placed in charge of the Sisters. Miss Dub\u00e9au, senior teacher of the school, complained last year that if she were then dismissed she would forfeit her claim to a pension from the Department of Public Instruction for the Province of Quebec. Since then the Department has been advised that she has completed her twenty-five years teaching, which would entitle her to an allowance and in May last instructions were given to Agent Bastien to notify her that her services would not be required after the 30th instant as the school was, after that date, to be placed in charge of the religious teachers.\n\nMiss Dub\u00e9au writes under date of the 28th ultimo asking that in view of her length of service and age that the Department grant her one year's salary as a retiring allowance.\n\nThis is an unusual application as very few of our teachers stay long enough in our service to justify them in making such a claim. I may say\nsay that the delay in making the contemplated change of teachers was out of consideration for Miss Dub\u00e9au that she might remain long enough to complete the term of service entitling her to a pension. Neither the school vote nor the funds of the Band would stand such a gratuity as asked for.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The question of changing the management of this school was brought up over a year ago and the decision was delayed out of consideration for you, in order that you might remain on long enough to complete the term of service entitling you to a pension, which you stated you would lose if you were dismissed before you had served for twenty-five years as teacher in the Province of Quebec.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMiss Josephine Dubois,\nTeacher of Indian school,\nJeune Lorette,\n\nIndian Affairs.

Miss St. Amand was, no doubt, well aware of the contemplated change in the management of this School which was proposed to be made more than a year and a-half ago and was delayed in order to avoid doing an injustice to Miss Dub\u00e9au, the Senior Teacher, who lacked a short time to complete her twenty-five years' teaching entitling her to a pension from the Department of Public Instruction, Province of Quebec.\n\nThe arrangement under which teachers are employed by this Department is that their engagement terminates on the 30th of June each year, and this Department is in no way governed by the Provincial School Laws or Regulations in the conduct and management of its schools.\n\nDirections were given to Mr. Agent Bastien to notify the teachers of the Lorette Indian School that it had been decided to place the School in charge of the Sisters after the close of the current school year, and he was asked to notify the present teachers that their services would not be required after the 30th June next. Such notice, I claim, was, under the circumstances, sufficient and I know of no funds from which gratuity of a year's salary could be paid to any of the teachers, as neither\nthe school vote, nor the funds of the Band would stand such a charge, and the proposed change could hardly take place if such payment has to be made.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

They have advised me of their anxiety to see their salary increased by the Department and they ask me for a reply.\n\nI wrote to the Department on July 31, last, to this effect. The two sisters ask for an increase of $50 each to their present salary.\n\nI express the opinion of the missionary when I say that we shall be glad if their request is granted, on account of their devotion to their pupils and also in view of reasons that I gave in my said letter of July 31, last.\n\nI have, &c.,\n\nA.

Elles m'ont fait part de leur anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 voir leur salaire augment\u00e9 par le D\u00e9partement et me demandent une r\u00e9ponse.\n\nJ'ai \u00e9crit au D\u00e9partement le 31 Juillet dernier \u00e0 cet effet. Les deux Soeurs demandent une augmentation de $50.00 chacune, \u00e0 leur salaire actuel.\n\nJ'exprime l'opinion de Monsieur le Missionnaire en disant que nous serions heureux si leur demande \u00e9tait accord\u00e9e, vu leur d\u00e9vouement pour leurs \u00e9l\u00e8ves, et vu aussi les raisons que j'ai donn\u00e9es dans ma susdite lettre du 31 Juillet dernier.\n\nJ'ai l'honneur d'\u00eatre,\n\nvotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\n\nAntoine O. Bastien\n\nAgent des Sauvages.\nOttawa, September 15, 1908.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nMr. Agent Bastien has applied on behalf of the teachers of the Lorette Indian school for an increased grant. There are two classes in this school in charge of teaching nuns, who are at present paid at the rate of $150 each. They have quarters provided for them over the school but have to maintain themselves out of their salaries, and the Inspector states that a good portion is used up in buying fuel.\n\nI think, taking in view the increased cost of living, the Department should at least give them an increase of $50 each, with which they would be content.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

There are no ventilators in the school-rooms and there is hardly an hour when the pupils are in class that we have not to open the window in order to get a little fresh air. The air is so vitiated that it is suffocating.\n\nWill you have the great kindness to authorize our physician, Dr.J.E.Vermet, of Lorette, to make a inspection of the convent; he is very competent and will be able to give you a very thorough report. For a year he has been finding fault with this building, very much, from a sanitary standpoint. If you will write to him, it will save you sending an inspector. This building was erected in accordance with plans from Ottawa, and the Government sent an inspector last winter. We did not say anything, because that gentleman ought to be in a position to know well what is needed for these class-rooms. It is for the Government to attend to this matter.\n\nI send you a plan, very simple, of the building.\n\nYours very humbly,\n\nSister St.Jean de la Croix,\nSuperior.\nMadame la Sup\u00e9rieure,\nCouvent de l'Indian Lorette,\nJeanne Lorette, Co., Qu\u00e9bec.\n\nMadame,\n\nOn nous \u00e9crit le que votre couvent \"contient trois lieux d'aisances qui n'ont pas de ventilation\", 2\u00b0 que \"les religieuses sont oblig\u00e9es d'ouvrir les fen\u00eatres des classes et qu'\u00e0 cette saison c'est trop froid\".\n\nNous \u00e9crivons \u00e0 notre correspondant pour qu'il nous donne plus de d\u00e9tails sur la mani\u00e8re dont sont construites les latrines, pour vous en \u00e9crire ult\u00e9rieurement.\n\nQuant aux classes, il nous para\u00eet \u00e9vident que votre \u00e9cole n'a pas le dispositif de ventilation appropri\u00e9 et, en cons\u00e9quence, le Conseil me charge de vous rappeler les trois articles, 69k, 69l et 69m des r\u00e8glements concernant les \u00e9coles, r\u00e8glements dont un exemplaire est ci-joint, et de vous prier de pouvoir \u00e0 la ventilation qui y est prescrite sans plus de d\u00e9lai.\n\nJ'inclus \u00e9galement un exemplaire d'un imprim\u00e9 sur la ventilation des \u00e9coles.

O. Bastien, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nJeune Lorette, Que.\nOttawa, January 19, 1912.\n\nMadam,\n\nIn your annual report on the Lorette School you state as follows: \"There is no janitor, but it would be necessary to have one.\"\n\nIn April, last, the Department agreed to pay you at the rate of $2.00 per month for the janitor work and the records show that you were paid to the 30th of June, last. The accounts have also been received for the scrubbing of the schoolrooms during the year 1911. These accounts show that the work was done on six different occasions. In view of these facts the Department does not understand your remarks that the appointment of a janitor is necessary. If you have attended to the work of sweeping the class-rooms you should forward your account up to the end of December through the office of the Indian Agent and from this time forward it would be well for you to send them in at the end of each quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nSister St. Jean Baptiste,\nTeacher,\nLorette Indian School,\nLorette, Que.\nJeune Lorette, 1er mars 1912.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Secr., Secr\u00e9taire,\nD\u00e9partement des Affaires des Sauvages,\nOTTAWA.\n\nMonsieur,\n\nEn r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 votre lettre du 30 janvier dernier, me disant que vous avez \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 par la Soeur Principale de l'\u00e9cole de Lorette qu'il n'y a personne qui s'occupe des petites r\u00e9parations de l'\u00e9cole. Je dois vous dire que les Soeurs elles-m\u00eames se sont charg\u00e9es du balayage des classes \u00e0 condition de .50 par semaine, tel que convenu par votre lettre du 26 avril 1911. Elles ont d\u00fb faire ce balayage puisqu'elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9es r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement, par cons\u00e9quent, je n'ai pas \u00e0 y voir.\n\nQuant au lavage des classes la soeur n'a pas \u00e0 se plaindre car il n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9glig\u00e9 et il est fait lorsqu'elle le d\u00e9sire, puisqu'elle a une femme de peine \u00e0 sa disposition.\n\nJe l'ai fait par ma lettre du 9 f\u00e9vrier dernier.\n\nSi la Soeur comme vous dites, m'a demand\u00e9 de lui avoir des blancs de \"Requisition for school material\", j'ai alors imm\u00e9diatement \u00e9crit au D\u00e9partement le\nSeptembre dernier, lui demandant de m'envoyer de ces formules et je ne les ai pas encore re\u00e7ues. C'\u00e9tait \u00e0 la veille, mais elle le veut. Je t\u00e2cherai de recevoir ces formules, de me rappeler la chose, ce qui m'aurait permis d'\u00e9crire de nouveau au D\u00e9partement \u00e0 ce sujet, c'est ce que je lui ai dit hier, lorsque je suis all\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole, mais elle ne se souvient pas avoir demand\u00e9 les formules en question; de plus elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle n'en a pas encore eu besoin jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent, attendu qu'elle avait tout ce qu'il lui fallait.\n\nSi je n'ai pas donn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t des explications c'est qu'une grave maladie en a \u00e9t\u00e9 la cause.\n\nJ'ai l'honneur d'\u00eatre,\n\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur\n\nAgent des sauvages.\nOttawa, March 13, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your two letters of March 1st in reference to matters pertaining to the Lorette School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that a supply of forms for requisitioning school material will be sent you. You will be good enough to hand them to the teacher when they arrive.\n\nWith regard to the stoves no action will be taken at the present time, but you should bring this matter to the attention of the Department next summer holidays. The oiling of the school floors may also stand over till that time, when you will be good enough to have it attended to.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. G.

Si je permettez, vous de vous dire que dans ces circonstances, il nous est absolument impossible de nous pr\u00e9parer notre nourriture, de prendre de nos repas et de surveiller les variations des id\u00e9es et nous-m\u00eames ou pauvres enfants ont de assez de temps pour que leur digestion ne se trouve pas trop...\npour leurs classes. Je vous avoue que pour le midi surtout, nous avons fait \u00e0 la gare. Si vous tenez absolument \u00e0 nous faire suivre le point du r\u00e8glement donn\u00e9, je peux vous dire qu'il est une piti\u00e9 pour nous une seule qui nous ferait la cuisine, de cette sorte quoique la fatigue se fit encore sentir, au moins elle serait un peu all\u00e9g\u00e9e. Je vous laisse \u00e0 votre discr\u00e9tion pour le montant \u00e0 donner. Tout de m\u00eame, 850.00 ne serait pas trop pour garder une servante de plus pour la cuisine, n'est-ce pas? En second lieu, le gouvernement sait favoriser l'\u00e9ducation; je crois le pas trop exiger et demandant si vous conduisez dans notre petite habitation de la lumi\u00e8re \u00e9lectrique, nos petits Ouiques m\u00eame en b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient dans les jours sombres d'automne et d'hiver.\n\nConfiant en votre liberalit\u00e9, je demanderais \u00e0 Dieu de vous d\u00e9dier en retour les faveurs choy\u00e9es qu'il a plu de accorder \u00e0 ceux qui dirigent les autres, lorsqu'ils le font avec le d\u00e9sint\u00e9ressement qu'on vous conna\u00eet.\n\nJe joins \u00e0 ma lettre une liste des livres, cahiers et autres effets scolaires pour nos clas-\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ'esp\u00e8re que par le pass\u00e9, vous continuerez \u00e0\nm'envoyer directement les objets demand\u00e9s. Si vous pouviez, pour cette fois, me permettre d'acheter moi-m\u00eame \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, ce qui est mentionn\u00e9 dans la requ\u00eate, nous les recevrons plus vite parce que nous \u00e9tions manquant de choses n\u00e9cessaires.\n\nAgissons l'hommage du profond respect que je dois \u00e0 l'honneur d'\u00eatre.\n\nMonsieur le Ministre,\n\nVotre bien humblement oblige\n\nMadame Sa Jeannie de Chantal.\n\n19 septembre 1912.\ncongregation N.D. du P. Secours,\nHuron Village of Lorette, Que.,\nSept. 19, 1912.\n\nMr. Frank Padley,\nDeputy Minister of I.A.,\n\nSir,\n\nIn all confidence I beg to ask you two favours: the first is as follow: you compel us to teach until noon and until four o'clock. I beg to tell you that in these circumstances it is absolutely impossible for us to prepare our food, to take our meals, and to oversee the recreation of the pupils; and as for themselves, these poor children, have they time enough for their digestion without interfering with their class? I may say that at noon, especially, we are very much pressed. If you insist absolutely on our following this regulation, could you not add a few dollars to pay for a sister who would do the cooking for us, so that although the work would still be felt, at least it would be a little lightened. I leave it to your discretion as to the amount to give; all the same, $50.00 would not be too much to keep another sister for the kitchen, would it? In the second place, the Government wishes to promote education; I do not think that it would be too much to ask whether you would be so kind as to provide our little house with electric light; our little Hurons would benefit by it during the dark days of autumn and winter.\n\nConfident in your liberality, I should ask God\nto bestow upon you in return the choice favours that it pleases Him to grant to those who direct others when they do so with disinterestedness such as we know to be the case with you.\n\nI append to my letter a list of the books, exercise-books and other school material for our classes. I trust that, as in the past, you will continue to send direct the articles asked for. Could you not with that purpose permit me to purchase myself at Quebec, what is mentioned in the requisition; we should receive them sooner because our pupils are in want of necessary things.\n\nAccept the profound respect with which I have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYours very humbly and gratefully,\nMother St. Jeanne de Chantal\nLorette:\nSalaries -\n$400 for two teachers i.e.\n$200 each\n\nRentals $2 or 50\nJeune Lorette, May 6, 1912.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of I.A.,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nAs in past years, I should like to have authority from the Department for the purchase of prizes to be distributed to the pupils of the school on the Lorette reserve at the end of the present school year.\n\nAs the number of pupils has increased greatly since last year, the teaching nuns request me to ask you to be kind enough to authorize the expenditure of the sum of at least $12.00 in the purchase of these books.

I appreciate, Sir, the amount that you have obtained for us, but you knew better than I that the maintenance and food of one person costs more today and with $50.00 one cannot go far; that is why I again ask you to intercede with the members in order to obtain this system of lighting, which will cost, I believe, $2.50 a month for a dozen lights, a sum that would appear very little to the Department, but which would be of great good to us and would enable us to employ for something useful the money that we spend for oil.\n\nRepeating the expression of my deep gratitude, I subscribe myself\n\nYour humble and much obliged servant,\n\nMother Ste.

General of Indian Affairs an indemnity of $50.00, which was granted us, and which enabled me to obtain from the Mother House a sister who takes charge of the kitchen, because the Department compels us to close the morning school at noon and to begin the afternoon school at one o'clock.\n\nBut, Mr. Secretary, $50.00 is very little to maintain one person, and at the present time with the authorization of Mr. Antoine Bastien, Agent for the band, I make a fresh appeal to your good and charitable heart to obtain for us again an increase of $50.00. The reason I ask for that is that I have reason to fear that the community will refuse me next year the sister that it has given me this year, because the amount is certainly small and this good sister could get more elsewhere.\n\nI have confidence in your liberality, Mr. Secretary, which I am assured is very great and which will make you take my request into consideration, and I trust that in return God will not allow Himself to be beaten in generosity; it is not His custom.\n\nI have, &c.,\n\nSr. St. Jeanne de Chantal\nMonseigneur le Secr\u00e9taire,\n\nAu D\u00e9partement des Affaires Indiennes,\nOttawa.\n\nMonseigneur le Secr\u00e9taire,\n\nLe 19 septembre 1912, j'ai re\u00e7u sollicit\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s du Sous-secr\u00e9taire G\u00e9n\u00e9ral des Affaires Indiennes une indemnit\u00e9 de $50.00 qui nous fut accord\u00e9e, et qui me permit d'obtenir de la Mairie une somme qui s'occupa de la m\u00eame place que le D\u00e9partement nous obligait \u00e0 faire la classe du matin \u00e0 midi et de commencer celle du soir \u00e0 une heure.\n\nMonseigneur le Secr\u00e9taire,\n\n$50.00 c'est bien peu pour l'entretien d'une personne et aujourd'hui avec l'autorisation de\nMonsieur Antoine Bastien, Agent de la Tribu, je viens de nouveau faire appel \u00e0 votre bon et charitable c\u0153ur pour nous obtenir encore une nouvelle augmentation de 250.00. Si je demande cela, c'est que j'ai droit de croire que la Communaut\u00e9 ne refuse pas un prochain la subvention qu'elle m'a donn\u00e9e cette ann\u00e9e, parce que le montant est certainement faible et cette bonne somme pourrait avoir plus ailleurs.\n\nJ'ai confiance en votre liberalit\u00e9.\n\nMonsieur le Secr\u00e9taire, si vous m'assurez \u00eatre bien grand ce que vous ferez prendre, ma demande en consid\u00e9ration et si elle est qu'en retour Dieu ne se lasse pas encore en g\u00e9n\u00e9rosit\u00e9.

They also each receive the bonus of $150.00, thus making the amount received by the Principal $450.00 and the assistant $400.00.\n\nAt B\u00e9r\u00e9nice the teachers are paid $275.00 each and they also receive the bonus of $150.00, a combined salary and bonus of $425.00.\n\nThe salaries of the two teachers at Restigouche have recently been increased and they receive, from the first of October, last, salaries as follows: principal $450.00 and the assistant $350.00.\n\nI would recommend that the salaries of the teachers at the Lorette, Pointe Bleue and B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Schools be increased to the same amount as at Restigouche, as the teachers at all these schools have a large attendance and perform the same duties and they are giving satisfaction in their work. At Restigouche there was an enrolment of 87 pupils with an average...\nof about 50; at Lorette the enrolment is 65 pupils and the average attendance 60; at Pointe Bleue the enrolment is 82 with an average attendance of 62 and at Bersimis the enrolment during six months of year is about 96 and for the September quarter last, the average attendance was 92. During the winter the Indians are away hunting and the enrolment at the Bersimis School is about 25, with an average of 21.\n\nIf my recommendation is approved, the salary of the principal of Lorette should be increased by $200.00 and the assistant by $100.00; at Pointe Bleue the salary of the principal should be increased by $150.00 and the assistant by $100.00 and at Bersimis the salary of the principal should be increased by $175.00 and the assistant by $75.00. By allowing these increases the salaries at these three schools will be the same as paid the teachers at Restigouche. There is practically the same amount of work to be done at all these schools and the teachers have the same qualifications. If these increases are approved by you they should date from the first of October, last, the beginning of the present quarter.\nOttawa, November 24, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that it has been decided to increase the salaries allowed to the teachers at the Lorette Indian Day School. The principal and assistant at present receive $250.00 per annum each and, from the first of October last, the salaries have been increased as follows:- the principal will be allowed $450.00 per annum and the assistant $350.00 per annum from the above date. This will provide an increase of $200.00 in the salary of the principal and $100.00 in the salary of the assistant. This increase is made in order to equalize the salaries allowed the teaching sisters in the Indian day schools in the Province of Quebec.\n\nYou will be good enough to inform the teachers of the increase allowed them from the first of October, last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

For this reason you were advised that the Lorette School would open on October 1, 1941, and close on June 30, 1942. You should so advise Sioui.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. M.E. Bastien,\nIndian Agent,\nLoretteville, Que.\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. HOEY\n\nRe: Lorette Indian Reserve\n\nOn September 17 I visited this reserve and accompanied by Indian Agent Bastien we inspected the Lorette Indian Day School. This is a very old building two stories high. The two class rooms are on the ground floor and the teachers' living quarters on the second floor. The enrolment at this school is 62 and the class rooms are rather small to accommodate this number of children. However, the whole building was extremely clean and in fairly good repair but the roof will require extensive repairs in the very near future and due to the construction of a new highway in front of the school property the water from the highway drains into the cellar. It will be necessary to construct some kind of a drain to carry the water from the cellar. Indian Agent Bastien is making inquiries regarding the cost of the necessary work and will later advise the Department. If the expenditure recommended by Mr. Bastien is at all reasonable I believe that this work should be done this fall.\n\nWhile the Sisters in charge of this school have only conducted classes to Grade 6 in the past it is their intention to conduct Grade 7 this year.\n\nFor many years it has been the custom to send the best of the oldest boys to the Brothers' School. At this school they take a three-year course which includes considerable commercial work. Indian Agent Bastien was very insistent on the fact that the older boys should be handled by men and in addition he stated that the training they receive at the Brothers' School enables them to secure positions.\nWhen the staff of the Lorette School only taught up to the sixth grade those who attended the Brothers' School had to stay for three years. However, with Grade 7 instruction in our own school it will only involve sending the brighter boys to the Brothers' School for a period of two years.\n\nFor the current academic year we have authorized grant of $30.00 each for 11 boys to attend the Brothers' School. Both the Indian Agent and the Sisters agreed that this was the total number who were entitled to the additional training this year. I pointed out to them that it was unlikely that this number could be increased in future years and I believe they thoroughly understand that in future the Department will only allow a maximum of 11 at the Brothers' School. The tuition fee is $30.00 a year each.\n\nIn addition to the regular academic subjects some vocational training has been given along practical lines and, as a matter of fact, the fence around the school property was constructed by the boys under the direction of the Sister.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nVillage Huron, 23 Juin, 1942.\n\nMonsieur R. A. Hoey, Superintendent,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI take the liberty to interrupt, your duties, to let you know how I am pleased to tell you that last night I got the privilege, as sub-Chief, to assist at the examination, of the Academic of Loretteville.\n\nIt is with pleasure, I tell you that the Hurons boys are ahead, in three degree, and the others were not the last.\n\nI tell you these things, to let you know that the moneys you spend, for the instruction, of those boys are not given in lost.\n\nPlease accept my thanks, for all what you doing to the welfare of our Indians, and I hope that you will do more in the future.\n\nI remain, Dear Mr. Hoey, in L.B.C.\n\nYour very truly,\n\nMaurice Vincent,\nVillage Huron,\nQUEBEC.\nOttawa, June 25, 1942.\n\nDear Mr. Vincent:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant and to thank you for the expression of appreciation contained therein.

Madeleine du S.C. and Sister Ste. Madeleine de Bethanie.\n\nWe do not appear to have any previous correspondence with reference to their appointment. The last letter we received from you regarding teachers at the Lorette School was dated August 25, 1941, in which letter you stated that Sister St. Aubin and Sister Mary of the Calvary would be in charge of the school for the academic year 1941-42. Since we had received no subsequent communication, it was our understanding that these two teachers were still in charge. Please let me know when Sister Ste. Madeleine du S.C. and Sister Ste. Madeleine de Bethanie began teaching at Lorette.\n\nR.A.

My little boy, aged 7, has just begun to go to school, his first year, since which time he has been mistreated. He has arrived at school with a tooth broken, the result of a blow from Ernest Savard's little boy, who is much older and bigger. The family of Ernest Savard, who are on the Reserve, are pure Canadians. Several have complained about this family, who pass their time in playing tricks and doing harm everywhere in the village. I told the parents but they pay no attention to their children; they cannot correct them and are obliged to let them do what they like. If this keeps on I shall have to take my children out of school. Please see to the matter as soon as possible. What have things come to that Canadians living on the Reserve have more say than we Indians. The people of the Village all have complaints to make about mistreatment by the Savard family.\n\n(sgd.)

Sister Ste. Jeanne d'Arc, Principal,\nLorette Indian Day School, Huron Village, P.Q.\n\nFollowing his last inspection of your school at the beginning of February, Mr. Doucet reported that you have made a radical change in your Course of Studies. You are introducing the teaching of English where such instruction is not required by provincial regulations.\n\nThe Department does not wish to jeopardize the success of the pupils in their studies for this year. We are, therefore, not ready to authorize such radical changes that may cause the failure of these pupils. Should there be any changes necessary you will be officially notified so that they may be made at the beginning of the academic year 1947-48.\n\nDirector\nLorette Indian Day School,\nHuron Village, March 11, 1947.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey, Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe acknowledge with thanks your letter of March 4th re: Extracurricular English being taught in our school. Our delay in answering is due to the fact that we communicated with the general authority at our Mother-House.\n\nWe confess to being positively taken aback by your statement that you \"are not ready to authorize such radical changes...\", in view of the fact that these changes were very high-handedly imposed upon us by your own local Indian Agent, Mr. Maurice Bastien, who gave us the impression that he was acting officially, on behalf of the Department. Our Reverend Mother, early in December, sent a personal representative here to beg Mr. Bastien that these changes be not enforced in the very middle of the school-year, for this placed her in the greatest embarrassment, but he was adamant and threatened to place a masculine lay-teacher in the school unless his requirements be immediately fulfilled.\n\nFurthermore, when, on Jan. 22nd, we remarked to Mr. Bastien that we had received no direct communication from Ottawa asking us to undertake the teaching of English on a larger scale, he replied that that was because he had smoothed out things for us and that the Department (following upon the visit of the Indian Commission last fall) positively required more English to be taught in our school.\n\nActing in very good faith, and convinced that she was cooperating with the Department, Reverend Mother went to no end of trouble to find a bilingual teacher, and that teacher has been here since Jan. 8th, teaching one and one-half hours a day, absolutely without remuneration!\nWe would like to call your attention to the fact that, to give weight to his arguments, Mr. Bastien very often invokes the existence of a \"contract\" which is supposed to oblige us to furnish bilingual teachers and bilingual teaching such as is done in the separate schools of Ontario. Neither Reverend Mother nor myself have any knowledge of such a contract nor can find any trace of it in the Community archives. Now, if such a contract exists, we suppose it to have been passed by former superiors with the Department at Ottawa, and you would greatly oblige us by sending us an exact copy. If, on the other hand, such contract was passed with Mr. Bastien, did he have the right to include clauses which are in contravention with the School Laws of the Province? At any rate, should such be the case, will you please oblige us by asking Mr. Bastien to send you an exact copy of this document, and forward same to us? We shall be very grateful if you can elucidate this \"contract\" question once and for all.\n\nIn accordance with your letter, we have of course resumed the teaching of English exactly in accordance with Provincial requirements, i.e., two hours a week, in grades six and seven, only.\n\nWe greatly regret that we can produce no written document to substantiate the above affirmations. All arrangements were made verbally with the Indian Agent. On our part, as we are always very straightforward in our dealings, we had absolutely no idea that we were being taken in.\n\nPlease excuse the almost unreasonable length of this missive. In all justice to our Community we feel that these explanations are necessary.\n\nAwaiting your further good pleasure and eager to receive a copy of the \"contract\" which we know you will have the courtesy to send us, I remain,\n\nYours very sincerely,\nS. Ste. Jeanne d'Arc, Principe,\nSister Ste. Jeanne d'Arc, Principal.\nOttawa, March 13th, 1947.\n\nReverend and Dear Sister:\n\nWe have your letter of the 11th instant with reference to the Lorette School.\n\nIt is noted that you are complying with the instructions contained in the Director's letter of March 4th.\n\nMr. Doucet of this Branch will visit your School at some period between now and the end of June and at that time he will discuss the whole situation with you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

In order to make a clear picture, I have asked the Superior to send me a list of all the pupils of school age that are not enrolled at the school but are enrolled in some Provincial school or other institution of learning and also those who are not attending any school whatever. I am inclined to believe that this situation can be remedied without increasing our educational facilities at this place. It must be remembered that Lorette is far advanced in the field of assimilation and I believe it would be a mistake to try to retard this improvement by isolating them in the field of education.\n\nI promised to return to this Reserve some time in the Spring in order to study this situation a little better and also to consider the problem of repairs to the roof of the school. This is an old building probably fifty years old and due to war conditions certain repairs were neglected. The leakage takes place in the valleys along the dormer windows. The main roof has been thoroughly repaired. It would even be necessary to repair the slanting portion as this building is a French roof style.\nI have asked the agent to clear the snow from these portions as soon after the snow falls as possible so as to prevent its seepage into the interior.\n\nThe teachers have drawn my attention to the difficulty of teaching several grades, especially the higher grades. In the senior room at Lorette grades, 4, 5, 6 and 7 are taught. I cannot agree that this is exceptionally heavy work. However, we know this is a problem that has to be solved in many of our schools and is one which has been met adequately in a number of them by the adaptation of methods different from the traditional methods used at some schools. The number enrolled in this school in each grade would not justify us making a new class in order to re-divide these pupils.

Sans doute, quand il s'agit du terrain de la r\u00e9serve, il est reconnu que les blancs ont le monopole des privil\u00e8ges.\n\nLorsqu'en 1890, M. Henry O'Sullivan, un blanc, a voulu obtenir la per-\nmission de prendre de l'eau du pouvoir de la Rivi\u00e8re St Charles qui\ncoule la r\u00e9serve, pour en approvisionner sa r\u00e9sidence, malgr\u00e9 que le D\u00e9parte-\nment e\u00fbt fix\u00e9 un loyer annuel de $15.00 avec un cautionnement pour\nle double de ce montant, le D\u00e9parte-\nment est revenu sur sa d\u00e9cision et a gratuitement & gratuitement\nmis ce pouvoir d'eau \u00e0 sa disposition,\n(Voir Correspondance inachev\u00e9e de 1887 &\n1890, N\u00b03322.)\n\nJ'ignore \u00e0 quelles conditions a \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9 en 1890 le bail de M.

La Correspondance sous le m\u00eame n\u00b0 est aussi rest\u00e9e inachev\u00e9e. Mais, je sais qu'alors M. Reid fit passer sur la R\u00e9serve un aiguilone pour son utilit\u00e9 personnelle et le D\u00e9partement s'empressa d'accepter la Condition d'une piastre par ann\u00e9e suffisante par les Chiefs (voir m\u00eame num\u00e9ro de correspondance).\n\nM. Hamel a occup\u00e9 pendant plusieurs ann\u00e9es non seulement la partie du rez-de-chauss\u00e9e dont je demande l'occupation, mais tout le rez-de-chauss\u00e9e & la moiti\u00e9 du 1er \u00e9tage o\u00f9 se trouve actuellement la nouvelle classe & tout le premier de l'\u00e9cole, sans que le D\u00e9partement, que je sache, n'y ait fait aucune objection.

(RG 10, Volume 6090, file 317-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI have received your letter and understand your concern regarding the condition of the school at the Village of Lorette. I am informed that the Department could not accommodate any additional students due to the school being overcrowded and unable to accommodate more pupils.\n\nI do not wish by these remarks to make personally as a Huron Indian, to force the hand of the Department in the matter, and had it not been for the emphatic refusal not called for by my request,\nI should have willingly kept silent. The request was so simple and so natural that I did not think it necessary to mention in my letter of the 16th Dec last that I had previously obtained from the chiefs of the tribe written permission to occupy without charge this half of the basement of the school the occupation of which would not harm anyone.\n\nThis refusal makes me more inclined to argue as to my quality as a Huron Indian than a full right to occupy a piece of land which belongs to me as much as to any one else in the tribe. There is no doubt as far as land on the reserve is concerned that it is recognized that white men have a monopoly of the privilege. When in 1870 Mr. Henry O'Sullivan, a white man, wished to obtain permission to use water power on the St. Charles River, which borders on the reserve, for the supply of his own house,\nin spite of the fact that the Department had fixed an annual rent of $15 or security for double that amount, the Department went back on its decision and graciously and gratuitously placed this water power at his disposal (see correspondence unfinished of 1879 and 1870, No. 3322).\n\nI am not aware what were the conditions on which a lease was issued in 1890 to Mr. Reid, another white man, to occupy the St. Charles River near his paper mill; it was a question at the time, and the chiefs decided to make him pay $50 a year. The correspondence under the same number has also remained unfinished. But I know that then Mr. Reid put an agreement through the reserve for his personal use and the Department at once accepted the condition of $50 a year suggested by the chief (see the same number of correspondence)\n\nDr. Hamel for several years\noccupied not only the part of the cellar for the use of the school, but the whole of the cellar and half of the ground floor where the class-room now is and all the garret, without the Department making any objection, as I am aware.\n\nMr. Howell was also a white man.\n\nThe proprietors of the Quebec & St. John Railway Company are also white men, since they without difficulty they obtained a remission of the damage done on the Guarantee Reserve by the passage of their railway, without ever obtaining either permission or authority from the Department.\n\nIt is probably also my quality of being an Indian which interferes in my receiving a reasonable salary an increase in which I asked for at the request of the missionary and the chiefs with the influence and recommendation of the most influential minister of the Quebec...\nGovernment.\n\nThis being us of the Huron property and of the right reserved by the Hurons I feel more than all the refusal which I can suffer.\n\nAnd if in my quality of being a Huron Indian I make these remarks, it is not with the object of making the Department go back on its decision that it has been expressed to me in its letter of the 20th Dec. I can disagree with this position, which is not one, since with the permission of the chief I have a right to occupy this basement except the satisfaction of the Department and provided that no inconvenience would result to the school. But I must remark that although only an uncivilized Indian, I understand perfectly what a refusal is and how far ones are given.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAntoine O.

Scott of the Department and an estimate for which I gave in my letter of the 7th Dec. I therefore enclose the account.\n\n1. The account of Mr. Ancilme\n   Cost for carpentry work is $28.30\n   instead of $25.00 on account of\n   the contractor being obliged to buy\n   four lengths of pine at 50\u00a2 each,\n   necessitated by the removal of the\n   stove to the middle of the room,\n   and moreover in order to prevent the\n   boys from breaking the windows,\n   at the request of the two teachers\n   I had placed across the lower\n   part of each window of six panels\n   strips of wood at a cost of $1.50 each;\nthen I had to have small shelves placed at the bottom of each blackboard on the walls for which the carpenter charged $1.50 extra expenses unforeseen and not included in the estimate sent to the Department which brings the account up to $28.50.\n\n2. Also the account of Mr. Joseph Clodeau, painter, is for $10.00 instead of $8.00, as at the time of making the contract it was impossible to foresee that in order to apply the varnish to the blackboards it would be necessary to give three coats and to polish twice with sand paper in accordance with the directions given on the can of varnish which the Department sent me and mentioned in my letter of the 19th Nov. 1875, No. 152/1875.\n\n3. The cleaning and whitewashing of the closets for the little girls cost $4.00 as mentioned in my letter of the 7th Dec.\n\nThere is also an account of $1.00\nfor cleaning and washing the classroom and furniture with linseed soap after the repair had been finished.\n\nI hope the Department will approve these several accounts, for the work has been done to my entire satisfaction.\n\n[Signature]\nHerman O.

As it now appears that such was not your intention, but that you merely required the space for storing empty boxes and such other things as you would not require to use frequently in connection with your business, there will be no objection to the permission sought being granted more especially as the Chiefs have given their sanction thereto.\n\nA.O.

It is therefore necessary that a drain should be made to conduct the water down the other side of the road.\n\nI visited the spot and obtained an estimate of the work to be done from a mechanic familiar with such work; he told me that the necessary work will cost at least $950. Further amount...\nthe closets, which are in a very bad condition, can be repaired, the broken windows on the ground floor put right, and the floor made proper for the house. For this purpose it would be necessary to dig a drain about 3 feet deep and 50 feet long under the public road, which is unadorned, and to build some at the openings of the drain, which should be enclosed in a box of brick plank.\n\nThe tender made seems to me to be very low considering the work to be done, which is urgent, the fall being already well on.\n\nWill the Department kindly authorize me in the matter as soon as possible.\n\nYours, etc.,\nR.

Grosdouis for lighting the stoves in the school of the Hurons of Lorette, putting up and taking down these stoves from the month of November to May just past, in accordance with instructions from the Department contained in its letter of the 7th December 1895.\n\nWill the Department, therefore, kindly settle this account.\n\nI have, &c.,\nAntoine O. Bastien,\nIndian Agent.\nSpecification for repairs to the schoolhouse in the Huron Village of Lorette.\n\nTo pull down the old roof and make a fresh roof and to cover it with cedar shingles and to make eight sky-lights and three windows in the gables with windows inside and outside, all the inside to be finished in one inch beaded pine boards, to make a partition in the middle with two thicknesses of boards and upright joists in the middle with a door in this partition. The other divisions shall be made with one inch boards separated into three or four at the request of the occupant, the necessary doors to be made and three or four wardrobes, all the walls up to the plastering to be filled with sawdust and three inches of sawdust to be placed on the ceiling and to lay boards over the small garret if need be, and a set of steps to mount to the small garret and an inclosed staircase from the first floor to the second.\n\nAlso was (not visible) on each flat, with a door through the wall.\n\nThe floor to be double, of pine one and a half inches over 27x47, and the chimney to be lengthened if need be in good brick.\n\nThe room used as a private apartment shall be divided to suit the taste of the occupant.\n\nWith a gallery 5x47 feet covered with boards and shingles supported by pillars and the lower part carved, the underneath of the roof to be ceiled, a stair at each end, and two coats of paint over the whole of the new lumber and one coat only on the old walls outside. A coat of black oil on the roof.\n\nThe windows and doors to be painted and the necessary things as well as the wardrobes.\n\nAll the work shall be well done and the\nwalls shall be repaired.\n\nThis work is estimated at $525.\n\nG. Giroux,\nMissionary Priest.\n\nIf the roof remains as it is, the price will be $425.\n\nIt would be much better to build another roof and so make a good class-room under this roof, and a better apartment for the teachers. This is the desire of the Chief.\n\nG. Giroux,\nMissionary Priest.\n\nAn immediate reply.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 4th July, 1900.\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nIn reference to Rev. Father Giroux's letter to Hon. Mr Fitzpatrick on the subject of repairs which he states should be made to the schoolhouse in the Huron Village of Lorette, I beg to say that plans and specifications showing the required repairs were received from Father Giroux yesterday. His estimate of the cost of the work is $250.00.\n\nI know of no funds that would be available for this purpose, as there is no provision in the estimates for any repairs to this school, and the capital of the Band, which amounts to only about $4000, would hardly stand this outlay, as the Indians already pay about $80.00 a year for supplies, fuel and inspection of the school.\n\nIn May last when it was decided to place the school under the control of the Sisters after the holidays, Mr Agent Bastien was directed to inform Father Giroux that the Department was not to be put to any additional expense in the way of salary or equipment.\nOTTAWA 5th July, 1900.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt on the 3rd instant of plans and specifications for the proposed repairs and alterations to the schoolhouse in the Baron village of Lorette, the cost of which you estimate will amount to $525.00.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department could not provide such an amount even if it were thought advisable to expend that sum in patching up an old building, as there is no grant for the purpose and the small amount of money which the Lorette Indians have to their credit would not stand such an outlay.\n\nI may add that when it was decided to place this school under the control of the Sisters, it was understood that the Department was not to be put to any additional expense in any way, and Mr Agent Bastien was directed to so inform you.\n\nThe Department recognizes, however, that some repairs are necessary to make the schoolhouse comfortable and in order to put the building in good repair.\n\nRev. Guil. Giroux\n\nMissionary,\n\nLorette, Que\nrepair, it will consent to the expenditure of the sum of $200.00 for this purpose on the distinct understanding that this amount is not to be exceeded and Mr Agent Bastien will be instructed to take the necessary steps to have this contribution expended to the best advantage.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\nOTTAWA, 5th July, 1900.\n\nSir,\n\nIn connection with previous correspondence relative to the transfer of the Lorette Indian school to the Sisters I beg to say that an application has been received from the Rev. Guill. Giroux of that place for the expenditure of the sum of $500.00 in repairing the present school building. The reverend gentleman forwarded plans and specifications of the proposed alterations with his application, which documents are sent herewith for your information.\n\nMr. Giroux has been informed that the Department could not provide such an amount, even if it were thought advisable to spend that amount in patching up an old building, as there is no grant for the purpose and the small amount of money which the Lorette Indians have to their credit would not stand such an outlay.\n\nHe was also informed that when it was decided to place this school under the control of the Sisters, it was on the understanding that the Department was not to be put to any additional expense in any way.\n\nThe Department recognizes, however, that some repairs will be necessary to make the schoolhouse habitable.\n\nA.

Cuil L'\u00c9toup pour les r\u00e9parations \u00e0 la maison d'\u00e9cole, mais qu'il \u00e9tait dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 allouer une somme de $250.00, en r\u00e9ponse, je dois vous dire que je viens de voir le R\u00e9v. M. L'\u00c9toup, que je n'ai pas vu depuis quelques temps et il m'a demand\u00e9 de vous \u00e9crire et de vous demander si le D\u00e9partement, qui consent \u00e0 accorder $250.00 cette ann\u00e9e, ne serait pas dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 octroyer une autre somme de $250.00 l'an prochain pour mettre la maison d'\u00e9cole dans...\ndans un \u00e9tat convenable.\n\nNous esp\u00e9rons M. Girou et moi qu'en \u00e9liminant la peinture qui \u00e9tait comprise dans le montant de $625.00, nous pourrions mettre cette b\u00e2tisse dans un \u00e9tat convenable et faire consentir le contracteur de la menuiserie \u00e0 attendre pour la balance qui serait allou\u00e9e l'an prochain. La raison qui nous fait faire cette demande, est que le toit est d\u00e9fectueux, tr\u00e8s bas, peu logeable et qu'il faudrait de toute n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 le remplacer par un comble fran\u00e7ais, afin de donner un logement confortable aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves et avoir deux classes suffisamment grandes et bien ventil\u00e9es pour le besoin hygi\u00e9nique de l'\u00e9cole.\n\nLe D\u00e9partement devrait donc en cons\u00e9quence, si possible, accorder la pr\u00e9sente demande en nous donnant un nouvel octroi de $300.00 l'an prochain.\n\nJ'attendrai votre r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 ce sujet pour vous transmettre une nouvelle sp\u00e9cification pour les travaux \u00e0 \u00eatre entrepris.\n\nJ'ai l'honneur d'\u00eatre,\n\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\n\nAntoine O.

McLean, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th inst., sending me for my information plans and specifications for repairs to the schoolhouse at Lorette and informing me that the Department cannot grant the sum of $525.00 asked for by the Rev. Guil. Giroux for repairs to the schoolhouse, but that it is prepared to provide the sum of $200.00.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that I have just seen Rev. Mr. Giroux, whom I was not able to see sooner as he had been away from Lorette, and he requested me to write to you and ask whether the Department, which has agreed to grant $200.00 this year, would not be prepared to grant another sum of $200.00 next year in order to put the school into proper condition.\n\nWe believe, Mr. Giroux and I, that by leaving out the painting, which was included in the amount of $525.00, we should be able to put this building in a proper condition and to get a contractor for the carpentry work to wait for the remainder which would be granted next year. The reason why we make this request is that the upper part of the house is defective, is very low; it is hardly habitable, and it is really necessary that it be replaced by a French roof in order to afford proper lodging for the Sisters and to have two class-rooms sufficiently large and properly ventilated for the health of the school.\nWill the Department therefore if possible accede to the present request by assuring us of the new grant of $200.00 next year. I await your reply on this point before sending you new specifications of the work to be undertaken.\n\nI have, &c.,\nAntoine O. Bastien,\nIndian Agent.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 4th August, 1900.\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nOn the 5th instant Mr Agent Bastien was informed that the Department would consent to the expenditure of the sum of $200 for the purpose of making the schoolhouse at Lorette habitable for the Sisters, who are to take charge after the summer holidays, and that this amount was not to be exceeded. He has written to say that the original estimate of Father Giroux of $525.00 could, by leaving out the painting, be reduced to $400.00, which Father Giroux is willing to expend, if the Department will agree to grant him another $200.00 for this purpose next year.\n\nBoth Father Giroux and Agent Bastien claim that $200.00 would not be sufficient while I understand that the Department was told that $200.00 properly expended would provide suitable accommodation.\n\nAs I have before pointed out there is no money specially available for this purpose and the grant of $200.00 would have to come out of the General School Vote, and if more is allowed it will have to come from the same source.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It was evident that that sum was not sufficient to meet the cost of doing the work completely, and the Department must have seen for itself on examination that that amount would not have been sufficient.\n\nIn the meantime, and almost immediately after the Department gave its consent to the expenditure of $200.00, The Honourable Solicitor General, Mr Fitzpatrick, on his way to Lorette, being conversant with the whole matter and devoted as always to the interests of his County and especially to the Huron tribe, wishing to give it a proof of his interest, generously personally subscribed the sum of $200.00 for the completion of the work so that on.\nhis special recommendation and after having come to an understanding with the Missionary the work was at once commenced for the sum of $400.00. This work was given to competent contractor, and will be completed shortly, the Department not having to expend more than $200.00 and getting first-class work.\n\nI believe it was the actual desire of the Solicitor General that the work should begin at once, especially as the time was short and as the contractor was able at the time to put on a large number of workmen.\n\nI should have liked to meet again The Honourable Solicitor General before giving this information to the Department, to which I hope everything will be agreeable.\n\nI have, &c.,\nAntoine O. Bastien,\nIndian Agent.\nI hereby certify that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed, and the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr Fitzpatrick, Solicitor General, amounting to $60.00 for painting the Lorette school building. Mr A. Bastien has certified to the correctness of the account. This work was done on the missionary's own responsibility.\n\nLast year when the Sisters took charge of this school certain repairs and alterations had to be made which cost about $400.00, $200 of which was contributed by the Department, the balance being paid out of Mr Fitzpatrick's own pocket. The original estimate amounted to $525.00, but by leaving out the painting it was reduced. There is no doubt that the building required painting for its preservation and to give it a suitable appearance and if the General School Vote for Ontario and Quebec can stand this charge of $50.00 I think it would be well to repay Father Giroux the amount expended by him.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs...

Il distribue cette eau et en a d\u00e9j\u00e0 distribu\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs familles sauvages de la R\u00e9serve \u00e0 condition de $6.00 par ann\u00e9e, et ces familles \u00e9tant oblig\u00e9es de faire faire les travaux d'installation \u00e0 leurs frais.\n\nJe m'\u00e9tais de me rencontrer avec M. le missionnaire, \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole des sauvages, et les religieuses institutrices nous ont fait remarquer, et c'est un fait que j'avais d\u00e9j\u00e0 constat\u00e9, qu'elles sont oblig\u00e9es d'aller chercher l'eau \u00e0 une bonne distance, ce qui leur est d'une tr\u00e8s grande inconv\u00e9nience, et leur cause beaucoup de mis\u00e8re pendant toute l'ann\u00e9e, surtout pendant les mauvais temps d'hiver, ainsi qu'aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves qui sont charg\u00e9s \u00e0 tour de r\u00f4le, par les institutrices, de charroyer l'eau pour l'usage des deux classes.\n\nJ'ai vu l'ouvrier qui pose les appareils d'aqueduc ici, et apr\u00e8s avoir mesur\u00e9 les distances et minutieusement calcul\u00e9, le co\u00fbt d'installation de l'eau dans la maison d'\u00e9cole serait entre $15.00 \u00e0 $20.00.\n\nJ'ai vu aussi le propri\u00e9taire de cet aqueduc, et comme faveur pour l'\u00e9cole, il consent \u00e0 accepter la somme de $4.00 par ann\u00e9e, au lieu de $6.00, [et ce n'est pas cher], qu'il charge \u00e0 toutes les familles sauvages de la R\u00e9serve.\nAu nom des religieuses, du missionnaire et en mon propre nom, je vous prie de vouloir bien autoriser de mettre l'eau dans l'\u00e9cole et de vouloir bien payer \u00e0 l'avenir $4.00 par ann\u00e9e pour cette eau.\n\nInutile de dire que l'installation de l'eau dans la maison d'\u00e9cole est une v\u00e9ritable n\u00e9cessit\u00e9, sans compter que \u00e7a ajoutera une valeur \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 plus grande que le co\u00fbt de l'installation.\n\nComme la saison est beaucoup avanc\u00e9e, et que les gros froids vont bient\u00f4t nous arriver, le D\u00e9partement voudra bien en cons\u00e9quence me donner, le plus t\u00f4t possible, l'autorisation requise, afin de faire faire les travaux avant que la terre ne soit trop gel\u00e9e.\n\nJ'ai l'honneur d'\u00eatre,\n\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent des sauvages.\nSir:\n\nOne of the members of the Huron Tribe constructed last year an aqueduct in the Lorette Village, thereby obtaining water from a great distance and at very considerable cost. He distributed this water and has since distributed it to several families of Indians of the Reserve on condition of paying $6.00 per year, and these families being obliged to have made the work of installation at their own cost.\n\nI have just met the Missionary at the Indian School and the reverend sisters told us, and this is a fact which I had already been aware of, that they are obliged to bring water from a good distance, which puts them to great inconvenience and gives them much trouble during the whole year, but above all during the bad winter weather, also that their pupils are sent in their turn according to the role by the teachers to bring the water for the use of the two classes.\n\nI have seen the workman who prepared this aqueduct and after having measured the distances and calculated minutely, the cost of installation of the water in the school-house will be between $15.00 and $20.00.\n\nI have also seen the owner of this aqueduct, and, as a favour to the school, he consented to accept the sum of $4.00 per annum, instead of $6.00 (and this is not dear), which he charges all the families of Indians of the Reserve.\n\nIn the name of the sisters, of the Missionary and of myself, I beg you to be good enough to authorize the putting of the water in the school and to be good enough to pay in future $4.00 per year for this water.\n\nIt is needless to say that the installation of the water in the school-house is a real necessity, not counting that this\nthis adds a greater value to the property than the cost of the installation.\n\nAs the season is well advanced and the severe weather will soon be upon us, the Department will be kind enough, therefore, to give me as soon as possible, the required authority so that I may have the work done before the ground becomes too much frozen.\n\nI have, &c.,\n\nAntoine O. Bastien,\nIndian Agent.\nPlease see letter under. Are there funds ($20.00) for putting the water into the school as well as the payment of $4.00 a year for its use? This would be much cheaper than providing a well.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

En cons\u00e9quence, je vous transmets pour paiement le compte d\u00e9taill\u00e9 en duplicata de M. William Montgomery, pour bois fourni aux deux classes de l'\u00e9cole, ainsi que celui aussi en duplicata de M. Charles Auclair, pour sciage de ce bois.\n\nLe montant de ces comptes comprend le bois d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9pens\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent, et celui qui reste pour tout le reste de l'hiver.\n\nJe profite de l'occasion de l'envoi de ces comptes, pour vous dire en r\u00e9ponse au dernier paragraphe de votre lettre du 24 avril dernier, que toute la quantit\u00e9 de bois mentionn\u00e9 au compte de l'ann\u00e9e derni\u00e8re, quoique d\u00e9taill\u00e9e en petites quantit\u00e9s, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 achet\u00e9e du m\u00eame coup, et il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 impossible de le payer \u00e0 meilleur march\u00e9. Le m\u00eame bois franc valait l'hiver dernier, $6.00 et m\u00eame $6.50 \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec. Je dois vous faire remarquer aussi que par les hivers longs que nous avons ici, nous sommes oblig\u00e9s de chauffer les classes pendant au-del\u00e0 de six mois, c'est-\u00e0-dire du milieu d'octobre \u00e0 la fin d'avril.\n\nJe dois vous faire remarquer de plus, comme vous pourrez le constater par le compte de l'ann\u00e9e derni\u00e8re, que la quantit\u00e9 de bois est un peu moindre cet hiver que l'hiver dernier, et que le co\u00fbt est de 50cts de moins par corde de bois franc et de 25cts de moins par corde d'\u00e9pinette. Par cons\u00e9quent, le chauffage des deux\nclasses cet hiver s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 pr\u00e8s de $11.00 de moins que l'hiver dernier.\n\nLe D\u00e9partement voudra bien en cons\u00e9quence solder ces comptes le plus t\u00f4t possible.\n\nJ'ai l'honneur d'\u00eatre,\n\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\n\nAgent des Sauvages.\nJeune Lorette, 15th January, 1904.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nSecretary, Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir:-\n\nIn your letter of the 2nd August, 1895, No. 152,188, relative to the Lorette School, you told me that: \"fuel needed for heating the school will be paid for by the Department\". Therefore, I transmit you for payment the detailed account in duplicate of Mr. William Montgomery for wood furnished to the two classes of the School, as well as that of Mr. Charles Auclair, also in duplicate, for sawing this wood.\n\nThe amount of these accounts includes the wood already used up to the present and that which remains for the remainder of the winter.\n\nI profit by the occasion of sending these accounts to inform you in reply to the last paragraph of your letter of the 24th April last that the whole amount of the wood mentioned in the account of last year, which was detailed in small quantities, was bought at the same time, and it was impossible to buy it cheaper. The same hardwood was worth last winter from $6.00 to $6.50 at Quebec. I have also to remark to you that on account of the long winters which we have here, we are obliged to heat the classes during upwards of six months, that is to say, from the middle of October to the end of April.\n\nI have further to remark, as you will see by the account for last year, that the quantity of wood is a little less this winter than last winter, and that the cost is 50 cts. less per cord for hardwood and 25 cts. less per cord for pine. Consequently, the heating of the two classes\nclasses this winter has been brought down to nearly $11.00 less than last winter.\n\nThe Department will be good enough, therefore, to settle these accounts as soon as possible.\n\nI have, etc.,\n\nAntoine O. Bastien,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 8th February, 1904.\n\nWith Cheques.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith cheques Nos. 445 and 446 in payment of Wm Montgomery's account for $40.75 and Charles Auclair's account for cutting wood\u2014$6.50.\n\nWith reference to official letter of the 24th April last referred to by you, I beg to inform you that the exception taken by the Department was not so much as to the price of the wood as to the quantity used. The Department would like to be informed as to whether this wood is used exclusively for the school and whether proper precautions are taken to prevent its being used for any other purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

But there are no waste-pipes, and the teachers, the Sisters, suffer much on account of this. These poor Sisters, as well as the missionary of the tribe, have made some representations to me in this matter, and I have seen that, in fact, it was necessary to make this addition. For this purpose I saw the plumber who put the water into the school, and he tells me that to put everything in order it will be necessary to have three enamel basins, three double \"S\", lead, one stop-cock and thirty-five feet of piping to take it away, and the labour.\n\nHe tells me that the whole will amount to $25. That is to say that the workman would furnish all the materials and would do the work for this sum.\n\nI hope that the Dept. will authorize me, as soon as possible, to have this work done, as the opening of the classes is approaching.\n\nI have etc.\n\nA.G.

D. de Lorette,\nHuron Village, 14 Oct., 1904.\n\nMr. Hector Verret,\nPrivate Secretary\nTo the Hon. Minister of Justice,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Hector:\n\nYou will find herewith a copy of the petition which we address at the same time to Mr. Pedley, Deputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs.\n\nI have had the honour of receiving at my boarding-house at Ludger Bastien's the Hon. Fitzpatrick accompanied by Mr. Pedley, who showed themselves well disposed towards obtaining for us the amount necessary to build a school in the Village, inasmuch as the present school is held in what was the former residence of the missionaries, restored and converted into a monastery and into classes for the Huron children.\n\nAs I am the resident missionary, I reclaim my residence, so that the Government will be obliged to grant us a new school, which, I hope, will be more comfortable and better situated than the present school.\n\nThe Minister suggested to me to inform you of and to send you a copy of the request in order that you will know its tenor and that you will look after and press its execution.\n\nI would like to believe that you will recall to Mr. Pedley his promise to send us a favourable reply within a few weeks so that we may commence the undertaking at once.\n\nCounting on your kindness, I hope that you will aid me in this request and that you will bring to the Deputy Superintendent's attention that this $2,000 should be taken from the subsidies voted each year for poor Indians and not from the funds of the Band as was intended by the Hon. Mr. Fitzpatrick and the Chiefs.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYours very humbly,\n\nP. A. Godbout, Priest,\nIn charge of N. D. de Lorette.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 19th October, 1904\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nWith reference to the petition hereunder from the Missionary and Chiefs of the Huron Tribe of Lorette for a grant of not less than $2,000.00 for the construction of a schoolhouse on the reserve, I beg to say that the evidence on file in this Department does not go to show that the present school building was intended for the presbytery or residence of the former missionaries. I find that in March 1879 Rev. Father Boucher, then missionary at Lorette, forwarded an estimate of the cost of the new schoolhouse which was valued at $1148.65 and required a further expenditure of some $250.00 to complete it. There was nothing said as to its being built for the missionary's residence.\n\nWhen the muns were given charge of this school in July 1900, it was understood that the Department was not to be put to any additional expense in any way, other than making certain needed repairs and it expended $250.00 for this purpose, which was supplemented by a gift of $200.00 from Hon. Mr Fitzpatrick.\n\nI do not see that the Department is under any obligation to relinquish this school building or erect a new one. It appears to me that the missionary is trying to get possession of the building for a presbytery, knowing that if successful, the Department will\nwill have to put up a new schoolhouse.\n\nThe building apparently belongs to the Band but as they have no funds to build a new schoolhouse and there are none available, I do not think they should be allowed to turn it over to the missionary for a residence. They have had a missionary on the reserve from time immemorial and it is rather late in the day to be looking for a residence for them.\n\nMartin Thomson\nOttawa, 27th Oct., 1904.\n\nSir,-\n\nI am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, enclosing petition from the Missionary and Chiefs of the Huron tribe of Lorette for a grant of not less than $2,000.00 for the construction of a schoolhouse on the reserve; and to say that the Department is looking into the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Secretary.\n\nA. O. Bastien, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nJeune Lorette, P.Q.\nOttawa, 28th Oct., 1904.\n\nMemorandum: Mr. Pedley.\n\nThe school at Lorette was erected by the Roman Catholic Church in 1879, in which year a grant of $100 was made by the Department towards its maintenance. Previous to that time the school had been in receipt of a sum of $120 per annum, first from the Old Province of Canada, and afterwards from the Province of Quebec, but was discontinued in that year. In 1880 the amount given by the Department was increased to $200 per annum to pay the salary of the teacher. This amount was recently increased to $300 a year. In 1900 the Department allowed $200 towards repairs to the building.\n\nThe Department considers it one of its duties to see that schools are provided on all Indian Reserves. When the funds of the band admit of it the necessary amount is taken therefrom; but when they have not sufficient funds the money is provided by vote of Parliament.\n\nAsst. Secretary.\nOttawa, 29th October, 1904.\n\nHon.

Ayant r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 la demande du Missionnaire et des Chefs, le D\u00e9partement a r\u00e9pondu, le 5 de Juin dernier, qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00eat \u00e0 autoriser la d\u00e9pense de la construction \"d'UNE NOUVELLE MAISON d'ECOLE\". Je ferai remarquer au D\u00e9partement que les Chefs ne demandent pas l'\u00e9rection \"d'UNE NOUVELLE MAISON d'ECOLE\", mais la construction d'une \u00e9cole, vu qu'il n'y en a pas.\n\nLa maison d\u00e9sign\u00e9e actuelle qui a servi pour l'\u00e9cole, \u00e9tait un Presbyt\u00e8re occup\u00e9 par les anciens missionnaires de la Tribu. Ce n'est que lorsque ces anciens missionnaires ont cess\u00e9 de r\u00e9sider sur la R\u00e9serve, qu'on s'est servi de ce Presbyt\u00e8re, comme maison d'\u00e9cole.\n\nOr, aujourd'hui, nous avons un missionnaire, indemnis\u00e9 par le Gouvernement du Canada, qui r\u00e9side sur la R\u00e9serve, et pr\u00e9tend ainsi que la Tribu, avoir le droit d'occuper ce Presbyt\u00e8re, c.-\u00e0-d. l'\u00e9cole o\u00f9 se tiennent les deux classes actuellement. Ce missionnaire est oblig\u00e9 depuis sa nomination, de pensionner dans une famille huronne du Village, et c'est un grand inconv\u00e9nient, comme vous devez le comprendre.\n\nC'est le d\u00e9sir de la Tribu que le missionnaire, le R\u00e9v.

Having repeated the\nrequest of the missionary and the chiefs, the Dept.\nreplied on June 5, last, that it could not authorize\nthe expense of the construction of a new school-house.\nI would remark to the Dept. that the Chiefs did not\nask for the erection of a new school-house, but for\nthe construction of a school, as they have not any.\nThe house which at present serves as a school was a\npresbytery occupied by the former missionaries of the\ntribe. It was only when these missionaries ceased to\nlive on the reserve that we used this presbytery as a\nschool-house.\n\nNow, to-day we have a missionary, paid by the\nGovernment of Canada, who lives on the reserve and who\nclaims, supported by the band, that he has the right to\noccupy this presbytery, that is, the school-house where\nthe two classes are at present held.\n\nThe missionary has been obliged since his\nappointment to board with a Huron family in the village.\nwhich, as you will understand, is a great inconvenience.\n\nIt is the desire of the band that the missionary, Rev. Mr. Godbout, take again immediately possession of his presbytery, that is, the present school-house, to reside there, and that the Dept. make haste to give the band the necessary funds to build a new school-house.\n\nAs the season is advancing, as the classes will open about Sept. 1, next, and as the present is the time to build this school, I hope that it will be built during the present holidays, and that the Dept. will grant the very just request of the band.\n\nI have, etc.,\nA.O.

The following were the reasons:\n\n1. That school is held in the house and on the land belonging to the church of the band and formerly the residence of the missionaries.\n\n2. That I am at present the resident missionary, and have no house.\n\n3. That the chiefs and A\nclaim this land and house for a presbyterian.\n\n4. That therefore the Dept. ought to authorize the building of a new school-house in order to give up the church property; and to obtain a vote of the money necessary for this purpose as soon as possible in order that school may open in the month of September.\n\n5. That we have the promise of the Minister of Justice, our Member, and of yourself, Rev. Padley, who accompanied the minister to the place a few weeks before the election last autumn, that the Govt. would vote us this money during the present session, as this work is urgent.\n\nIn a petition from the undersigned to the Dept. in October last, and advised by yourself and the Hon. Mr. Fitzpatrick, the petitioners asked for the sum\nof $2500; and the Minister informed us some days before the election that the Govt. would vote us $1500. Besides he declared to me in two personal letters that that was understood between himself and the Govt.\n\nNow it is already late, there remain only two months for us to conclude school-house, the session is drawing to a close, and both the Minister and the Dept. keep silent about all our claims.\n\nHowever I beg to inform the Dept. that the present school no longer conforms to the requirements of health (1) because the height of the ceiling is only 8 feet; while the law requires 10 feet at least; (2) because the cabinets & closets, opening into the class-rooms, are a source of pestilence to the children and to the teachers and are a veritable danger to their health.\nOn account of all these reasons and others, we beg the Dept. to be diligent in rendering us justice, and to send an inspector, if it thinks necessary, to be convinced of these facts; otherwise at the risk of seeing this school closed by the Board of Health and the Indian children deprived of their school this fall.\n\nAs you see, sir, this is not altogether a favour that we ask as an act of justice on the part of the Govt.\n\nYours truly,\n\nP.

The missionary and the Chiefs claim that they were promised a new school building and that the one now in use was originally a presbytery for the missionary and is required by him for a residence, and that it is not adapted for its present use. The Agent also calls attention to the need of a new schoolhouse. The question was last brought up on the 31st May last, when you decided that the Department was not prepared to authorize the expenditure, and the Agent was so informed on the 5th ulto.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

In reply I beg to say that there appears to be some misunderstanding in regard to what took place when I was at Lorette last fall in regard to the sale of the Quanante Arpents as what I did say was that if Government would sanction the expenditure I would prefer to put up a new school building to a presbytery, but I made no promise that a school house would be built. So far no funds have been provided for a school building.

Cependant votre pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseur, l'Hon. Sifton a pr\u00e9tendu que c'\u00e9tait assez, et a fait r\u00e9gler cette somme trop modeste par le d\u00e9partement malgr\u00e9 l'Hon. ministre de la Justice, notre d\u00e9put\u00e9, et les chefs hurons qui auraient voulu faire accorder d'avantage.\n\nQuand il s'est agi du logement, notre d\u00e9put\u00e9, l'Hon. Fitzpatrick et Mr. Peddy, d\u00e9put\u00e9 surintendant des affaires sauvages, se sont rendus sur les lieux, avant les \u00e9lections du mois de Novembre dernier.

Or l'\u00e9cole actuelle n'est pas autre chose que la r\u00e9sidence des anciens missionnaires; comme elle n'\u00e9tait pas habit\u00e9e, elle fut restaur\u00e9e et convertie en \u00e9cole; elle se trouve attenante \u00e0 l'\u00e9glise, plac\u00e9e sur le terrain de l'\u00e9glise, par cons\u00e9quent la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'\u00e9glise.\n\nEt aujourd'hui, moi comme missionnaire r\u00e9sidant, je r\u00e9clame cette maison pour en faire ma r\u00e9sidence, puisque je n'en ai pas et ne puis en avoir d'autres.\n\nUne p\u00e9tition a \u00e9t\u00e9 adress\u00e9e au d\u00e9partement au mois d'octobre dernier demandant $2000.00 pour construire cette \u00e9cole destin\u00e9e \u00e0 l'instruction des enfants hurons; r\u00e9ponse fut donn\u00e9e que l'on consid\u00e9rerait la chose; l'Hon.

Mr. Oliver,\nMinister of the Interior,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nAlthough I have not the honour of knowing you personally and although you have not long occupied the honourable position of Minister, nevertheless, your nomination has made you known and the news of your election has been well received, not only by the French Canadians and Roman Catholics of Quebec but by your compatriots and co-religionists of your own province. Permit a humble and poor priest to present you his most sincere congratulations and to offer his respects.\n\nI may now bring to your attention the subject of this letter.\n\nI was appointed by the church authorities as resident missionary to the Hurons of Lorette and have occupied this position since the month of October, last. Up to that time the services in the Huron church were conducted by the cur\u00e9 of the neighbouring parish, but as this service could no longer be continued, and it having, moreover, been declared imperfect and insufficient by those who had a right to say, the council of the tribe asked for and obtained a resident priest, not only to administer to their spiritual wants but also to preserve good order and public morality, but this was done on the two following conditions:\n\n1. That there would be given to this missionary a salary of not less than $500 or $600 per year.\n2. That he would be suitably lodged.\nSince that time a petition was sent to the Dept. asking for this salary; and it was only after several months that the amount of $200 was granted, to be added to the 50 pounds sterling which was formerly paid to the former non-resident missionary.\n\nYou will admit, Sir, that a salary of $425 is quite insufficient to keep a house, furnish it and maintain it. However, your predecessor, the Hon. Mr. Sifton claimed that it was sufficient and fixed this sum, notwithstanding the Honourable, the Minister of Justice, our member, and the Huron Chiefs, who wished to grant more.\n\n2. When the matter of lodging came up, our member, the Hon. Mr. Fitzpatrick, and Mr. Pedley, the Deputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs, went to the place before the elections in the month of Nov., last. They declared that the government could furnish nothing for churches or presbyteries, but that it could and ought to for the schools. Now, the present school is nothing but the residence of the former missionaries; as it was not used they fixed it up and turned it into a school-house; it is joined to the church, placed on the land of the church and, consequently, the property of the church. And now I, an resident missionary, claim this house to make of it a residence, as I have no residence and cannot get any other.\n\nA petition was addressed to the Dept. in the month of October, last, asking for $2,000 to construct a school intended for the teaching of the Huron children; the reply was given that the matter would be considered. the Hon. Mr. Fitzpatrick promised us that there would be voted for us out of the funds of the government not less\nthan $1500 during the last session; and now Mr. Pedley tells us that nothing was done.\n\nThe Dept. has, therefore, acted unjustly towards us, and I am confident, Sir, that you will render justice to us now,\n\nTo assure yourself of the justice of my request and of the truth of what I have said, I refer you to the Hon. Charles Fitzpatrick, our member, and to the department, where you will find documents in support thereof.\n\nBesides, the house where the classes are held does not comply with the hygienic conditions required by the government and the board of health; because in place of 10 feet between the floors there is only 8 and because the water-closets open into the class-rooms are a source of pestilence. The Dept. has already been notified of this but has not replied.\n\nFinally, the work of repairs that are necessary and the remuneration that the Church will require to allow the classes to be held there in the future, since it needs the building as a lodging for its missionary, will amount to more than the sum asked for to construct a new building.\n\nYours faithfully,\nP.A. Godbout, Priest.\nMissionary.\nOTTAWA, 31st August, 1905\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant calling the attention of the Minister to the necessity for the erection of a new schoolhouse on the Lorette reserve; and in reply I beg to say that your letter will be brought to his attention when he returns to Ottawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary\n\nRev.

On a seulement pas daign\u00e9 y r\u00e9pondre. J'en conclus qu'il y a plus que de la n\u00e9gligence, il y a aussi de la mauvaise volont\u00e9. Je le r\u00e9p\u00e8te, c'est un \u00e9tat de choses intol\u00e9rable.\n\nLes cabinets d'aisance qui sont loin d'\u00eatre des W.C., sont remplis depuis des ann\u00e9es; ouvrant sur les classes, ils y explent une peste continue; \u00e0 certaines heures il faut interrompre les classes et renvoyer les enfants pour n'\u00eatre pas asphyxi\u00e9s. Il n'y a aucun ventilateur autre que les fen\u00eatres qu'on ne peut pas toujours laisser ouvertes.\n\nDe plus, au lieu d'avoir la hauteur de 10 pieds, du plancher au plafond, il n'y a que 8 1/2 pieds.\n\nAh si c'\u00e9tait une \u00e9cole protestante, on n'y tol\u00e9rerait pas cet \u00e9tat de chose huit jours, et ici, il y a des ann\u00e9es que cela dure.\n\nJe suis oblig\u00e9 d'acheter de la chaux pour d\u00e9sinfecter un peu, et je suppose que lorsqu'il s'agira de faire payer cette d\u00e9pense le gouvernement va s'objecter?\n\nSi on voulait \u00eatre juste, au d\u00e9partement, je voter un salaire convenable et me permettre de prendre l'\u00e9cole actuelle pour un presbyt\u00e8re, puisque c'est l\u00e0 l'ancienne r\u00e9sidence.\nr\u00e9sidence des missionnaires; si l'on d\u00e9cidait enfin de voter les $2000 ou au moins $1500 pour b\u00e2tir une \u00e9cole convenable et autres encore au bien \u00eatre de ces pauvres enfants. Mais quand on a le salaire ridicule de $425 p. par ann\u00e9e, qu'on est oblig\u00e9 de chercher des pensions ou des loyers qu'on ne peut pas toujours trouver, c'est difficile d'\u00eatre bien lib\u00e9ral.\n\nVoil\u00e0 pourtant la position que me fait le gouvernement qui a des millions provenant des r\u00e9serves sauvages et dont il devrait employer au moins une petite partie \u00e0 leur profit.\n\nJe prie le d\u00e9partement de voir \u00e0 ce que la question de notre \u00e9cole se r\u00e8gle o\u00f9 je me verrai oblig\u00e9 de faire intervenir les officiers du bureau de sant\u00e9 ou d'hygi\u00e8ne.

No one has condescended to reply. I conclude from this that there is more than negligence; there is also unwillingness. I repeat it, that the state of affairs is intolerable. The privies, which are far from being water-closets, have been full for some years; opening into the class-rooms, they are a continual pest; at certain times it becomes necessary to stop the classes and send the children out in order that they will not be asphyxiated. There is no ventilator other than the windows, which cannot always be left open.\n\nMoreover, instead of being 10 ft. from floor to ceiling it is only 8\u00bd ft.\n\nBut, if this were a Protestant school, this condition of affairs would not be tolerated for a week, and here it has gone on for some years.\n\nI am obliged to purchase lime to disinfect a little, and I suppose that when it is asked to pay for this expenditure the government will object. If the Dept. wished to be just to me it would vote me a reasonable salary and permit me to take the present school for a presbytery, since it is the former residence of the missionaries.\nIf it is decided finally to vote the $2000, or at least $1500, to build a suitable school-house, I shall be able to meet these expenses and still others for the welfare of these poor children. But when one has the ridiculous salary of $425 and when one is obliged to look for his board or lodgings where it cannot always be found, it is difficult to be very liberal.\n\nThat is the position in which I am put by the government, which has some millions coming from Indian reserves, and of which it ought to employ at least a little for the benefit of the Indians.\n\nI ask the Dept. to see that this question of our school is settled, otherwise I shall be obliged to have the officers of the board of health intervene.\n\nA reply is urgent.\n\nYour humble servant,\nP.

General.\n\nRE Application for New School House, Lorette.\n\nOn the 15th. October 1904 Mr. Agent Bastien forwarded a petition from the missionary and chiefs of the Huron tribe of Lorette asking for a grant not less than $2,000 for the construction of a school on their reserve within about one hundred feet of the Indian Church or Chapel. They claim that the building in which the school is at present held is the Presbytery or residence of the former missionaries, and that as a resident missionary has been appointed it is intended as a residence, and that it is necessary to have a school or convent in which to lodge the teachers who instruct the Huron children.\n\nAs I pointed out in my memorandum of the 19th. October 1904, the evidence on file does not go to show that the present school building was intended as a Presbytery or residence of the former missionaries. It was originally built for a school house, and when the nuns took charge in July 1900, certain repairs were made to provide quarters for them in this building. The building was put by the Rev. Father Boucher in 1879 to replace one built by him in 1869. The Department contributed towards the erection of both these buildings, which it understood were put up as school-houses, no mention being made of their being intended for a Presbytery or residence for the missionary, although the present building had provision for living quarters. The petition was acknowledged and the Agent was informed that the matter would be enquired into, and on November 18th., 1904, he was again informed that the matter was still under consideration and as soon as a decision was reached he would be advised.\n\nOn the 5th. June, 1905, Mr. Agent Bastien, who had called\ncalled the Department's attention to this application again was informed that the Department was not at present prepared to authorize the expenditure necessary for this purpose. On July 5th, the missionary and chiefs again brought the question of a new school house at Lorette to the Department's attention, and the Agent also wrote on the same day pointing out the need of a new school house. The missionary was written to and informed that there appeared to be some misunderstanding in regard to what took place when you were at Lorette last Fall regarding the sale of the Quarentes Arpentes, and he was told that what you did say was that, if the Government would sanction the expenditure, you would prefer to put up a new school building to a Presbytery; but that you made no promise that a new school house would be built. He was also informed that no funds had been provided for the school building, and, that as funds were not available, the Department could not at present undertake the construction of a building. The missionary again wrote direct to the Minister on the 4th August, and on the 21st of that month, he was informed that his letter would be brought to the Minister's notice when he returns to Ottawa. He writes under the date of September 20th, complaining of the unsanitary state of the present building. I think the Department should improve the sanitary condition of this building. In the meantime, the question of granting funds for a new school house is under consideration.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

General:\n\nRE: School house at Lorette:\n\nThe agitation for a new school house at Lorette commenced almost immediately after the appointment of the Reverend Father Godbout as missionary, who succeeded the Rev. Father Giroux, on the 1st. October last year with an increase in salary of $200; he is now paid $425.00, $200.00 of which is paid from the funds of the band, and $225.00 from the Province of Quebec fund.\n\nWhen the present building was repaired in 1900 at the time the nuns were placed in charge of this school, it was understood that the Department was not to be put to any additional expense in any way, and I do not think the Department is under any obligation to relinquish this school building and erect a new one so that the missionary may get possession of the building for a Presbytery, as the current correspondence on file does not bear out Father Godbout's contention that it was originally put up for that purpose.\n\nIf, however, the Department decides to erect a new school house, there will be no objection to providing quarters for the resident teachers, whether nuns or lay teachers, as it is making similar provision in most of the new school houses which are being erected, owing to the difficulty experienced in teachers obtaining suitable quarters on the Reserve.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Church properties held by the R.C. missionaries on the reserves in Lower Canada previous to the conquest were retained by them without their right to the same being questioned.\n\nGrants were made both by the Indian Department and the Provincial Government towards the erection\nerection of church and school buildings; but these grants were not held to constitute a claim to ownership of the buildings, although it would, it is thought, lay the Church authorities under the obligation to use them for the purpose for which they were stated to be intended when the grants were asked for and made.\n\nThere is no doubt but that the building erected in 1869 was built to be used for a school, and the grants made to it were on that understanding. In the correspondence regarding it the missionary always referred to it as a school house. In a letter of the 23rd March, 1876, the Rev. Mr. Boucher said, - \"I have insured the school house for $800 with the Farmers Insurance Co. I paid $15.00 premium for three years for the policy. The house is built on the village land and belongs to the village.\n\n\"Will the Department be good enough to pay for the insurance, the village being extremely poor. They cannot contribute anything to the support of the school.\"\n\nIn reply Mr. Boucher was informed that the Department could not pay more than $100 per annum towards the school building in question.\n\nAsst.

He stated that at present the missionary is obliged to board in a private residence which is inconvenient for him; and that it would appear that the Department was not willing to carry out the understanding had with the Minister of Justice and the Reverend Father Godbout, and he asks that the Department would be good enough to inform him of its intentions in order that he may communicate them to the missionary and chiefs. This letter was replied to on the 5th. of June, when the Agent was informed that the Department was not at present prepared to authorize the expenditure necessary for this purpose.\n\nMr. Agent Bastien wrote the Department on the 5th. of July in the name of the chiefs referring to the correspondence which had already taken place in reference to the school-house in the village, and calling attention to the wording of the Department's letter of the 5th. June last that it could not authorize the expenditure necessary for the construction of a new school-house, Mr. Bastien saying \"The chiefs did not ask for the erection of a new school-house but for the construction of a school as they have not any. The house which at present serves as a school is the Presbytery occupied by the former missionaries of the tribe: it was only when these missionaries ceased to live on the Reserve that they used this Presbytery as a school-house. Now to-day we have a missionary paid by the Government of Canada who lives on the Reserve and claims, supported by the band, that he has the right to occupy the\n\nPresbytery\n\"Presbytery, i.e., the school-house where the two classes\nare at present held. The Missionary has been obliged since\nhis appointment to board with a Huron family in the village\nwhich, as you will understand, is a great inconvenience.\nHe continues by saying that \"it is the desire of the band\nthat the missionary, Mr. Godbout, should immediately\nresume possession of his Presbytery, i.e., the present\nschool-house, to reside there; and that the Department\nshould take immediate steps to provide the necessary funds\nto build a school-house.\" He calls attention to the fact\nthat the season is advancing and hopes that the building\nwill be put up during the present holidays and that the\nDepartment will grant the very just request of the band.\"\n\nOn the same date Father Godbout, the Grand Chief,\nand five other Chiefs wrote the Department on this subject\ngiving the following reasons why a grant should be made.\n\n\"You are aware that since the Month of October last we, the\nHuron Chiefs and I, have written more than once in regard\nto a grant of a certain sum of money to build a new school-\nhouse in the village. The following are the reasons:\n\n1: That school is held in the house and on the land be-\nlonging to the Church of the band and formerly the residence\nof the missionaries.\n\n2: That I am at present the resident missionary and I\nhave no house.\n\n3: That the Chiefs and I claim this land and house for a\nPresbytery.\n\n4: That, therefore, the Department ought to authorize the\nbuilding of a new school-house in order to give up the\nChurch property; and to obtain a vote of the money necessary\nfor this purpose as soon as possible in order that school\nmay open in the Month of September.\n\n5: That we have the promise of the Minister of Justice,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6090, file 317-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\npoor copy\nour Member, and of yourself, Mr. Pedley, who accompanied\nthe Minister to the place a few weeks before the election\nlast Autumn, that the Government would vote us this money\nduring the present session, as this work is urgent. In a\npetition from the undersigned to the Department in October\nlast, and advised by yourself and the Hon. Mr. Fitzpatrick,\nthe petitioners asked for the sum of $2,000; and the\nMinister informed us some days before the elections that\nthe Government would vote us $1,500. Besides he declared\nto me in two personal letters that that was understood\nbetween himself and the Government. Now it is already late,\nthere remain only two months for us to build this school-\nhouse, the session is drawing to a close, and both the\nMinister and the Department keep silent about all our claims.\nMoreover, I beg to inform the Department that the present\nschool no longer conforms to the requirements of health:\n(1st) Because the height of the ceiling is only 8\u00bd feet;\nwhile the law requires 10 feet at least;(2nd) Because the\nlatrines or closets, opening into the class rooms, are a\nsource of pestilence to the children and to the teachers\nand are a veritable danger to their health. On account of\nall these reasons and others, we beg the Department to be\ndiligent in rendering us justice, and to send an inspector,\nif it thinks necessary, to be convinced of these facts;\notherwise at the risk of seeing this school closed by the\nBoard of Health and the Indian children deprived of their\nschool this fall. As you see, Sir, that this is not as much\na favour we ask as an act of justice on the part of the\nGovernment.\"\n\nThe Department replied to the Rev. Father Godbout\non the 25th. of July informing him that there appeared to\nbe some misunderstanding in regard to what took place when\nthe undersigned was at Lorette last Fall regarding the sale\nof the Guarante Arpents: as what the undersigned did say\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6090, file 317-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nwas that if the Government would sanction the expenditure, he would prefer to put up a new school building to the Presbytery, but he made no promise that the school-house would be built. He was also informed that so far no funds had been provided for the school building, and that as no funds were available for the purpose, the Department could not undertake the construction of the building.\n\nThe Rev. Father Godbout wrote to the Minister on the 4th of August informing him that he was appointed by the Church authorities as resident missionary to the Hurons of Lorette, and that he had occupied this position since the month of October last. Previous to that time the services in the Huron Church were conducted by the Cur\u00e9 of the neighboring parish; but, as these services could no longer be continued, having been declared imperfect and insufficient by those who had the right to say, the tribe asking for and obtaining a resident priest, not only to administer to the spiritual wants but also to preserve good order and public morality. This appointment was made on the following conditions:- 1st. That there would be given to this mission a salary of not less than $500 or \u00a3600 a year. 2nd: That he would be suitably lodged.\n\nSince his appointment Father Godbout states that a petition was sent to the Department asking for this salary and it was only after several months that the amount of $200.00 was granted to be added to the fifty pounds, sterling, which was formerly paid to the non-resident missionary.\n\nFather Godbout calls attention to the fact that a salary of $425.00 is quite insufficient to keep a house, furnish and maintain it, although the late Minister claimed that it was sufficient and fixed the amount, notwithstanding that the Minister of Justice and the Huron Chiefs desire the larger grant.\n\nFather Godbout states that when the matter of lodging\nlodging came up, the Hon. Mr. Fitzpatrick and the undersigned went to the place before the elections in the month of November last and declared that the Government could furnish nothing for churches or Presbyteries, but that it could and ought to for the schools. He states that the present school is nothing but the residence of the former missionaries; as it was not usedm they fixed it up into a school-house. It is joined to the church, placed on the land of the church, and consequently the property of the Church: and now he, as resident missionary, claims the house as a residence, as he has no residence and cannot get any other.\n\nHe refers to the petition addressed to the Department in October last asking for $2,000 to build a school for Huron children and to the Department's reply that it would be considered. He states that the Hon. Mr. Fitzpatrick promised that not less than $1,500 would be voted during last session, and that he is now told that nothing is to be done. He claims that the Department has acted unjustly and seeks fair treatment. He refers to the Hon. Mr. Fitzpatrick and to the Department in confirmation of the truth of what he has stated. He also calls attention to the building which does not comply with the hygienic conditions required by the government and the Board of Health, the ceilings only being eight feet high in place of ten feet, and the closets opening into the class rooms being a source of pestilence.\n\nIn conclusion he says that the repairs are necessary, and the remuneration that the Church will require for allowing the classes to be held there in future, since it needs the building as a lodging for the missionary, will amount to more than the sum asked for to construct a new building.\n\nThe Rev. Father Godbout was, on the 21st August last\nlast, informed that his letter would be brought to the Minister's attention when he returns to Ottawa.\n\nThe foregoing is a summary of the correspondence which has taken place regarding the application for a grant of $2,000 for the erection of a new school-house at Lorette.\n\nWith regard to the building at present used as a school-house, the undersigned begs to say that the papers on file relating to the erection of the building do not bear out the contention that it was built for a Presbytery. This building was put up in 1869 by the Rev. Father Boucher at an estimated cost of $1,148.65. The Department contributed an annual grant of $100.00 from 1868 to recoup the missionary for the expenditure on the building which was referred to in the correspondence as the school building, the last $100.00 being sent him on the 16th. of July 1880, in which year an annual grant of $200.00 was passed by Order-in-Council 15th. May 1880 as a contribution towards the teachers' salary which was increased to $300.00 on the 1st. of July 1895, which is the amount now granted.\n\nIn 1900 when the nuns took charge of this school in July, it was understood that the Department was not to be put to any additional expense in any way other than making certain needed repairs, and it expended $250.00 for this purpose which was supplemented by a gift of $200.00 from the Hon. Mr. Fitzpatrick.\n\nRespectfully Submitted,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6090, file 317-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nJ.D.

J'ai eu plusieurs conf\u00e9rences avec les chefs et le missionnaire. Nous avons fait examiner les lieux par un ouvrier, et nous en sommes venus \u00e0 la conclusion que des am\u00e9liorations temporaires co\u00fbteraient tr\u00e8s cher. Ainsi, il faudrait enlever les closets de l'endroit o\u00f9 elles sont. Elles se trouvent dans un petit appentis en dehors, mais attach\u00e9s \u00e0 la maison d'\u00e9cole du c\u00f4t\u00e9 Est.

I have had several conferences with the chiefs and the missionary. We have had the place examined by a workman and we have come to the conclusion that temporary improvements would cost very much. For instance, it would be necessary to move the closets from where they are. They are in a small shed behind, but attached to the school-house on the east side. The door into the closets is in the school-house. To make satisfactory repairs and render the place sanitary, it would be necessary to remove this shed where the closets are. Now, if it is removed there is no other place to put it, for the cemetery is at the north, the highway on the south, the Sisters' garden on the east and the church on the west.\n\nTo avoid the evil odors from the closets, it would be necessary to remove them from their present place, and there is no other place, as I have just shown.\n\nThe Missionary and the Chiefs have on several occasions, through my correspondence, under the present number, asked the Dept. for the necessary money to build a school-house. The Dept. has never given these gentlemen a satisfactory reply. They ask me to bring it before the Dept. again, as this would be the only means of overcoming all the difficulties, the least of which is no repair to the closets.\n\nSeeing the high cost of a new closet and bringing the water to it, the Missionary and the Chiefs think it proper to draw the attention of the Dept. again to what I have just written and hope for a favourable reply.\n\nI have the\n\nA.O.

McLean, Esq.,\nSecretary, Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th Oct. last with regard to the unsanitary condition of the closets of the Lorette School, as well as a plan for the construction of a new closet. In reply I have to inform you that on account of want of space near the school-house for the construction of an outside closet, in compliance with your plan, -as was explained to you by my letter of the 18th October last, the Missionary had decided, but before the receipt of your letter and of your plan,- to have a closet with water attachment on the inside of the school. The works were however commenced when I received your instructions and as soon as the construction of this water-power closet shall be finished, the accounts will be sent to the Department for payment.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAntoine O. Bastien,\nIndian Agent.\nMemorandum:\n\nDeputy Superintendent General,\n\nI have been considering the best means of financing the project of a new school house on Lorette Reserve. This Band has now about $8,600.00 at credit or capital account which bears interest at three per cent. When full payments for the Roomont Reserve shall have been made, the full amount of capital will be about $17,000.00. At three per cent., this will give them an annual revenue of $510.00. Against this revenue they have pledged an annual payment of $200.00 to their Priest, and the balance which remains is fully needed to provide for the maintenance of insane members of the Band and casual relief charges. If we take from the capital any considerable amount, it will of course weaken the interest. I think, however, that the Band could afford to assist in meeting the expense of building the school house to the extent of half the cost. I think that $1,500.00 or at the most $2,000.00 should provide a building well adapted for the purpose and with proper modern conveniences. If the Band consents to pay half the expense, we can provide the balance from current appropriations without asking the House for a special vote. The building will not be finished before the 30th of June next so that I will be able to divide our share of the expenditure between two fiscal years. I do not think we could afford to pay the whole cost of the school house without a special appropriation; and, having due consideration for the circumstances of these Indians, I do not think the Government ought to be asked to meet the whole cost. Although it is our policy to build school houses where they are required and to keep them in good repair, we always expect the\nthe Indian funds to bear the cost if they can do so without impoverishing the funds; and throughout the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec a large majority of the school buildings are the property of the Indians having been erected from their own capital.\n\nOttawa, 1st December, 1924\n\nAccountant.\nIndian Affairs.\n\nTo Maurice Bastien\n\nDATE | AMOUNT\n---|---\n\nPour avoir fourni l'eau de son aqueduc \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole de la R\u00e9serve des sauvages de Lorette, du 1er D\u00e9cembre 1904 au 1er D\u00e9cembre 1905. $4.00\n\nFor supplying water from his aqueduct to the school in the Lorette reserve from Dec. 1, 1904, to Dec. 1, 1905. $4.00\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\n[Signature]\n\nAntoine D.

The work has even been commenced when I received your instructions and as soon as it shall be finished, the accounts will be sent to the Dept. for payment.\" Accordingly I transmit herewith for payment, below from the persons who worked at the closet. You will find appended to the one from Mr. J. D. Giroux, number, although he did the work under contract, a list of the materials that he furnished, and in this list the amount of his work is mentioned.\nIt was for the information of the Dept. that I asked them for this list, because at first sight his account appeared high to me.\n\nThe reason I did not send you these accounts sooner was because I could not get the same from Mr. O. Fiset, and sooner as he was absent from Lorette immediately after finishing the carpentry work of these closets.\n\nWill the Dept. kindly settle these accounts as soon as possible, as the workmen tell me they have urgent need of the money.\n\nJ.

General,-\n\nThe condition of the closets at the Indian school at Jeune Lorette, north of the city of Quebec, was brought to the attention of the Department on the 18th October last. On the 28th a plan was sent for the construction of two new buildings. Before this arrived \"the Missionary\" had decided to have a closet with water attachment constructed inside of the school, and the works were commenced before the Agent received our instructions. At that date, the 21st, he stated the accounts would be sent here for payment.\n\nWe have now received the accounts amounting to $150.63, or over twice the cost of the buildings authorized by the Department.\n\nThere is no doubt apparently that the closet now built is a much better arrangement than the one authorized by the Department. It, however, is rather a bad precedent for anyone to take upon himself the responsibility of having any work done of this nature without the authority of the Department. I beg to submit the matter for your consideration. I think also the Agent is to blame in not having stopped, or at least protested against such work being undertaken without the authority of the Department.\n\nChief Surveyor.\nOttawa, 31st March, 1906.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 28th ultimo enclosing accounts amounting to $130.63 for the construction of a water closet at the Indian school, Jeune Lorette, and also with reference to your letter of the 31st November last, I have to say that you should not have allowed any expense to be incurred in this work greater than would have been incurred by the construction of the water closets authorized by the Department.\n\nThese closets could have been erected for $50. each, that is $60. for the both, less than one half the cost that has been incurred. You are probably aware that the fund from which payment of this account is to be drawn is the interest on the capital of the Hurons of Lorette. The balance available from this interest account, after paying the usual drafts on it, will not admit for a long time the payment of the above mentioned sum of $130.63. I have to ask you to inform me how it is proposed that this money shall be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O. Bastien, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nJeune Lorette, Que.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Godbout, missionary, seemed favourable to the project, but said that at the time there were no funds available.\n\nThe Chiefs asked me to call the attention of the Deptt. to the subject, and as Parliament is in session, it would be an easy matter to place in the estimates about \u00a31,500.00 for\nthe building of this school.\n\nThe Hon. Mr. Fitzpatrick, who is the Member for the county and a devoted friend of the Board, might give you his opinion as to the necessity for the school in question and also to the opportunity of placing it in the estimation of the Dept. of the aboriginals.\n\nThe Chiefs know that the Hon. the Minister of Justice was strongly in favour of this necessary project, owing to the need of our missionary College in the present school.\n\nThe Chiefs will be greatly pleased if the Dept. decides in the affirmative and they receive a favourable reply from the Dept.\n\nYours &c.,\nF.O.

M. Godbout alors missionnaire, a adress\u00e9 au D\u00e9partement des devis et sp\u00e9cifications de la nouvelle \u00e9cole projet\u00e9e. C'est \u00e0 Mr. Pedley directement que cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 exp\u00e9di\u00e9. J'aimerais \u00e0 savoir ce qu'en pense le D\u00e9partement. Je n'ai aucune copie de ces devis et sp\u00e9cifications. Le D\u00e9partement se trouve \u00e0 en avoir le seul exemplaire. Si le D\u00e9partement ne le trouve pas ou s'il ne lui convient pas, voici ce que je me propose de faire sans retard, si le D\u00e9partement m'y autorise:\n\n1. Le site sur lequel nous devons b\u00e2tir appartient \u00e0 notre r\u00e9serve et est inoccup\u00e9. Donc rien \u00e0 payer pour le terrain. Il se trouve au Sud du Chemin du Roi, vis-\u00e0-vis l'ancienne \u00e9cole. Je vous inclus le plan que vous m'avez adress\u00e9, et en l'examinant, vous verrez que les barres bleues indiquent ce terrain qui a 300 pds. de profondeur sur 300 pds. front \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s. Le front se trouve sur le chemin du roi, et la profondeur va jusqu'\u00e0 la Riv. St. Charles. L'endroit marqu\u00e9 en rouge serait la nouvelle \u00e9cole.\nLa grandeur que nous nous proposons de donner \u00e0 la nouvelle \u00e9cole serait de 45 pds X 40 pds, \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s, en rempliesant les conditions de votre lettre du 26 juin dernier.\n\n2.- Je vais voir un architecte qui va pr\u00e9parer un plan, devis et sp\u00e9cifications et des estim\u00e9s pour demander des soumissions aux entrepreneurs. C'est plut\u00f4t un trac\u00e9 que je veux avoir pour juger de l'ext\u00e9rieur de la b\u00e2tisse et des commodit\u00e9s int\u00e9rieures.\n\nOn me dit qu'actuellement, le mat\u00e9riaux et la main d'\u0153uvre sont d'un prix tr\u00e8s \u00e9lev\u00e9. Si les prix donn\u00e9s par les soumissionnaires \u00e9taient trop \u00e9lev\u00e9s, on pourrait diff\u00e9rer la construction jusqu'\u00e0 l'automne. Peut-\u00eatre qu'\u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, la main d'\u0153uvre et les mat\u00e9riaux seront moins chers.\n\nJe dis tout cela, pour la raison, que la somme de $1500.00 est tr\u00e8s modique, et qu'il est difficile de faire quelque chose de convenable avec cette somme.\n\nSi le D\u00e9partement trouve que je suis correct, je vais me mettre imm\u00e9diatement \u00e0 l'\u0153uvre. Il est entendu que je consulterais le missionnaire chaque fois que la chose sera n\u00e9cessaire. J'attends donc les ordres du D\u00e9partement.\n\nJ'ai l'honneur d'\u00eatre,\n\nvotre d\u00e9vissant serviteur,\n\nAntoine O. Bastien\n\nAgent des Sauvages.\nJaime Lorette,\nJuly 19, 1906.\n\nH.D. McLean, Esq.,\nSecretary, Dept. of I.R.,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nThe reason delayed in replying to your letters of June 26th, 27th, and the 16th inst., was because when in communication with me in regard to the site for the new school-house, the missionary asked me to defer my reply to the Dept.\n\nLast fall the Rev. Mr. Goddard, then missionary, sent the Dept. plan and specifications for the proposed school. This was forwarded direct to Mr. Kelley. I should like to know what the Dept. thought of it. I have no copy of this plan and specification; the Dept. has the only copy. If it does not suit the Dept., this is what I propose without delay doing, if authorized by the Dept.\n1. The site on which we are to build belongs to our reserve and is unoccupied; so there is nothing to pay for the land. It lies south of the King's road, opposite the old school-house. I enclose the plan that you sent me; on examining it you will see that the blue lines indicate this piece of land, which is about 350 feet deep by 350 feet in frontage. The front is on the King's road, and the depth extends as far as the St. Charles river. The spot marked in red will be the new school.\n\nThe size that we propose giving the new school is 45 x 40 feet, fulfilling the conditions of your letter of June 26th, last.\n\n2. I am going to ask an architect who will prepare a plan and specifications and estimates in order to call for tenders from contractors. This rather attracts me, as I wish to have inside to judge as to the exterior of the building and the interior accommodation.\n\nI am told that at present\nmaterials and labour are very high.\nOf the figures submitted by the\ntenders, though too high, we might\ndefer the erection of the building\nuntil the fall. Perhaps by that\ntime labour and materials may\nbe cheaper.\n\nI say all this because\nthe sum of $1532-00 is very moderate,\nand it would be difficult to do\nanything suitable for that amount.\nOf the Deptt. considers that\nI am right, I shall set out\nto work.

He says that the Rev. Mr. Godbout, the late missionary on the reserve, sent a plan and specifications of the proposed building direct to you last fall; they are not on file, and I have seen nothing of them.\n\nHe gives the dimensions of a suitable building as about 40 x 45 ft., which would furnish plenty of room for the two classes in the school and would provide suitable accommodation for the Sisters who are in charge of the school above the class-rooms. He states that he is going to see an architect, who would prepare a plan and specifications and estimates, so that tenders may be called for. We could have this work done here and save the architect's fees, as the sum provided, namely $1,500, is little enough for a building of this description. In fact the Agent says that material and labour are very high at present and it may be necessary to defer the erection of the building until fall on this account.\n\nThe Agent has returned the tracing sent him of the reserve and has indicated thereon the site selected for the school, which is on the reserve proper and is conveniently situated for the purpose. The question to be decided is whether plans and specifications are to be prepared here or not.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

D'ailleurs, je ne m'attends pas \u00e0 la force de faire cette traduction.\n\nLa raison pour laquelle je demande cette traduction, c'est que nos entrepreneurs ne comprennent pas un mot d'anglais et ne peuvent prendre connaissance des sp\u00e9cifications ni des quantit\u00e9s. J'ose esp\u00e9rer que le D\u00e9partement me fera parvenir, sous le plus court d\u00e9lai, ces m\u00eames sp\u00e9cifications et quantit\u00e9s en anglais avec la traduction fran\u00e7aise, ce qui me permettra de contr\u00f4ler leur exactitude.\n\nJ'ai l'honneur d'\u00eatre, Votre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\n\nAntoine L. Bastien\nAgent des Sauvages!\nJenne Lor#ette, Sept. 10, 1906.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq., Sec., Dept. of I.A.,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the Dept's letter dated Aug. 23, last, also plan No. 128, specifications & bill of quantities in regard to the erection of the school-house at Lorrette. I find I am obliged to return you the specifications & the bill of quantities in order that the Dept. may be kind enough to have the same translated into French.\n\nI do not like to undertake the responsibility of making this translation, which is very difficult, as there are technical words or phrases used in the trade. Moreover I do not feel that I have the strength to make this translation.\n\nThe reason why I ask for this translation is that our contractors do not understand a word of English & cannot make anything out of the specifications or the bill of quantities. I hope the Dept. will send me, with as little delay as possible, these same specifications & quantities in English, with translation in French, which will enable me to see that they are followed exactly.\n\nI have, &c.,\n\nA.O. Bastien, I.A.\nOttawa, Sept.17,1906.\n\nActing Deputy Minister.\n\nWith reference to the request of Agent Bastien for a translation in French of the specifications (10 pages) and bill of quantities (5 pages) for the erection of a school-house at Lorette, I beg to say that for the very reason given by Mr. Bastien, namely, that these documents are full of technical words and phrases used in the trade, makes it impossible for any one in this Dept. to translate these documents into French.\n\nI would suggest, therefore, that the Dept. of Public Works, with its staff of French-speaking technical officers, be requested to make the translation. I think this course followed has been followed before.\n\nH.C. Rowe.\nSir,\n\nRecently this Dept. sent to its Indian Agent at Lorette, Que., a specification and bill of quantities for the erection of a school-house and residence on the reserve at that place. The Agent has just returned these documents, saying that he cannot translate them, as they contain technical words and phrases used in the trade so that the making of a translation would be a very difficult task.\n\nHe says that the contractors do not understand a word of English and so cannot make anything out of the specification or the bill of quantities.\n\nAs there is no one in this Dept. qualified to make these necessary translations, while no doubt some of the technical officers in your Dept. would have no difficulty in performing this work, may I ask that you will be so kind as to have translations of these documents made, and then these and the originals be sent to this Dept. As it is late in the season for building operations, I should esteem it a great favor if you will be so kind as to have this matter attended to promptly.\n\nThe documents referred to are enclosed herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFrederic Beliveau, Sec.,\nSecretary, Dept. of Public Works,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Gauvin, Cauchon & fr\u00e8res, Ed. P\u00e2quet, Phil\u00e9as Leclerc et Achille Dugal, tous de Qu\u00e9bec, et \u00e0 M. M. On\u00e9sime Fiset, Gaudias Verret et Th\u00e9odore Goulet, de St. Ambroise de la Jeune Lorette. Tous ces messieurs sont des entrepreneurs bien connus. Je n'ai re\u00e7u en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 ma demande, que deux soumissions, celles de Phil\u00e9as Leclerc de Qu\u00e9bec, qui demande $2,700.00, et celle de Gaudias Verret de St. Ambroise de Lorette, pour $1800.00. Je vous inclus ces deux soumissions en dates des 19 & 23 octobre derniers.\n\nSi j'ai retard\u00e9 \u00e0 vous exp\u00e9dier ces soumissions, c'est parce que les entrepreneurs Th. Goulet et On\u00e9s. Fiset m'avaient demand\u00e9 du d\u00e9lai pour pr\u00e9parer leurs soumissions. Je n'ai pas re\u00e7u d'eux ces soumissions. Ils m'ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 depuis qu'ils ne donneraient pas de soumission.\n\nD'apr\u00e8s l'opinion des entrepreneurs et du missionnaire, il serait trop tard pour commencer les travaux cet automne, qu'il serait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable d'attendre au printemps. La raison serait\nserait qu'il faudrait faire s\u00e9cher le bois cet hiver, et les travaux de ma\u00e7onnerie seraient mieux faits au printemps. Cependant, il vaudrait mieux que les contrats seraient accord\u00e9s maintenant, vu que les entrepreneurs auraient le temps d'ici au printemps, de pr\u00e9parer leurs mat\u00e9riaux, surtout le bois.\n\nJ'ai l'honneur d'\u00eatre,\n\nvotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\n\nAgent des Sauvages.\nQuebec, Oct 17, 1906.\n\nSir,\n\nI undertake to build you a school-house at Indian Leffette, masonry, woodwork, shingle roof, glazing and painting in accordance with plan and specification for the sum of $2,700\u2014work to be first-class.\n\nYours truly,\nP.H. Leclerc,\nCarpenter contractor.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to answer your letters dated Oct.8, and Nov.8,1906, relative to the construction of the school.\n\nAs directed in your letter of Oct.8, last, I asked estimates from Messrs P.P.Gauvin, Cauchon & Bros., Ed. Paquet, Phileas Leclerc and Achille Dugal, all of Quebec, and also Messrs from Mr. M. Onesime Fiset, Gaudias Verret, and Theodore Goulet, of St. Ambroise de la Jeune Lorette. All of these gentlemen are well known contractors. In answer to my inquiries I received but two answers: one from Phileas Leclerc of Quebec who asks $2,700 and that of Gaudias Verret of St. Ambroise of Jeune Lorette for $1,800. I inclose these two tenders; they are dated Oct.19, and 23, last.\n\nThe reason I delayed sending you these tenders was because the contractors Th. Goulet and Ones. Fiset, asked me for time to prepare their tenders. I have not received these tenders from them; they have since told me that they would not submit tenders.\n\nIn the opinion of the contractors and the missionary it is too late to begin the work this fall; they think it would be better to wait until the spring. The reason is that it would be necessary to dry the lumber this winter and the masonry work would be better done in spring. However, it would be better to grant the contracts now so that the contractors may have from new until spring to prepare their materials, especially the lumber.\n\nI have, &c.,\nA.O.

The other tender from Mr. Leclerc is for $2700.\n\nMr. Verret's tender for $1800 is $300 in excess of the sum provided, but if he puts up the building called for by the plans and specifications it would be well worth this extra amount. In any event a revote will have to be made and it might be as well to provide a sufficient sum to pay for the building, which will not be undertaken till next Spring; but in the meantime the contract should be entered into so that the Department may have a hold on the contractor.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The plans it appears are suitable, and should if possible be adopted. The tenders received were two one for $1800 and the other for $2700.\n\nMr. Ogilvie, in his memorandum hereunder states that the tender for $1800 is a particularly low one, unless he has special facilities. Mr. Ogilvie's estimate is shown to be $2346.16 for this work, and in addition there still remains to be provided for the construction of a drain and cement floors and a furnace at an estimated cost $406.00. The total estimated cost for the complete work is $2652.16, and as stated above there is only $1500 available to meet this expenditure. If however, the contract is awarded for $1800, we have then a deficit of $706.00 to provide.\n\nI beg to draw your attention to the memorandum from the Accountant of the 1st Dec., 1908 in which he recommends that the Hurons of Lorette should contribute towards the construction of the proposed School house. I beg to recommend that the Agent be instructed to inform the band that the Department has at its disposal the sum of $1500.00 for the erection of the building and they should pass a resolution recommending that the balance required namely, $1152.00 (according to Mr. Ogilvie's estimate) be taken from their capital funds.\nIf it should appear that the person tendering to construct the building for $1800 has special facilities, the Department would be justified in letting the work to him, the balance required would be only as stated above $706.00. I think it would be better for the Indians to ask the authority for the larger sum, namely $1152.\n\nPlease also see the memorandum from Mr. Stewart, dated 26 Oct., in which he states \"The Department considers it one of its duties to see that schools are provided to all Indian reserves. When the funds of the band admit of it the necessary amount is taken therefrom; but when they have not sufficient funds the money is provided by vote of parliament.\"\nOttawa, Dec. 10, 1906.\n\nReferring to your letter of the 8th ult., I have the request you to inform the Indian Council that the cost of the proposed new school house is estimated by the Architect of the Department at $2552.00. This includes the drain, furnace, and cement floors which are not provided for in the specifications on which you called for tenders.\n\nThe Department has the sum of $1500 available for the construction of the school. There is, therefore, a balance of $1052 to be provided to make up the sum according to the estimate above mentioned.\n\nYou will please inform the Indians that they should pass a resolution requesting that the said sum of $1052.00 be taken from their capital funds for the purposes required.\n\nThe tender received for $1000 is considered to be a particularly low one unless the contractor has some special facilities for procuring his labour and materials. In the event of the department accepting this tender, the total extra sum required will be $706.00. It is considered advisable that the Indians should pass a resolution for the greater sum ($1152) of course only such portion of this sum will be spent as may be required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O. Bastien, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nJeanne-Lorette,\nQue.\n\nSecretary.\nMonsieur,\n\nJe r\u00e9ponds \u00e0 votre lettre du 10 D\u00e9cembre dernier. J'ai soumis la lettre du D\u00e9partement au Conseil des Sauvages et voici ce qu'ils ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 : D'abord la soumission de Mr. Verret au montant de $1800.00 ne leur para\u00eet pas trop basse. Vous dites dans votre lettre que l'entrepreneur ne pourrait construire \u00e0 ce prix que s'il se trouve dans des conditions sp\u00e9ciales pour se procurer la main d'\u0153uvre et les mat\u00e9riaux \u00e0 bon march\u00e9. Mr. Verret se trouve dans ces conditions. Il peut se procurer le bois dans la paroisse de St. Ambroise ; il a un moulin \u00e0 sci\u00e9 o\u00f9 il peut pr\u00e9parer tout son bois et ses ouvertures ; de plus si la soumission lui est donn\u00e9e, le plus t\u00f4t possible, il aura deux ou trois mois, jusqu'\u00e0 la fonte des neiges, pour voir \u00e0 son affaire.\n\nLes Chefs ont examin\u00e9 les plans et ils en sont satisfaits. \u00c0 leur r\u00e9union, ils ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de n'accorder que $500.00 sur leur fond, ce qui fera $2000.00 avec les $1500.00 vot\u00e9es par le Parlement. Sur les $500.00 qu'ils donnent, $300.00 serviront \u00e0 combler la diff\u00e9rence entre la somme vot\u00e9e par le Parlement et celle de $1800.00 demand\u00e9e par le soumissionnaire Verret, et les $200.00 autres, serviront pour conduire l'eau \u00e0 l'Ecole, installer les water-closets et faire un drain. Quant aux fournaises, ils pr\u00e9f\u00e8rent pour le moment garder les po\u00eales qu'ils ont dans la vieille \u00e9cole. Plus tard, lorsqu'ils seront plus en moyens, ils pourront changer le syst\u00e8me de chauffage. D'ailleurs, toutes les \u00e9coles des Canadiens dans...\nDans les paroisses sont chauff\u00e9es au bois et avec des po\u00eales.\n\nNous aurons ainsi une bonne \u00e9cole, compl\u00e8tement finie, pourvue d'eau, de closets et d'un drain. Tous s'accordent \u00e0 dire que la soumission de Mr. Verret au montant de $1800.00 est la plus avantageuse que nous puissions avoir et que vu la position du soumissionnaire, il peut ex\u00e9cuter parfaitement son contrat et r\u00e9aliser un profit raisonnable. D'ailleurs, nous pouvons exiger des garanties de sa part, des cautions.\n\nLes sauvages esp\u00e8rent que la question va se trouver r\u00e9gl\u00e9e de cette mani\u00e8re et que la soumission Verret sera accept\u00e9e le plus t\u00f4t possible par le D\u00e9partement. Dans ce cas, le D\u00e9partement voudra bien me faire conna\u00eetre ses vues le plus t\u00f4t possible, afin que je fasse passer r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement par le Conseil des Sauvages, la r\u00e9solution de $500.00 pour \u00eatre prises sur leurs fonds.\n\nJ'ai l'honneur d'\u00eatre,\n\nvotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\n\nAgent des Sauvages.\nTranslation,\nJeune Lorette, Jan. 9, 1907.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of I.A., Ottawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to reply to your letter of December 10, in which you submitted the Department's letter to the Indian Council, and this is what was decided.\n\nFirstly, the tender of Mr Verret, amounting to $1,800.00, did not appear to them to be too low. You say in your letter that the contractor could not build at that price what is contained in the special conditions and obtain the labour and material cheaply. Mr Verret is in this position. He can obtain the lumber in the parish of St. Ambroise; he has a saw-mill where he can make all the lumber and sashes and frames (doors); besides if the contract is given him as soon as possible, he will have two or three months until the snow melts to attend to the mat-\n\nThe chiefs have examined the plans and they are satisfied with them. At their meeting they decided to grant only $500.00 of their funds, which with the $1,500.00 voted by Parliament, will make $2,000.00. Out of the $500.00 that they are giving, $300.00 will serve to make up the difference between the sum tendered by Parliament and the $1,800.00 asked for by Mr Verret and the other $200.00 will be used to bring the water to the school, to put in the water-closets and to make a drain.\n\nWith reference to the furnaces, they prefer for the present to keep the stoves that they have in the old school. Later on, when they have more money, they will be able to change the system of heating. Besides, all the schools of the French-Canadians in the parishes are heated with wood and by stoves. We shall thus have a good school completely finished, provided with water, water-closets and a drain. All agree in saying that Mr Verret's tender, amounting to $1,800.00, is the most advantageous that we can have and that, owing to the position of the tenderer, he can carry out his contract perfectly and make a reasonable\nprofit. Besides, we can exact a guarantee from him, bonds.\n\nThe Indians hope that the question will be settled in this manner and that Verret's tender will be accepted as soon as possible by the Department.

The running expenses of the band, however, are too heavy to permit of any considerable sum being taken from band funds, and the Public Works Appropriation of $1500 was obtained last Session. The band has contributed $300 to make up the balance of the tender, and a further $200 to bring water to the school, install water closets therein and make a drain.\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nAntoine O.T.

Mr. le missionnaire Giroux et moi, apr\u00e8s examen plus minutieux des sp\u00e9cifications, croyons que certains changements devraient \u00eatre faits.\n\nNous voudrions remplacer le lattage et le mortier par du bois. Premi\u00e8rement pour le plafond de l'\u00e9tage des institutrices, on voudrait qu'il fut en bois, parce que cela serait beaucoup plus chaud, plus solide et par cons\u00e9quent plus durable. Deuxi\u00e8mement, les murs des classes devraient \u00eatre en bois, parce que les \u00e9l\u00e8ves de l'\u00e9cole vont \u00eatre port\u00e9s \u00e0 d\u00e9t\u00e9riorer le mortier. Cette jeunesse, comme vous le savez, est impitoyable.

McLean, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDept. of I.A.,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the erection of the school-house in the Sunan village, I should like to ask the attention of the Department to a proposed change. According to the specifications, the contractor is to lay the walls, the partitions, and the ceiling of the storey where the teachers (nuns) will reside; and the said contractor is ready to follow the specifications to the letter. The missionary, the Rev. Mr. Giroux, and I, after a most minute examination of the specifications, believe that certain changes ought to be made.\n\nWe should like to substitute wood for the lath and plaster. First, for the ceiling of the teachers' storey it is desired that this should be of wood, because it would be much warmer, more solid, and consequently more durable. Secondly, the walls of the class-rooms ought to be of wood, because the pupils will be inclined to injure the mortar; these young people, as you know, are unmerciful. We have spoken about it to the contractor, and this, what he is prepared to do: he will consent to substitute for the lath and the brown coat of mortar a double wainscot of wood with a thickness of felt paper between, and that for the places above mentioned, that is to say, the walls of the class-rooms and the ceiling of the teachers' storey. He asks extra for the painting, for in that case it would be necessary to paint this part. This would not cost much, because the part...\nto be so painted is not large. The price that the painter asks contractor Verret for the whole of the work of painting is 15 cents a yard.\n\nWe hope, the missionary and I, that the Dept. will agree to permit this little change, which we ask with the sole object of having a more solid, warmer and more durable work.\n\nI have, &c.,\nA.O. Bastien,\nI. A.\nOttawa, June 26th, 1907.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 6th instant I beg to inform you that the changes suggested in the construction of the school house in the Huron village are not considered to be advisable from a sanitary point of view. The contractor should, therefore, construct the building according to the specifications.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. B. McLEAN\nSecretary.\n\nA.O.

The missionary, the chiefs and myself are thoroughly satisfied with the contractor, Gaudioso Vernet. Two-thirds of the work is complete and the contractor would like something on account of the contract; the stone foundation is finished, the cellar is dug, the body of the house is built, the shingling of the roof is complete, the floor is made, the doors and windows are ready to be put in place, all the lumber to complete the work is on the spot, in fact two-thirds of the work is done.\n\nThe contractor needs $1,000 on account of his contract, and I believe that the Dept. can pay this amount without fear.

La raison du retard dans l'ach\u00e8vement de ces travaux se trouve dans le fait que les ouvriers pl\u00e2triers sont tr\u00e8s rares et que notre entrepreneur n'a pu se les procurer comme il l'aurait voulu. Il n'y a qu'une trentaine d'ouvriers pl\u00e2triers \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, et avaient tous de l'emploi.

The work is almost quite finished; it will be complete about the 10th or 13th inst. The reason for the delay in this work was owing to the fact that plasterers are very scarce and our contractor was not able to obtain them as he wished. There are only some thirty plasterers in Quebec and they were all occupied. But at last the contractor has got one, and he will finish the work as I have just said in the beginning of next week.\n\nThere will be no delay in the opening of the classes. The pupils are having their lessons in the old school building as usual while waiting until the new one will be ready.\n\nI have, &c.,\n\nA. O. Bastien,\nI. A.\nJ.D.

En r\u00e9f\u00e9rant aux sp\u00e9cifications que m'a fournies le D\u00e9partement, je ne vois pas que cet item ait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vu, et l'entrepreneur pr\u00e9tend qu'il n'est pas oblig\u00e9 de faire des doubles ch\u00e2ssis pour l'hiver. Ces doubles ch\u00e2ssis co\u00fbteraient dans les environs de $50.00. Je laisse au D\u00e9partement le soin de d\u00e9cider la chose et de m'\u00e9crire le plus t\u00f4t possible, sur ce point.\n\nJe crois avec le missionnaire et les chefs, que le D\u00e9partement autorisera la confection de ces ch\u00e2ssis doubles, qui sont absolument n\u00e9cessaire, \u00e0 \u00eatre pay\u00e9s \u00e0 m\u00eame les fonds vot\u00e9s pour les \u00e9coles des sauvages de la Province de Qu\u00e9bec.\n\nLa b\u00e2tisse de l'\u00e9cole \u00e9tant termin\u00e9e, il faudrait y conduire\nle drainage ainsi que l'eau, et y installer les water-closets.\n\nPar R\u00e9solution de la Bande en date du 26 janvier 1907, transmise au D\u00e9partement par ma lettre du 28 janvier 1907, ce dernier devait, sur les $800.00 souscrites par la bande, payer la somme de $300.00 \u00e0 l'entrepreneur Verret pour combler la diff\u00e9rence entre la somme de $1500.00 vot\u00e9e par le Parlement, et celle de $1800.00 prix de l'entreprise, et les autres $200.00 devant servir pour conduire l'eau \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole, installer des water-closets et faire un drain. Or, vu que ces travaux doivent \u00eatre faits par des journaliers et des ouvriers qui ont besoin de leur argent au fur et \u00e0 mesure que se font les travaux, je demanderais au D\u00e9partement de m'adresser cette somme de deux cents dollars, afin de d\u00e9frayer le co\u00fbt de ces travaux.\n\nIl n'y a pas de temps \u00e0 perdre, vu que les gel\u00e9es nous arrivent.\n\nJ'ai l'honneur d'\u00eatre,\n\nvotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\n\nAntoine O. Bastien\n\nAgent des Sauvages.\nI have the honour to inform the Dept. that the work on the village school-house is finished to the thorough satisfaction of the missionary and myself. The contractor, Mr. Gaudias Verret, has asked me to inform the Dept. that he would like to be paid the balance of his contract, namely, $800. I do not see any reason why the Dept. should not pay this balance, inasmuch as the contractor has not made much out of this contract.\n\nNow there are still wanting 20 double windows for the building, which were not provided for in the specifications.\n\nOn referring to the specifications that the Dept. furnished me, I do not see that this item was provided for, and the contractor contends that he is not obliged to make double windows for winter. These windows would cost about $50. I leave it to the Dept. to decide the matter and to write me as soon as possible as to this point. I believe with the missionary and the chiefs that the Dept. will authorize the making of these double windows, which are absolutely necessary, to be paid out of the funds voted for Indian schools in the province of Quebec.\n\nThe school building being finished, it is necessary to connect the drainage with it and also water, and to provide water-closets.\nBy resolution of Jan. 26, 1907, transmitted to the Dept. in my letter of Jan. 28, 1907, the Dept. was out of the $500 subscribed by the band to pay the $300 to Contractor Verret to make up the difference between the $1500 voted by Parliament and $1800, the amount of the contract, and the other $200 was to be spent in bringing water to the school, putting in water-closets and making a drain. Now, as this work has to be done by workmen who need their money in proportion as the work progresses, I would ask the Dept. to send me this sum of $200 in order to pay the expense of the work.\n\nThere is no time to lose, as the winter is coming on.\n\nI have, &c.,\nA.

You should certify on the voucher that the contract has been completed according to the plans and specifications in a satisfactory manner.\n\nI also enclose cheque No. 3039 for $100.00 being an advance for work in connection with the water supply for the school.

The position of basement stairway changed and a trap door put in instead of going down under main stairs.\n\nThe woodwork and joining generally appears to be strongly put together. It is, however, very rough and no portions have been hand smoothed.\n\nThere is a good system of plumbing established and the water supply brought into the building.\n\nThe contractor for the building is ill and I was therefore unable to interview him. I have been credibly informed, however, that he has sustained a loss of about $250. on the contract and the stonework will cost to complete about $40. to $45.\n\nThe Chief of the Band and Sisters in charge of the school express themselves as being very well satisfied with the building and the accommodations provided. The Sisters ask for a partition across hall at head of stairs to prevent cold draughts ascending to upper portions of house at a cost of $25. and I would recommend that this be done.\n\nArchitect.\nOttawa, 26th December, 1907.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 26th ultimo, stating that the school building at Jeune Lorette is complete and asking that the balance due on the contract be sent to Mr. Verrett, the contractor, I have to say that an officer of the Department who recently visited the school has reported that portions of the work remain incomplete. No cross stone wall has been built to retain the earth from an excavated portion of the basement. He also states that a stone wall is only partially built at present under the main building and porch. The beam filling in basement has also been omitted. It will be necessary to complete this work satisfactorily before the final payment can be made.\n\nThe Department authorizes the building of a sheeting partition across the lower hall, with door hung and locked, etc., complete, and to be painted to match other woodwork. For this the Department will allow $50.00.\n\nAs storm windows are a necessity in this climate, the Department will allow them and you are authorized to have them put on at the tendered price of $50.00 for the twenty-six windows stated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The cost of the work would amount to about $1,500.00.\n\nThe reason I am asking this information is that the chiefs are not inclined to have this amount charged to their band funds which are as follows: (Capital....$15,607-58; Interest....$3,528.76,) on account of the school being a government property.\n\nIf there are no funds available this year, I would recommend that the above mentioned amount be included in next year's estimates.\n\nDepartmental Engineer.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMR. SCOTT.\n\nThe question of installing the hot water heating system at the Lorette Indian Day School has been postponed until this year, on account of lack of funds.\n\nAs you are aware, winter is a dull season for steam fitters and I am advised that the services of a reliable steam fitter could be secured at a very low price, and furthermore, that this man would be willing to wait until the Department's appropriations are available, for the payment of his work. I estimate that the whole system could be installed by one steam fitter and one helper, within about forty days' time, at a cost of $475.00.\n\nArrangements could also be made with the firm supplying the piping, radiators, etc., so as to delay the payment of the materials until funds are available, thus taking advantage of the present price of radiation which is daily increasing.\n\nI may add for your information, that you have already approved of this work, and that Mr. Ferrier concur in my recommendation to have the work completed during this\n\nIndian Affairs.
