Father Ferrault, Winnipeg, for the appointment of Raoul Martel as teacher of the Lake Manitoba Indian Day School, and also a letter from Chief Moise Paul approving of his appointment.\n\nMr. Martel was in the service of the Department for sometime before he enlisted in 1915. He was re-appointed as teacher of this school in July, last, but the Indians protested his appointment on the grounds that he was drunk on the reserve several times. Chief Paul made the charge, but he now recommends that he be re-appointed. Father Ferrault says that the charges made against him were false and states that, as he was recently married, there will be no cause in future for such charges being made on account of his conduct, and that he is quite satisfied that he will give good satisfaction, if reappointed. Mr. Martel has Normal training and had several years experience as teacher in this school previous to his enlistment.\n\nHenry Springer, who was the former teacher, has resigned from March 31st, last. As there is at present no teacher at this school, I would beg to recommend that Mr. Martel be given another chance at his retention of the position, however, to depend on his conduct and the success with which he meets in this work. The salary paid to Mr. Springer was at the rate of $500.00 per annum, and I would recommend that Mr. Martel receive the same rate of payment.\n\nIt will be necessary to fit up a residence for the teacher of this school. Father Ferrault last summer reported that he could purchase a house for $250.00, but would have to have it moved about three miles to the schoolhouse and it would cost about $100.00 to move it and fit it up.\nHe now states that, if the Department does not wish to carry out his suggestion, it will be necessary to build a residence, as it will be impossible to get a teacher unless suitable quarters are provided.\n\nThe school building also requires some repairs to the foundation and to be sided on the outside. The present building is of log construction and is not situated in a central locality. There are about thirty children of school age on the reserve.\n\nThe Agent does not furnish any information regarding a building for the teacher's residence or the fitting up of the school building, and I think that he should be asked to furnish a full report in the matter. In the meantime, in order that the children may not be deprived of an education, I would beg to suggest that Mr. Martel be appointed and take up his duties.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6237, file 521-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nOttawa, April 14, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant enclosing a recommendation from Rev. Father Perrault for the appointment of Mr. Martel as teacher of the Lake Manitoba (Dog Creek) Indian Day School and also a letter from Chief Moise Paul, in which he also recommends Mr. Martel's appointment and states that he has now no complaint against him.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in order that the school may not remain closed, the Department will approve of the appointment of Mr. Martel, to begin duties as soon as possible. His retention in the position will depend upon the success with which he meets and also his conduct on the reserve. The Department will allow him a salary at the same rate as was paid Mr. Springer, namely $500.00 per annum.\n\nFather Perrault requests that a suitable residence for the teacher be provided, as there is very poor accommodation at the present time. He informs the Department last summer that a house could be purchased for $250.00, which would have to be moved about three miles, and it would cost about $100.00 to move it and fix it up. He states that quarters for a teacher are absolutely necessary, as it is impossible to keep a teacher at this school without living quarters being provided for him. You should furnish a full report regarding the question of obtaining a residence for the teacher and whether you think it worth while to follow Father Perrault's suggestion being carried out to purchase this house and have it moved, or whether you think it better to build a small residence near the school and the probable cost of erecting the same. You should state your views fully regarding the question of providing suitable accommodation for a teacher for this school.\n\nFather Perrault states that the school building also requires to be repaired. You should furnish a report stating the repairs that are required to place the school in good condition and the probable cost of having the work done. You will be good enough to give this matter your prompt attention, in order that the Department can arrive at a decision regarding this matter.\n\nIn the meantime, as advised above, Mr. Martel may carry on the work as teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

As there are 200 school days in one year and as the salary is $68.75 per annum, the proportional amount for 22 days in September should be $13.75 per day, making a total of $66.50.

The Department learns that Mr. Goulet is not very satisfactory but that he may be helped somewhat by supplying the proper equipment. The Inspector states that the teacher had no idea of what books or programme he was to follow and was expecting orders from your office.

Martell, I beg to say that previous to October 1st last this gentleman was a teacher on the Dog Creek Indian reserve. Since then he has disappeared and I am unable to give any information as to his present whereabouts. I would suggest that you communicate with Mr. A. Uglertree, Indian Agent, Portage la Prairie, Man., who, I think, will be able to give you the information you desire.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\n\nMessrs. Dyke and Benson,\nBarristers, etc.,\nFort William, Ont.\nSubsequently, he advised me to put in another claim stating that at the time of my first demand he was not aware that I was entitled to my salary and that he would recommend the second claim for payment.\n\nAs I was not getting any news, I wrote Mr. Ogletree who finally answered that the Department had refused to change its decision and, as stated before, although I have complied with the regulations, I did not get my three months' salary and bonus and this possibly through a divergence of opinion on matters not pertaining in the least to the fulfillment of my duties as teacher.\n\nI do not wish to argue the question on the merits of my case; I will only say that since I have the sympathy of such men as Messrs. Horace Chevrier, L.F. Roy, barrister of Winnipeg, Shuli Macdonald, member for St. George, in the local house and many others with whom I have worked hand in hand to uphold a principle so dear to some of us, this should be concrete evidence and conclusive proof that I at least deserve more than a passing glance.\n\nI trust I have not encroached too much upon your time and respectfully but hopefully request that you instruct the Indian Department to reconsider its decision herein and to give my claim a more favorable consideration.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nYour humble servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuite 4, Tashe Block,\nSt. Boniface, Manitoba.\nJanuary 4th., 1925.\nSt. Boniface, Manitoba,\nJanuary 4th, 1923.\n\nThe Hon. Chas. Stuart,\nDept. of the Interior,\nOttawa, Ont., Canada.\n\nHonourable Sir:\n\nI have the honour to submit the following for your consideration.\n\nI, the undersigned, was a teacher on the Dog Creek Indian Reserve, Manitoba, and during my term of office I sent in an application to the Civil Service Commission at Ottawa for the position of Indian Agent at Fisher River, Manitoba, and subsequently for the Pelley Agency, Saskatchewan. At the time I applied for the latter, at the end of August 1922 (during the summer holidays) I also mailed my resignation as teacher at Dog Creek to Agent Ogletree at Portage la Prairie, Man., same to be effective September 30th, 1922, viz. the end of the Quarter.\n\nI was advised by Mr. Ogletree that it was useless for me to resume school for that period (September), and one Mr. M. Goulet, whom I had suggested to succeed me on October 1st was requested to report at Dog Creek on Sept. 1st; however I was ready and willing to resume my duties as school teacher and discharge the same for the month of September, and on account of the Agent's instructions, I was left unemployed in September which meant the loss of three months' salary.\n\nAs I had absolutely complied with the Indian School rules and regulations, I claimed my salary in the usual way, that is through my immediate chief, Mr. Ogletree and I presume the Department acted upon his views which apparently were not favorable to me as my claim was rejected.\nOttawa, Jan. 12, 1925.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nReferring further to your letter of the 21st ultimo, regarding the address of Mr. R. A. Martel, I have to inform you that this Department has received a communication from this gentleman, in which he informs us that he is living at Suite 14, Tache Block, St. Boniface, Man.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Your services were continued for two full academic years, and I have learned that you have been paid two full years' salary, and bonus at the rate of $15 per teaching month.\n\nI have given this matter my most favourable consideration, and I regret to inform you that there are no arrears in your case.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDuncan C.

A. Martel your file #123-6-1\n\nMr. R. A. Martel who is a personal friend of mine has requested me to write you with reference to your letter to him dated January 12th last.\n\nWe are informed that Mr. Martel who was employed at the Lake Manitoba Indian Day School from the first day of September 1922 at a yearly salary of $600 payable quarterly, offered his resignation to take place on the first of October 1922, on the last day of August of the same year, thereby giving a full month's notice as required by the rules.\n\nMr. Martel was paid his salary in full up to the end of the last quarter ending on the 30th of June 1923; he was quite willing to go back and finish his quarter ending with September 1923 but was told by your agent here that as this would necessitate a change during the school year that it was better for him not to go, and that the Department would take someone else. Mr. Martel was quite willing to do this provided he was paid for the months of July and August during which time he attended to his duties as much as was required from him, and there was no school then.\n\nIt may perhaps be objected, that the months of July and August were not school months, but we are informed by Mr. Martel that there were certain duties to be fulfilled by him during that time, and that he attended to the same. We may also point out to you that Mr. Martel was quite willing to finish his quarter by going back to the school for the\nOttawa, Feb. 17, 1923.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of the 10th instant, with reference to the salary paid R. A. Martel during the period he taught the Lake Manitoba Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to inform you that Mr. Martel was employed by this Department as from the first of September, 1920, at a salary of $600 per annum plus any bonus provided by law. His services were continued for two full academic years, and he was paid two full years' salary, supplemented by a bonus at the rate of $15 per teaching month. Mr. Martel performed no service during the months of July and August, last, as he left the reserve early in July. This matter has been given most favourable consideration, and I have to inform you that there are no arrears of salary due him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMessrs. Dubuc & Roy\nBarristers, etc.,\n201-205 Somerset Block,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nActing upon the suggestion of Mr. J. R. Bunn of the Lake Winnipeg Inspectorate, I beg to submit the following for your consideration.\n\nWith further reference to my claim for salary for September quarter 1922, I have noted the statement made in your last letter to me to the effect that having completed my full academic year on June 30th, 1922 I was paid for such\n\nI respectfully want to draw your attention to the fact that after June 30th, I was still in the employ of your Department, and that I did perform work such as looking after the sick, distributing rations, etc., during part of the holidays.\n\nI admit that I was away for a time during the holidays, but it was with Mr. Ogletree's permission.\n\nAs stated above, being still in the employ of your Department, in order to comply with the rules and regulations, I could not leave the service without giving written notice, so the latter part of August 1922 I sent my resignation to Mr. Ogletree, said resignation to be effective September 30th, but he refused to let me finish my quarter on the grounds that most of the Indians would probably be away.\n\nI also want respectfully to point out that during my sojourn at Dog Creek, my activities were not limited to teaching only. During my spare time I broke and remodeled a good sized garden, I built a substantial stable, 34 x 17, which is a credit to the Reserve, and actually an asset to the Department. It is well worth $250.00. As I was not asked to do it I did not expect any re-imbursement, I did it just as an example to the Indians, but the fact remains that these improvements are still the property of the Department and are an incentive to a new teacher.\n\nAnd again, before I resigned I went to the trouble of finding a successor thereby avoiding delay and inconvenience.\nIt will have to be admitted that there has been no lack of earnest and effective cooperation on my part during the months in question.\n\nIn conclusion I may add that Mr. Ogletree, who seemed to appreciate my efforts, shares that view. I trust that on the strength of the above explanations, you will see your way clear to reconsider the matter.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n4/18/23. 237 Monville St. St. Boniface\n\n[Stamp]\nOttawa, April 28, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, with further reference to your claim for salary as teacher of the Lake Manitoba Indian Day School, I beg to state that you have been informed before careful consideration has been given in your case, and I have to advise you that there are no arrears of salary.\n\nYou commenced duty on or about the first of September, 1920, and conducted the school for two full academic years and you were paid two full years' salary. You left the reserve some time during the holidays - the months of July and August - 1922 so that less than two calendar years were spent in our service.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

It is hoped that this outbreak will soon be over and that no deaths will occur.\n\nIt is presumed that both schools will re-open as soon as the doctor considers that conditions permit.

He has been away from the school since December 31, 1927, and there is no vacancy in our present school service, to which he could be appointed at the present time.\n\nBeyond this information we know nothing whatever of Mr. Martel.

When forwarding you Inspector's report of his\nvisit in October 1923 I drew attention to this and was informed\nin reply that as it was the intention of Inspector Bartlett to\nre-visit the school at an early date and submit a special report,\nit would not be advisable to take any action until that in-\nspection report was received. Inspector Bartlett did not\napparently re-visit the school and after reading his latest\ncomments there would appear to be no reason for withholding\naction to replace Mr. Coulet.\n\n(Signed) Wm. Graham\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6237, file 521-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nLAKE MANITOBA INDIAN DAY SCHOOL:\n\nThere is a day school on this reserve, which is taught by Mr. Maxime Goulet. At the time of my visit, the school was closed on account of an epidemic of measles amongst the children. There were 27 names on the register, 6 boys and 19 girls. The average attendance for the last quarter was 6, for the past year, 10.\n\nThe school is a log building 20 x 25 with shingle roof. It has a good high ceiling and is in a fair state of repair.\n\nThe teacher's residence is a log building 20 x 18 with an upstairs, but the walls being low, the upstairs can only be utilized for storing. It also has a lean-to kitchen 12 x 18. During the severe weather, the house is very cold, as it is lined on the inside with beaver board and I presume the plaster has crumbled away on the inside between the logs and the beaver board.\n\nIt is not necessary for me to say very much regarding Mr. Goulet's ability as teacher. I knew him when he was teaching school on this reserve about 35 years ago and at that time he was a man well up in years. Mr. Goulet is getting much too old for this work. The attendance at the school has been poor and I do not believe the children are making much headway.\n\nCOMMISSIONER GRAHAM'S COMMENTS ON INSPECTOR CHRISTIANSON'S REPORT ON THE LAKE MANITOBA INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nCOMM. GRAHAM'S LETTER OF FEB. 23, 1926. (#208-9)\n\nYou will note what the Inspector says about the Day School, and I quite agree with him. We are merely marking time and I think depriving the children of a proper education by having a school of this kind.\nOttawa, March 11, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nFor some time, the Department has been considering the question of making a change of teacher at the Lake Manitoba Indian Day School in order to improve the work. From a recent report of Mr. Inspector Christianson, who visited this school in February, it appears that the children are making no progress in their studies. It has been decided, therefore, to dispense with the services of Mr. Maxime Goulet, the present teacher, at the end of the current school year, June 30th, next. Please inform him that his services will not be required after that date.\n\nIn due time you should endeavour to obtain the services of a qualified teacher of the Catholic faith, to begin duties on or about September first, next. The names, qualifications and experience of any applicants you receive for the position should be submitted for the consideration of the Department. The salary allowed will be commensurate with the qualifications of the teacher you are able to secure.\n\nPlease bear this matter in mind and forward applications in due time so that a successor to Maxime Goulet can be appointed to begin duties when the school re-opens after the coming summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Mclean,\nAct. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nA. Ogletree, Secy.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nLAKE MANITOBA DAY SCHOOL.-This school is under the Roman Catholic Mission, and taught by Mr. Maxine Coulet. There are 27 pupils on the Register with an average attendance of 9. The attendance at this school is not very satisfactory; a great many of the pupils live a long distance from the school and for a great part of the year the roads are almost impassable. The pupils only make very little progress.\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\n\n28th March, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose my report of educational work in the Portage la Prairie and Manitouwak Agencies for the fiscal year ending 31st March 1926.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. Ogletree,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Amt. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nExtract from Report of Inspector Bartlett on the Lake Manitoba Indian Day School - dated April 20th, 1926.\n\nMaxime Goulet - Age 71.\nHas taught for a number of years here, and at other points.\nNo special certification.\nHealth - Infirm.\nSuccess - Extremely unsatisfactory.\n\nThe old gentleman is too infirm through age and ill-health to make a success, even if he had the natural ability and training.\n\nI have considerable sympathy for the present incumbent. He is an old man, ill, with an ailing wife, alone in a very uninspiring environment. He is probably doing as well as he is able - but that unfortunately amounts to very little.\n\nI have called his attention repeatedly that regulations call for the use of the text books of the public schools of the province; but he persists under various pretexts in using the books of a certain church society for readers. I see no hope of improvement under present conditions.\n\nShould you decide to make any improvements in building, I should be glad to consult without charge to your Department.\n\nIn forwarding the above report under cover of his letter of April 29th, 1926, Commissioner Graham states as follows:\n\nIn 1922 the unsatisfactory conditions existing at this school were reported to you, and on the 7th of November you stated in letter No.126-6-1 that Mr. Goulet's progress would be watched carefully with a view to improving matters. Nothing further is there was not a marked improvement in the conduct of the school. Two years later, on the 19th of November, 1924, I again drew your attention to the very unsatisfactory report which had been received on this school, and pointed out that there was no change. To this letter I received no reply, and we are now in receipt of another report which, in my opinion, calls for prompt action.\n\nThis school should undoubtedly be closed up and the children transferred to a Roman Catholic Boarding School without delay. Some of them could be taken to Qu'Appelle School, and perhaps a few to Muscowequan, Pine Creek and Sandy Bay. I am quite satisfied there is a place for them if the Department decide that they should be sent to a Boarding School.\nOttawa, May 7th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nRelative to the report of Inspector Bartlett on the Lake Manitoba Indian Day School forwarded under cover of your letter of the 29th ultimo, I beg to say with reference to the Inspector's statement regarding the services of Mr. Maurice Goulet, the teacher, that Mr. Agent Ogletree was instructed to inform him that his services would not be required after the end of the current school year, June 10th. We have also requested the Agent to take up with the Church authorities the matter of securing the services of a qualified teacher of the Catholic faith to begin duties on or about September 1st, next, and to submit the name, qualifications and experience of any applicants for the position for the consideration of the Department.\n\nRegarding the condition of the building, we will have no funds to provide for any new buildings at this point during the present school year. When the services of a new teacher are obtained, consideration will be given to the authorizing of a few minor repairs to make the building as comfortable as possible during next winter.\n\nI may add that the Church authorities are desirous that the day school activity on the Lake Manitoba Reserve be continued.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Hennicot,\nArchbishop of Winnipeg.\nMr. Duncan Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept' of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nMy dear Mr. Scott,\n\nI have found a teacher for Dog Creek Indian Day School and I have sent her there. Her name is Miss May Sanregret. She holds a Second Class Professional Certificate of the Province of Manitoba. She has been teaching for ten years on provisional certificates, but only recently finished the Normal Course and secured the qualifications mentioned above. She is a bright girl and an excellent teacher. In compliance with your wish and according to the programme you have adopted, I did not wish to recommend anyone who had not the proper qualifications.\n\nI do not know what salary was previously paid in this School, but remembering what you did in the case of Miss Gorman at the Red and Flow School, I promised Miss Sanregret that she would receive at least $100.00 a month. It takes a great deal of money to pay for the cost of travel, fare and for the 25 miles which must be traversed in a sleigh. Moreover, the teacher has to buy and have transported the furniture required for the house, including stove, cooking utensils, bed and bed clothing, etc., etc. The expense is so great, that a salary of $100.00 is far from excessive. As Miss Sanregret is a very capable person, I wish you to place in her hands also the supplies, stationery, medicines, etc., with whatever perquisites may be attached thereto.\n\nMiss Sanregret is entering on her duties at once.\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nArchbishop of Winnipeg.\nDear Archbishop Simonds:\n\nI have Your Grace's letter of the 5th instant, and, in reply, I am pleased to approve of the appointment of Miss May Sanregret as teacher of the new Pine Indian Day School at a salary of $100.00 per teaching month.\n\nI trust that there will be a career of much usefulness in her case and am informing Mr. Indian Agent Ogletree of the appointment and asking him to give the new incumbent every possible assistance.

Sanregret, Teacher of the Lake Manitoba Indian Day School, asking for an assistant.\n\nI quite agree with the request of Miss Sanregret. Miss Sanregret is taking a great deal of interest in this school and now has 25 children attending school and in a few days will have 30 children. Miss Sanregret is working too hard as she is alone and there is too much work for her outside of the school work. Miss Sanregret should not be here alone. I do not like the idea of young girls living on the Reserve alone; it is not right. I would recommend that an assistant be appointed at $20.00 per month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\nDr. Duncan G. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA,\n\nMy dear Dr. Scott,\n\nWith further reference to the request which I made through you for the erection of a Boarding School on the Dog Creek Indian Reserve, may I say that I have since had the occasion to visit the Reserve. It seems to me that the position is ideal for a school of this kind. There are about 30 children of school age on the Reserve. Besides these there are also on the Rbb and Flow Reserve, and besides between Lake Manitoba and Winnipeg we have Catholic Indians on the Fisher River and the Jackhead Reserves. For these latter no provision whatsoever has ever been made, and this, it seems to me, is something that should engage the consideration of the Department. Let me add that the Sandy Lake School cannot accommodate the number of children who wish to enter and who have a right to depend upon it for an elementary education.\n\nTo my mind the construction of a Boarding School at Dog Creek would meet the situation and incidentally solve some other problems. It is absolutely necessary to erect new schools and new school buildings at Dog Creek and Rbb & Flow. The old school at Rbb & Flow is literally dilapidated to the department, and there is no school residence there at all. If the Boarding School be not undertaken, then it is imperative to attend at once to the other, and that would in the end be a sheer waste of public money. Moreover, the Boarding School would relieve you, I naturally suppose, from the necessity of having a Farm Instructor and Field Matron, as the object lesson would always be before the eyes of the people.\nAll in all, the project presents itself to me as a very desirable one. This is the only request I have ever made to the Department, and I would not make it, were I not convinced that the project were worthy of favorable consideration as a matter of public utility.\n\nI beg to remain,\n\nMy dear Dr. Scott,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n+ Aloysius A. Jannett,\nArchbishop of Winnipeg.\nOttawa, April 25, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, with reference to the advisability of appointing an assistant teacher at the Lake Manitoba (Dog Creek) Indian Day School.

I am glad to know this, realizing as I do the desirable character of such premises. But I was hoping that the Department would have accepted my suggestion and request to have a Boarding School erected on the Dog Creek Reserve, which would have made unnecessary the construction now contemplated. You may remember that I wrote Dr. Scott on this matter, but never received any answer. If there is any possibility and if doing what I believe best, it would be better to delay. I wish you would take the matter up with Dr. Scott, and give him a definite final answer later. I wanted one Boarding School, which I would hope to make a pattern for all the others.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nArchbishop of Winnipeg.\nMay 31, 1927.\n\nDear Archbishop Sinnett:\n\nI have Your Grace's letter of the 23rd instant, acknowledging my communication announcing a new building at the Red and River Indian Day School and asking concerning the possibilities of a residential school on the Dog Creek Reserve.\n\nThe Department has decided to go ahead with the day school building at Red and River, as the establishment of a residential school and the provision of the necessary funds is most uncertain. There are many pressing claims on the Appropriation for Indian Education, and when the matter was brought to Dr. Scott's attention, before his departure for the Maritimes, he was not at all hopeful that favourable consideration could be given to the larger programme. As Your Grace is aware, there are several Indian residential schools where the physical equipment must be replaced and this first claim on Parliamentary Vote must be satisfied before our system can be extended.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

I wish you would take under consideration the suggestion I took the liberty of making.\n\nIn the meantime, would it be too much to ask you to grant $40.00 a month to the Assistant at that school for the current year. I have an excellent opportunity for a position who has done considerable social work among the poor in Winnipeg, especially with the newcomers to our land. She desires a salary of $20.00 a month above all her living expenses. I figure that these expenses amount to $20.00 a month more. Am I asking too much from the Department?

Six months ago the church authorities nominated another teacher for the Pine Bluff school and the Department made the appointment.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D.

I am not feeling well and I called Dr. Poyser to see me; he advised that I should not teach or play that I don't feel very good and is referring me to a specialist for X-ray and treatment. Dr. will also write to the Office or give me his certificate of ill health for the moment so I believe that a rest will help me to finish the year here.\n\nI would like to know if extended holidays will be allowed with salary. Thanking you.\n\nYours truly,\nMay J. Tamper.\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nMarch 26th 1928\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose a letter I have received from Miss May J. Sanregret, teacher of the Lake Manitoba Indian Day School, who asks for an extension of one week extra, so that she may be able to take X-ray treatment in Winnipeg during the Easter recess.\n\nI would recommend that Miss Sanregret be granted this extension by the Department for which she asks, during the Easter holiday.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nThe Asst.

Apparently, the Department has received no notice or correspondence to a proposed change in the assistant teacher at this school. Please let me have full particulars regarding the new assistant teacher and state on whose authority she was engaged. Please note that matters of this kind should be brought to our attention and our approval given before a change is made.\n\nThe cheque for Miss Sopchuk is being forwarded to you and, if it is in order, you may hand it to her.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Asst.

I will write Miss Sauregret, with regard to this matter and enquire on whose authority Miss Mary Sopchuck was engaged in place of Miss S.A. Slavin, and report to the Department.\n\nMiss Sauregret is in Winnipeg at the present time and will not return until the 16th instant, she is undergoing X-Ray treatment there.\n\nIn the mean time when the cheque is received by me for Miss Sopchuck, I will hold same until a full report is received.\n\nThe Asst.

Sanregret, on whose authority Miss Mary Sopchuck was appointed, Miss Sanregret informed me that she had authority from His Grace the Archbishop of Winnipeg, which she thought was all that was required, as the late Indian Agent Mr. Ogletree had told her that her appointment would be recommended by His Grace, but that he did not tell her it needed the approval of the Department. I understand from Miss Sanregret that Miss S.A. Slavin left the last of January and that an arrangement was made between Miss Slavin and Miss Sopchuck regarding the salary, so I have forwarded the cheque to Miss Sanregret advising her to see that the arrangements that were made are carried out.\n\nMiss Sanregret informs me that His Grace the Archbishop of Winnipeg, approves of the appointment of Miss Sopchuck to the end of the June term 1928. I also note that Miss Sopchuck qualification is only Grade VI standing.\n\nI have written Miss Sanregret, that in future when an appointment of an Assistant is made, it must have the approval of the Department, and that all business in connection with her school must be done through this Office.\n\nThe Asst.

His Grace, the Archbishop of Winnipeg, has written to ask for a well for the use of our school. We are using the little water there is in our well, which water is practically unfit to drink. We are forced to mix milk\nthis water for drinking purposes. The Farm Instructor of this Reserve (Mr. B. G. Johnson) was posted to the office of Mr. J. Waite, that we were distilling liquor and Mr. Waite sent the R.C.M.P. with a warrant to search our house; he found fruit juice, but Mr. Waite should know that we are not of the class that distills liquor. I consider it an insult on our dignity to have sent a detective in our house without demanding an explanation as to the origins of the story.\n\nI demand an apology in writing from both Mr. J. Waite, Indian Agent at Portage la Prairie, Man., and from Mr. B. G. Johnson, Indian Farm Instructor, Big Rock Indian Reserve, a copy of which has to be sent to the headquarters Office of the R.C.M.P. at Winnipeg.\n\nWould you kindly Sir, give this same attention, as I am very anxious not to lose my prestige with the Indians of our Reserve.

The fathers are going away this afternoon; they will take this letter, I hope.\n\nNow we are in great distress over an incident and Father Kalmin allowed me to tell Your Grace.\n\nThe water from our well is not fit to drink while there is very little, if not enough for our use. We need to put plum juice in the water to drink it. One evening Mr. Moore from Bridgeland stopped at our house.\nand we gave him some of this brandy wine\nto drink somebody came and watched\nthrough the window an Indian probably\nwho reported to the farm Inspector that he\nhad seen our house some kind of liquor\nThe F. Inspector reported to the Indian agent\nthat we had been here in our house the\nagent sent the mounted Police to search\nour house; he did not find anything\nof course but our places I think it is\nan insult from the agent to have done\nthis without asking us first if there was\nany ground for such a story.\nI am writing to Dr Scott telling him\nthe facts but would you have kindly\nwrite also so Dr Scott will know that\nwe are not hiding the facts from him\nand he will give you there the attention\nthat this case requires. I demand a reply\ngive in writing from both Mr White and Mr.\nJohnson saying so in my letter from Dr.\nScott.

The incident, of which Miss Sauregret complains, is a very painful one. The accusation that two young ladies of excellent character were keeping or making \"hemp-brew\" is so absurd that the Agent should not have believed it for a moment and should not have insulted them by sending the Mounted Police to make a search of the premises. He owes them an apology.\n\nYour Farm Instructor on this Reserve has been making it very difficult and very disagreeable for Miss Sauregret.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\nArchbishop of Winnipeg.\nCOPY\n\nINDIAN OFFICE\n\nAt Vogar No., Man.,\nOct. 24/28.\n\nJ.

She gave him the wine on Sept. 25th, and he told us about it on October 5th, when he came to the Reserve again.\n\nI do not think Mr. Knox will deny this, as my wife and I heard him make the statement in our house, and he might have known that he was telling me something that I had to take up.\n\nKnowing that there was wine in the teacher's house on September 25th, I would think it proper to search the house now for further evidence.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n(Sgd) R.G.

Manitoba District.\nActing on instructions received from the Officer Commanding Manitoba District, on the afternoon of the 13th inst., I proceeded by C.B.R. to Brickdale, Man., and on the following morning by hired livery to the residence of the farm instructor Dog Creek Indian Reserve, for the purpose of investigating a complaint that the above named Mr. Sanregret, teacher residing on the Reserve, had made wine and got drunk.\n\nI first interviewed Mr. J. Knox, Riverman, Brickdale, Man., who was reported by Mr. Johnson, farm instructor to the Reserve, as having told him in the presence of Johnson's wife, that he had received a drink of wine at the teacher's residence. Knox stated that the drink he received from the teacher's residence was nothing more than fruit juice and water, jokingly referred to by the teacher and her maid as their wine, and that knowing the teacher and Mr. Johnson did not pull well together, he had asked Mr. Johnson if he had tried the teacher's wine and told he had had a short of it for a joke, not dreaming that Johnson would take him seriously. I later took a statement from Mr. Knox to this effect.\n\nOn arriving at the Reserve I proceeded to the Instructor's residence, and informing him of Mr. Knox's statement, asked him what other information he had regarding the teacher having got drunk, and whether the Indians had reported this. He informed me that some time back Miss Sanregret herself had told his wife that she had fixed up some plum juice which she was drinking it she had started to laugh and could not stop, this was the only information he had and he did not want his wife's name brought into the matter.\n\nI then proceeded to the teacher's residence, and without giving her any names, told her that a complaint had been made that she was making wine and that the best way to clear the matter up was for me to search the premises, she I did but found no wine.\n\nMiss Sanregret declared that there never had been any intoxicating liquor on the premises since she had resided there, and on being asked if she had ever fixed up any fruit juice she stated that the water was not fit to drink and that to make it palatable she had added fruit juice from preserved fruits, or rather she added a stock, and she thought she might have given rise to the story. I obtained a statement from her to this effect.\n\nStatements from Miss Sanregret and Mr. Knox attached.\n\nW.J. Conner\nP.O. Box 2680\n\nIndian Affairs.

Miss Sanregret claims that she cannot get along with her assistant, Miss Dubriel, and gives this as her reason for resigning. I have had considerable trouble at this school, Miss Sanregret cannot get along with the Farm Instructor, on the reserve, and I am convinced that the man has done all in his power to please her. She is very exacting and it is impossible to satisfy her. During the period of her stay on the reserve she has had four assistant teachers, Misses Koraski, Slavin, Bochuk and the present Miss Dubriel, the three teachers previous to Miss Dubriel left because they could not get along with Miss Sanregret. During my last visit to the reserve, Miss Dubriel complained to me that Miss Sanregret was making things very unpleasant for her within view to having to resign. I interviewed both parties, and the matter was patched up. Miss Dubriel appears a very quiet capable girl, and I would not think her of a quarrelsome disposition. Miss Sanregret has done very good work on the reserve with the children, she resigned from her duties last summer term, and I persuaded her to continue. I would strongly recommend that Miss Sanregret resignation be accepted by the Department, a teacher will have to be appointed to take her place, as Miss Dubriel does not hold a certificate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst.

Sonregret in which she informs the Department that she has, on your instructions, returned and taken up duties as teacher of the Lake Manitoba (Dog Creek) Indian Day School. I may say that the Department accepted the resignation of Miss Sonregret to take effect on the 31st of March, last, and His Grace the Archbishop of Winnipeg was informed accordingly. The Department received complaints from time to time regarding the lack of merit in the work of Miss Sonregret and that she was unable to work in harmony with her associates. For this reason it was thought advisable to accept her resignation.\n\nHowever, as it appears from Miss Sonregret's letter that she has returned and resumed duties, the Department will allow her to remain as teacher during the balance of the present school year, viz., to June 30th, next, after which date her services should terminate. This will give you an opportunity to make enquiries and nominate the services of a qualified teacher to take charge of this school when it reopens after the summer holidays, or about September 1st, next. I shall be pleased if, in due time, you will forward the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher whom you recommend.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nThe Right Rev.

At present time we have the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School and the Kibb and Ploy Indian Day School and a combined school at Crane River. In addition, there is the Lake Manitoba Indian Day School on the Dog Creek Reserve, on the eastern shore of the lake.\n\nAs I understand it, the buildings at the Sandy Bay Residential School are in fair shape, but the water supply is bad. Further, there is not sufficient accommodation there for the Roman Catholic children of the area who require residential school training. Your 309-11A R.C. 2, of September 16th, last, recommends that if the Sandy Bay School is to be rebuilt a better site should be secured. Good farm land and good water are of prime importance, and these are not found at the present site.\n\nI may add, in confidence, that the Church is asking for the establishment of a new residential school on the Dog Creek Reserve. This request is not sponsored by any of the Missionary Orders and\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6237, file 521-1, part 1)\nI do not know what arrangements could be made for its conduct, if granted. Our census shows about 51 children of school age there.\n\nOn the four reserves around the lake, there are apparently 178 children of school age. Approximately 130 of these would be physically fit for residential school training. The Susseete but one school for the district. As the Ojibaws are already associated with us in the conduct of the Sandy Bay School, I am inclined towards continuing the association by asking them to manage a new school. The next question is when should it be constructed\u2014in other words, how long can the existing school be used? Lately, the Department has asked the Indian Agent to investigate if deep or artesian wells have been successful in this area. This might solve the problem of drinking water.\n\nI should like you to let me have a general report and recommendation in this connection. The day schools in operation are fairly successful and might be allowed to continue for the time being.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nMay 13, 1930.\n\nDear Archbishop Simott:\n\nI have discussed with the Minister the question of a residential school on the Dog Creek Reserve and, as I anticipated, it was impossible to do anything at the present time.

That I suggested was not a large and expensive school, but a building that would suitably accommodate about 75 children. I have just returned from spending a few days on that Reserve, and I feel that a great deal can be done for the Indians there, to make them independent and self-reliant. To me this Reserve offers the best opportunity for work in behalf of the Indians.\n\nI dare hope that you will be able to recommend this to the Minister and that something will be done without delay.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nArchbishop of Winnipeg.\n\nIndian Affairs.

There are so many pressing claims on the appropriation for Indian Education, that any extension of the work must be given very careful consideration. The future of the Sandy Bay Residential School should be considered in this connection. The Oblate Order is urging a new and larger building. I do not know when funds can be provided to satisfy this need; but I am free to state that the Department's policy is to put our existing institutions into good condition before establishing new ones. I shall give Your Grace's suggestion consideration when the future programme is being determined.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nMost Rev. Alfred A. Simnett, D.D.,\nArchbishop of Winnipeg,\n355 St. Mary's Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nMy dear Dr. Scott,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 21st instant.\n\nIt does not appear to me to be wise to extend the Sandy Bay School. Your Indian agent at Portage la Prairie is of opinion that the Reserve should be moved farther North. I am not absolutely familiar with conditions, but this Reserve has always impressed me as having very little to commend it. If a suitable locality could be found elsewhere, it might be advisable to endeavor to move the Indians. With this prospect as a possibility, it would scarcely be wise to enlarge the school just now.\n\nBut this has nothing to do with my petition for a small school on the Dog Creek Reserve. I cannot thank you for your assurance that you are going to give my letter \"consideration\". I have received no such \"consideration\" from the Indian Department, that I am satisfied with it. I would like a little action, if I am to continue to take any interest in the Indians; I do not make these remarks to be insulting, but I am merely stating fact.\n\nMay I add that the Sandy Bay and the Pine Creek (Groserville) Schools are in my jurisdiction. In these matters you deal, I understand, with the authority of the Church, and there is no one at Ottawa or elsewhere who is authorized to act for me.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nArchbishop of Winnipeg.\n\nIndian Affairs.

You have always been so kind to me and our relations have been so friendly that it would hurt deeply to seem even to be wanting in appreciation of your good nature.\n\nI was annoyed though, and I confess I am still. Two years ago or more, I submitted the project of a school on the Dog Creek Reserve to the Department and to the Minister personally. Nothing was done. Now I am told that the Department is considering the advisability of enlarging the School at Sandy Bay. The very reason why I wanted the Department to build a school at Dog Creek is that I considered it very foolish to enlarge the School at Sandy Bay where there is no promise and very little opportunity to better the material welfare of the Indians.\n\nI sincerely hope that the Department will see the good reasons back of my petition and that it will be able to proceed with the work during the coming summer.\n\nI remain, My dear Scott,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nArchbishop of Winnipeg.\n\nDr. Duncan C.

I have indeed endeavoured to meet Your Grace's wishes in every way, as I know how interested you are in the Indians, and I know also that your recommendations are well considered; however, the experience of the Department and the Churches has shown that it is not economical to have small Residential Schools. When I said that the matter would be considered, I meant that your views would be sympathetically considered, and your suggestion that we should not enlarge the school at Sandy Bay will have due weight. At the same time I cannot hold out hope that we will be able to get any further appropriation for education in the Estimates for the current year. We are building two new schools for Roman Catholic children to take the place of dilapidated and antiquated buildings, one near St. Paul de Metis, Alberta, and the other on the Muscowequan Reserve, near Eastend, Sask. Although my Minister is generous in his Estimates presented to Parliament, we have such heavy demands on us for medical and hospital services and general relief, that it is difficult to get full supply for our varied needs.\n\nWith the kindest regards, and thanking you for your letters, I am\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nMost Rev.

Miss Weber is a beginner and has been in charge only a short time. She is using the lessons or methods given in Normal School. Experience will help her to adapt these to the Indian child.\n\nMiss Weber and her assistant seem to manage quite well. They are comfortably housed and seem to enjoy their work.

Probably you must have it in hands.\n\nHis Grace Archbishop SIENOTT, who had engaged her, is willing to accept this resignation and charged me to look for somebody fit for the job.\n\nIf you have no objection, I would be pleased that the Department engage Mrs. L. VAUDRY, actually 2-186 Provencher Ave., St-BONIFACE, who would be free for coming after the Christmas vacation time when start the resignation. This Lady is a widow, all qualified for that kind of work, old however in good health and strong and of a very good morality. She is capable, and aside of her work for nursing she would willingly show sewing to the girls. I personally think that this lady will be of a great help in the Reserve. She knows already enough\nRe. Miss Doiron - (continued)\n\nof the work in the Reserves because a great number of years ago had worked with an old Missionary, Rev. Vales, principal at Fort Alexander.\n\nShe will agree better with Miss Weber than did Miss Doiron, enacting rather like a Mother to her. And if later on a man will teach she will be more easily associated with him than a young girl.\n\nNow, kindly advise me as soon as possible about this arrangement, giving me the probable answer of the Department as well as the amount paid in wages and conditions.\n\nI am indeed anxious to know all that in a way that we do not lose any time and be able to fix everything before the time appointed by you for undertaking the work, so I was advised by the Inspector HAMILTON.\n\nExpecting a favorable answer, I remain Sir, yours respectfully,\n\nRev.

In view of this relatively small enrolment it is exceedingly difficult to justify the employment of two teachers at this school. It is just possible, of course, that one of the teachers, probably the assistant, is engaged in welfare work or in providing nursing service on the reserve. If such is the case, this teacher, in my judgment, should be paid from either the Medical or the Welfare Vote. We have Indian day schools in the Dominion at this date with an average of 25 pupils, with one teacher in charge. It would be appreciated, therefore, if you could send forward in due course a report on this school and conditions on the reserve and a definite recommendation with respect to the employment of the assistant teacher.\n\nR.

Charlie Paul was with me and Elmo Heywood was there. Charlie Sutherland asked me to go with him but I told him that I was going with Jim Paul. We went to Charlie's place to look for a horse and Elmo Heywood was there. Charlie Sutherland went to the church. Jim Paul went to Jim Paul's place and I went to the church. Elmo had a horse and he told me to ride the horse. I went toward Jim Paul's place and met Jim Paul. Jim Paul told me to go and get a knife from Charlie Heywood's place. He wanted to cut the hobble off his horse's legs. I went out and got the knife and came back to the church. I met Charlie Sutherland by the church. He told me to watch the church. Elmo Heywood was there. We walked down the road back to the church. I heard Charlie Sutherland talking to someone near the church. I went inside the house and yelled out and I saw Charlie Sutherland coming down the road past Louis Chippeau's place. He said, \"There is Elmo.\" I told him I hadn't seen Elmo. Charlie said, \"Let's go and look for him.\" We met him by the church. Jim Sutherland called Elmo over to him and they talked together but I could not hear what they said.\n\nElmo Heywood called me. He said to me, \"Do you want a drink?\" I said, \"That kind of beer have you got?\" Jim Sutherland said it was just beer.\n\nElmo said to Jim Sutherland, \"Let's drink with Jim Paul too.\" Sutherland said, \"No. If we give him to drink Jim Paul will fight us when he gets drunk.\" Elmo said, \"No, he won't fight us.\"\n\nElmo Heywood came and called me. I went outside and talked to Elmo. Jim Paul and Jim Sutherland went into the house. Elmo left and Jim Sutherland went back for Jim Paul and Jim Sutherland. We found him in the house. They had two 20 oz bottles of Bright's Wine. They had drunk some out of one bottle. The rest of us drank the two bottles of wine. Jim Sutherland went into the house and came back in about five or ten minutes with two more bottles of wine. We drank them. Then Jim Paul went with Jim Sutherland and in about ten minutes they brought back all bottles of wine. They gave us two bottles to drink and we were the six Elmo and Jim Paul and Jim Sutherland kept one bottle each back in the house. We drank all the wine out of the six bottles.

The east door had been forced by breaking some framework near the back and breaking the window glass. One 20 gallon jug and fourteen 30 oz. bottles of Mass wine were stolen.\n\nThe Virginia, Joseph, and Father Archibald had left the premises on Sunday, July 15th, 1946, at about 6:00 P.M. We returned at about 11:30 P.M. on the following Monday. At this time I noticed the school had been entered. I notified the police at Asham by letter on July 15th, 1946.\n\nI secured the window again by driving a nail in each side of the back and fastening the closed door with heavier wire. Everything else was left the way we found it as much as possible.\n\nOn Monday, July 16th, 1946, the windows were again left alone when we were absent from 11:30 A.M. to 6:30 P.M., then Father Archibald was coming to supper at about 7:00 P.M. He saw Jimmy Smith on the road talking to Jimmy Paul. Jimmy Paul was intoxicated.\n\nHe then checked the school and saw that the north west window was again missing. A large piece of glass had been broken enabling the intruder to glance inside to see what was in the safe. The cupboard at the back of the school had been forced open in the same manner as on the previous occasion.\n\nTen 20 oz. bottles of Mass wine were taken from the cabinet.\n\nJimmy Paul and Jimmy Sutherland are suspects in this matter. Jimmy Sutherland was seen by Elizabeth Ann, Mrs. Louis Gippins and Sheila Paul, Willie Baptiste and Mrs. Charlie Baptiste, drinking and gambling along the road on Saturday night.\n\nOn July 17th, 1946, we returned early from Asham. We spoke with the police. I noticed a small hole in one of the school seats. This hole had been kept in the cabinet and had been in its original position. It must have been caused by whoever broke into the school.\n\nSgd. Mr. K. Harpster.\n\n1. The Lake Manitoba Bay School is a 20' x 24' frame building. The door is on the south side. There are two windows 30\" x 36\" on the south side. On the east side are four very small windows. On the west side are four windows each with 10 lights measuring 12\" x 12\". The most northerly of these latter windows is very badly had been made. There are several small marks on the window such that it had been painted. The window glass was carefully searched for possible fingerprints but with negative results. No other objects could be found in the school on which the culprit might have left prints. The present outside of the building is entirely covered with grass and vegetation. No evidence. Neither could any useful impression be found within the building.\n\n2. Several small markings were noted on the cabinet door, possibly made with the blade of a knife or similar instrument. As far as can be ascertained there was nothing stolen other than the wine mentioned in the statement of Mr. K. Harpster. The missing wine is valued at $2.00.\n\n3. A one gallon jug approximately one-third full of wine was handed in the police by Mr. K. Harpster.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This with negative results. However, while I was returning to headquarters, on the evening of the 31st, June, 1945, I observed this subject around the Westhorne Hotel, at Portage-Blanchard, Man., he was subsequently placed under arrest. Arrested in the above connection being in my possession at the time, and he was escorted to Portage La Prairie, Man.\n\nWhile at Portage the writer questioned young SUTHERLAND in the above matter, and after he was given the usual Police warning, the following signed statement was obtained from him:\n\n\"I am twenty-two years of age. That I was at the Dog Creek Reserve a short time ago, Norman BAPTISTE, Lawrence SUTHERLAND, my brother and I were together. Norman BAPTISTE told me he had bought wine, half a case, six bottles of wine at the Indian School.\n\nThe three of us went to the school three days after this. Norman came out window on the North side, first window, he came in first, followed by myself and I went in.

The foregoing statement is submitted for what it is worth; however there is a possibility that Norman BAPTISTE, Lawrence SUTHERLAND, brother of this subject, were also in on this matter. SUTHERLAND claims that BAPTISTE was the one who broke the school window and went into the school first.\n\n5. In accordance with instructions of the Officer in Charge, Winnipeg Detachment, I obtained the Constable I/a Ashburn Detachment, from Portage La Prairie, Man., to learn what an escort might be provided for this subject. Oct. 25th, I/a Ashburn Det., stated that he had court on the 23rd, Inc., and therefore would not be able to come to Portage, and requested that the writer take SUTHERLAND to Winnipeg, Man.\n\n6. While in touch with Oct. 25th I also informed him that SUTHERLAND was accompanied by a Frank PAUL, aforementioned, but Oct. 25th stated that he was not believed to be involved, and therefore he was not held.\n\n7. I later contacted the Winnipeg Detachment, for instructions as to the escort of SUTHERLAND, and was later advised to escort him to the Vaughan Street Jail. Said instructions being complied with, and prisoner turned over to the authorities at the said Jail, together with the warrant to apprehend, and receipted, which was signed by the Judge on file at this office, patrol having been made per P.C. 88134.\n\n8. While I was in contact with Oct. 25th I informed him that SUTHERLAND had stated that Norman BAPTISTE had broken into the Indian School, accompanied by James SUTHERLAND and Lawrence SUTHERLAND.\n\n9.

SUTHERLAND was given the usual warning after which the following statement was obtained:\n\nSTATEMENT OF JAMES SUTHERLAND, 28-8-46.\n\n(a) On a Saturday about two weeks after Treaty Time at about 3 o'clock in the afternoon Norman Baptiste met me by the church on Rato Manitoba Indian Reserve. Norman said he was looking for me. I asked him why and he said 'I got some drink for you'. I started asking him questions and he told me that there were 50 Indians inside the school. He said that there was a case of beer there too.\n\n(b) Norman and I walked north on the road and met my brother, Lawrence Sutherland, near Louis Chipman's place. The 3 of us went into the bush and Norman Baptiste gave us a gallon jug of wine. Norman had a couple of bottles of wine besides. We drank some of the wine out of the gallon jug and hid the rest of it in the bush.\n\n(c) The 3 of us then went to the school. Norman Baptiste took a stone and broke the glass in the first window from the south side. He put a piece of cordwood against the wall under the window and climbed up and stood on the window sill. He put his hand in through the hole and turned the lock off. Then he pulled out two 3 inch nails that were put in the top of the window. He pushed them back and forth with his hand until they came loose. Then he pushed the window up and went in through.\n\n(d) Lawrence climbed a tree and I went in last. We were in the school about 10 minutes. Norman told me that when he got the first jug and a half on case of wine, one cover was cracked out of the window glass and he stuck his finger in to turn the lock off. The nails weren't in the window that time.\n\n(e) Norman had opened the cupboard at the back of the school when I came in. Norman was pulling boxes out from the far side of the cupboard. We took out 24 bottles of wine and one case of beer. We left the bottle of wine in the cupboard. Lawrence jumped out the window first. I followed him and Norman handed the wine and the beer to us. Norman said, 'Father Archbold must be bootlegging'.\n\n(f) We put one case of wine and the case of beer by a cordwood pile near the school, inside the fence. About 10 minutes later we came and got it and took it into the bush where we were drinking it. George Swan came and was drinking with all of us. After that Norman went away and got Jim Paul. Jim Paul was drinking with us. We also bought the case of beer and 3 bottles of wine for Sunday. Ernest Hayter-adding came after Jim Paul and was drinking with us.\n\n(g) On Sunday morning Jim Paul sent George Swan to get the case wine from the school. George Swan brought it back and Norman Baptiste took it away from him. Norman said, '...\nJames SHERMAN is at present lodged in Red Lake Jail awaiting trial. On May 4th, he was remanded in custody to appear in Provincial Police Court at Winnipeg, Man., on Saturday, May 12th, 1945. Further remands will be necessary as more formal charges appear in Provincial Police Court at Red Lake, Man., on Saturday, May 12th, 1945. The C.P.C. at Red Lake was verbally advised accordingly on May 4th.\n\nInvestigations are being continued and it is expected that further action will be taken immediately.

It is further noted that at the time he saw SUTHERLAND was wearing a cap, not at the time he met him (see report dated 12-8-45) that SUTHERLAND bought a grey tweed cap from L. LEVI at the time he cashed the first cheque on the 23-8-45. May an effort be made to obtain further description of this cap from SUTHERLAND, please.\n\n8. It is noted that SUTHERLAND does not desire to enter possession herein; it is known, however, that he has been writing registered letters to BILL HAYES, of Elkdale, in an effort to recover his money. HILLIARD, of Elkdale, has expressed a desire to prosecute SUTHERLAND and will lay the necessary charges. It is advised that evidence is sufficient. It is considered here that the evidence of HAYES is necessary. Further, an attempt to make by Troheme detachment to arrange to have SUTHERLAND attend a hearing to identify this suspect. It is not known how far it would be more conveniently arranged by conveying SUTHERLAND to Redding by bus, or conveying SUTHERLAND to the Troheme district; this matter will be discussed at D.R.O. next patrol.\n\n9. Please refer to file number: \"James SUTHERLAND (Trenty Indians), Rogers, Man. - R.C. & Theft from School House (460)\" (APP 300-45, MINT, File 45-8-45). SUTHERLAND was arrested at Redding on the 23-8-45 but has been released in custody from week to week since that time. This other case is ready for hearing at Elkdale on the 25th-8-45, which being the regular Court day in this district. This matter will be discussed with Crown Counsel. It probably can be arranged to have this other case heard and sentence passed; this will give ample opportunity to prepare evidence in the second case, if a verdict of 'guilty' is found.\n\n10. A LETTER of Timmins, Man., will again be interviewed and his desires as to matters of prosecution determined and an effort made to obtain some evidence of value from him. From his attitude previously (see Larson) took it that he was afraid to take any action for fear of possible retaliation or other reasons.\n\n11. The items obtained from LEVI, the cheque obtained from SUTHERLAND, and sample of handwriting obtained from SUTHERLAND are being forwarded to the Scientific Laboratory at Regina by registered mail, even date. Three copies of letter which accompanies them herewith.\n\n12. May this file be again referred to Troheme Detachment for actions requested at paragraphs 8, 9 and 10.\n\n13.

The cases here refer to the forgery and uttering of 2 cheques, the first offence of uttering having apparently taken place within the City of Winnipeg, at the store of A. Levi, Toby's Clothes Shop, 491 Main St., Winnipeg; and the second offence of uttering occurring at Troehorn, Manitoba at the store of W. Delmar Huston.\nAlthough the Indians did not actually say his name was Bill Smith, he applied the name \"Bill Smith\" from the Registration Form and confirmed that name very illegibly on the back of the cheque. However, he did not take particular notice of the Registration Form other than to sign it. The name was neatly made out and the signature \"Bill Smith\" was very legible, and he knew the name because another's name had been written by the Indians as he had difficulty even spelling the name.\n\nThe name of the Royal Bank of Canada Cheque was neatly made out, dated July 26th, 1945 for $50.00, but the signature on the Tricentennial return stamp was very poorly signed \"Bill Smith\" or \"Bill Miller\" and could seem to have been written in the same handwriting as was the endorsement on the back.\n\nHe made sure that the Indians got on the bus going to Winnipeg the same morning (July 26th) but the Bradshaw Bus Agent at this point does not remember so long ago, selling the required tickets.\n\nA number of Indians are now harvesting in this district and Mr. Baldwin, who is from the Dog Creek Reservation, said he knew the Indians but has not seen him around this district.\n\nMr. Baldwin definitely does not wish to lay a charge and requested that the attached cheque be returned as soon as it had served its purpose.\n\nContinued enquiries will be made and should further information be obtained an immediate report will be submitted. In the meantime this file will be closed as concluded at this point.\n\nCopy of photograph of James O'Mahoney returned to Bradshaw Office, hereunto.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6237, file 521-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\n\nPool Copy\nIn reference to the above, I have to report that on this date Mr. Johnson (name) visited me regarding the $50.00 cheque which he had cashed.\n\nThe following self explanatory statement was taken from Mr. Johnson:\n\nOn the afternoon of Sunday, July 24th, 1965, an Indian or Indians came into the store. He was about 30 - 35 years old, with no distinguishing facial characteristics, wearing a cap and I don't remember how else he was described. He wanted to get a cheque cashed and showed me a cheque and produced a Registration Form as supplied by a Post Office where a Registration Certificate is issued. The name on this form was \"Bill Miller\" and was signed by Mr. Johnson. The cheque was one of the Royal Bank of Canada, Halifax, Nova Scotia Branch, NS, and it had an Erickdale return business stamp on the face of it. The Erickdale return stamp had the signature of either \"Bill Miller\" or \"Bill Miller\". This Indian who presented himself as Bill Miller endorsed the cheque on the back by signing the name \"Bill Miller\" from the Registration Form in his possession. At that time I thought this was a legitimate cheque and signed the Registration Form and placed the name \"Bill Miller\" on it as the Indians signature didn't compare very well with the writing of the name on the Registration Form.\n\nI turned the cheque into the Bank of Commerce, Erickdale, NS, the same day, July 24th, 1965. Later it was returned from Winnipeg with the notation \"no authority to sign\".\n\nI wrote a registered letter dated August 1st to Bill Miller, Erickdale, NS, and received notification that said letter had been delivered to Mr. Miller, Erickdale, NS. I am now holding Mr. Miller responsible for the delivery of my letter so he apparently received it at the Erickdale Post Office.\n\nThe Indians bought a pair of black jeans pants and a work shirt - color unknown. I think he got on the bus which left Erickdale at 11:30 A.M. each morning.\n\nThe cheque I gave over to the police is the cheque received from the man in question.\n\nMr. Miller was shown a group of photographs of Indians, Indian breeds and white persons. Among these was a photo of James SUTHERLAND, which SUTHERLAND picked up being a good resemblance of the man who came into our store. Mr. SUTHERLAND could not describe the man other than being a young Indian of medium stature, but he thinks it likely that he would recognize him if seen again.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This fact dispelled Sutherland's statement wherein he says that he bought the ticket at Kirkdale on Friday, July 26th, 1948.\n\nOn July 26th, John Sutherland, Kirkdale, was contacted and from him it was learned that James Sutherland came to Sutherland's farm which is situated one mile east and one mile north of Kirkdale, Man., on Sunday, July 26th, 1948. Sutherland stated that he arrived at Sutherland's farm after which he left. On Monday, July 27th, 1948, about ten minutes before train time, James Sutherland approached John Sutherland at his residence in Kirkdale and borrowed the train ticket. Sutherland stated that he was going to look for work and did not have the required amount of money to buy his ticket. This definitely establishes that James Sutherland was in the vicinity of Kirkdale, Man., about the time that Sutherland's garage was entered.\n\nFurther investigation has been conducted by the results of the inquiries being conducted by Troopers Detachment. When the said information is received the indicated action for the furtherance of this case will be undertaken as expeditiously as possible.\n\nInvestigation will be continued and further report submitted in due course.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6237, file 521-1, part 2)\nFurther to the above and marginally noted previous reports, on 23-8-45 James BURNHAM was interviewed at Headingley Gaol in connection with the embezzlement of funds. BURNHAM denied all knowledge of the matter. The following statement concerning BURNHAM's movements during the time in question was obtained from him:\n\n\"I left the Treaty Grounds about four o'clock on Sunday afternoon and went to Eriksdale on Aikins' wood truck. Then I went back with a man from the Narrows, with a Model A Ford car. I got off after we had passed Vegar and walked to Headingley. I got there in the evening. I got a ride in a horse to Spruceville. I stayed there two nights. I came back from Spruceville on a truck with a green box and green ash and went to Winnipeg. I went back to Eriksdale the same day with an Asham truck. I went to Douglas with a car from Douglas. I slept in Bob Kingsley's barn that night and walked to Eriksdale next morning. On Friday morning I bought a ticket at the station to go to Winnipeg. I paid for the ticket a one dollar bill. I finally sent three, five cents. I got a second ticket and bought a ticket. I got a paper from the conductor on the train and took it to the Indian Office in Winnipeg. They gave me another paper which I took to the railway station and I got 60\u00a2 back.\n\n\"I took the moonlight train the same day to Victoria Beach. I stayed there a week and a half and came back to Winnipeg on the train. I took the Brandon bus to St. Claude, about 14 miles east of Thompson. I got a ride on a truck to Thompson. I slept there by night. I bought a ticket to Winnipeg. In fact, I came back to Winnipeg next day. I took the moonlight train to Grand Beach the same day. I picked berries there. I was there a week and two days. I came back to Winnipeg and the same night I went to Gladstone on a truck from Dauphin. I got a ride from Gladstone with the priest from Sandy Bay. This was on Saturday. On Monday night about 4 o'clock the policeman picked me up at Northcote.\"\n\nOn 23-8-45, an identification line-up was arranged at Headingley Gaol, consisting of eight Indians including James BURNHAM. Mr. A. Levie, of Toby's Clothes Shop, 400 Main St., Winnipeg, Man., where one of the forged cheques was purchased, examined this line-up but he was unable to identify the person who had signed the cheque.\n\nOn 24-8-45, inquiries were made at the Indian Affairs Office in Winnipeg with a view of ascertaining the date of James BURNHAM's departure from Eriksdale, though the receipt he received to apply for a refund on his ticket. This office had no record of such matters. However, further...\nWith reference to the report in the above connection of the Ashern Detachment dated the 10th instant, wherein mention is made of Thomas SUTHERLAND, Great Falls, Montana, in the case, possibly being at Great Falls, I have to report that inquiries at Great Falls revealed that SUTHERLAND has not been in that district since 1944. However, it was learned that he was in Winnipeg about a month ago and left for Westbourne, Manitoba in company with Frank PAUL and George SHAN, both Treaty Indians from the Big Creek Reserve. Within the last ten days SHAN and PAUL have returned to Winnipeg, and stated that SUTHERLAND was arrested by the police at Westbourne.\n\nThis latter information was obtained from Mrs. William Paul of Great Falls, who had been told by Mrs. Adolf Nelsonson, 300 Pacific Avenue, Winnipeg, mother of George SHAN. If necessary, this woman could be interviewed in Winnipeg for further information, if SUTHERLAND has not yet been apprehended.\n\nSIGNED (Lac du Bonnet).\n\nE.S.I. (Ashern).\n\nThe Cst.

This man is the subject of File No. 456 handed \"Jones, William, Treaty Indian, Togo, N.C., R.C. & Theft from School House, Sec. 450 C.O.C.\" in connection with which warrant to apprehend has been issued.\n\n2. May File herein please be referred to Tribune Department so that Mr. Oliver Norton may be interviewed and a description of the person who gave him the cheque obtained, and inquiries made in an effort to locate this person. It is also desired that the cheque held by Norton be obtained for comparison purposes as to signature, and to establish if it's origin as Mr. Hollister has mixed only one blank cheque from the cheque-book in the trunk of his garage (vide para. 3 of this report).\n\n3. May enquiries please be made in the Great Falls District by Lee du Pont's Information and should Norton be located he should be apprehended and held on the warrant mentioned in para. 2 above.\n\n4. Investigation is being continued here to locate Jones otherwise and also to determine the wrote out the body of the cheque. Extra copies of this report attached hereto, together with Form 249 # 31/48 covering the cheque held by Mr. Norton. No charge has been laid to date but it is understood that should the perpetrator of this offence be located, the required action will be taken by the complainant.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nwho was purchased a cheque in the amount of $250.00 drawn on the William and Ethel Branch of the Royal Bank of Canada stamped with \"Bill Smith\" and signed by \"Bill Smith\".\n\nI communicated this news to the William and Ethel Branch of the Royal Bank of Canada and informed them about the cheque. They also signed it on the back using the name \"Bill Smith\". So they obtained all the $250.00 from the bank.\n\nThe cheque has been returned to me by the bank. Reason for return being that it was signed by an unauthorized person. If the responsible person is located I would lay a charge against him. This cheque which I am handling to the police today is the cheque this man had.\n\nSgd: A. Levi,\nOff: A.O. Levi, etc.\n\nA group of eight photographers of Indians and half-breeds, including that of James Smithson, was shown to me. In an effort to have him identify the man who gave him the cheque, Mr. Levi could not definitely determine if one of these men might be the guilty party but he is of the opinion that he could recognize the man if he saw him in person.\n\nAs indicated in Mr. Levi's statement the cheque was handed to the witness. The body of the cheque is made out in such a manner that a handwriting analysis would be difficult. It is signed in different handwriting styles. The signature is so cursive that it cannot be identified. The signature is similar to the signatures that are used in the names.\n\nThis date Mr. Levi, Agent, C.M.R., Station agent at Brantford, Ont., was contacted and it was ascertained that an Indian man had been reported as being about 30 years of age purchased a single ticket ticket for the name \"Bill Smith\", with 10 copper and the remainder in coins, was one or two 50 pieces. The price of the ticket is $25.00. The Indian did not have the required amount to purchase the ticket and went out to borrow $25.00. The person from whom he obtained this money has not been located to date. The Indian obtained a receipt from the Station agent for the ticket in order that he might apply to the Indian Office for a refund as provided by the special travelling rules. No further details are available. Mr. Levi thinks that the purchase of the name \"Bill Smith\" was made by an Indian applicant for the refund, the name can be definitely established by obtaining the receipt from the Indian Office at Windsor, Ont.\n\nJames Smithson seems to be the most logical suspect in this matter. He had not been seen in this district since 1877-78. It is rumored by the Indians of Lake Simcoe that he was last seen in the area of the Severn Valley, Ont. Any information relative to his whereabouts will be appreciated.\n\nPhoto no. 1499 and is described as follows: Native Indian, age 30 yrs, height 5'6\", weight 150 lbs., complexion dark, hair black, smooth head, clean shaven, eyes brown, nose narrow, slight\n\nIndian Affairs.

With reference to the above, on 1-6-46, Mr. John Baldwin of Edmonton returned to Calgary, Alta., and filed this office with a complaint regarding the loss of his cash from the Royal Bank of Canada, Calgary, Alberta, and the subsequent theft. These charges were signed by Mr. Baldwin, the Chief Inspector, in the amount of $500.00, and endorsed by Mr. Baldwin. The second was in the amount of $200.00 and was endorsed by Mr. Baldwin.\n\n2. Mr. Baldwin arrived back on Tuesday, July 24th, 1946, that he arrived at his garage in the morning, he noticed that an envelope containing machine gun parts which he had lost on his office desk on the previous Monday night had been removed from the desk and the form enclosed therein back of the desk. Further examination revealed that a $50.00 roll of notes and about five worth of 25\u00a2 and 5\u00a2 postage stamps were missing from the desk and about $100 or $150 in currency was missing from the till. No other money had been lost for the till.\n\n3. The premises were searched between 9:00 p.m. on Saturday, July 24th, and Tuesday morning, July 26th, through a stage at the back of the garage which was broken previously, thinking that the offense might have been committed by small boys from around Calgary. Mr. Baldwin made inquiries at the scene to ascertain if anyone had been in possession of a large amount of money or currency. These inquiries met with no success until a letter was received from the owner of the Royal Bank of Canada, Mr. Baldwin, who informed him of the two charges mentioned above. Mr. Baldwin then examined the charge book which was kept in a drawer of the office desk. As far as can be ascertained only one blank cheque is missing from this book. This missing cheque had the Royal Bank of Canada stamp on it. The other stamp used for this purpose was found in its usual place in the desk.\n\n4. On this date the writer interviewed Mr. A. Lewis, Lewis' Brother Sons, Ltd., Calgary, Alta., and the following was obtained:\n\nSTATEMENT OF A.

The Grades are as follows:\n\n- Grade 1 - 10\n- Grade 2 - 5\n- Grade 3 - 1\n- Grade 5 - 2\n\nThe children were fairly well clothed and were clean.\n\nThe class-room was tidy and warm. The stove is cracked badly and should be renewed.\n\nThe school could be brighter and more cheerful if the walls received a coat of light paint. The Sister had some nice plants in the windows and this added greatly to the appearance.\n\nThe teacher's residence is in good repair. The cellar now has water in it to the depth of about three feet. A tank pump should be supplied so that the water could be pumped out. The walls of the cellar are filled up with dirt. A proper cement floor and walls were installed and a sump hole placed in one corner perhaps the basement could be kept fairly dry and thus be made useful for storing supplies and vegetables.\n\nA school garden was broken up this year from new land and the Sister intends to have the children to gardening next spring. The vegetables will be used for their noon meal. If the basement under the house can be kept dry it will be used for storage purposes.\n\nA.G.

The clergy from Sandy Bay Residential School have gone into the Reserve during the last year and by solicitation have taken away 23 children. To my mind and, I think, to the mind of the Indian Department it is much better that the children should be educated at the Day Schools on the Reserve. When the time of schooling is over they are not strangers on the Reserve but they take their place naturally in the environment to which they have always been accustomed. On the contrary those from the Boarding School are strangers and they find it hard to get back to their natural environment.\n\nConsequently there should be a two room school on the Dog Creek Reserve. The school that is there now and another, preferably the present Sisters' House, with the kitchen where the girls could be taught cooking and another room where they could be taught sewing, etc. The children thus would get a practical education.

The records here, however, do not indicate that a request for the establishment of a school at the Dog Creek Reserve has been received either from Indian Agent Waite or Inspector Hamilton. It is just possible, though, that if the needs of the Indians are more than they appear to be at other reserves, a switch might be made. This is a matter that I would be glad to discuss with you personally immediately following your arrival at Ottawa for the Session. I am disposed to agree with the Archbishop that in view of all the circumstances, it would be sound policy to make provision for the education of the children at Dog Creek on their own reserve.\n\nI am returning Archbishop Sinnett's letter herewith.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRalph Maybank, Esq., M.P.,\n612 Avenue Block,\nWINNIPEG,\nManitoba.\n\nRAH/CH\n\nIndian Affairs.

Waite, Indian Agent, Portage la Prairie, Manitoba.\n\nPlease find attached a letter from the Archbishop of Winnipeg as sent to R. Maybank, Esq., M.P., concerning the school at Dog Creek Reserve.\n\nIt is presumed that this request refers to the Lake Manitoba Indian School where Sister Mary Margarita is now teaching. We would appreciate your comments on this situation.\n\nIt is noted from your report of December 23, 1946, that some eighteen children were enrolled last year at this school. Therefore, it is presumed that the archbishop is asking for another school elsewhere on the Dog Creek Reserve.\n\nBernard F.

November 20, 1947.\n\nWith reference to the above-named letter and enclosure, being a letter addressed to Mr. Maybank, M.P., by His Grace Archbishop Sinnott, I beg to advise that there are 45 children of school age on the Lake Manitoba Reserve. Of these, 18 are at the Day School and 23 at Sandy Bay Residential schools. Of the four remaining, 2 are in Winnipeg and two at Pine Falls. Both families are resident at the points mentioned.\n\nAt the present time there are two sisters and a resident priest on the Lake Manitoba Reserve. The idea is to increase the community, as two sisters find it difficult to live together. Two additional sister teachers would make for a better and more congenial life. However, to build an additional school on the present site, would be of no help to the Indian children, who are walking from four to five miles to the school. While the suggestion of teaching cooking, sewing etc., may be sound, it still would be necessary to transport children to and from school if an addition on the present site was contemplated.\n\nNo provision was made in Estimates for an additional school at Lake Manitoba. If it is the intention of the Department to build at Lake St. Martin next year and consideration given to the building of Day Schools at Crane River, Long Plain and Sandy Bay Reserves, it would appear that these would constitute a full building program for some years to come.\n\nJ.

His report reads as follows:\n\n\"With reference to the above noted letter and enclosure, being a letter addressed to Mr. Maybank, M.P., by His Grace Archbishop Simms, I beg to advise that there are 45 children of school age on the Lake Manitoba Reserve. Of these, 18 are at the Day School and 23 at Sandy Bay Residential School. Of the four remaining, 2 are in Winnipeg and two at Pine Falls. Both families are resident at the points mentioned.\n\n\"At the present time there are two Sisters and a resident Priest on the Lake Manitoba Reserve. The idea is to increase the community, as two Sisters find it difficult to live together. Two additional sister teachers would make for a better and more congenial life. However, to build an additional school on the present site would be of no help to the Indian children, who are walking from four to five miles to the school. While the suggestion of sending cooking supplies in any way is sound, it still would be necessary to transport children to the free school if an addition on the present site was contemplated.\n\n\"No provision was made in Estimates for an additional school at Lake Manitoba. If it is the intention\n\nRalph Maybank, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nof the Department to build at Lake St. Martin next year and consideration given to the building of day schools at Crane River, Long Plain and Sandy Bay Reserves, it would appear that these would constitute a full building program for some years to come.\"\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Lake Manitoba Indian Day School,\nLittle Saskatchewan Indian Day School\n\nInspector A. F. Kerr has turned over to me two letters relating to the above schools. These letters request a report on the teachers of the schools and state that no report has been received since June, 1946.\n\nI may say that in September, 1946, I took over this field from Mr. Kerr. Since then I have made two inspections of these and other schools in the area. In each case reports were submitted to the Winnipeg office of the Indian Affairs Branch. It was my understanding that these reports would be forwarded from Winnipeg to Ottawa. It would appear, however, that such is not the case.\n\nAt present I am engaged on duties in Winnipeg. In a matter of two or three weeks I shall return to my division and shall forward to you copies of the reports sent to the Winnipeg office.\n\nI regret the inconvenience caused, and trust that the above arrangement will be satisfactory.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nInspector of Schools.\nAugust 11, 1946.\n\nMr. R.

Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nLake Manitoba Indian Day School.\n\nLittle Saskatchewan Indian Day School.\n\nWhen our records showed that we had not received any recent reports on the above two Indian Day Schools, we wrote to Mr. A. F. Kerr, Inspector of Schools, concerning this matter. We have now received a letter from Inspector Patterson, advising that he took over this field from Mr. Kerr in September, 1946. Since then he has made two inspections of these and other schools in the area and in each case submitted reports to the Winnipeg office of this branch. It was his understanding that these reports would be forwarded here.\n\nCould you please advise whether this has been done as our files do not show an Inspector's report on the Lake Manitoba School since June, 1946.\n\nBernard F.

The only one on file here is Bulletin No. 5 dated September 1st, 1948. Apparently Mr. Waite took the first four issues for his own use.\n\nMay I please be supplied with the last four issues in order that I may refer to them as occasion arises.\n\nA.G.

Thinking I was overpaid, I wrote you stating my impression.\n\nYour answer was that having completed over the 200 days as required, I was entitled to the amount sent me, but that the bonus for Sept. Quarter would be less and it came less having received $15.00 only for said Quarter.\n\nIn view of this fact, as I have completed 205 days of School tuition, I would think that the principle applied last year is also applicable for the year ending June 30th.\n\nAs I am taking part of my holidays outside of the reserve, I would ask of you to kindly address your reply to\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nSuite 3, Manitoba Block,\nST BONIFACE, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6238, file 521-3, part 1)\nOttawa, July 27, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th instant, with reference to the amount of salary paid you for the quarter ending June 30, 1922.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you began duties at the Lake Manitoba Indian Day School, at a salary of $600.00 per annum, on September 1, 1920. The school year in Indian day schools begins September 1st and ends June 30th, and, as you were a new teacher at the Lake Manitoba School, you were paid for the quarter ending September 30, 1920, for the number 87 days you actually taught, an amount of $65.00.\n\nFor the December quarter 1920, you were paid one-quarter of your yearly salary, or $150.00, and for the March quarter 1921, you were paid the same amount.\n\nWhen we received your return for the quarter ending June 30, 1921, (the end of the school year) it was found that you had taught the required number of days during the school year and, as you have previously been paid $265.00, the Department paid you the balance of your yearly salary, namely, $237.00.\n\nFor the school year just closed, which began September 1, 1921, and ended June 30, 1922, the Department paid you as follows:\n\n- September quarter, 1921, .............. $150.00\n- December quarter, 1921, .............. $150.00\n- March quarter, 1922, .............. $150.00\n- June quarter, 1922, .............. $150.00\n\nYou have, therefore, been paid the full amount of salary due you.\n\nThere is still due you the bonus for the quarter ending June 30, 1922. The method of payment of bonus to teachers of Indian day schools for the fiscal year 1922-23, (which began April 1, 1922) has not yet been decided upon. As soon as a decision is made the bonus due you for the June quarter will be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. A.

Mr. Christenson said that the matter of a new school for Big Creek was under consideration.\n\nThe school building there is of log and much like the homes of the Indians themselves. It is very difficult to heat, and the lighting is very poor. There is no porch on the door, and the draft keeps the floor cold. The residence of the teacher and her companions is unfit for two young ladies to try to live comfortably in. I feel sure that conditions in the school room and in the house are responsible for attacks of illness from which the teacher suffered.\n\nThe teacher, Miss Longpre, used modern methods in teaching and has been getting good results comparatively speaking. I trust that her health will permit her to remain.\n\nI might mention again the long distances some of the pupils had to go, and back home to travel in the early winter snow, walked from four to seven miles. I believe some others are now in boarding school.\n\nI trust that your department will improve the situation.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is regretted, however, that we have no funds provided for the erection of new buildings at this point during the present fiscal year. The local Indian agent will be requested to report as to the urgent repairs that would be necessary to place these buildings in as comfortable a condition as possible for the next school year.\n\nThe Department is pleased to note that the teacher has been getting good results at this school.

He says the residence is very uncomfortable for the teacher to live in.\n\nThere are no funds provided in this year's Estimates for the erection of new buildings on this reserve. You should inform the Department so that the more urgent repairs that would be required in order to place the school and residence in a fairly comfortable condition for the winter. You might state your views regarding the erection of a porch over the door of the school. Please mention the approximate cost of any work which you would recommend be carried out.

The school is not large enough to accommodate all the children of school age.

You may, therefore, arrange to carry out the repairs considered absolutely necessary to make the building comfortable for the coming winter. The expense should be kept as low as possible. I shall be pleased if you will arrange to have the needed work carried out as soon as possible, purchasing any material and arranging for the labour. The Department will leave this repair in your hands to be carried out as satisfactorily as possible and at the lowest cost.\n\nYou should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Asst.

The Agent should be instructed to make this school and house as comfortable as possible this fall, without going to any great expense, and an amount should be placed in the Estimates this year for a new school and teacher's residence if the school is going to be continued.

(RG 10, Volume 6238, file 521-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nCANADA\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nPoor Copy\nDOG CREEK DAY SCHOOL\n\nThis school is taught by Miss May J. Sanregret, and she has been provided with a helper. There are 26 children on the register, and three more will be ready to start after the holidays. There are also some children from this reserve attending the Sandy Bay Boarding School. Miss Sanregret is getting splendid results, as before she took charge this place was dormant as far as the teaching was concerned. Not only is she getting splendid results as a teacher, but she has helped the Farming Instructor a great deal where there has been sickness on the reserve, and I cannot speak too highly of her work. This opinion is borne out by the report of Public School Inspector Flewis, who has charge of that district. A lot of the children from the south end of the reserve come to school a distance of five miles, and some from the north end about two or two and a half miles. Inspector Flewis recommends a van for conveying the children from the south end to and from the school, and I am submitting this for the consideration of the Department.\n\nThe school and teacher's residence are very poor affairs. The worst feature of both buildings is that they are practically unfit for habitation in the winter. The teacher informed me that it was always noon before they could get any heat in the school at all, and the house is also extremely cold. For this reason, I believe, the present teacher is resigning from the work, which is regrettable, but she informed me that she had pretty nearly made up her mind that she could not put in another winter there, as her health would not permit her to stay. Owing\nRegina, Sask., July 31st, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the various schools in the Manitowah Agency, which shows that the work is being carried on satisfactorily. There are several matters, however, that require the attention of the Department.\n\nI am not in favour of having the van system put into effect at the Dog Creek School. It would only end in failure. The residence at this school should be condemned and a new one built as soon as possible.\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, August 10th, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 31st ultimo, enclosing the report of Mr. Inspector Christiansen on his inspection of the Lake Manitoba (Dog Creek) Indian Day School, I beg to say that the Department will place an item in next year's estimates for the funds required in the erection of a classroom and teacher's residence.

I observe that you have instructed Mr. J. Hallett, Indian Agent at Portage la Prairie, to carry out \"the more urgent repairs considered necessary to make the building comfortable for the coming winter.\" Under separate letters of the same date, I was instructed to arrange for certain repair work at other schools in this Agency, but in this instance the Department issued instructions to the Indian Agent. I think for the sake of uniformity and that I may be kept informed of what expenditures are being incurred, work of this nature should be attended to through this office.\n\nWill you please advise me what instructions have been issued to the Agent, and what expenditures he has been authorized to incur?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

You should arrange for the drilling of this well when considered timely, and you may purchase the necessary pump, piping and other equipment required. Accounts covering the cost should be forwarded in the usual manner.\n\nIt is proposed to erect a new school building on this Reserve next summer, and due consideration should be given in selecting a site for the well so that it will be convenient to the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nJ.

C. Weber is a qualified teacher, and I would expect fair results from her efforts. The teacher's residence is well furnished, and is occupied by Miss Weber and Miss Doiron, who prepares the noon-day meal for the children and acts as Field Matron. These two women do very well, but I would consider that a married man could fill this position much better and would be more capable of looking after the work, as well as attending to the outside matters which arise both about a school and residence.\n\nA large patch of plaster has fallen off the school ceiling, and more is loose. This repair work should be attended to during the coming season. The residence has no eavetroughing, consequently the rain water from the roof seeps in around the foundation and floods the basement. As a protection to the foundation and basement, eavetroughing should be supplied.\nLAKE MANITOBA INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nI arrived here at noon on the day previous to Good Friday, and found the children dismissed for the day. The roll calls for 26 pupils, 8 boys and 18 girls. The grades are as follows:\n\nGrade I - 9\n\" II - 6\n\" IV - 10\n\" V - 1\n\nThe average attendance for the quarter ending March 31st, was 18.03. Some of the children have a long distance to come, and the 'flu and bad colds had greatly reduced the attendance.\n\nMiss K. C. Weber\nRegina, Sask., April 20, 1951.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the various schools in the Portage la Prairie and Manitowah Agencies. This report was made by Mr. Inspector Hamilton, who was occupied from the 26th February to the 14th April in making an inspection of these two agencies.\n\nThe Inspector points out that the Lake Manitoba Day School was closed on the day prior to Good Friday. I do not know why this should be. The attendance here is fair. The Inspector points out that while the teacher is certified, he is of the opinion that a married man could fill this position much better. I do not agree that I can agree with him in this. We have had some splendid results with two girls working in these schools, in fact better than when we had a man. We have nothing in the estimates to provide for repairing the interior of this school. I note the Inspector states that a large patch of plaster has fallen off the ceiling and more is loose.\n\nOn the whole I would say that the report on these schools is very satisfactory.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, May 5, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to the report of Mr. Inspector Hamilton on his inspection of the Lake Manitoba Indian Day School, forwarded by you under cover of your No. 208-11 of the 26th ultimo, I have to say, with reference to the repairs required to the plaster of the ceiling, that the Department will approve of you arranging to have the repairs required to the plaster carried out.\n\nRegarding the saxes troughing required for the residence, I shall be pleased to have an estimate of the cost of the material and installation of same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.

I also beg to make requisition for the sum of $15.00 for the digging of stones in the school-yard. It is about six years since the school was built and since that time the stones in the yard have raised and the yard is dangerous for children playing games. The smaller stones have been picked by the teacher and children but there are some requiring a team and men to haul away. Most of the large stones will weigh in the neighbourhood of half a ton.\n\nThe teachers made the request that a porch be built at the back door of the residence. The back door faces North and during the winter it is impossible to keep the kitchen warm with one stove and an additional heater takes up too much room.

Waite, Indian Agent, Portage la Prairie, Man.\n\nWith reference to requisition for supplies for the Lake Manitoba Day School, you may purchase the following:\n\n- 4 Window shades, cream, 35\" wide\n- 1 Front door lock, Yale\n- 7 Doz. wood screws, 1\u00bd\"\n- 1 Gal. flat wall paint, cream\n- 1 Gal. varnish, light oak\n- 2 Gal. turpentine\n- 2 Brooms\n\nThe following is a quotation from the teacher's requisition:\n\n\"The lean-to, which we use as a store-room for our provisions, leaks badly. At present we cannot keep anything in the cellar as the water is 4 ft. high. Hence if the lean-to were repaired our problem would be solved for spring and fall, as the cellar floods at these seasons.\"\n\nI presume from the above that the cellar to which the teacher refers is the cellar in the teacher's living quarters. It is too bad that some arrangements could not be made to drain out this water, because, for sanitary and health reasons, it is regrettable that this amount of water is continually standing in the cellar. However, if this cannot be done you should make immediate arrangements to repair the lean-to which is used as a store-room for the teacher's provisions.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\n\nJuly 29, 1943.\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: 126-6-5, July 26, 1943.\n\nWith reference to the last two paragraphs of the above mentioned letter, I wish to advise that owing to the high water level in the lake district this year all cellars in the vicinity of Lake Manitoba are flooded. To pump the water out of the cellar would not benefit, as it would immediately fill in again.\n\nDuring treaty payments on the Lake Manitoba Reserve, I checked over the lean-to roof, and found the radio pole had been nailed to a piece of plank which was nailed to the roof. This allowed water to back up under the shingles and leak through the sheeting. This was remedied and I have heard no further complaint.\n\nJ.

Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 20th ultimo, enclosing an account amounting to approximately $170.00 for the installation of a windcharger at the Lake Manitoba Reserve. I have also noted the letter which Archbishop Sinnott forwarded to you.\n\nAs you know, it is not our practice to supply lighting units in either Indian day schools or the residences attached to them. No doubt the teacher was also aware of that fact and, if not, she at least knew that no expenditure can be incurred without first obtaining the Department's authority. Under the circumstances we would appreciate your making further inquiry regarding this matter and advising why the windcharger was installed without our being consulted.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, January 7, 1944.\n\nRev. Sister Margarita, Teacher,\nLake Manitoba Indian Day School, V o g a r, Man.\n\nI am anxious to know if the wood supply necessary for heating the residence at the Lake Manitoba Indian Day School is purchased and provided by this Department.\n\nI have recently had a report from the office of the Minister, in which the statement is made that this wood is purchased by the teachers in charge of the school. I may state, however, that it is the policy of the Department to purchase wood at all Indian day schools, and it is just possible that a misunderstanding has arisen in your case. An immediate reply, if possible by Air Mail, will be deeply appreciated.\n\nR. A.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to yours of the 7th inst., I wish to inform you that the Indian Department does not provide the wood supply necessary for heating the residence at the Lake Manitoba Indian Day School.\n\nWe, the Benedictine Sisters, took charge of the Lake Manitoba Indian Day School in September 1935. Ever since then we have provided and paid for the fuel for the school residence out of our salaries. During the year, with an average winter, we used about 20 to 25 cords of wood. Last year we used 25 cords, the winter being most severe. We use our own fuel supply to cook the hot lunches for the school children during the winter months. For the current year, we have already purchased 10 cords of wood for the residence.\n\nThanking you for your kind consideration,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nSr. M. Margarita m.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6238, file 521-5, part 4)\nOttawa, January 21, 1944.\n\nMr. A. G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building, Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nI desire to refer to my letter to you, dated September 16, 1942, copy of which I am sending forward herewith.\n\nThe officials at the Minister's office are anxious to know what action you took to provide the wood necessary for the heating of Indian day schools and teachers' residences attached thereto, immediately following receipt of this communication.\n\nThe Minister is in receipt of a letter in which the statement is made that no fuel has been supplied to heat the teacher's residence at the Lake Manitoba Indian Day School, despite the fact that an amount of the fuel purchased by the teacher is used to heat and prepare noonday lunches for the pupils. May I point out also that when teachers' salaries are under review from year to year the amount of salary is, to some extent at least, determined by the housing accommodation provided for the teacher and the supply of wood allowed. We were under the impression here that all Indian day schools and all teachers' residences in Manitoba were heated with wood or other fuel. The information contained in the letter to the Minister, in respect to the Lake Manitoba Indian Day School, came as a great surprise to the officials. We are anxious, therefore, that you should send forward, just as soon as you can conveniently do so, a list of the Indian day schools and teachers' residences in Manitoba and the provision that has been made in each case to supply these buildings with fuel.\n\nEncl.\n\nR.

The present residence of the Sisters would be used for the second school. They could have a class in Domestic economy in one room, a class of manual labor in another, a class of knitting and sewing in another, and finally a class of cooking in another. The Indian children are much better when they are educated on their own reserves. They are in constant contact with their parents and what they learn at school they communicate at once to their parents. The Indian Residential School may have its good purpose, but it cannot do the work of the Day School on the Reserve.\n\nI understand that you said that other Reserves might come before Dog Creek, because they did not have in their proximity a good Residential School like Sandy Bay. To me that is not pertinent at all. What is pertinent is that the Day School does not cost as much as the Residential one. Why should there be twenty Indian children at Sandy Bay, when they can be educated better and with less cost in their own Day School on the Dog Creek Indian Reserve? I see no reason why the Department should not convert the Sisters' Residence into another school and build another residence for the Sisters. At the moment there is more than a foot of water in the basement of the Sisters' present residence. The new residence could be built on higher ground. I think these arguments are most convincing.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nAlfred A. Sinnott,\nArchbishop of Winnipeg.\n\nCOPY\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nWe beg to enclose, herewith, a letter received from his Grace, Alfred A. Sinnott, Archbishop of Winnipeg, which is self-explanatory.\n\nThe teacherage on the reserve is the usual bungalow type - not large enough for domestic science classes. An amount will be placed in the Portage estimates this year for the erection of a new school, which we suggest should be built at the south end of the reserve. A later survey of this situation will be made and reported.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor\nof Indian Agencies.\nJune 10, 1948.\n\nMr. H.S. Davis, Regional Supervisor\nof Indian Agencies, Winnipeg, Man.\n\nWe have your letter of the 2nd instant\nwith reference to the Lake Manitoba Day School.

(RG 10, Volume 6238, file 521-5, part 4)\nOttawa, October 25, 1948.\n\nRe: Lake Manitoba Indian Day School,\nFortage la Prairie Indian Agency,\nVogar, Manitoba.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Hoey's memorandum dated August 25th, a report has now been received from Mr. Gow's office in this matter.\n\nThe present siting of the school is excellent; it is on the highest ground in the property; there is no complaint regarding it.\n\nHowever, Mr. Davis was referring to the Sisters' Residence. This is a frame structure over a small cellar pit. This latter is subject to intermittent flooding which interferes with its essential use as a root store. But this flooding evidently does not affect the building itself, and no damage to the residents' health has so far been mentioned.\n\nThree alternative solutions to this difficulty are suggested:\n\n1. Install a drain from the cellar to a roadside ditch; estimated cost $350.00.\n2. Fill in cellar pit and provide new storage cabin nearby; estimated cost $300.00.\n3. Move entire residence to a new site over a concrete basement; estimated cost $2,400.00.\n\nFrom a careful consideration of the factors involved, it is our opinion that the 2nd alternative is to be preferred. There is a definite need for storage space for garden produce, etc., for winter use as the property is 25 miles by road from the railway station and they are subject to considerable isolation during the winter. Judging from Mr. Gow's Report and the drawing accompanying it, a copy of which is forwarded herewith, the Residence will continue to be satisfactory if the cellar is filled in.\n\nIt is considered that this matter can be handled by Mr. Davis on your authority.\n\nT.S.

In fact, without altering our system entirely I do not see how it could be done. The teachers are paid on quarterly returns and it would be increasing the work to have returns prepared monthly, and cheques issued monthly. The cheques would be for small amounts, as the salaries are nearly all about $300.00.

(No. 118342) as follows:\n\nIn regard to the method I have followed to arouse the interest of the parents and children in school matters, kindness and persuasion has been my two leading factors.\n\nI never flatter them, but give them credit for any meritorious act they have done, and gently, but firmly correct them when they have done anything contrary to common decency. Whenever a child absents himself or herself from school I invariably make it a point to visit the home, and find out the cause, if I find no definite reason, but simply indolence, I sit down a reason with the parent, as a kind and just father would do to his child, and this method I have found out to work satisfactorily. I have also found out that long experience in Indian work that it is absolutely useless trying to drive an Indian to do this or that thing, lead him, and him by kindness and firmness in my principles and I have found to advantage that this is the only way.\n\nOf course I do not say\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6238, file 522-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOL COPY\nI have found out the Indian problem, but with these people in general, that is, compensation there is sorrow and no joy, in fighting and in all things like them, without in any sense compromising their principles or practices, is the nearest way to their confidence. I have done in anything for real peace and common brotherhood. Thus I have found my way, and they in turn take me and treat me as a friend, until they know our very hearts of our life that was written friendship and the true desire to help them. More than this, they say I believe in them, and I'm confident they believe most heartily in me.\n\nAs for the lives of the people and other matters pertaining to the Reserve, I have no hesitation in stating that everything is progressing satisfactorily. This has been an exceptional good winter for this district. On the Reserve alone, I say, that 150 tons of good marketable fish has left the place, and say, at the price of fish now at present the Indians must have realized about $2000 at least of this commodity. So they will keep from this to Indians are in a flourishing condition and this is so apparent want brought to any notice.\n\nIn conclusion, let me thank the Dept. for the confidence conferred upon me, and also for the exercise in any Colony which will encourage me very much.\n\nI am, etc.,\nYour obedient servant,\nJno.

I do not know if Mr. Jackson reported this or not. However, I have heard nothing further until now. But from the tone of your letter it would appear that I was neglecting the work. I have my instructions direct from the Department through you, and I guide myself accordingly which I suppose is all that was expected of me. However, the Indians will have to provide a suitable house for the teacher, if they think it is necessary he must live amongst them, but I doubt if it would be to their advantage, as I cannot be more for their welfare than I am doing now. And further I have been told and I must live without two months on any place (I want to prove why) but to make matters mutually satisfactory to all parties concerned, I will willingly live on the Reserve providing a suitable building is supplied to me (or during the winter months) and I think the Department will not object on account of the request, as I cannot afford to lay out money on a dwelling house without knowing how to get my own back.\n\nHope writing that the properies will square up matters satisfactorily.\n\nI beg to remain your obedient servant,\n\nJ.W.C.

[Signature]\nInd.Agt\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI am sending under separate cover by mail my returns for December quarter, 1912 and trust you will find them right.\n\nAlthough I have a good many pupils on the roll, still the average is not good, and this accounts for the pupils not attending in the afternoons, which I am at a loss how to remedy. This indifference, formally I invariably gave the children credit for a full day, but this didn't help me any at the examinations, and I have decided not to do so anymore. The only way to meet this difficulty is, I would suggest that, to keep the children in, say from 9 A.M. to 1.30 P.M. I think this method would not only benefit the teacher but the children as well kindly advise.\n\nIn concluding I beg to say the people in the district are as far as I can see in excellent health, although the fishing industry is pretty much a failure, yet there is no apparent fear of any destitution. Everybody appears to be alright, with the exception of a few who are having a kind of religious mania, brought in by some half-witted people from Fisher River, who claim to be successors to the Apostles and are preaching the doctrine of tongues and miracle working. There is quite a stir at present, but I hope to see the storm quieted in time. Old John Sanderson of the Baptist Church is working in with them but of course you couldn't expect anything else.\n\nYours sincerely\n\n(Sgd) Jno.E. Favel\nTeacher\n\nR.

I have asked Mr. Logan, and Inspector Jackson what regards to him. I understand the attendance at his School is not as good as it used to be, and the reason of that is being endangered by the shakers in that locality. Mr Jackson tells me that Favell lives outside the confines of the Reserve, and for that reason is not as useful as he might be, were he resident on the Reserve.\n\nI have no personal knowledge of him, as a teacher, except through the Agent and Inspector, but I have personal knowledge of the manner in which he tries to assist the Department by giving me information, when it comes to him, of the infraction of the liquor law, and the troubles caused by the 'holy rollers' and shakers of that locality. A small raise in salary would show the Department's appreciation in that way.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nChief Inspector.\n\nIndian Affairs.

If you will ask for my report of School inspection for the year 1913-14 of date the 27th Feb. (and that report must be in the Department as there are some quotations from it in the last bluebook,) you will find that the last year has been the worst in the history of the Lake St. Martin's school for some years, and for reasons pertaining to religion. But I may say that the Shaker excitement is now calming down, and we may expect the school attendance to again become normal. With regard to an increase of salary for Mr. Favel, I may say that he is a much better teacher than the late Mr. Clair, last year's teacher on the adjoining reserve, (Little) Saskatchewan, and he was getting $500.00 a year, the only objection to Mr. Favel is that he does not live on the reserve.\n\nI have not the 1910 to 1913 blue books at hand but from memory would say that in every year since I have been Inspector in the Lake Manitoba Inspectorate, I have sent in a report on this school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nDuncan C.

E. Farrell\n(Seal)\n\nJ. H. McLean Esq.,\nActing Deputy and Secretary\nOttawa, Can.\nExtract from Inspector's Report on the Lake St. Martin School, December 7, 1920. Original on 126-7-6\n\nFor years this school has remained stationary. At every visit I find conditions just about the same; three-fourths of the pupils are in the lowest grade and 2 or 3 in a higher grade, and it would appear just as soon as the boys and girls get so that they can do some work they are not sent to school. I would like to see a truant officer appointed on this reservation for a year and compel the larger children to attend. I have spoken to the chief and band elders about this matter of keeping the larger children away from school on many occasions but with no good result. The Chief, Charles Sumner, is an intelligent and go-ahead man. He sees the difficulty but is not able to enforce the attendance of these larger children. The attendance as shown by the school registry office for the year ending September 30th, 1920, is as follows: December 15, 1919, 18.44; March 1920, 19.65; June 23.09 and September 21.85; an average for the year of 21.66, and 80 per cent. of this attendance was in the kindergarten or the A.B.C. class.\n\nThere is one thing I would mention about Mr. Pavell. He had four sons at the war, one was killed and two of the others were badly wounded. They are at home and getting so that they can work on the land they own near their father. Mr. Pavell wished me to ask the Department about his salary as teacher. He was getting $500.00; he applied for a raise and he says he was given the promise of a raise of $100.00 a year but this last quarter's cheque was $137.50 or $550.00 a year.\n\nS. J. Jackson,\nInsp. of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, December 14, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your report on the Lake St. Martin Indian Day School, I beg to say that the teacher, Mr. J. E. Favel, received salary at the rate of $450.00 per annum up to April 1, 1920. From that date he was allowed an increase of $100.00, making the present salary $550.00 a year. He was paid at that rate for the quarter ending June 30th. In addition he received bonus at the rate of $150.00 a year.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nS.

His difficulty is that he has to work out his own methods of instruction never having taken a Normal course and in this he is doing very well. When it becomes necessary to secure an assistant teacher for the school every endeavour should be made to obtain the services of a fully qualified person with some experience in teaching.\n\nIt would be well to encourage teachers in Indian schools to attend the teachers' conventions which neighbouring teachers attend in order to give them a broader outlook, to keep them in touch with what other teachers are doing and permit them to discuss their problems with other teachers who are interested in similar matters.\n\nJas.

Fairford operating under most favorable conditions still holds the lead, but it is being overtaken by Lake St. Martin School, though Mr. Garwood works alone there with scanty equipment, unfavorable environment and a heavy ungraded school. All are doing well, however. Mr. Wheaton, of Little Saskatchewan, has done much more efficient work this year and the school shows substantial progress.\nLAKE ST. MARTIN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nThe school is a log building in a good state of repair. There are 39 children enrolled, the average attendance being about 30. There were 35 present at the time of my visit. This school is taught by Mr. G. Garwood who has been here for 5 years. I first visited this school a year ago. Before going there, Mr. Ogletree, the Agent, gave me to understand that the teacher was worse than useless, and I no doubt went there with that in my mind. However, I changed my opinion considerably while I was there but did not like to say very much about Mr. Garwood in my last report on this school. However, after enquiring thoroughly into this man's work, I have come to realize that we have a first class teacher here. He is very much interested in his work; I spent a couple of hours in the classroom and in my opinion the children did very well and showed great improvements over last year. Mr. Garwood also does a lot of work on the reserve when there is sickness and co-operates in every way with Mr. White, the Farming Instructor.\n\nA mid-day lunch is served to the children and on the day I was there it consisted of a thick soup with a little meat in it, some rice and evidently flour had been put in to make it thick. Each child also received two biscuits.\ntwo biscuits and a cup of Cocoa. This mid-day meal at the school is certainly a splendid thing and is just what the children need. The cost is small but it certainly is of great benefit to the children, who, in many cases, do not receive sufficient food at home.\n\nSigned [signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. John E. Fowell is doing the Church work but of course not teaching the school. I have written to Mr. Weller, who is leaving Moose Factory, asking him whether he would care to take the position. He has done most satisfactory work at Moose but I am not certain as to whether he possesses the necessary academic standing by way of certificate. Perhaps you knew.\n\nThe distribution of medicine, etc., for many years was attended to by the Missionary at Fairford but for some time it has been done by the teachers at the \"Improved School\". I am writing to ask whether without disturbing your finances arrangements could be possible to revert to the old method. I ask this for two reasons. In the first place, it is claimed that during the summer months, when the school is closed and the teachers are absent, the handling of the medicines is not done and the Indians complain. In the second place, the Indians around Fairford make such a poor living that they are not able to supplement the salary of the missionary as they should and the addition of the remuneration you are doing to them cannot fail to be of great assistance to Mr. Smith. I do not wish this done if the transfer will affect the salaries of the teachers at the Improved School, which I understand continues to go on so well, but all the same the transfer would be very satisfactory to me. The Bishop of Brandon, who has just visited the district in my place, reports that the Improved School building needs some repairs in the way of painting outside and some attention to the interior. If this could be carried out during the vacation it would be very desirable. I have most gratifying reports of the satisfactory work of the Farm Instructor at Little Saskatchewan or Sandy Bay.\n\nWith kind regards, I am,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nA. F.

April 7, 1933.\n\nMr Agent Waite\nPortage la Prairie.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI find that I cannot finance my contemplated trip to the Old Country unless I can have my salary cheque for the June quarter ahead of time. The amount that I now have on hand is barely sufficient to cover ocean fare without allowing for railway journey and the many incidental expenses on route. Therefore, I wonder if you would be able to advise the Department if I could have special consideration in this regard, and have my cheque a month ahead of time. This would relieve me of much anxiety and I could then proceed to book my passage without delay.\n\nThanking you, I beg to remain\n\nYours very truly\n\n[Signature]\nTeacher.\n\nSS-10\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba,\nApril 15th, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to herewith enclose a letter received from Mr. Sam Waller, Teacher, Lake St. Martin's Day School, in which he requests that his cheque for the quarter ending June, 1933 be forwarded a month ahead of time, so that he may book his passage to England. I would advise that Mr. Waller is doing excellent work, not only as a teacher, but his work amongst the sick has made a considerable saving to the Department. Will you please advise in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 21, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, enclosing a communication from Mr. Sam. Waller, teacher of the Lake St. Martin Indian Day School, requesting that his cheque for the quarter ending June 30th, next, be forwarded a month in advance, in order that he can arrange for his expenses in making a proposed visit to England.\n\nIn reply I have to say it is regretted that the cheque for the full quarter's salary cannot be sent in advance, as the Auditor General would take exception to the payment. However, we will forward Mr. Waller a cheque for one-half the quarter's salary about the middle of May, next, and the balance can be paid upon receipt of his return at the end of June.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.-B.

I hardly think there is any need for a more expensive set as these should give good service and seems to contain a very complete assortment.\n\nI have written to His Grace, the Archbishop of Rupert's Land to see if he could obtain from his Diocese a small grant towards furnishing this place with the larger items of furniture needed, but some of the smaller articles can be made by me and painted to suit my own particular fancy. I have not yet had a reply from him.\n\nOwing to limited means, I am not able at this time to make any great outlay, but with the things I already have, and with what the Archbishop may be able to get for me I hope to make myself very comfortable. A set of tools will always be useful not only to a resident teacher but to the pupils as well when there is an opportunity for manual handicraft.\n\nIf the Indian Agent has recommended any painting to be done either inside or outside the School dwelling, if the Department provides the paint, I would be quite willing to do this myself in my spare time, as I rather enjoy painting.\n\nBelieve me to be,\n\nYours truly\n\nSam Wallis\nOttawa, August 1, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo, requesting that a supply of carpenter's tools be provided for use at the Lake St. Martin Indian Day School, and enclosing clippings from the T. Eaton catalogue giving prices, etc.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department is communicating with Mr. Agent Waite, Portage la Prairie, and authorizing him, after consulting you in the matter, to arrange for the purchase of carpenter's tools to an amount not exceeding $25. You should call at the office of Mr. Waite, in Portage la Prairie, on your way to the school. We are sending him the clippings which you forwarded. Mr. Waite will arrange for the purchase of tools not exceeding the above amount, after you inform him what you require.\n\nRelative to furnishings for the teacher's residence, I have to say that the Department is not aware as to what supplies of this nature are in the residence. I may say that a new building was erected as a teacher's residence in the summer of 1927. After you arrive at the school, should you require a new supply of furnishings, you may prepare a requisition and forward same through the office of Mr. Waite.

Waller, teacher of the Lake St. Martin Indian Day School, for furniture for the use of the teacher's residence and also carpenter tools.\n\nIn connection with the carpenter's tools asked for, I would refer you to official letter or the last ultimo in which you were authorized to incur an expenditure not exceeding the sum of $25 in the purchase of the tools as selected by Mr. Waller. You should consult him as to the various tools he requires and arrange for the purchase to an amount not exceeding the above mentioned sum. The Department understands that Mr. Waller intends to conduct a class in manual training and that these tools are required for this purpose.\n\nRelative to the furnishings for the teacher's residence, you may arrange for the purchase, at the lowest possible cost, of a cook stove and a box stove, both of a wood burning type that would be satisfactory for the purpose for which they are required. You may also arrange for the purchase of the quantity of stove pipe, elbows, damper pipes, taper pipes and stove board required. You may also purchase a drop leaf table, 2 small tables, 6 chairs, 2 box bunked chairs, 2 chairs, 2 stools, etc., etc. The above furnishings, while of a good substantial type, should be purchased as cheaply as possible. It is not considered necessary to supply a chiffonier. The cost of each article should, if possible, be kept within the estimate submitted from the catalogue of the T. Eaton Company. Please arrange for the purchase and delivery of the above authorized supplies as soon as possible.\n\nAfter the above purchases have been made, you should forward itemized accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

In this connection I shall be pleased to have a further report from you as to whether you consider that the paint and other supplies asked for should be furnished or not, and, if these are supplied, if the teacher will perform the labour in doing the painting and if there would be any charge made for his services in doing the work.

The building is in fair repair, and I found the place very tidy.\n\nThere are 38 pupils on the roll, and the grades range from Grade I to Grade III.\n\nThe teacher's residence is a five roomed house, which I found to be well furnished and spotlessly clean.

It may be necessary to demolish the present chimney and build a new one. You should engage the services of a competent man to do the work - you to purchase any brick, lime, etc., that may be required. I would urge you to have this chimney placed in good condition at an early date. Please forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of any material and labour.\n\nReferring to official letter of the 10th ultimo, in which you were authorized to supply a quantity of lime, whitewash brushes, towels and nails, it was stated in this letter that the teacher was to perform the work of whitewashing and re-chinking the outside of the school building. The teacher states he is unable to do this work, and you may therefore engage the services of Indians. If possible, the work should be completed before the school re-opens after the present summer holidays.

In reviewing previous correspondence, we find that you were authorized to purchase the above quantities of paint, kalsomine and varnish in letter dated April 26th, 1940. Please let us know if this material was furnished at that time, and, if so, why it is necessary to again supply the above.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. J.

Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: 127-7-5 W T l, July 15, 1946.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of the above noted letter regarding a well at the teacherage, Lake St. Martin Reserve. It is true that the water in Lake St. Martin is not fit for drinking purposes, although the Indians drink it. Ice is packed for the teacherage, but this is not entirely satisfactory.\n\nSome years ago an attempt was made to drill a well at the teacherage on this reserve. Four inch casing was used and a stop had to be made at 100 feet as the casing was too light to stand further drilling and the casing was pulled out.\n\nAt the present time there is an experienced driller on the Little Saskatchewan Reserve, drilling a well for the proposed nursing station. His costs are as follows and attached hereto is his price.\n\n$7.50 per foot, including cost of 5\" standard casing, board and lodging and the cost of moving. The Department of National Health and Welfare are paying the moving costs from Winnipeg to Little Saskatchewan Reserve and return.\n\nIt was expected that water would be obtained on this reserve at a depth of approximately 100 feet. The soil, however, appeared to be of the same constituency all the way down the 100 foot hole that was drilled some years ago. It is possible that water would be found if drilling could have been continued to a depth of 150 feet. The wells in the district are from 60 to 200 feet. The cost of a well would be high and I would suggest that if drilling is to be done on this reserve...\nthat a new hole, a distance from the old one, be drilled. The old hole was filled in as it was dangerous for stock.\n\nMr. Mills has a number of jobs in the environs of the City of Winnipeg and is anxious to return, but would be prepared to do this job if approved by the Department. It is expected that the well at the nursing station will be completed on or about the 26th of this month and if the Department intend to have a well drilled at this point immediate action is necessary.\n\nA dug well is out of the question as only surface water can be obtained by this method.\n\nJ. Waite,\nIndian Agent.\nAirmail.\n\nOttawa, July 25, 1946.\n\nMr. J. Waite, Indian Agent, Portage la Prairie, Manitoba.\n\nWater for Lake St. Martin Day School.\n\nReference your letter 49-295 of 23 July, 1946.\n\nThe contents of your letter have been discussed with the Director and it has been decided to act in accordance with your recommendation and dig a well at this teacherage provided that you are satisfied there is a reasonable chance of obtaining water.\n\nWe have had unfortunate experiences in the past with the digging of deep and expensive wells on the Prairies. It is realized that it is almost impossible to place a limit beyond which the well should not be dug because of the cost. Therefore, this depth will have to be decided by you in consultation with the contractor, Mr. Mills. His experience at Little Saskatchewan Reserve should prove helpful.\n\nPlease advise us of the progress of this well digging.\n\nBernard F.

March 18, 1947.\n\nIn reply to the above noted letter, I wish to advise\nthat it is regrettable that the money voted for the new\nschool at Lake St. Martin Reserve will have to be used\nfor a new residence. Enclosed please find my report\non this fire, submitted to the Department on March 8th.\n\nThe only contractor I know in the Gypsumville district,\nwho, I think, would be capable of tackling a job the\nsize indicated would be Mr. Herman Helgason, Ashern,\nManitoba. I hope to be able to erect the bull barn\nthis year and have already received his quotation for\nthis work.\n\nI wish to point out that the estimate of $2500.00\nfor the building of a residence at Lower Fairfield\nSchool was for a lean-to dwelling to the school.\nOf the $2500.00, $500.00 was estimated for a drilled\nwell, pump and piping. This would leave, on an\nestimate, $2000.00 for the building.\n\nJ.

Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\nOttawa, May 1st, 1947.\n\nMemorandum\n\nDIRECTOR, DIVISIONS AND ENGINEERING BRANCH\n\nLake St. Martin Indian Day School\n\nOn March 7 we sent you a list of our projected buildings as contained in the 1947-48 estimates. Included was the sum of $5,000.00 for a one-room school and teacherage at Lake St. Martin, Portage la Prairie Agency.\n\nIndications are that contractors are willing to bid for this construction. Mr. Hamilton, our Inspector, reports that Mr. Sigurdson who is building the nursing station at Little Rockatchewan, Portage Agency, will consider quoting on the school. Mr. Indian Agent Waite reports that Mr. Norman Holgerson of Ashorn is also interested in quoting.\n\nTherefore, would you please air-mail Mr. Cox in Winnipeg to have one of his engineers survey the proposed site. As we already have a log building at this reserve now, there should be little or no difficulty. We hope to proceed immediately with the construction of this school and anticipate your full co-operation in having the site surveyed immediately.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector\n\nc/o to Inspector Hamilton.\nIndian Agent Waite.\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| Feb. 7 | Two bags of lime purchased for use in whitewashing the Lake St. Martin Indian Day School as per account attached | $2.00 |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nMr. Gow, Department Engineer, Winnipeg, called me on the telephone on the 13th, relative to the surveying of a new school site, Lake St. Martin Reserve. I called on Mr. Gow yesterday, also Mr. Inspector Hamilton, regarding this work. In neither Mr. Inspector Hamilton's nor Mr. Gow's letter is the matter made plain. Is it the Department's intention to build two schools? I take it that at the present time it is the intention to build a combined school and teacherage this summer and to employ two teachers. Both teachers will reside at the proposed school residence for the present and the old log school will be operated in addition to the new school. I would strongly recommend the combination school and residence. At Lake St. Martin Reserve two schools are required and should be placed about 1\u00bd to 2 miles apart for the convenience of the children. The old residence, that was burnt down, is at the approximate centre of the reserve. A well was drilled at this point and could not be used for either school, if it is the intention to build two schools. This would mean that two new wells would have to be drilled.\n\nIt has been arranged with Mr. Gow to proceed to Lake St. Martin Reserve on June 2nd. In the meantime I would be pleased to receive advice in connection with this matter, so that the survey may be satisfactorily carried out.\n\nJ. Waite,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 20th, 1947.\n\nMr. J. Waite, Indian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Manitoba.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 16th instant, it is our intention to build a combined school and teacher's residence on the Lake St. Martin Reserve this year.\n\nI note that you consider that a second school is required on this reserve, but we will have to use the old school for the academic year 1947-48, providing that we can obtain two teachers.\n\nWe are not certain from your letter at what point you intend to locate the new combined school and residence. If it is at the site of the former residence, I presume it will not be necessary to drill another well as you state a well was built at this particular point.\n\nHowever, if the site is changed, it is noted that it will be necessary to drill a well and you might let me know if you can have this work done and at what cost.\n\nBernard F.

No reply however has been received from Mr. Gow on the subject but our Engineering and Construction Service has written him airmail on June 10th to forward the required data as soon as possible.\n\nAs soon as the necessary report and plan is received copies will be transmitted to you.\n\nDirector.\nBlueprints of Lake St. Martin\nMemo to Mr. D. B. Gow\n\nRe: Lake St. Martin Indian School Sites\n\nThe sites visited for the proposed Lake St. Martin Day School were firstly just above the Narrows on Narrows Reserve No. 49, close to the Anglican Church, and secondly, about a mile to the southwest - both within a hundred yards of the lake shore and both selected by Mr. Waite, the Indian Agent.\n\nThe sites are located on knolls of grassed areas away from other buildings, clear of the bush and chosen by Mr. Waite to be central and suitable for the children located in houses along the shoreline of the reserve. The surface soil is sandy loam and short grass forms a tough turf. Underlying this is a sandy clay subsoil with a few scattered stones one to four inches long. This subsoil is well consolidated so that a man took 1\u00bd hours to go down 1\u00bd feet with a post-hole auger after the first foot was dug out. This type of sandy clay has been found to go to a depth of 20 feet or more all over this area. A second hole on the first site was dug out 2\u00bd feet deep in one-half an hour. No water is encountered in the vicinity as vegetable pits keep dry when dug to 5 or 6 feet depths, so that foundation conditions would be good.\n\nNo Indian house has a well and only at one place has a very limited supply of water been obtained in boring for wells. Other holes have been dug with bores up to 30 feet deep and deeper wells are sixty. Lake water is generally used for domestic and stock use. Ice blocks are used to some extent. For this reason the Agent considered it inadvisable to have any sewage disposal system which might contaminate the lake nearby.\n\nThere is no electric transmission line closer than Ste. Rose, over 50 miles to the southwest, and no electric current is generated on this reserve.\n\nDrinking water is obtainable at a drilled well about 1800 feet south. This well has a limited supply of about four barrels per day and was used by the former teacher. This well supply was the only successful bore of several tried and is located in an enclosure which contains the foundation of the burned-out teacher's residence. The well casing should be surrounded by concrete block 6 feet high. The drainage away from the bore should be made by building up soil around the platform block. A 6\" standard casing was put down 37 feet when water was located in gravel. Pumping was done to lower the water in the casing to the bottom and it took 1\u00bd hours to rise 8 feet. The pump cylinder is 20 feet below the surface and static level is 10 feet below the surface, according to information supplied by the local Farm Instructor.\n\nFor concrete foundation work, beach gravel may be had 1\u00bd miles from either site.\n\nD. B. Gow, Esq.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\n532 Dominion Public Building,\nWINNIPEG, Manitoba.\n\nJ.T. Rose\nRe: Lake St. Martin Indian Day School,\nPortage la Prairie Agency, Manitoba.\n\nEnclosed you will please find the following with reference to the proposed Lake St. Martin Indian Day Schools:\n\n(a) Memorandum by Mr. J. T. Rose prepared from the results of his examination of the site on June 3,\n\n(b) Duplicate prints showing the proposed School Site #1, together with key plan of the reserve,\n\n(c) Blue prints, in duplicate, showing the proposed School Site #2.\n\nUpon the receipt of your letter of May 9 with reference to the inspection of the site, we got in touch with Mr. Weite, Indian Agent for the district at Portage la Prairie, but he had not received any notification of the inspection from his own department. Inasmuch as he was of the opinion that two schools should be built rather than the one, the visit to the reserve had to be delayed until such time as the matter could be referred back to his own department at Ottawa. Naturally the selection of a site or sites would be governed by the consideration as to whether there should be one or two schools and now I understand that two schools are being considered.\n\nThe data given in Mr. Rose's memorandum, supplemented by the sketch plans forwarded, provide the information requested in your letter of May 9. You will appreciate our notification to the draft dated July 6 that the only underground water supply procurable to date is located about 1500 feet from the proposed #1 site or at the location of the burned teacher's residence. This matter of water supply should be a determining feature in the selection of a site or sites and also as to whether there should be one or two schools. The water of Lake St. Martin is unsafe and usually unfit for human consumption and before any school is constructed, an underground water supply must be assured in the immediate vicinity.\n\n(Sgd.)

Gow herewith for your information.\n\nJune 18th, 1947.\n\nMemorandum\n\nRe: Lake St. Martin Indian Day School,\nPortage la Prairie Agency, Manitoba.\n\nWith further reference to the memorandum from Mr. Hoey dated the 2nd instant, regarding the above, we have now received from Mr. Gow a report dated Winnipeg, June 11th, and plans of proposed school sites No. 1 and No. 2 prepared by Mr. J.T. Rose of his staff, copies of which we are transmitting to you herewith together with a copy of Mr. Gow's covering letter dated the 13th instant, for the information of the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nIt will be noted that the only source of drinking water is from a well with a limited supply of about four (4) barrels a day situated about 1500 feet from No. 1 site and presumably about 3700 feet from No. 2 site. As the expense of installing a pumping installation from the existing well to either site could obviously not be justified, it would appear that water required for drinking purposes at either site would have to be hauled from the well periodically to a storage tank, which should be installed in the schools.\n\nEnclos.\n\nJ.M.

It has been suggested\nthat a two room school, located at one of these sites\nmight handle all the children and would provide more\nefficient education than by erecting two one room schools\na mile or so apart.

Sigurdson on building the school. Mr. Sigurdson is at present engaged in building a Nursing Station on the adjoining reserve (Little Saskatchewan). I would suggest that Mr. Waite be instructed to ask Mr. Sigurdson to quote using as much of our local lumber as possible. If this were done it would only be necessary to purchase the finishing lumber for both inside and out, shingles, insulation, and hardware.\n\nI have made extensive enquiries in connection with securing a competent carpenter to act as foreman, but without success. Therefore I feel sure if we hope to get this school built our only chance is to use Mr. Sigurdson who is in the district, provided he is willing to do the work and will submit a reasonable quotation.\n\nA copy of a letter received from the North American Lumber Company concerning the above matter is attached for your information.\n\nA.

We have already sent you under separate cover a copy of this plan.\n\nIs there any contractor who is willing to erect these buildings on the various reserves in which you require them? It was suggested by Surveys and Engineering Branch that possibly one big company might consider the erection of all four buildings. If this is not possible, then we must investigate the possibility of having either bids from local contractors or advertising in Saskatchewan newspapers.\n\nHaving discussed this situation with you personally, and realizing the shortage of materials and contractors in your province, we realize how disappointing will be this news from the North American Buildings Limited.\n\nBernard F.

We are also having serious difficulty with the contractors bidding upon these schools.\n\nWould you consider it feasible to have this Company work out a standardized plan along the lines of your drawing as is suggested in paragraph four of the attached letter.\n\nThe situation at the present time is that we are having extreme difficulty in getting any contractors to submit bids on our buildings and, therefore, because of the urgency of our need, we are forced to look elsewhere for the erection of these buildings.\n\nDirector.\n\nIndian Affairs.

For 2 years now they have been having the big ones one day and the small ones the other day.\n\nOut of a month some only get 8 days school and the others 12 days. We did not scold much as we expected this year to have two...\nschools. A new one built and to be the other one built and to for this winter.\n\nNow it's almost October 1st and we have nothing and we are very sure what we have will be taken from us as the nation house where the teacher lives is so cold, it is not right to ask her to stay in it now. We would like the Dept of Indian Affairs not to let this happen to us. It could be stopped by boarding the teacher outside the Reserve and seeing that someone is paid for driving her.\n\nIt's not right to ask her to see to this herself, as she is supposed to be given a place to stay close to the school. Once you change our teacher it's hard to get another one. We want to know what you plan to do in this business.\n\nWe were promised our new...\nschool, and place for our teacher\nto live as things are in.\nWe depended on this being done\nfor us this year.\nPlease let us know immediately\nas we do not want the school\nclosed.\n\nSigned Chief\n\nJohn J.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/HH.\nOttawa, November 15, 1947.\n\nDear Mr. Bryce:\n\nI have for answer your letter of October 29th.\n\nI regret very much that we have been unable to erect a new day school at Lake St. Martin this year. As you are probably aware, the sum of $8,000.00 was included in our main estimates this year for the construction of a one room day school and teacherage for this Reserve. Inspector Hamilton and the Indian Agent did their best to interest contractors in the construction of this school. The only tender that they were able to obtain was that of Mr. R. Sigurdson of Winnipeg, Manitoba. His tender was for $16,410.00 and was submitted to our Surveys and Engineering Branch for their comments.\n\nThe reply which we received from this Branch read in part as follows:\n\n\"This service has no hesitation in stating that tenders for a one room schools where cost will proximate $16,000.00 are exorbitant and no contract should be awarded\".\n\nIn view of this statement from our architects and because we were have this identical building constructed elsewhere for prices ranging from $11,000.00 to $13,000.00, we could not accept Mr. Sigurdson's tender. Inspector Hamilton and Mr. Indian Agent Waite were informed of this fact.\n\nHowever, we have been able to arrange for a suitable boarding place for Mrs. Beachell and also to provide for daily transportation to the school for her. It is our intention to include a revote of $14,000.00 in our next year's appropriation for the construction of this school. It is hoped that we can interest a contractor for its erection next year.\nI know that you will be pleased to hear of the two qualified teachers whom we have engaged for the Fairford schools. I feel confident that with their wide experience they will render us efficient service.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW. Bryce, Esq., M.P.,\nP.O.

Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: 126-7-5 (WT1), September 16, 1947.\n\nIn reply to Department letter above noted, I wish to advise that two holes were drilled on this reserve to approximately 100 feet without locating water. Later a well was drilled on the reserve, and water found at approximately 50 feet. There is an adequate supply of water in this well for the average household. The run in rather slow. I believe water could be obtained at the proposed sites of the new schools at an approximate depth of 80 feet. Both sites are on high land, fairly close to Lake St. Martin. The drilled wells in the outlying district approximate this depth.\n\nThe cost of the two wells would be $800.00, plus the cost of the pump and piping, an additional $100.00.\n\nJ. Waite,\nIndian Agent.\n\nNOV 10 1947\n\nREGISTERED\nOttawa, November 18, 1947.\n\nMr. J. Waite, Indian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Manitoba,\n\nWe have your letter of the 6th instant with reference to drilling wells at the Lake St. Martin and Fairford schools.\n\nIf it is not too late in the season, the Department approves an expenditure not exceeding $500.00 for drilling a well at the Fairford school. If water is obtained at a reasonable depth, we would be prepared to authorize the drilling of a well at the Lake St. Martin school next Spring.\n\nBernard F.

They come up quickly between the lakes, and driving five miles would not only be a hardship, but there would be a danger of getting lost.\n\nThe plans of the proposed school at Lake St. Martin Reserve, which were forwarded to Mr. Sigurdson were returned here and I forwarded them to Mr. Herman Helgason of Ashern for an Estimate. He will work on them during spare time this winter and give an estimate as soon as his prices are completed. I believe his estimate will be considerably less than that quoted by Mr. Sigurdson. Mr. Helgason built the nursing station on the Little Saskatchewan Reserve, also the bull barn. I know he is a capable contractor and any work he undertakes is done in a satisfactory manner.\n\nJ.

During the emergency war years, some variations from these regulations were permitted, but we are now required to advertise for tenders on construction of public buildings in excess of $5,000.00. Attached hereto please find a sample advertisement. It is our intention to advertise for tenders for the construction of the Lake St. Martin Day School in the near future. Therefore, we would request you to advise us:\n\n(a) The names of the newspapers in or near your agency in which you would recommend that we advertise;\n\n(b) Post offices and other government buildings in which we should display drawings, specifications, etc.\n\nNaturally, your own office will be one in which we will display drawings, etc. If no tenders are received after advertising, you will be advised so that other means can be considered whereby the construction of this school can be carried out during the fiscal year 1948-49.

The erection of a prefabricated school.\n\nWith regard to (2) above, the Department, as previously stated, has a complete bill of materials for the construction of this standard school. Other agents have successfully had this school constructed this year by employing a foreman-carpenter and Indian helpers. The drawings and specifications are very clear and the Department buys all the necessary materials. I give you this information so that you can consider such a mode of construction if advertising fails.\n\nWe would appreciate receiving from you the information required in paras (a) and (b) above. We should also be advised as to the availability of hydro and water facilities and their distance from the school building.\n\nEnc.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F.

The only newspapers delivered in the area Winnipeg to Gypsumville are the Winnipeg Free Press and Winnipeg Tribune.\n\nB. I would suggest postings in the three following post offices:\n   Lundar, Ashern and Gypsumville.\n\nThere is also a daily newspaper at Portage la Prairie \"The Daily Graphic.\" I would also suggest that this newspaper be used as it has a fairly large circulation in the Portage district.\n\nJ. Waite,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 26, 1948.\n\nMr. J. Waite, Indian Agent, Portage la Prairie, Manitoba.\n\nLake St. Martin Indian Day School.\n\nReference your 49-39C (127).\n\nIt would seem that before any definite steps can be taken with regard to advertising for tenders for the construction of the above Day School that we reach a definite decision as to the intended site. Could we please be advised whether you have received from Mr. Hamilton, copies of the report submitted by Mr. D.B. Gow, District Chief Engineer, Lands and Development Services Branch of this Department. You will recall that Mr. Gow visited the Lake St. Martin area in June, 1947, and submitted a report concerning two sites which you had suggested. In a covering memorandum from the Chief Engineer we were advised at the time as follows:\n\n\"It will be noted that the only source of drinking water is from a well with a limited supply of about four (4) barrels a day situated about 1500 feet from No. 1 site and presumably about 3780 feet from No. 2 site. As the expense of installing a pumping installation from the existing well to either site could obviously not be justified, it would appear that water required for drinking purposes at either site would have to be hauled from the well periodically to a storage tank, which should be installed in the schools\".\n\nWe are quite determined not to locate any school unless we are assured of a good source of water. Past experience has indicated the wisdom of being assured of a water supply before the construction of a school begins.\nTherefore, it would seem evident that steps will have to be taken with regard to the sinking of a well before any further consideration can be given to the request for tenders. In view of your knowledge of local conditions, it would be appreciated if we could be advised as to the obtaining of an underground water supply.\n\nUnder separate cover you have already been forwarded a copy of the blueprints for a standard one room school with attached teacher's residence which we intend building at this place. You will note that although only one classroom is actually provided for, the basement is very large and well lighted and is so planned as to be available for a second classroom if and where needed.\n\nBernard F.

Mines & Resources, Ottawa\n\nRe: 126-7-5 (WT), February 26, 1948\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of Department letter above noted, and wish to advise that Mr. Gow's report was attached to Department letter of June 24th, 1947. This letter was answered on September 10th.\n\nThe present well, at the old school site on this reserve, gives about 20 pails a day. The water runs in slowly and is being used by the Indians. This would be sufficient water for the school and teacher's residence, but would not accommodate the Indians in addition.\n\nMy understanding is that it is the intention of the Department to build one school this summer and another in the near future. If this is correct, the new school this summer should be built at the south site and a well should be drilled. I think water should be obtained at the south site between 80 and 100 feet. The site is slightly rolling and approximately one mile from the old school site. The depth at which water should be obtained is more guess work than anything. The depth of wells vary considerably in the immediate district, from 58 feet to 150 feet. The well should be drilled before any work is done on the school, as there is every possibility of a running well in such close proximity to the lake. Any overflow can be taken care of if drilled before anything is done on the building of the school.\n\nIf it is intended that only one school is to be built on the reserve, then the old site should be chosen. It is fairly central, but it would mean that children remote from the site would have to walk 4\u00bd miles. If the south school was built this year, the old school would acco-\ndate the children from the north end of the reserve for another year or two. However, it would mean two teachers, one of whom would have to walk from the old school to the residence to be built on the new school. The present teacher, Mrs. Beagell is very difficult to get along with. None of the Department nurses have been able to live with her even for a few days at a time, and I am doubtful of an arrangement where two women would have to live together for quite some time.\n\nWill you kindly advise further in this matter regarding the intention of the Department in the matter of erecting one or two schools.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 15, 1948.\n\nMr. A. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nProposed Peguis South Day School\n\nProposed Lake St. Martin Day School\n\nOak River Day School.\n\nDuring his recent visit to the Department Mr. Indian Agent Young advised that he was completely satisfied with the work of Mr. John Robertson of Kenton, Manitoba, in erecting the Oak River School. It is therefore suggested that Mr. Robertson be approached to ascertain if he is interested in building another school for us on the same basis.\n\nIncluded in our 1948-49 estimates are one-room schools and attached teachers' residences for Lake St. Martin in the Portage la Prairie Agency and Peguis South in the Fisher River Agency. It is recommended that Mr. Robertson be approached concerning these schools. They would be identical with the one he is now finishing at Oak River.\n\nIt would require two or three months to obtain the standard bill of materials for these schools. Therefore we are trying to line up our building programme now, before there is too much contracting activity.\n\nI might add that we have found that the day labour basis of building, as adopted at Oak River, has proven cheaper than the cost plus basis contract, as used at Burdock in the Fisher River Agency, while we have not yet the final cost.\nfigures, it is evident that the Oak River School will cost less than the Murdoch School (these buildings are identical).\n\nFrom the map it would seem evident that Mr. Robertson would be more likely to be interested in the Lake St. Martin School rather than in the Peguis School. Therefore Mr. Lamby should advise if there is any good carpenter interested in the Peguis School on a day labour basis.\n\nBlueprints, specifications and bills of materials for the standard one-room school with teacher's residence are being sent, along with this letter to the two Agents concerned.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F.

(RG 10, Volume 6238, file 522-5, part 3)\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Lake St. Martin\n\nIf you refer to Mr. Waite's letter (March 4, 1948, file 126-7-5) you will notice that he recommends two schools. He wishes to avoid transportation.\n\nThe enrolment of 51 pupils as recorded in the last quarterly return (December 1947) seems to justify this stand. On checking the treaty list I find 51 pupils 1 to 6 and 52 - 7 to 16. These figures check fairly well with the last census (1944) which give 56 and 44 respectively.\n\nEnclosed please find a map of the reserve. The pencilled \"X\" is the approximate location of the present school. It is fairly central and is about four miles from the East and West boundaries. Distances appear to be road distances which are longer than that indicated on the map, due to many detours which are necessary due to low lands. This distance will be shortened when the road program is carried out.\n\nThe two new schools would be about one mile East of the present school and one mile West. The population is grouped mostly in the centre of the reserve. There are about eight families living near the West boundary, that would be over three miles from the centre and four families, living near the East boundary, that would be over three miles away.\n\nI believe that a central two-room school would provide educational facilities to this community for many years. Briefly, the advantages of a two-room school over two, one-room schools, would be as follows:\n\nAdvantages of two, one-room schools:\n1. Will bring the East and West boundary families within three miles from the school.\n2. Possibly avoid the necessity of transportation.\n\nAdvantages of one, two-roomed school:\n1. Less expensive to construct than two, one-room schools.\n2. Would avoid the necessity to drill two new wells. There is a well at the central location.\n\n-over-\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6238, file S22-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA Pool Copy\n3. Less difficulty to obtain teachers.\n4. Better community centre.\n5. Less liable to create factions.\n6. Better educational opportunities for the children.\n\nOne main disadvantage of the central large school would be the necessity, possibly, of transporting the pupils from the two extremes. This would not be a serious problem as these people have horses. It might entail an expenditure of about $500.00 yearly.\n\nThe educational setup of a two-room day school was discussed with Provincial Inspector Simms who concurs with our opinion of its advantages over the double proposition. Mr. Waite suggested the two schools to conform to the policy of \"no transportation\".\n\nShould the proposition of one central school be decided it will be necessary to send the plans, specifications and bill of material for a two-room school. Mr. McKenzie is willing to undertake it on the same conditions as the others. However, a new estimate for the lump sum must be calculated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. J. Doucet.\nMr. B. F. Neary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nEnclosed please find a report on the educational setup at Lake St. Martin.\n\nIt is not possible at the present time to visit this place so this report is really from remote control. However, I feel that the complete picture should be before the Department in order to make the proper decision. Please let us know as soon as possible which of these two schools will be built so that further steps may be taken with the contractors.\n\nI have received various letters re the teacher at Oak River and will interview Mr. Young and the other parties concerned in a few days.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

Waite,\nField Agent, Indian Affairs,\n536 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nLake St. Martin Indian Day School\n\nReference your 206-4B (127) of May 17.\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of bill of materials for two-room Indian Day School at Lake St. Martin. In view of Mr. Doucet's recommendations, we are transferring money from Valley River (where we intended to erect a two-room school) to Lake St. Martin (where we intended to erect a one-room school). This change in plans means that we will have funds for a two-room school at Lake St. Martin and for a one-room school at Valley River.\n\nIt is anticipated that we will be receiving from you in the near future a tender for the labour on the construction of this building. In the meantime we cannot place the entire order for the bill of materials until Ministerial approval as to the contractor is obtained. However, we are ordering the cement immediately so that there will be no delay with the excavation of the basement and the pouring of the concrete. If the contractor could give an indication as to the approximate cost of the lumber required for the concrete forms we could authorize local purchase of this amount, so that work could begin on the basement almost as soon as we have Ministerial approval for the labour tender.\n\nTherefore, we are today forwarding to the Departmental Purchasing Agent a requisition for the purchase...\nof 700 bags of cement. It is presumed that we will also hear from you with regard to local purchase of the gravel required. I would also like to know if we should forward an accountable advance of $500.00 to you in order to cover hauling and other local charges.\n\nBernard F.

We will wire you immediately when a decision is reached on this tender.\n\nIt will be necessary to submit a separate requisition for door and sash hardware. Mr. Helgason can doubtless assist you with such a requisition if his tender is accepted. We will also require a requisition for the lumber needed for the cabinets and stairs. It is presumed that Mr. Helgason can make these on the ground.\n\nI will send you a copy of the requisitions to the Purchasing Agent. You will note that I have recommended local purchase of the gravel and sand required.\n\nI would also suggest that you consider submitting a requisition for the paint which will be needed. I would suggest the following colours:\n\n(a) Outside - white with shamrock green trim.\n(b) Class rooms - pale green for upper walls with darker green for walls under blackboards.\n\n(c) Kitchen - white.\n\n(d) Living Room - Cream.\n\n(e) Bed Rooms - Pale Blue.\n\n(f) Basement - Light green concrete paint.\n\nBernard F.

Two extra copies of Order-in-Council are required.\nJune 14, 1948.\n\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY\n\nTHE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL,\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to report:\n\nTHAT it is immediately necessary, and funds are provided in the 1948-49 estimates, Indian Affairs Branch, Mines and Resources, to construct a combined two-room Indian day school and teachers' residence on the Lake St. Martin Indian Reserve, Portage la Prairie Indian Agency, Province of Manitoba;\n\nTHAT it is essential that educational facilities be provided for the Indian children on the Lake St. Martin Indian Reserve and living quarters for two Indian day school teachers;\n\nTHAT Section 36 of the Public Works Act, Chapter 166, R.S.C., 1927, provides, in part as follows:\n\n\"Whenever any works are to be executed under the direction of any Department of the Government the minister having charge of such Department shall invite tenders by public advertisement for the execution of such works except in cases (a) of pressing emergency in which delay would be injurious to the public interest . . . .\"\n\nTHAT efforts have been made to interest builders and contractors in the vicinity of the said reserve but the builders and contractors have advised that they would not be interested in tenders if invited as aforesaid, as they have all the work they can do in their own localities;\n\nTHAT a competent building contractor, namely Norman Belgaon, of Ashern, Manitoba, whom our officials state to be a reliable contractor, has agreed to undertake the construction of the said building immediately on a straight labour contract of Seven Thousand Two Hundred and Fifty Dollars ($7,250.00) with the Department supplying all materials;\n\nTHAT it is considered that the construction of this building is a pressing emergency and within the exception provided in Section 36 above recited and further, it is considered that the work can be more expeditiously and economically executed as suggested herein.\n\nThe undersigned, therefore, recommends that authority be granted for the provision of this building as outlined above, this being the only arrangement possible at the present time and it being essential that this work be undertaken at once and carried to completion in order that the building will be available for use by the time the next school term commences.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nMinister of Mines and Resources.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6238, file 522-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\n\nPoor Copy\nOttawa, June 14th, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Lake St. Martin Indian Day School.\n\nIncluded in our main estimates for the year 1948-49 was the sum of $14,000.00 for the erection of a one room Indian day school and attached teacher's residence on the Lake St. Martin Indian Reserve, Portage la Prairie Indian Agency, Province of Manitoba.\n\nBefore erecting this school we had an educational survey carried out by our Supervisor of Vocational Training. We were of the impression here that a two room school should be erected and this feeling has now been confirmed by Mr. Boulet's report. It has been decided to transfer funds from the Valley River Day School and to erect a two room school at Lake St. Martin instead of the one room school originally planned.\n\nWe are, therefore, forwarding today to the Departmental Purchasing Agent a bill of materials for the erection of such a school.\n\nPlease find attached a copy of a tender from Mr. Herman Helgason of Ashern, Manitoba, for all the labour work connected with this school. Normally the construction of a school costs us between $25,000.00 and $30,000.00 depending upon its location. We have an estimate from North American Lumber and Supply Company on the bill of materials for this school amounting to approximately\n$9,000.00. With Mr. Helgason's labour contract of $7,250.00, we should be able to erect the school for approximately $20,000.00.\n\nWe feel that Mr. Helgason's tender is a satisfactory one and have, therefore, prepared the Order in Council as indicated above.\n\nDirector.\n\nBFH/MGD\nIN INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\nDEPT MINES AND RESOURCES\nOTTAWA\n\nRE YOUR SIGNAL JUNE 10 STOP FORWARDED HELGASON LAKE ST MARTIN CONTRACT\nWITH LETTER OF JUNE 8\n\nR S DAVIS\nREGIONAL SUPERVISOR\nMINES AND RESOURCES\nWINNIPEG\n\nTHI 121027R KK\nOttawa June 10, 1948.\n\nMr. J.

Hamilton,\nSupt. of Indian Agency,\nPortage la Prairie, Manitoba.\n\nLake St. Martin Indian Day School.\n\nReference your 49-39 C of October 16th.\n\nFurther to our conversation, please be advised that the following minor structural changes will be necessary in the blue prints provided for this school:\n\n(1) The stairs from the teachers' living quarters to their bedrooms should be straightened out to remove the landing. This is due to the fact that the hand rail at the foot of the stairs is too high to permit the passage of furniture between it and the ceiling. By eliminating the landing, we will allow more space in the living-room and also will be able to take large pieces of furniture upstairs more easily. The Contractor at one of our other construction projects did this by putting in fourteen steps and by raising them 8\" apart.\n\n(2) On Sheet No. 3 of Plan # 849, you will note that the door in the closet to the left hand bedroom is so situated that it hits the sloping ceiling of the bedroom when it is opened. This can easily be removed by moving the door 3\" to the right.\nUnder separate cover I am mailing you another set of the blueprints and two sets of specifications. As our stock is depleted and it will be necessary to run off a new batch of prints, would you please obtain an extra set from Mr. Davis' office.\n\nBernard F.

I called on Ashdown's, Marshall-Wells, General Steel Wares, Eaton's, Imperial Iron Corporation and Dufault Sheet Metal.\n\nNo one could supply a cast iron furnace and no promise could be made when one of 200,000 capacity could be made available. It was stated definitely nothing could be done this year. Another real problem was the shortage of sheet metal. In this respect Mr. Dufault gave some glimmer of hope.\n\nI attach a cut showing the only large furnace I could locate in Winnipeg. These furnaces are in urgent demand and Mr. Argue could not hold one pending a reply - thus the need for your immediate decision.\n\nYou will note Mr. Dufault has been good enough to undertake this work, but he is short of sheet metal. Is there any way the Department can get released to Mr. Dufault the metal listed on his quotation? The quotation is only good pending the release of metal.\n\nMr. Helgason already is asking for the pipes for the partitions to the upstairs and these should be supplied at the earliest possible date.\nI am concerned because I do not believe another furnace is available in Winnipeg and I am sure the one proposed will give service.\n\nPlease wire re accepting and what action has been taken re supplying the sheet metal.\n\nA.G.

All outgoing letters should bear the official file number and originator's designation.\n| Reference | By | Remarks | Date | PA No. | By | Date | For Remarks |\n|-----------|----|---------|------|--------|----|------|------------|\n| 10672     |    |         |      |        |    |      |            |\n| 9457      |    |         |      |        |    |      |            |\n| 107       |    |         |      |        |    |      |            |\n| 612       |    |         |      |        |    |      |            |\n| 617       |    |         |      |        |    |      |            |\n| 109       |    |         |      |        |    |      |            |\n| 10-575    |    |         |      |        |    |      |            |\n| 10-2012   |    |         |      |        |    |      |            |\n| 13211     |    |         |      |        |    |      |            |\n| 13212     |    |         |      |        |    |      |            |\n| 13213     |    |         |      |        |    |      |            |\n| 13214     |    |         |      |        |    |      |            |\n| 13215     |    |         |      |        |    |      |            |\n| 13216     |    |         |      |        |    |      |            |\n| 13217     |    |         |      |        |    |      |            |\n| 13218     |    |         |      |        |    |      |            |\n| 13219     |    |         |      |        |    |      |            |\n| 13220     |    |         |      |        |    |      |            |\n| 13221     |    |         |      |        |    |      |            |\n| 13222     |    |         |      |        |    |      |            |\n| 13223     |    |         |      |        |    |      |            |\n| 13224     |    |         |      |        |    |      |            |\n| 13225     |    |         |      |        |    |      |            |\n| 13226     |    |         |      |        |    |      |            |\n| 13227     |    |         |      |        |    |      |            |\n| 13228     |    |         |      |        |    |      |            |\n| 13229     |    |         |      |        |    |      |            |\n| 13230     |    |         |      |        |    |      |            |\n| 13231     |    |         |      |        |    |      |            |\n| 13232     |    |         |      |        |    |      |            |\n| 13233     |    |         |      |        |    |      |            |\n| 13234     |    |         |      |        |    |      |            |\n| 13235     |    |         |      |        |    |      |            |\n| 13236     |    |         |      |        |    |      |            |\n| 13237     |    |         |      |        |    |      |            |\n| 13238     |    |         |      |        |    |      |            |\n| 13239     |    |         |      |        |    |      |            |\n\nDO NOT WRITE BELOW THIS LINE\n\nIndian Affairs.

Neary,\n\nI am enclosing herewith a Progress Report on the Lake St. Martin School. This man has not followed out the specifications, but he has been instructed to make the necessary changes. However, he has plenty of work done to cover this additional $2000.00 and I recommend payment be made.\n\nLast week, I visited Lake St. Martin 2 room school, which is under construction, with Mr. Ross of the Surveys and Engineering Branch, and I am forwarding you a list of work that Mr. Helgason, the Contractor has not done according to specifications. The shiplap on the main walls of the building on the inside has not been done as specified - it has been nailed straight around the building in place of putting it diagonally. While the building would have been stronger if it had been put on diagonally, nothing can be done at this late date.\n\nMr. Hamilton has visited this school practically every week this summer, but as far as I can see has done nothing but make social calls. I advised Mr. Helgason that final payment will not be made until such time as these changes are made.\n\nR. S.

Davis\n\nRe your letter of Feb. 28, 1949 as to work on Lake St. Martin School. I might state that the main work left on this building is the painting inside and out. Owing to severe weather and very bad roads I have not thought it wiseable to send up the men yet to go up there with men on the 26th and will finish all work possible. I gave Mr. J. Waite a list of material still missing. Kindly advise me if this has been sent up. I do not think that the outside painting can be done satisfactory before the end of this month unless the weather breaks. There has been enough work done to put the third payment which I have not received yet, Kindly see to that.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nHermann Helgason\n\nCOPY\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Lake St. Martin School\n\nThe Contractor, Mr. H.

I have been in contact with Mr. Helgason and as you will note from attached copy of a letter Mr. Helgason claims it will be impossible to do the necessary finishing before the end of this month.\n\nI am pressing Mr. Helgason to commence work as soon as possible in order to try and clear this matter up prior to the 31st of March of this year. If the work cannot be completed before the end of March will you please advise me as to the latest date which I may submit accounts to be paid out of 1948-49 funds.\n\nI am also enclosing a requisition for several items still required by the Contractor to complete this building and I would request your authority for local purchase of same.

Revised plans Indexed 889, were drawn up to provide additional space in the furnace room.\n\nWe do not concur with their suggestion to enclose the furnace room in frame walls instead of concrete as shown. Every effort has been made to reduce the fire hazard to a minimum and for this reason in addition to structural considerations, the furnace room should be built as shown.\n\nAs requested, we are returning herewith the letter from the Campbell Heating Company Limited.\n\nB.F.

S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\nDear Sir:\n\nAttached hereto is a memorandum by Mr. J. T. Rose reporting on the work to be completed on the Lake St. Martin Indian Reserve School.\n\nYou will note that Mr. Rose estimates that about $2,000 will be required to complete the school in accordance with the specifications. It would appear advisable, therefore, that sufficient funds should be retained in order to insure that the Contractor will finish this work in a satisfactory manner.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nD. B. Gow,\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\n\nEncl.\n\nMr. R. S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor,\nIndian Agencies,\n532 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nMemorandum\n\nMr. D. B. Gow\n\nRe: Progress Report on School Building for the Indian Affairs Branch (Lake St., Martin Reserve).\n\nA visit was made by writer to the above school on April 12th in company with Mr. Waite of the Indian Affairs Branch and an inspection was made of the work done.\n\nIn the Basement:\n\nFinishing of walls and floors remains to be done. Doors are to be made and hung. Windows are to be hinged and fitted with transom chains, locks and chain raising attachments. Storms are to have brackets attached. Other finishing is to be done and painting completed.\n\nThe furnace work is completed but the draft controls are to be carried to a fixed plate upstairs and one cold air entry is to be made into the south basement room. This type of furnace takes so much space it would be advisable to have any future school built to this plan changed so that the furnace room would be 3 feet wider. At present there is no way to get at the smoke pipe for cleaning or replacement except by removing one cold air pipe which blocks access space at present.\n\nFirst Floor Classrooms:\n\nBlackboards, cupboard door frames and a minor amount of work on the trims and window shelves remain to be done. Painting has not been started. The floors require sanding before varnishing.\n\nLiving Quarters:\n\nThe dresser remains to be built and installed. All trim and floors require sanding before painting. Chimney beading and plastering over the brick besides all crackfilling, here and in the school rooms, are to be done before painting can be carried on.\n\nA vent should be cut and trimmed for the chemical toilet.\n\nExterior Finish:\n\nChimney capping and painting of the flashing around the chimneys are to be done. Flashing is to be completed along water stop. All painting is to be done. Toilets are to be put on sills and placed. The outside catchbasin is to be built at junction of drains from basement rooms.\n\nIt is estimated this work will amount to about $2,000. It was found, on a visit to the contractor in his home at Ashorn, that he planned to proceed on Monday with his workmen to complete the work as rapidly as possible. He expects a payment to be made him on account. It seems reasonable that he receive an amount which would leave $2,000. to be paid on completion of the work.\n\nMr. D. B.

It would not appear advisable, therefore, under these conditions to send in a teacher to take up work on the reserve, but the Inspector is being asked whether it would be practicable to establish a school for these Indians where their homes are situated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

This condition of residence I was not aware of as I have never visited the reserve. However, in the years we have had a summer teacher out there, we have had a fair attendance during the summer months. Having heard nothing from Mr. Atkinson, who is out there this summer, I cannot speak regarding this year's attendance. At the same time Mr. Atkinson will have to be paid for his services. If the Department does not wish a teacher sent out there in future, why of course we will not think of sending one out. Whatever may be decided on for another year by the Department will be satisfactory. In the meantime provision will have to be made for Mr. Atkinson's summer's work.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant reporting that you had sent Mr. Atkinson out to Little Grand Rapids to engage in school work during the past summer.\n\nOn May 23rd, last, you were informed that the Department regretted that it had not information regarding the probability of conducting a successful summer at this point and that it was not considered advisable to send in a teacher. Apparently, notwithstanding this letter, you have sent Mr. Atkinson in. Nothing has been heard of him by yourself and nothing by the Department. No school supplies were asked for and no instructions of any kind were given from here.\n\nIn view of the letter above referred to the Department would like to have some explanation from you as to why you sent Mr. Atkinson in, what instructions you gave him with regard to the school work, the rate of pay that you agreed upon, etc. The Department cannot bind itself to pay Mr. Atkinson unless he has performed services as a teacher, which is highly improbable, at least to appreciable extent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

This will explain why your communication of May 23rd came too late to prevent action being taken this year. I do not think the Department to pay for any work except that which has been done by Mr. Atkinson in the school. I do not think he has given much time to anything other than teaching. I have had no report from him as yet. No doubt the report of his work and the attendance at the school will reach the Department in due time.\n\nI expect to be in Ottawa some time after the middle of October, and will be able to answer any further questions that might throw light upon the case.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Band is willing to exchange land at the south of the reserve for the land asked for, and I respectfully ask for your decision in the matter.\n\nThe land in this district is of very little value, and if the Department feels disposed to grant the request of the Little Grand Rapids Band for this exchange, arrangements can be made now and survey obtained when convenient.\n\nThe establishment of a Hudson's Bay Post at the reserves of Deer Lake and Pekangekum now provides work by freighting for many men of the Little Grand Rapids band whose families remain near their reserve, during the summer months.

I requested the Rev. Mr. Barner to make a special report of the schools on the river and this is incorporated in my reply.\n\nAlex Murdoch who is teaching at Deer Lake, Ontario, is a graduate of Brandon Industrial School and has a pretty fair education. He has had one year's experience teaching at Nelson Lake. Mr. Barner reports of him as follows: \"I visited the school at Deer Lake on the 19th of July, 1918, and found 15 children present. Mr. Alex Murdoch, a graduate of Brandon School in charge. He commenced work on June 17th and up-to-date has had an average attendance of 10. This will increase when the Cranes arrive from Sandy Lake. I was much impressed with Alex's ability to teach these children. He certainly has the genius though not the professional training of a teacher. The children are well behaved and diligent. The building belongs to the people and the church. It is made of logs well covered up. The roof is made of heavy poles covered with tar paper. The walls inside are made of heavy poles covered with hewn poles. The floor is made of whippoorwill lumber. There are no desks. The seats are homemade. The school equipment is much better than at Little Grand Rapids. There is an overplus of slates which we are sending to the school at Little Grand Rapids.\"\n\nAlexander Crate is at Pekangekum. He has had a good general education in English. Has a good general knowledge of trading and business and is splendidly suitable for Pekangekum School. Mr. Barner did not visit this school.\nMrs. Mary Nanakup teacher at Little Grand Rapids is a graduate of this school and has a good general education in English. Mr. Barner visited the school on the 12th of July and reports as follows: \"I found a good building made of logs, well roofed but not chinked or plastered in any way. There were 40 children in attendance well behaved and attentive. Mrs. Nanakup (Mary Jane Gibault) a graduate of the Brandon Industrial School was in charge. This woman is evidently a consecrated worker and quite capable of handling a school of this elementary type. The furniture and equipment are very poor. The seats are simply rude logs on legs and there are no desks of any kind. With the few lesson cards and scribblers in stock the teacher was getting very good results in lettering and writing by the pupils. We visited the school again on Monday finding 71 present. We talked to the people about the school in the Sunday services and urged them to send their children.\"\n\n\"I am deeply impressed with what I have seen of the experiment of appointing the educated Indians as teachers of these elementary schools. From the purely economic stand-point it is good business in my judgment for in the case of Deer Lake where, previous to this year, they have had only one summer term of school, the young men who are now freighting can keep notes in their books, do some figuring and some writing in Cree. It seems to be a useless thing to send persons into these schools who do not know the Cree as well as the English for there cannot be a point of contact with the children.\"\n\nTrusting that the Department will find this report satisfactory, I am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nF.

We supplement this with $100 in each case, and am settling with the teachers on a basis of $400. I understand from the accountant of our Mission Board that no cheques have been received yet from the Government for these three schools. I presume there is on account of the reports not having reached Ottawa. I will see that they are forthcoming as soon as I return to Brandon, but when the cheque is issued will you kindly see that it covers the amount of $500, irrespective of the number of days that was given in the classroom in each of the schools. This I believe to be the maximum that was possible during the summer in each case.\n\nWill you kindly see that supplies for next summer for these schools are sent in not later than February, so that they will be at Berens River ready to go up as soon as the boats move on the river.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ Perrier\n\nDuncan C.

The Department will provide an amount of $300.00 for salary for each of these schools and will pay this amount in full, provided the schools are open a minimum of at least 60 days during the summer.\n\nYou should arrange for teachers for next summer in time for them to arrive at their respective schools to begin duties as early in the summer as possible and you should inform the Department of their names and qualifications which they possess.\n\nYour request that supplies be sent these schools not later than February next, has been noted.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nRev.

Original on File 427001-25.\n\nLITTLE GRAND RAPIDS.\n\nThe summer day schools at Little Grand Rapids, Deer Lake and Pekangekum did not operate this summer, I understand. In fact the work at these several reserves varies in operation so much that it is not very satisfactory from any viewpoint so far as I am able to figure it out. In fact so long as the Indians are of nomadic habits it is doubtful if schools can be of much advantage, as it is very difficult to assemble the children for classes owing to the erratic habits of life of the parents or guardians.\n\n(Sgd.) Jno. R. Bunn,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n26th July 1922\n\nMr. Russell T. Ferrier\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to inform you that the School-teacher, that is the Missionary Teacher Mr. Hope, who was at Poplar River has been stationed by the Manitoba Conference at Little Grand Rapids up the Berens River Manitoba. He will be prepared to open School under the sanction of the Indian Department using our Church building for the purpose.\n\nI understand that there was a standing arrangement between Dr. Scott and Mr. Ferrier that those inland points were to be supplied by Summer School teachers whenever we could find teachers who were willing to go. The places are hard to reach. In this case, however, it is prepared today all year and I trust the Department will see its way clear to appoint him as a yearly teacher for 1922-23.\n\nOur Mr. Niddrie has gone up there this summer at my request and at great expense to build a little house for Mr. Hope. He has sent in a requisition for School Supplies. I trust you will give special attention to it. I was there myself last summer and I know that \"the cupboard was bare.\"\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nArthur Warner\nOttawa, August 3, 1922.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, informing the Department that Mr. W. J. Hope, formerly Teacher at Poplar River, has been transferred to Little Grand Rapids, and that he will open school at that place, using your church building for the purpose.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the re-opening of this school, under the charge of Mr. Hope, is approved. He will be allowed salary at the rate of $800 per annum plus any bonus provided by law.\n\nIt is noted that Mr. Hope is prepared to remain throughout the year, and if the attendance of Indian children warrants it, the Department would have no objection to this school being open the full year. We will be better able to decide this point after the first quarterly return, showing attendance, etc., is received from Mr. Hope.\n\nI may add that the requisition forwarded by Rev. Mr. Hiddrie has been received. The text books asked for have been ordered, to be sent from the Government Stationery Office, and Mr. Agent Latulippe, of Selkirk, was instructed to forward the other supplies asked for.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Arthur Barner that Mr. W. J. Hope, formerly teacher at Poplar River, has been transferred by the Manitoba Conference to take charge of the school at Little Grand Rapids, and that he will open the school at that point, using the Methodist Church building for the purpose. Mr. Barner requests that the school at this point be kept open for the full year, as he states that Mr. Hope is prepared to stay throughout the year.\n\nWe have informed Mr. Barner that the transfer of Mr. Hope is approved and that the salary allowed will be at the rate of $800 per annum plus any bonus provided by law. This is the same rate as was allowed per schedule of salaries agreed upon for teachers in that northern district.\n\nWe have forwarded a supply of stationery and have asked Mr. Agent Latulippe to purchase and send to the teacher a quantity of other material which was asked for.\n\nThe question of continuing this school throughout the year will depend on the attendance, as shown by the first quarterly return received from Mr. Hope.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Hope, formerly teacher at Poplar River, to Little Grand Rapids, where he will re-open the school in the Methodist Church building. They state that Mr. Hope is prepared to stay at this point throughout the year, and request that the school be kept in operation the full year instead of for the summer months only.\n\nWe are allowing Mr. Hope salary at the rate of $800 per annum, plus any bonus provided by law. We have also arranged to forward a supply of classroom and other material which was requisitioned for by the church authorities.\n\nThe question of continuing this school during the full school year will receive consideration after the first quarter return, showing the attendance, etc., is received from the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Ferrier  \nIndustrial School.\n\nAUG 23 1922\n\nTF/GD\nI may point out at this juncture that the only building available in which to teach school in that district is situated at Little Grand Rapids, near the Hudson's Bay post. When Mr. Niddrie, our Missionary, went up there in July to assist Mr. Hope in erecting a small dwelling he held council with the Indians regarding the best place to carry on for the present time and with the exception of one man, they decided to conduct school in the church at Little Grand Rapids. Therefore a small house was erected, the walls of logs, in which Mr. Hope will live this year.\n\nIf it is finally decided that there shall be no change in the location of the Reserve, it may be necessary to change the site for the school house to one of the other points mentioned in your letter. It goes without saying that we wish to cooperate in every way with the Department in its plans. I shall be glad to know at any time should a decision be made to erect a school house for the Indians in this district. I have no doubt that Mr. Perrier will be taking this matter up with you personally when he visits Ottawa. I am sending him a copy of this letter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd.)

F.\nIndustrial School, Brandon, Man.,\nOctober 27th, 1922.\n\n574088\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nI have received a letter from Mr. W. J. Hope written from the Dynevor Hospital, in which he expresses a desire that he may be admitted into this hospital. No doubt the Department has heard from the Agent at Selkirk concerning him.\n\nMr. Hope is the man who was teaching for us at Poplar River and was sent out to Little Grand Rapids last summer. This will create a vacancy in our teaching staff at this point. I have not heard from Mr. Macdonald our missionary at Poplar River as to whether he had sent any one out there to take on the work but will inform the Department as soon as I receive any information.\n\nIn the meantime, I trust he will be well cared for at the hospital in Selkirk. I have written the Minister at Selkirk to visit him and report to me on his condition.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT. Ferrier\nOttawa, Nov. 7, 1922.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have yours of the 27th ultimo, referring to Mr. W. J. Hope, late Teacher of the Little Grand Rapids Indian Day School. I have noted that Mr. Hope is in the Dynevor Hospital and that you are waiting for further information before suggesting a successor for the cause at the Berens River.\n\nMr. Agent Latulippe reports that Mr. Hope has informed him there were no children in attendance at the Little Grand Rapids Indian Day School on the first of September, last, and that he did not expect any until the time of the 1923 annuity payment. In view of these facts, the Department will not expect to continue the grant for this school for the winter months. It is extremely doubtful if school activities at Little Grand Rapids, Pikangikum and Deer Lake are successful enough to warrant Government expenditure.\n\nConcerning Mr. Hope at the Dynevor Hospital, I wish to state that the Department will expect him to meet his own expenses.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T.

The teacher reported that on the 1st of September not one child appeared at the school, being all away with their parents.\n\nMr.W.J.Hope came in to Selkirk by the last boat for medical treatment and was advised by his physician to proceed to Ninette Sanatorium, but he is still in the neighborhood and has requested that his salary cheque be forwarded to Selkirk, P.O., or to this office.\n\nAlso please find quarterly returns for the Berens River Meth.Ind.Day School from Mr.C.D.Street; I have not received notice from the Department as to the appointment of this teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, Nov. 8, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant, enclosing Quarterly Returns covering the period the Little Grand Rapids Indian Day School was in operation during the past summer.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that salary is being allowed Mr. W. J. Hope for two months from the 24th of July, last. As this school is conducted under the auspices of the Methodist Church, a cheque for the amount of salary due him for the two months, viz., $150, has been sent to the Treasurer of the Missionary Society, Toronto. A cheque for the amount of bonus due for two months, viz., $30, is being sent him in your care. Mr. Hope should apply to the Treasurer of the Methodist Missionary Society for the amount of his salary.\n\nRegarding the appointment of the teacher at the Berens River Methodist Indian Day School, you will be advised in a separate communication.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Ferrier,\nIndustrial School,\nBrandon.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nRe your letter of October 27th in connection with Mr. W. J. Hope:\n\nI walked out to St. Peter's reserve today to see this man, a rather longer walk than I had expected, as the man resides on the east side of the river about six miles from my home.\n\nI found the man at home in a poor little house. He is slow but his friends, perhaps help him. He is far from well and unless he gets some proper treatment I fear he will not live long. I spoke to him about going to Ninette. Dr. Gibbs has made some arrangements to receive him in hospital at Ninette and the man is quite willing to go but he is without means and if he is required to pay, cannot do so. Can you through the missionary society do anything for him? With proper treatment he may recover. Left alone as he is I do not think this possible and he should not be left alone. Perhaps the Indian Department might pay for his keep as he is an Indian.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSIGNED O. E. Somerset\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn your letter of the 7th No. 125-12-1 you state the following re Mr. W. J. Hope:\n\n\"Concerning Mr. Hope at Dymavor Hospital, I wish to state that the Department will expect him to meet his own expenses.\"\n\nI requested the Rev. Mr. Somerset, the Methodist Minister at Selkirk to visit Mr. Hope and report to me. I enclose you a copy of his reply. The old man is in a needy condition and I feel something should be done for him. Does he not belong to the Poplar River Band or the Berens River Band and receive his annuity from the Department? I have had a conversation with Dr. Stewart who has charge of the Minette Hospital and he informs me the best he could do is to put him on the waiting list. He says the Municipalities pay the Institution $1.96 per day per patient for those unable to pay for themselves but that the actual cost is $2.60 per day. Would it not be possible for the Department to arrange to take him into the Dymavor Hospital? I make this request believing the case is more urgent than the Department was aware of when writing on the 7th. If this can be done it might be well to instruct your Agent to take immediate steps towards this end.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have noted that Mr. Hope is in a needy condition and is living alone on the old St. Peter's Reserve.\n\nIn reply I wish to state that Mr. Hope's name does not appear on the treaty lists for the Poplar River or Berens River Bands. The Department believes this gentleman is a half-breed and a non-treaty. In view of his straitened circumstances and ill health, it has been decided to have him admitted to the Dynevor Hospital, and Mr. Agent Latulippe of Selkirk, Man., was telegraphed today in this connection.\n\nI might inform you that a cheque for $160 - the amount of salary due to Mr. Hope - has been directed to the Treasurer of the Methodist Missionary Society in Toronto, and a cheque for $50 for bonus has been made out in favour of Mr. Hope and mailed in care of Mr. Agent Latulippe.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I understand that all the necessary supplies for opening the school are on hand with the exception of any blackboard. They are asking for a teacher for the coming year. There is Miss Moore, daughter of John Moore, a Hudson Bay officer who is available. I believe she has had three years' training in a high school and should be quite competent to take charge.\n\nI would like if this appointment could be sanctioned by the Department at such a salary as is thought right. I would suggest it be at the rate of $600.00 for the year as I believe the girl can live in her father's home. This would amount to $450.00 for the nine months and would give us a chance to try out the school during that time.\n\nMr. Letellier, your agent, was paying treaty during Mr. Biddrie's visit and no doubt will be able to give you a full report on this proposition.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6239, file 523-1, part 1)\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOntario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Mr. Luther Schuetze, Little Grand Rapids.\n\nIn further reply to your letter of February 26th, 1930, - File #125-12-1 - I beg to state that when Mr. Luther Schuetze was appointed as missionary teacher at Little Grand Rapids, he found himself without buildings of any kind on the Reserve. Therefore he had to proceed to erect both school house and residence. Your Department provided material for the school house, and our Board provided material for the mission house, but Mr. Schuetze was entirely responsible for the erection of these buildings. It was impossible for him to accomplish all this work out of school hours without some assistance. Our Board, therefore, provided an Assistant for him in the person of a graduate of the Norway House Residential School. We chose one of the brightest ex-pupils, so that in an emergency he could take charge of the school if there was work which demanded Mr. Schuetze's attention. I know that Mr. Schuetze has given some personal attention to the freighting of the material, but it was not for the Hudson's Bay Company - it was in connection with the school and mission buildings.\n\nI regret that this report, which appears to be of a damaging character, has reached your Department; but I think that if there is a thorough investigation by your Agent, it will show that it is only a half truth and that Mr. Schuetze has had no relationship with the Hudson's Bay Company in the matter of freighting. All the reports we receive in connection with his work are very satisfactory, and I believe that both the Government and the Church are receiving full value for all they are investing in this work.\n\nOur Mr. Barner expects to visit Little Grand Rapids during the coming summer and he will report further to me in connection with the work there.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nAB.MLT\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6239, file 523-1, part 1)\nOttawa, April 1st, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to request that you will report, at your early convenience, regarding the work that is being carried on at the Little Grand Rapids Indian Day School by Luther Schmetz, the teacher. The department understands that he was carrying out the work of erecting both a schoolhouse and teacher's residence at this point and that it was necessary for him to give some attention to the freighting of the material. I shall be pleased if you will state whether he has also been hauling freight for the Hudson's Bay Company. You might state whether he has completed the buildings, and, if so, if he devotes full time to the teaching of the day school. The Department desires as full information as possible regarding the work being performed by Mr. Schmetz in connection with the work at Little Grand Rapids.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. A. Stevenson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nSelkirk, Man. 16th April, 1930\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter, No. 125-12-1 of lst. instant, regarding the work being done by the teacher at Little Grand Rapids, I beg to inform you that the first intimation I had of this man doing any freighting was from the R.C.M.P. Berens River Detachment of 25th January, which stated that this was for the Hudson's Bay Co.\n\nThere were some desks for the school, which were purchased on authority No. 125-12-5, 11th September and shipped to Bloodvein, on the understanding that Mr. Scheutze was to freight these to Little Grand Rapids in the winter free of charge.\n\nI have made further enquiries about this man's work and learn from two men who have been freighting between Bloodvein and Little Grand Rapids, that they met him on the trail several times in the winters of 1928-29 and 1929-30. They did not know whose freight he was hauling.\n\nThe schoolhouse and teacher's residence was built in 1928 but I understand that logs have been taken out this winter for a church.\n\nIn a letter from Mr. Scheutze, dated 28th February, received last mail, he states that he had an Indian, a former pupil of Norway House Indian Residential School teaching at L. Grand Rapids but that he had let him go. The school was kept open all the time, I presume this was while he was away.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Mr. Luther Schuetze, Little Grand Rapids, Manitoba.\n\nIn further reference to your letter of February 25th - File 128-12-1, I may say that I visited the Little Grand Rapids Reserve in the month of July and went thoroughly into the rumour which reached the Department concerning this matter.\n\nI discovered that a request had been made to the Department for 30 school desks. This request was granted on condition that Mr. Schuetze would freight these in without cost to the Department. In addition to this, there was material with which Mr. Schuetze was completing the building operations, and he was made responsible for freighting this material in also. In order to accomplish this with the least expenditure, he had to do the work in the winter, and it was a heavy task. The bulk of the time taken in this freighting operation was the Christmas holidays; but, in addition to this, he lost twelve school days to the work. During these twelve school days he left the school in charge of an assistant who was provided by the Mission Board. This young man is a graduate of the Norway House Boarding School and is thoroughly qualified to take charge of the school for a few days. The report that Mr. Schuetze was freighting for the Hudson Bay Company is entirely without foundation, for he did not handle a pound of their freight during the operation.\n\nIn view of the fact that Mr. Schuetze has had to take charge of the erection of two buildings since he went into Little Grand Rapids, and that he has had to perform most of the mechanical work himself, I think that he has accomplished something very fine. I feel sure that on our part, instead of entering into criticism, we ought to commend him highly for his self-sacrificing labours.\n\nTrusting that this explanation will be quite satisfactory to the Department, I remain\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nA.B.MLT\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department took this matter up with the authorities of the United Church of Canada, under whose auspices this school is conducted. An officer of the Board of Home Missions visited Little Grand Rapids this past summer and I enclose, for your information, a copy of his report to the Department. It would appear that Mr. Schuetze is performing excellent work at Little Grand Rapids and that it was necessary for him to freight supplies used in building operations at this point.

Arthur Barnet,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nTHE NEW OUTLOOK\n\nReport of journey up the Berens River, Manitoba\n\nby ARTHUR BARNER\n\nRev. J. W. Nickle and I left Berens River Mission with two of our Christian Indians, John James and William Everett, at seven o'clock Thursday, July 18th. We took a fifteen-foot canoe with Evinrude engines and a supply of gasoline and oil. We had a good outfit and a good supply of food. As we expected to be away three weeks, it was necessary to take everything needed to the far end of the journey by freight, to be ready for our return.\n\nOur first stop was Little Grand Rapids, about 100 miles inland. This point is 200 feet above the waters of Lake Winnipeg, so we will have to remember that we had to portage canoe and goods thirty-eight times on the journey, each portage covering a range of rapids. The water was high and the rapids turbulent; our expert canoe men took everything in their stride. After three days' steady travel we reached Little Grand Rapids at 6:30 p.m. on Saturday, July 20th.\n\nIt is four years since I visited this place. The following statement will refer to the Indians living at Little Grand Rapids, Pekanepegum and Deer Lake. When I first visited those places in 1923, there was no mission work as far as mission work was concerned. For about fifteen years prior to that time, Rev. Mr. Nickle, of Berens River Mission, had made annual visits in the summer to Little Grand Rapids and Deer Lake. He did all that he could that was possible of the Christian religion in the course of two or three days. This policy was continued under Rev. W. Nickle's care each year after 1920, including Pekanepegum. But it seemed that the Indians were not interested for the people. In July, 1927, a well-educated man named Luther Schwartze, came five days to see us. He was doing with the Indians at Poplar River, felt moved to go and open the work at Little Grand Rapids. He saw much of God in transforming things there. At very small cost the Church and the Government had built a school, house and mission house. He and his family are a great example to the people behind him. The Indians here are 281 souls in the band. He has gathered 150 into the Church of Christ, and his school attendance is very good. He is showing the people by his garden what can be done with vegetables, and by keeping goats to provide milk for his six children and his faithful wife. His children are very good, and he keeps them as good subordinates. These people left an income of $1,000 last year, and they are prospering, and they feel sure they have been led of the Spirit. We spent Sunday with Brother Schwartze at Deer Lake and their store, holding two services in the schoolhouse, which was uncomfortably crowded. We had a very hearty congregation of the birthday of the Church, though we thought that it would show up better going inside.\nSir:\n\nIt was brought to my attention last week that Miss Mary Mozel has been hired by Mr. Luther Scheutze to teach the classroom on the Little Grand Rapids Indian Reserve.\n\nI discussed this matter with Mr. Irwin, the Indian Agent at Selkirk, who stated that he was aware Mr. Scheutze hired Miss Mozel last year to substitute while he was sick, but he did not know she had again returned last September.\n\nI phoned the Rev. Dr. Cormie, of the United Church, who supervises these appointments, and although he was aware of Miss Mozel being at Little Grand Rapids, he understood she was hired by Mr. Scheutze to teach his own children and expected she was paid from a grant allowed for education by the church. He immediately wrote Mr. Scheutze, instructing him to carry on the work himself and dispense with the services of Miss Mozel in connection with the teaching of the Indian children. Dr. Cormie was very emphatic in his instructions and he is positive they will be carried out. At any rate, he intends to make a thorough investigation of the whole matter.\n\nI have always received good reports in connection with the work carried on by Mr. Scheutze and I have every reason to believe that Dr. Cormie's instructions will be followed out. Any further developments regarding this matter will be reported.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, January 22, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your 202-11 of the 18th instant, informing the Department that Mr. Luther Schuetze, teacher of the Little Grand Rapids Indian Day School, had engaged the services of Miss Mary Mozell to carry out teaching duties.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that it is expected Mr. Schuetze, himself, will perform the teaching services for which he is paid, provided he is in good health. I note that you have taken this matter up with Rev. Dr. Cormie, of the United Church, who supervises the school, and that he has written Mr. Schuetze instructing him to carry on the work himself and dispense with the services of Miss Mozell in connection with the teaching of the Indian children. It is expected that, as long as Mr. Schuetze is employed as teacher of this school, he will carry out the teaching duties himself.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nAt this point we have a man acting as missionary-teacher, by the name of Luther Schuetze. Mr. Schuetze has several children, and in order to provide for their education, he has brought in a teacher to understand that one or probably two, of the traders who have skilled in dealing with him the cost of this teacher, who is fully qualified according to the standards of the Province of Manitoba. Her name is Miss Jean McConnell. She is a daughter of Rev. J. A. McConnell of Little Britain.\n\nMr. Schuetze asks if your Department would give permission for Miss McConnell to substitute for him in the Indian Day School during such times as he is engaged in certain services which he renders to the Indians. I presume that there would be no expense involved so far as your Department is concerned. It is simply a question of regularizing Miss McConnell's teaching in the Indian School, under the supervision of Mr. Schuetze.

We do not know anything about Mr. Mutch's taking holidays in April and May. In fact, we have a letter today from the office of our Superintendent in Winnipeg, telling us that Mr. Rushforth will go in in July and that Mr. Mutch is planning to stay until the former arrives.\n\nYou will understand, of course, that both Mr. Street and Mr. Rushforth are to act as missionaries as well as teachers on their respective fields, which will account for them entering upon their duties in July.\n\nThis is all the information I can give you at the present time in answer to your enquiry as to when Mr. Street and Mr. Rushforth expect to take up their new duties.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

That still does not dispose of the difference between Berens River and Little Grand Rapids, and, in view of the cost of living in the two places, it seems to me amazing that the Department should pay $1100.00 at Berens River and $900.00 at Little Grand Rapids. The question that is in my mind is, why Berens River should get $200.00 more than Little Grand Rapids. I suppose it is one of the mysteries that goes back into the dim and distant past. If you will refer to Mr. Street's letter, you will see that the scale of salary at Berens River was originally $900.00 and that it was raised to $1100.00 whilst he was there. However, I do not suppose there is anything that can be done about it, in view of the fact that your estimates are based on that scale.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGD.MIT\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Street also informed me the Dept. was furnishing lumber for a new school this season. No complaints were received but Mr. Street informed me some Indians had been making brew and were drunk around the New Year. Thirty children were present at this school although the register recorded fifty-two at times. Twenty-two or three of the children present are Indians, the balance are whites attending from around the settlement. I was also informed that there is some discussion regarding the location of the new school. The band, chief and Councillors desire the school be built on the reserve at the old location.

Under these circumstances a cheque for that month will be forwarded to him.\n\nI would point out that the appropriation for the fiscal year 1940-41 only provides salary for a period of 9 months for each teacher of an Indian day school. Mr. Street has taught one month in the current fiscal year, namely April. Consequently, salary can only be allowed for 8 additional months between now and the end of March, 1941. Under these circumstances the school should remain closed during May, June and July. If, however, Mr. Street wishes to teach during the month of July, it should be on the distinct understanding that it will not be possible for the Department to allow him any salary for that month. Please inform him accordingly at once.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. E. McPherson,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nSelkirk, Man., July 26, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to refer to your letter of June 13th, File 125-12-1, relative to the school term of the U.C. Indian Day School at Little Grand Rapids.\n\nMr. Street has requested that I write and inform you that during the 1939-40 Season, he taught school the following months: September, October, November, December, January, February, March, April and closed his school during May and June. As this only makes an 8 month term, he reopened his school in July and is teaching this month, but as you stated in your letter that he will not be allowed any salary for July, he wishes to point out that both April and July should apply on the 1939-40 school term.\n\nIn view of Street's information, please advise if your ruling as outlined in your letter, still stands. Street was informed that he would have to go by whatever decision the Department made.\n\nIt is my opinion that Street could be paid for the following months in the 1940-41 school term: July, August, September, October, November, December, January, and February, and close during March, April and May as decided on at every time. This would make an 8 month school term, which would work out right if the Department's ruling is carried out in regard to Street's April, 1940 cheque.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nE.

According to Mr. Street's statement, he has only been paid for eight months. May I ask if it is correct that Little Grand Rapids was an eight months' school when this was put into effect?\n\nThe second point concerns the present year.

It is the opinion both of Mr. Street and those who know the situation, that this should be a nine month school.

He took his annual summer holidays in May and June and has been paid for July and August.\n\nThe academic year and the fiscal year overlap but we must be guided by the amount of money provided for Mr. Street's salary for the fiscal year which started April 1, 1940, and ends on March 31, 1941; namely, $990.00. He has already been paid from the current year's appropriation for the months of April, July and August. Consequently only six months' more salary can be paid him from September 1, 1940, to March 31, 1941.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. R.E. Cochrane, D.D.,\nSecretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 17, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nUnder separate cover I am writing to you with reference to the Little Grand Rapids R.C. School and in reviewing your letter of July 26 and official reply of July 31 regarding the Little Grand Rapids U.C. Indian Day School it is noted that it has been decided to operate this school to the end of February, 1941, and that the holidays will be taken during the months of March, April and May, 1941. The December quarter ended June 30, 1940, at the Little Grand Rapids R.C. School. It is found that only 41 children attended that school although the names of 41 children were shown on the return. Apparently the children who should attend this school are not on the reserve during the June quarter.\n\nYou can understand that the whole situation on the Little Grand Rapids Reserve is rather perplexing to the officials of the Board and consequently it would be appreciated if you would let us have a complete report with a recommendation regarding the dates which you consider these two schools should be in operation in order to obtain the best attendance.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. E. McPherson,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nSelkirk, Man. February 24, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letters of February 17th, Files 125-30-1 and 125-12-1, relative to school terms and attendance at the U.C. and R.C. Schools at Little Grand Rapids.\n\nIn the case of the U.C. school, the attendance during the December, 1940 Quarter was very good, considering that I have given instructions that all able-bodied Indians were to leave the Reserve for their trap lines.\n\nI believe the poor attendance at the R.C. School was due largely to the fact that the Missionary reported a little trouble between the parents and himself. This was purely a personal quarrel and the parents refused to allow their children to attend school. I wrote the R.G.M.P. at Berens River and instructed him to talk to these Indians when he made his patrol to the Reserve; this patrol has been made and I understand that trouble is now under control. I also wrote Mr. Street, Teacher of the U.C. School and requested that he not accept Mr. Bellavance's pupils in his school. Street replied that he would do as I requested.\n\nIn regard to the matter of school terms, both teachers agreed at Treaty time that the months of March, April and May would be the best to have the schools closed. I cannot understand why the U.C. School had such poor attendance last June as most of the Indians are on the Reserve at this time of year. The matter of arranging a satisfactory school term at Little Grand Rapids is indeed a difficult one. The question is, briefly, that there is bound to be poorer attendance during the Winter and Spring if the Indians take their families to the trap lines. It is necessary that the men at least, go to trap lines as this is practically the only means they have of making a livelihood. On the other hand if the women and children stay on the Reserves while their husbands are trapping we would have to issue rations to them. This is a matter where either the school attendance suffers during the Winter months or we keep the Indians on the Reserve and issue rations to them. I have always instructed the Indians to leave their Reserves in the Summer and go to their trap lines. The matter, therefore, of arranging a suitable school term under the circumstances is very difficult. The present school term has been arranged as suggested by the Teachers of both Schools.\n\nPlease advise if you wish me to again take this matter up with the teachers.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nR.A.

This is due to local conditions and it has been found that the school is not working in having the school in operation during the months of March, April and May.\n\nI find that Mr. Clarke did not open this school until July 15, 1942, due to the fact that he was teaching at Oshawa, Ont., in provincial school from June 20.

For some years, except last year when I came here, I attended summer school regularly every summer. In this manner I have worked toward obtaining my B.A. degree and should have my degree within a short time.\n\nI quite realize that July and August are teaching months here but I feel certain that I could slack two weeks in March and possibly most of May without doing any harm so far as the red season is concerned. I doubt if the Indians will be away from here before March 15' due to the unseasonable lateness of the season. Also most of them will likely be back in early May.\n\nI would greatly appreciate your careful consideration of my request and if you consider it necessary, this letter could be forwarded to Ottawa. You will realize that it means a lot to me to be able to attend summer school especially since the University of Manitoba does not grant home course in the 3rd and 4th years.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn R.

I would rather suggest that the school be closed altogether for the time Mr. Clark is away. I know the Indians will be leaving for their trap lines a few weeks before the rat season is due. They always do this and, owing to the cold winter I do not think they will be back as soon as usual.\n\nI do not think that it would be possible to have another teacher go in there to relieve Mr. Clark for the summer season as at present it is very hard to get teachers but as you can see by Mr. Clark's letter, it means quite a lot to him to be able to take up his course in Winnipeg.\n\nI wish you would please inform me what the Department considers should be done.\n\nE.

He is not an experienced teacher, but has completed two First Aid and one Home Nursing course under the Red Cross Society; has had machine shop practice in the Manual Training School; and has attended a Bible School under the Mennonite Church.\n\nWould you kindly let me know the date at which teaching commences and the rate of remuneration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGD.MLT\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Clark will not be in charge of this school during the coming academic year. To succeed him the Department has approved the appointment of Mr. N.A. Dusek at a salary of $100.00 a teaching month, plus bonus. He will re-open the school on June 1, 1943, and it will continue in operation to February 28, 1944. I enclose copy of letter of appointment and other documents will be forwarded to you when received.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nMay 24, 1943.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 16th instant, the Department approves the appointment of Mr. H.A. Dusek as teacher of the Little Grand Rapids I.O.C. Indian Day School for the coming academic year. This school should be operated from June 1, 1943, to February 28, 1944. As you realize, this is only a nine-month term, but a letter from Indian Agent McPherson stated that there would be no advantage in operating the school after the end of February, due to the fact that the Indians leave the reserve for rat hunting. Salary will be allowed Mr. Dusek at the rate of $100.00 a teaching month, plus bonus. The necessary forms for cost-of-living bonus and income tax will be forwarded to Indian Agent McPherson. When Mr. Dusek begins duties he should complete these forms and forward them to this office.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. Geo. Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n209 Queen St. West,\nToronto 5, Ont.\nOttawa,\nMay 24, 1943.\n\nMr. E. McPherson, Indian Agent, Selkirk, Man.\n\nWith reference to the Little Grand Rapids U.C. Indian Day School, the Department has approved the appointment of Mr. H.A. Dueck as teacher. I am advising the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada to have him begin duties on June 1 and continue the school in operation to February 29, 1944. While the majority of our Indian day schools will be in operation for ten months during the coming academic year, I understand from previous correspondence from your office that you do not think it is advisable to operate the day schools after the end of February and consequently the Little Grand Rapids U.C. Indian Day School will only be operated for a nine-month period. I enclose the necessary forms which you should have Mr. Dueck complete and return as soon as he begins duties.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nReference to your letter 125-43-1 of May 24-43, I have to advise that the Little Grand Rapids U.G. School did not open June 1st. I will advise you as soon as Mr. Dueck reports for duty.\n\nE. McPherson,\nIndian Agent\nOttawa,\nJune 24, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Little Grand Rapids U.C.,\nIndian Day School, No. 385.\n\nIn memorandum of May 24 you were advised that Mr. H.A. Bueck would begin duties at the above-mentioned school on June 1 at a salary of $100.00 a teaching month, plus bonus. Mr. Bueck did not open the school on June 1 and no payment of salary should be made to him until you hear further from this office.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, July 2, 1943.\n\nEX'D A\n\nThe Deputy Minister,\nDepartment of Finance,\nOttawa.\n\nThis is to advise you that the services of Mr. J.M. Clark, teacher, Little Grand Rapids United Church Indian Day School, ceased effective March 1, 1943. Would you kindly let me know in his favour for the amount at his credit in the Retirement Fund? No overpayment of any kind to this employee is outstanding.\n\nDeputy Minister.\n\nJuly 5/43\nOttawa, July 2, 1943.\n\nThe Deputy Minister,\nDepartment of Finance,\nOttawa.\n\nThis is to advise you that the services of Mr. J.M. Clark, teacher, Little Grand Rapids United Church Indian Day School, ceased effective March 1, 1943. Would you kindly let me have a cheque in his favour for the amount at his credit in the Retirement Fund? No overpayment of any kind to this employee is outstanding.\n\nC. W. JACKSON\n\nfor Deputy Minister.\nOttawa,\nJuly 28, 1943.\n\nMr. E. McPherson, Indian Agent, Selkirk, Man.\n\nWith reference to official letter of May 24, advising you of the appointment of Mr. N.A. Dusek as teacher of the Little Grand Rapids U.C. Indian Day School, we have today received the attached forms. These forms are very incompletely filled out; for instance, the Declaration of Head of Household for Purposes of Cost of Living Bonus only contains Dusek's name. It should also be signed by you in the manner practised elsewhere. Present regulations permit the Indian Agent to sign this form in the case of teachers in remote sections of the country.\n\nOn the staff questionnaire you will note the answer to \"Racial Origin\" is \"Dutch\". Does this mean Dutch?\n\nThe word \"Naturalized\" in answer to the question \"British Subject\" is wrongly spelled. It would be advisable to have the date of his naturalization stated on this line. I presume from the information given on the staff questionnaire form that he began duties on July 21, but I have not received any word from you to that effect. You should have the forms properly completed and returned as soon as possible.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMr. R. A. Hosey,\nSuperintendent Welfare and Training.\n\nI wish to inform you that Mr. N. A. Dusek, reported on July 21, at Little Grand Rapids. He had been delayed considerably by the Selective Service. I do not know what the trouble was, but that was the information he gave me.\n\nI would suggest that he be put on the payroll of Aug. 1, as I do not think he would be able to do much in a week's time. He informed me that he forwarded the papers to the department which I had sent to him some time ago which were to be returned to the department and I explained that he put in his time as stated on July 21st or July, but he was still not started on the 22nd because the school had to be cleaned up before he could start teaching.\n\nI am quite well aware that it is quite hard to get men for this place but personally I do not think that him nor the man sent to Poplar River, would be suitable for the position, as neither one of them understand anything about pulling teeth and handling children.\n\nThe man, Mr. Shanks who was at Poplar River was a failure as far as being of any value to the department. In my opinion any missionary going out to this reserve should be given a course for six months regarding medicine and work that would be taken up by an Indian teacher and that is why the Roman Catholics make such a success of their missions here when they send them north into Indian country. They have to learn the Indian language and how to handle the Indians in the outlaying districts. I trust that you will accept this only as a suggestion.\n\nE. McPherson\nIndian Agent.\nSelkirk, Man., August 7, 1943.\n\nMr. T. R. L. MacInnes,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nI am enclosing forms which were sent to Mr. Nick Allen Dueck, Little Grand Rapids. In a letter which I received from him, he states that he cannot fill in the total amount of salary, as he has not been informed what he is being paid.\n\nPersonally, I do not think this man or the man who has been sent to Poplar River, will be a success.\n\nE.

He also states that he would like his cheques forwarded to Little Grand Rapids via Winnipeg. Will you please look into this matter at once?\n\nE. McPherson,\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, January 18, 1944.\n\nMr. E. McPherson, Indian Agent, Selkirk, Man.\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to the salary of Mr. N. A. Dueck, teacher of the Little Grand Rapids United Church Day School.\n\nOur records indicate that Mr. Dueck's cheque has been sent regularly at the end of every month, addressed to him at Berens River, Manitoba. The last cheque, for the month of December, was mailed from here on December 24th. I suggest, therefore, that you get in touch with the post master at that point, and if the cheques addressed to Mr. Dueck are not being held, you should advise me.\n\nA review of the latest postal guide does not show \"Little Grand Rapids\" as a post office. Berens River is the address to which we have always sent communications for this school.\n\nR. A.

I trust that you will inform the post office authorities in Winnipeg accordingly, as there is no post office officially recorded at Little Grand Rapids.\n\nI also desire to refer you to official letter of May 24, 1943, in which we directed your attention to the fact that from previous correspondence from your office you do not think it advisable to operate day schools after the end of February. Please let me know if your opinion in this regard still stands, as, in that event, we will take Mr. Dueck's name off the pay-list on February 29, 1944.

McPherson,\nIndian Agent\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nI have your letter 125-12-1 of Jan 26/44 re the day schools at Little Grand Rapids.\n\nAs previously suggested I would recommend that the R.C. and U.C. Day Schools be closed for the months of March, April, May 1944. As the Indian families leave the reserve during the rat trapping season the school attendance would be better if school was held during the summer months commencing June 1/44.\n\nE. McPherson,\nIndian Agent\nOttawa,\nFebruary 5, 1944.\n\nEXD.\n\nMr. E. McPherson, Indian Agent, Selkirk, Man.\n\nI have your letter of the 1st instant, in which you suggest that the Little Grand Rapids R.C. and Little Grand Rapids U.C. Schools be closed for the months of March, April and May. This will result in the teachers of these schools only being paid for a period of nine months. You realize the difficulties of obtaining teachers and, if we keep the term to nine months, I am inclined to feel that both teachers will consider that we are not dealing fairly with them.\n\nIn your letter of June 18, 1943, you suggested that the Little Grand Rapids R.C. School be kept open until the end of March. It opened on June 1, 1943, and, if it remains in operation until the end of March, the teacher of this school at least will feel assured that he has received ten months' salary.\n\nUnder the circumstances I would appreciate your giving the matter further consideration and writing again.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nI have your letter 125-12-1 of Feb 5 and would state that I received a letter from Mr. Hoey dated Jan 26/44 re closing the U.C. Day School at Little Grand Rapids at the end of Feb. I wrote Mr Hoey on Feb 1st stating that as I had previously suggested, I recommended that the U.C. and R.C. Day Schools at Little Grand Rapids be closed for months of March, April and May.\n\nOn receiving your letter I note that you do not think we are dealing fairly with the teachers by only having a nine months term. I know that teachers are hard to get at the present time so if the Dept thinks we should operate these schools another month I will notify the teachers to have the schools remain open during month of March. I think that it was on account of the closing of the school last season that Mr. Clarke left and possibly it would be easier to get teachers to remain there if the schools were open the full term. Please advise by return mail what the Dept wishes are in this matter.\n\nE.

Indian Day School. It appears that the majority of the Indians live on the side of the river on which the church is located and that the present school is located on the opposite side of the river. This necessitates all the children crossing the river each day. Our informant states that it would appear desirable to use the church instead of the present school building and I understand that the United Church authorities would be willing to allow us to do so. Please let me have your recommendation in the matter at the earliest possible date.\n\nR.A.

In any case, we are happy to nominate as his successor Mr. Abram Neufeld, who is twenty-four years of age; has Grade XI; but is without professional standing as a teacher, although he has had some experience. He is a married man, and I think would do good work.\n\nWe should be glad to know that this nomination meets with your approval; also, when the school year closes and the rate of pay.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6239, file 523-1, part 1)\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nI have just been advised by Mr Dueck of the Little Grand Rapids U.C.Day School that the R.C.School was open during April and May and Mr. Dueck has kept his school open also. Mr. Dueck states that this does not interfere with the trapping and that it is almost impossible to get the children to attend during the hot days of July & August. Mr. Dueck further states that the Teacher of the R.C.School has received his cheque for April but Mr. Dueck has received no cheque himself.\n\nE. McPherson,\nIndian Agent\n\nP.S. Will the above interfere with the appointment of Mr. Neufeld. May I suggest the the school continue to June 30th and reopen Aug 1/45 and Mr Neufeld take over on that date.\nOttawa, May 26, 1945.\n\nDear Doctor Dorsey:\n\nI desire to refer to Mr. Hoey's letter of May 15, with reference to the Little Grand Rapids Indian Day School. When that letter was written, we were under the impression that the United Church and the Roman Catholic Church Schools on the Little Grand Rapids Reserve would close on March 31. However, it now appears that although Mr. Dueck opened the U.C. school on June 1, 1944, the R.C. school was not opened until September 1, 1944. The latter school continued in operation during April and May, and when Mr. Dueck realized this, he also kept the school open during those months.\n\nThe Agent now intimates that these two schools should remain in operation until June 30.\n\nWe have no particular objection to this arrangement, but I am writing the agent, stating that in order to avoid such difficulties in the future we should revert to the regular academic year, namely, September 1 to the following June 30.\n\nAs Mr. Dueck has remained at Little Grand Rapids, we will be prepared to continue salary to him to June 30, but owing to the circumstances about which we have just learned, I think that Mr. Neufeld should not report to the school until September 1, 1946, with the definite understanding that he will continue it in operation until June 30, 1946.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. Geo. Dorsey, D.D.,\nAssoc. Sec. Bd. of Home Miss.\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2B, Ont.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, May 26, 1945.\n\nMr. E. McPherson, Indian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, with reference to Mr. Dueck, teacher of the Little Grand Rapids Indian Day School.\n\nIn view of the contents of your letter it is necessary to review the situation at both the United Church and the Roman Catholic Schools at Little Grand Rapids.\n\nFor some time past it has been understood that these two schools would close at the end of March and re-open at the beginning of June. Mr. Dueck re-opened the Little Grand Rapids School on June 1, 1944, and consequently, at the end of March, 1945, he had been paid 10 months' salary. In view of the previous arrangement his name was then removed from the paylist.\n\nA teacher for the R.C. school was not secured until late in August - see our letter of August 28, 1944. He was placed on the paylist from September 1, 1944, and consequently would not teach the 10 months until the end of June, 1945. In view of the above, no injustice has been done to Mr. Dueck.\n\nI note from your letter that Mr. Dueck has kept the school open during April and May, without any authority, and in the meantime we have received a recommendation from the United Church of Canada to appoint Mr. Abram Neufeld as teacher of this school. As we thought that Mr. Dueck had given up duties at the\nend of March and that the two months' annual holidays would be taken during April and May, we advised the United Church authorities to have the new teacher report for duty on June 1.\n\nIt is perplexing for the officials of this Branch to be informed at the end of May that the preceding arrangement in effect at this school had not been carried out. It is difficult to understand why we were not previously informed of Mr. Dueck's action.\n\nIt is possible that both schools on this reserve should be taught during the same months, but I think the time has come for us to make a definite decision regarding the months during which the schools should be in operation and inform all persons accordingly, and thus avoid the difficulty that has occurred this year.\n\nTo carry out the suggestion contained in your postscript would mean that the children would obtain only one month's holidays. I doubt very much if that would be very satisfactory.\n\nIf you agree with the statement made by you by Mr. Dueck, to the effect that the children do not attend the school during the months of July and August, I think the best solution of the whole matter is to revert to the regular academic year, namely, September 1 to the following June 30, and this should apply to both schools. Please let me hear from you immediately.\n\nWe are again placing Mr. Dueck's name on the pay-list, so that he will receive salary for the months of April and May and June. This is being done with the understanding that the attendance that he will have during those months justifies the payments being made to him.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, May 28, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Little Grand Rapids U.C. Indian Day School, No. 522.\n\nIn my memorandum of May 15 I advised you that Mr. N. A. Dueck had given up duties at this school, effective April 1, 1945.\n\nI am now informed by the Indian Agent that owing to special circumstances it was considered advisable to continue this school in operation to June 30, 1945. Consequently, Mr. Dueck should be paid salary for the months of April, May and June. His resignation will therefore be effective from July 1, 1945, and the school will not re-open until September 1, 1945, on which date the appointment of Mr. Abram Neufeld will be effective. As stated in my memorandum of May 15, Mr. Neufeld should be paid salary at the rate of $100.00 a teaching month.\n\nFor Deputy Minister.\nBoard of Home Missions\nThe United Church of Canada\n290 Queen St. West\nToronto 2 B, Ontario\n\nAttention of Mr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMay 28th,\n1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan: Re: Little Grand Rapids\n(Your File 125-12-1)\n\nI have your letter and have noted the contents,\nwhich I am communicating to Dr. Cormie.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr Duseck stated in his letter that the R.C.School had remained open and that he did not want to close unless both schools were closed.\n\nAt the time I suggested that these school close during April and May I had hoped that it would benefit the trappers but we have found since that it was not as much benefit as we expected. It was found difficult to have the children attend school during the warm weather. Under the circumstances I would recommend that we no return to the regular season of Sept 1st to June 30th. I have now written both teachers to remain open until end of June as they did not close during April and May.\n\nI would suggest the Mr Duseck's cheque for June is not forwarded until we know whether or not Mr. Mufeld has reported for duty.\n\nE.
