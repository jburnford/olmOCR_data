There are a large number of Indians in the northern part of this district who have other interests than those connected with the lands which they occupy. They have been treated with kindness and consideration by the Government, but they have not been able to secure the benefits promised them under the treaty. They should be treated with kindness and consideration, and their claims should be settled promptly. We urge upon the Government the claims of these Indians, and we hope that they will be treated with kindness and consideration.\n\nNORTH WEST SENATORS.\n\nThe appointment of Mr. R. Hardisty of Edmonton to the Senate is a good one, and there has been considerable discussion as to whether he will be able to represent the interests of the Indians in the Senate. We believe that he will be able to do so, and we urge upon the Government to give him every possible assistance in carrying out his duties.\n\nTHE VAGRANCY CASE.\n\nSir, Please allow me to say that I have been informed that a case of vagrancy has been brought before the Court of Queen's Bench. The defendant is charged with being a vagrant, and the charge is supported by evidence. We urge upon the Government to take steps to prevent such cases from occurring in the future.\n\nClearing Parlor Stoves\n\nBox Stoves\n\nFancy Goods\n\nThese Goods are now on Sale\n\nCall early and see our new display\n\nTHE TIMES\n\nSASKATCHEWAN REVIEW\n\n$2.50 PER YEAR\n\nTHE TIMES\n\nDAILY NEWS\n\nTHE GLASS COMPANY\n\nAND THE LEADING NEWSPAPER\n\nFRIDAY, JANUARY 13, 1888.\nJ.

It is essential that the Government should approve of the scheme to secure a new line between Winnipeg and the United States, because it holds that the con-\nstruction of such a line would be a great\nplighted faith, would divert trade to the\nUnited States, which would be kept in\nCanada, and injure the trade of Manitoba\nand the Territories for the benefit of\nWinnipeg, and would work injustice to\nwestern Canada. The country needs new railways in unprovided dis-\ntricts more urgently than it can com-\npensate for the loss of western Manitoba.\n\nThe Saskatchewan, especially its north branch, runs through the richest part of the Northwest. The soil for a thousand miles along its banks is as favorable as those of Manitoba, and the conditions are much more favorable to pioneer settlement. The Government has nothing to say in condemnation of the Canadian pioneers. They are as\neasy as any in existence, and will in a few\nyears have made progress in their com-\nmunities. But the pioneer\u2014especially the pioneer with limited means\u2014finds\nnear the mouth of the river a better field\non the open prairie. On the latter he\nhas no lumber for his house, no water\ntill he digs a well far from the river's\nsource. Along the river he finds good\nwater in abundance, logs for the walls of\nhis house, and so soon as a decent house\nis built, lumber is easily floated down\nthe river in snow.\n\nThe presence of timber does not diminish\nthe labor of clearing the land, for while\nthe soil of the river bank is fertile, the\nother is arid. It is a singular fact\nthat that bank of the river which faces\nthe sun is always more productive than\nthe northern exposure is wooded. The the-\nory is that on the bank having a river\nside exposure soil repetition occurs,\nand there is a greater rate of expansion and contraction, which tear\nthe roots from the trees and destroy them.\nOn the bank facing south, or another\nexposure the snow lies longer, protecting\nthe young trees and summer fairly sets\nin on that side, thus promoting vegeta-\ntion. At all events, whatever the theory\nmay be, the facts for the settler near a river\nhave been proven by experience. While\nthe prairie settler must spend considerable money for material with\nwhich to build his house, he is doing\nwell. The settlers in Manitoba have\nsettled along the banks of rivers, and\nthose who emigrated to the prairies across\nthe river, and never regretted till they reached the Saskatchewan.\n\nThe importance of opening easy and\ncheap communication with the West\nof the Saskatchewan is manifest, and it is\ncertain that this communication should\nbe by rail. The Saskatchewan is naviga-\nble, and will be found to be extremely\nuseful to the settlers. Lake Winnipeg\nis also navigable; but the route between\nWinnipeg and Prince Albert is very\ndifficult and so difficult that a railway is an\nabsolute necessity. At the mouth of\nthe lake there is a river so wide that\nthere are six feet of water at low tide,\nand above the mouth of the Saskatchewan\nis a rapid wholly impassable by steam\nboats, so that the steamer would have to\nunload and send their passengers and\nfreight over a distance three or four\nmiles to the nearest point where river\nboats. Even if a canal was built around this rapid, little benefit would\nbe derived from it because the light-\ndraught boats which navigate the\nlow river dare not venture out upon the\nlake. Further, boats leaving Winnipeg\nserve as habitations for the Indians, they\nreach the neighborhood of Prince Albert,\nwhile a railway will pass through a rich\ncountry, and will be able to be com-\npleted and will then supply traffic to\nthe road. The Marquis and Northwestern\nrailways are now building a line westward\nin the direction of Prince Albert, but\napparently the company finds it difficult\nto raise funds to prosecute the work.\nThis scheme will probably be completed\nby Federal aid might properly and benefi-\ncially be extended, so that the line might\nbe extended to Prince Albert at the\nearliest possible date.\n\nPrince Albert is the natural gateway\nto the rich lands further west of the\nNorth Saskatchewan. But little habi-\ntated country lies between it and Lake\nWinnipeg; but west of it the land is\ngood, in the very base of the Rocky\nMountains. Routes ascend the river to\nEdmonton, a distance of 600 miles above\nPrince Albert, and these can supply set-\ntlements at such times as the popula-\ntion shall be strong enough to construct\na railway.\n\nIn course of time a railway must\nbe constructed from Prince Albert will become\nnecessary. Such a line will pass near\nthe mouth of Lake Winnipeg, touch the\nMarquis line, and continue thence in a straight line to Quebec.\nBut this project must wait until\nthe Marquis line is completed. The\nSaskatchewan valley at Prince Albert are ur-\ngently needed, and to the solution of\nthis problem the people of only the\nwest of the old Canadian provinces\nwould give their best thought.\u2014Hamilton\nSpectator.\n\nLOCAL NEWS.\n\nT.
