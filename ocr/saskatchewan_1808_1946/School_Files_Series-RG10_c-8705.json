BUSHARD,\n\nPursuant to telephone conversation this afternoon, I have to inform you that horses, cattle and agricultural machinery will be purchased for the Blue Quills Indian Residential School, in the electoral district of Athabasca, from time to time, during the next few months, as required. The original requisition from the Reverend Principal indicated that six horses, ten cows and the following agricultural machinery would be required:\n\n- Breaking plough,\n- Mower,\n- Gang plough,\n- Rake,\n- Disc,\n- Wagon,\n- Harrow,\n- Bob sleigh.\n- Drill.\n\nI may say it is not the intention to purchase any of this equipment until the Reverend Principal writes that particular stock or machinery is then required. The current prices for the locality of St. Paul, Alberta, will be paid when purchase is made. It is possible that a team or two of horses, the ten cows, a harrow, wagon and bob sleigh will be required during the next few months and that the rest of the equipment and stock will be needed in the spring.\n\nA.

Buckley found death, is now unable to work, and then there is still now no other veterinary surgeon at St-Paul.\n\nTruly yours,\n\nRev. Jos. Angin,\nPrincipal.\nMarch 23rd 1932.\n\nTo the Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference with your letter No 118-1-14, of Feb. 4th, relative to the machines to be supplied to the Blue Quills School, I may say that, according to your letter, I have asked, 5 weeks ago, for the prices of these, to Mr Charles Gauvreau of St-Paul, but have not got any reply. It is possible that Mr Gauvreau have written to the Department directly.\n\nConsidering however that the spring is coming soon and that the agricultural implements will be needed within one month, I have taken the liberty to ask for prices to the principal firms of machinery in St-Paul that have always repairs in hand in stock and I submit below their prices for your information:\n\n| Massey-Harris | Mc Cormick-Deering |\n|---------------|-------------------|\n| 16\" Breaking plow | $92.00 | $93.00 |\n| 16\" Disc | $92.00 | $88.75 |\n| Spring tooth harrow | $90.00 | $90.25 |\n| 20 R Drill | $299.00 | $222.50 |\n| Bob-sleigh with double-box | $113.50 | $105.00 |\n\nFor freight from Edmonton to St-Paul | $27.44 |\n\nThe Massey-Harris firm gives a 7% discount on Machinery, and 5% on sleigh, so that the amount totals to $575.65.\n\nThe Mc Cormick-Deering firm gives a 10% discount on all, so that the amount totals to $566.99.\n\nI know that Mr Gauvreau has yet some machines from Lacrosse Flow Works, of Racine, Wisc. I would be very obliged to the Department not to furnish these same machines to the school, as it takes 3 weeks before getting repairs from Racine, Wisc.\n\nTruly yours,\n\nRev. Jos. Angin,\nPrincipal.\nTo the Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter No 118-1-14, of Feb. 4th, concerning the livestock to be supplied to the Blue Quills School, I must say that Mr Charles Gauvreau of St-Paul, has submitted no price till now.\n\nThen I can state for your information that the farmers here around the school could supply 10 good cows, fresh, young, healthy for the price of $50.00 per head, and below. Those cows are not Shorthorn, but Ayrshires mixed up with Pure Shorthorn.\n\nAs to one bull, I have no reference to submit now.\n\nTruly yours,\n\nRev. Jos. Angin,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, July 5, 1932.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI wish to refer to your letters of March 23rd, last, requesting the Department to supply milk cows and agricultural implements.

I thank you for your kindness and must say that 10 cows and one bull, all dairy Shorthorn, would be very necessary at the present. We have only 7 cows now and this number is very insufficient.\n\nAs to the agricultural implements, I can say that these asked for last spring are yet wanted, viz:\n\n- 1 16\" brush breaker/which is breaking-plow $92.00\n- 1 16-run disk $9.00\n- 1 spring tooth harrow with truck $9.00\n- \u221a 1 20-run drill $24.99\n- 1 bob-sleigh with double-box $11.14\n\nAs the funds are limited, you will grant according to your funds, but I would be pleased to get all these supplies, if possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

The playgrounds should be fenced the soonest possible, chiefly when it is time yet to make fence; pretty soon, it will be too cold to have the playgrounds fenced.\n\nThe pump is working very badly and I fear it breaks sometime. Mr. Indian Agent Gullion has been advised two months ago and I asked at this time that the pump be taken off and fixed up again. Would it be possible that the man who has settled down this pump come again to see about it?\n\nOur wheat is already cut and pretty soon it will be the turn of the oats to be cut, and afterwards the thrashing will take place. I get you remember that we have no granary and no other place to put our crop. Therefore a granary should be built very soon. I hope you will take steps in this connection.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. Jos. Angin,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, September 1st, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Principal of the Blue Quills Indian Residential School St. Paul, Alta., has requested that the following agricultural implements, fencing and cattle be supplied:\n\nAgricultural Implements:\n1 - 16\" Breaking Plough\n1 - 16\" Disc\n1 - Spring tooth harrow\n1 - 20 R Drill\n1 - Bob sleigh with double box\n\nFencing:\n340 - Cedar fence posts, 7 ft. high\n190 - Rods woven fencing, 48 in. high\n50 - lbs.

With regard to the cows, the Principal states that they have 7 cows at the school at present. Would it be necessary to supply 10 more at this time? You may ascertain what arrangements could be made with Charles Gauvreau, of St. Paul, for supplying the cows and farm implements and the cost. Please state, also, whether you could arrange for the purchase of any equipment authorized, including the milch cows and bull, or whether you would recommend that this be placed in the hands of Mr. Agent Gillion. I should be pleased if you would give an approximate estimate of the cost of supplying the equipment, live stock, etc., which you recommend at the present time.\n\nThe Principal is anxious to obtain the fencing material as early as possible and, in order to prevent delay, you may arrange for the purchase from indicated sources of supply of the quantity of fencing material, as mentioned above. Please obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost and attach same to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward to the Department for payment.\n\nI shall be pleased to have your recommendation regarding the agricultural implements and milch cows.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 1st instant in connection with the agricultural implements, fencing, and cattle asked for by the Blue Quills Indian Residential School at St. Paul. You have my report on this school dated the 24th ultimo, and you will note that I have stated that the following agricultural implements will be required:\n\n- 1 - 16\" Breaking Plow (Not required until Spring)\n- 1 - 16\" Disk\n- 1 - 20-run Drill\n- 1 - set spring toothed Harrows\n- 1 - Bob sleight with box - Required this fall.\n\nThe fencing is for the playgrounds, and when I was there the Principal estimated the cost at $250. These grounds should, of course, be fenced, but there is no reason why this cannot be held over until spring, if necessary. In any event, I am not very much in favour of fencing playgrounds with woven wire as it soon gets out of shape from the boys standing on it, &c. I think plain wire with a rail on top of the fence would be more suitable.\n\nWith reference to the milch cows and bull: No doubt this school requires additional cows as they only have seven at the present time, but if say five additional cows were supplied this fall, I think that would be sufficient to meet the requirements of the school at least until spring. The bull of course is not required until spring, and can be purchased at the Edmonton bull sale which is held about the 1st of April. The approximate cost of good milch cows would be between $50 and $60.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nTherefore.......\nTherefore, all that would be absolutely necessary to supply at the present time would be the Bob-sleigh and box at a cost of about $90 and five cows at an approximate cost of $300. I note that the Department state arrangements could be made with Chas. Gauvreau for supplying cows and farm implements, and they desire to know the cost of same; I am of the opinion that this man is not a dealer in any of the lines mentioned. The Bob-sleigh and box could be bought in the usual manner and delivered through an implement dealer at St. Paul, and Mr. Gullion, the Agent, is quite capable of purchasing the cows, from the farmers in that district. Of course if the Department wish to place the purchasing of these implements, &c., in the hands of Mr. Gauvreau, I will see that this is done.\n\nI might also refer to the granary which was mentioned in my recent report on this school; This is something that is required by the school this fall, if there is any means whatever of financing it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christiansen,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nSeptember 17, 1932.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR.

I shall be pleased to have your instructions regarding the above purchases.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, September 22, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, in connection with the agricultural implements, fencing and cattle for the Blue Quills Indian Residential School at St. Paul, Alta. It is noted that the only farm equipment required at the present time is one bob sleigh, with box, and I would request that you arrange for the purchase from firms on the list handling these supplies, and have same delivered at the school when considered timely. Please obtain an account, in triplicate, covering the cost, which you should certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nRegarding the fencing of the playgrounds, as our funds this year are limited, this work can be held over until next Spring. This matter may be brought to the attention of the Department at that time and full details should be given regarding materials and cost.\n\nWith reference to the purchase of milch cows, I have to say that the Department is prepared at the present time to supply the school with five grade milch cows. It is considered that a good type of grade cow would be satisfactory. They should be young and giving milk, or to freshen early in the new year.\n\nYou may arrange with Mr. Agent Gullion, if you are assured he is a good judge of cattle, to make the purchase. He should give Mr. Charles Sauvreau, St. Paul, an opportunity to supply the cows, but if Mr. Sauvreau is unable to do so, the Agent may make the purchase locally. It would be advisable that he secure the aid of a Government Livestock Man, if one is in the district, in selecting the cows. All cows should be free from tuberculosis and should be of good milking strain. It is noted you are of opinion that the cost of good milch cows would be between $50 and $75 each. It is hoped that they can be obtained at prices not exceeding this figure. After the Agent has completed the purchase, he should forward for payment accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, in favour of the parties from whom the cows are purchased.\n\nThe question of supplying a further number of cows, additional agricultural implements and fencing material will receive consideration this coming Spring.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nE. Christianson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alta.\nOttawa, September 23rd, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Principal of the Blue Quills Indian Residential School has forwarded to the Department the enclosed list of equipment which he desires supplied.\n\nOwing to lack of funds, it will not be possible to authorize any further expenditure this year than was mentioned in official letter of the 22nd instant. You will note from the last paragraph of that letter that the question of supplying a further number of cows, additional agricultural implements and fencing material will receive consideration next spring although, at the present time, the Department is unable to state what funds, if any, will be available for this purpose.\n\nYou might, however, give careful consideration to the list enclosed with this letter and, at your convenience, you should report to the Department what articles on the list you consider are absolutely necessary. When replying, the list should be returned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nM.

Spence, of St. Paul.\n\nWill you please furnish the Minister with a report in this matter.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nJanuary 10th, 1933.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Buskard -\n\nI have to refer to your memorandum of the 9th January regarding the purchase of five cows for the Blue Quills Residential School at St. Paul, Alberta. In our memorandum of September 17th, referred to by you, direction was requested regarding the purchase of the cows by Mr. Gullion, the Indian agent, from farmers in the district, as Inspector Christianson had stated that Mr. Gauvreau was not a dealer in any of the lines mentioned. This action was approved by the Minister provided Mr. Gullion was considered to be a good judge of cattle and the suggestion was made that he secure the aid of a Government line stockman if one were in the district. It was further stated that Mr. Gauvreau should be given an opportunity to supply the cattle required.\n\nOn this ruling, Inspector Christianson was informed that if he considered agent Gullion a good judge of cattle, the agent might be authorized to make the purchase. He was to be instructed that Mr. Gauvreau should be given an opportunity to supply the cows but if he was unable to do so the agent might make the purchase locally. He was to be further instructed in regard to securing the services of a Government stockman in selecting the cows.\n\nAlthough no further correspondence took place, it is assumed that the agent acted on these instructions and being unable to secure the cattle from Mr. Gauvreau he made purchase from A. S. Spence. The voucher submitted for payment in this connection bears the following words: \"Authority: Inspector Christianson's letters No. 407-11A of Sept. 26th and Nov. 23rd, 1932.\"\n\nI trust this explanation is satisfactory.\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\n**LOCAL PURCHASE\u2014ABSTRACT OF TENDERS**\n\nTenders called Oct. 12, 1932, by letter phone.

It then developed that what the Principal wanted was a Grain Tank and not a Wagon Box. He also wanted a set of trees and yoke. Trees and yoke are not a part of a bob-sleigh, but rather than have a lot of fuss over nothing I had the wagon box changed for the Grain Tank, and the trees and yoke furnished.\n\nThe extra cost in this connection, over and above the Wagon Box is $30.95. Therefore a voucher is herewith attached for $70.35 and abstract for tenders is also attached for same, and another voucher attached for the extra $30.95.\n\nI hope this meets with the approval of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

In reply, I wish to submit the following report:\n\nIn Mr. Inspector Christianson's letter No. 407-11A of the 26th September, 1932, I received instructions in part as follows: \"As to the purchase of additional milch cows, you are hereby authorized to purchase five grade milch cows for the school of a good milch type. You should see the Principal and ascertain from him what would be the most suitable time for the cows to freshen. When the Department wrote to me in this connection I advised them that the cows could be purchased at a price of from $50. to $60., and this amount should not be exceeded. I think we should get exceptionally good cows for even $50. You are aware of the market price at the present time, and I would consider that real good cows can be bought for this amount. In making the purchase you are to give Mr. Gauvreau an opportunity to supply the five cows that are required, but if he is unable to do so, you may purchase them locally wherever you can find suitable ones.\"\n\nThe cows were also to be T.B. tested. On the 13th October, I interviewed Mr. Gauvreau in regard to supplying the five cows required. I advised him as to the kind and type of cows required and also informed him that he should endeavor to see the Reverend Principal of the Blue Quill's school before getting any cows. In my report for the month of October, I mentioned that the cows had not yet been delivered. By letter dated November 23rd, 1932,\n\nHarold W. McGill Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMr. Inspector Christianson advised me that the matter had already been too long delayed and instructed me to get in touch with the Principal immediately and buy five cows that were suitable to him. I received Mr. Christianson's letter on the 29th November and on the following day, I called at the school and the cows was one of the subjects discussed with Rev. Father Anglin. He informed me that he wished to have at least two cows fresh, the others to freshen before Spring. I was in St. Paul but did not see Mr. Sauvreau on that date. I however, met Mr. Walter Allen from North of St. Paul and he mentioned that Mr. Sauvreau had told him that a number of cows were needed for the school. I advised Mr. Allen that I would look over his cattle as soon as possible. The day following, December 1st, I drove out to Mr. Allen's and looked over his herd. While some of his cattle were fairly smooth, they were not of the larger type and with the exception of one very poor heifer, none of the cows that I looked over had freshened. He had three heifers, I believe rising three years, that I considered the most promising. His cows, I understood, were not freshening until Spring. I advised Mr. Allen that five cows were required for the school and that I wished to get cows that would prove suitable to the Principal. I also told Mr. Allen that I would advise the Principal in regard to his (Mr. Allen's) cattle and that if the Principal considered that they might be suitable, he might drive over and look at them. The Principal, however, did not want any untried milch cows or any that were not going to freshen during the Winter.\n\nAs Mr. Sauvreau was apparently making no further efforts to secure the cows, I did not again approach him in connection with the matter and proceeded to carry out Mr. Christianson's instructions. On making enquiries in St. Paul, I was advised by Mr. H.A. Welsh and others, to get in touch with Mr. A.S. Spence, whom it was considered was the most familiar with the stock in the district. On the 3rd December, I got in touch with Mr. Spence and advised him of the kind and type of cows required. The cows were accordingly delivered at the school on the 16th December. I called at the school with Mr. Spence on Saturday the 17th and checked up on the animals with him. The cows supplied were large and of a very good type. One cow had just freshened, one was to freshen at once and another one within ten days, the other two being due to come in a little later. The Reverend Principal informed me that he was very well satisfied with the cows. The cows were purchased with the understanding that they would pass the T.B. test and Mr. Spence is having them tested. Taking the time...\ntime spent in looking for suitable cows, trucking, etc., into consideration, I was of the opinion that for the type supplied, the cows were reasonably priced.\n\nIt was represented to the Department that the cows were purchased at an amount which was $75.00 more than the price quoted by Mr. Allen. The cows furnished were of course worth the difference or I should not have made the purchase. There were cattle in the district that could have been bought at prices even lower than Mr. Allen's but there is the difference between suitable and unsuitable animals to be taken into consideration.\n\nI fail to see any reason why Mr. Sauvreau should feel aggrieved as he was given an opportunity and I think plenty of time, to procure the cows. In this connection, I might mention that when in St. Paul on the 26th January last, Mr. A.U. Lebel asked me to call at his office. I did so and he then brought up the matter of the cows, stating that Mr. Sauvreau had requested him to write Ottawa and ask for an investigation in the matter of the purchase. Mr. Lebel thought that it might be advisable to see Mr. Sauvreau and Mr. Allen regarding this but after considering the matter, I came to the conclusion that it would be very poor policy to go about explaining my action in a matter in which I considered I was right and in accordance with instructions from my superior officer. In discussing this with Mr. Lebel, I explained the situation and he was apparently satisfied. There was absolutely nothing for which I considered I should place myself on the defensive and I felt that I had no occasion to adopt that attitude.\n\nI have gone into this at some length in an endeavor to make the situation clear and in conclusion, would say that I regret very much any annoyance the purchase of the cows may have caused.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E. Cullion\nIndian Agent.\nApril 30, 1933.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. BUSKARD,\n\nI wish to refer to your memorandum of the 14th ultimo, regarding the purchase of five cows by Mr. W. E. Gullion, Indian Agent, Saddle Lake, Alberta, from Mr. A. S. Spence, for the Blue Quills Indian Residential School, without the application of the T. B. test to the animals and at $75 over the quotation of Mr. Walter Allen of St. Paul. A report regarding the purchase has been received from Mr. Gullion, from which I quote as follows:\n\n\"I received instructions from Mr. Inspector Christianson to arrange for the purchase of five grade milch cows of a good milk type and to give Mr. Gauvreau an opportunity to supply the cows but that, if he was unable to do so, to purchase them locally wherever suitable ones could be obtained - the cows to be T. B. tested. On October 13th I interviewed Mr. Gauvreau, advising him of the type of cows required. On the 26th of November, as Mr. Gauvreau was apparently making no efforts to secure the cows, I did not again approach him in connection with the matter. I met Mr. Walter Allen and inspected his herd. While none of his cattle were fairly smooth, they were not of the larger type and, with the exception of one very poor heifer, none of the cows had freshened. He had three heifers rising three years, which I considered the most promising. I advised Mr. Allen that five cows were required for the school, that would prove suitable to the Principal. The Principal did not want any untried milch cows or any that were not going to freshen during the winter. On making enquiries, I was advised to get in touch with Mr. A. S.

B. test and Mr.\n\n- Spence\nSpence is having them tested.\n\n\"While it is represented that the cows were purchased at a cost of $75 more than the price quoted by Mr. Allen, I would point out that they were worth the difference, or I would not have made the purchase. There were cattle in the district that could have been bought at prices even lower than Mr. Allen's, but there is the difference between suitable and unsuitable animals to be taken into consideration.\"\n\nIn concluding his letter, Mr. Gullion states:\n\n\"I fail to see any reason why Mr. Gauvreau should feel aggrieved as he was given an opportunity and I think, plenty of time, to procure the cows. In this connection, I might mention that when in St. Paul on the 26th January, last, Mr. A. U. Lebel asked me to call at his office. I did so and he then brought up the matter of the cows, stating that Mr. Gauvreau had requested him to write Ottawa and ask for an investigation in the matter of the purchase. Mr. Lebel thought that it might be advisable to see Mr. Gauvreau and Mr. Allen regarding this but, after considering the matter, I came to the conclusion that it would be very poor policy to go about explaining my action in a matter in which I considered I was right and in accordance with instructions from my superior officer. In discussing this with Mr. Lebel, I explained the situation and he was apparently satisfied. There was absolutely nothing for which I considered I should place myself on the defensive and I felt that I had no occasion to adopt that attitude.\"\n\nI may add that Mr. Spence, from whom the cattle were purchased, has been paid at the rate of $60 each for two cows and $55 each for three cows - a total of $385.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE.\nCALGARY, ALTA., April 29th, 1933.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to bring to your attention that last year the Principal of the Blue Quills Indian Residential School in the Saddle Lake Agency was asking for certain equipment in the way of machinery, horses, &c.\n\nI have had a letter from him recently stating that he is urgently in need of the equipment for spring work.

Will you please advise me whether the Minister wishes the purchases to be made directly from this office, or whether they should be made through the Inspectors or the Indian agents themselves. The practice has been to instruct the Inspectors to do the purchasing, and continuance of this method would be the quicker. I shall be glad if you will let me know as soon as possible.\n\n[Signature]\n\nOttawa, May 13th., 1933.\nBlue Quills Indian Residential School,\nSaint Paul, Alberta,\nMarch 5th, 1934.\n\nMr. M. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCALGARY, Alta.\n\nDear Mr. Christianson:\n\nIn my estimate to the Department last year I asked for 6 work horses and 2 double harnesses that we may prepare our land for the seeding. These horses and harnesses will be absolutely needy soon next spring, and I would be satisfied if you could ask the Department that horses and harnesses be supplied to the school during April.\n\nWe have 130 acres to seed this year, but out of these 130 acres 100 have to be ploughed very carefully, as it will be the first ploughing since the land was broken. Just now I have only 6 horses for this work and it is completely insufficient. I hope that you will obtain from the Department horses and harnesses. I suppose that now you enjoy a very good health.\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"JOS. ANGIN O. M. I.\"\nPrincipal.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE,\nPB CALGARY, ALTA....March 12th, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to herewith forward copy of a letter which I have just received from the Rev. Father Angin, Principal of Blue Quills Indian Residential School at St. Paul, Alberta. You will note that the Reverend Father is asking the Department to take immediate action to purchase the six work horses and two sets of harness.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, March 19, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your 407-11A of the 12th instant, enclosing letter from the Principal of the Blue Quills Indian Residential School, in which he requests the Department to purchase six work horses and two sets of harness.\n\nPlease let me have a definite recommendation with regard to the necessity of supplying the horses and harness requested by the Principal.\n\nIn the event of your recommending the purchase, please give an estimate of the cost of the horses and state where they can be secured. On receipt of this information, the Department will be in a position to decide if funds can be provided.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nM.

In reply would state that to carry out the programme of the school re farming operations, the Principal actually requires the six horses and two sets of harness. I find that horses up in that country are worth about $90.00 each. They can be purchased from farmers in the vicinity as no doubt most good farmers would be glad to sell a team of horses as cash is very scarce around St. Paul at the present time. I think it would be safe, if the horses were authorized, to let Mr. Gullion buy them, as I noticed the last time I was around with him that he was a fairly good judge of live stock. I would not have the time to go up there just now. The roads are impassible and I am very busy.\n\nThe harness could be purchased from the Great West Saddlery Company here and shipped from their Edmonton branch. Good harness can be bought for about $35.00 per set.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

It is noted, from your letter, that the horses can be secured at a cost not exceeding $90 each.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase of two sets of harness from the Great West Saddlery Company, at a cost of $35.00 a set.\n\nEnclosed is R. R. No. 2017 as your authority for the purchase of the above.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nM.

The Principal advised me that he has received the horses and harness and wishes me to extend his thanks to the Department for furnishing him with this outfit. The horses are very fit being all young horses weighing from 1400 to 1500 pounds and before taking them over, I advised the Agent to be sure that the Principal was satisfied with the purchase, which he did.

The only policy which would be open to you is the supervised herd plan and, if you desire to take advantage of this plan, it will be necessary for you to have the party responsible for the herd fill in and sign the enclosed agreement forms and return one of them to this office. The duplicate copy should be retained by the party signing the agreement.\n\nI would point out that no compensation is paid for any cattle which react to a test conducted under the supervised herd plan, but the Institution will receive whatever proceeds there may be from any carcasses which are passed as fit for human consumption. No charge is made for the services of our inspectors, but everything possible is done to eradicate tuberculosis from the herd and to maintain it free from this disease.\nI would particularly point out that the responsible person with whom this Department will deal should sign the agreement forms.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nVeterinary Director General.\n\nEncls.\nOH/ML\nOttawa,\nDecember 19, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn your report for the month of November on the Blue Quills Residential School you recommended that the herd be tested.

Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nSaddle Lake, Alberta.\n\n2nd June 1944.\n\nDear Mr. Morris, (Wherever you may be)\n\nHave been thinking about you all week the weather if anything here has been worse than last week, so we had some luck with the weather anyhow.\n\nI quote from my monthly report as follows:\n\n\"A very enjoyable and instructive visit was received from Mr. J.E. Morris from May 19th to May 26th, having an official visit to the Agency, and go over the ground with you is like a refresher course, while we had bad weather which threw some of plans out of gear, I think Mr. Morris saw a very good cross section of the Agency. I thoroughly enjoyed his visit and help and information I received from him, and I can also say this for the rest of the staff. I only hope he may be able to visit this Agency again, and that other officials may also come. I hope I have success with some of his projects he is anxious to start and I think I see some action in the making already\".\n\nAnd I do mean just that Mr. Morris.\n\nI visited the Blue Quill's School last Wednesday night and Father Letour is ready to go on some goats. Please advise me how to procure same and through what channels. His brother from Duck Lake was there and he is having good luck with goats so Father Principal at Blue Quill's would like to get started and I think it is an ideal place to start. I regret I did not ask you for instructions how to procure goats when you visited here. Not only goats I have thoughts of endless questions I could have discussed with you that I passed up.\n\nTrust the weather is better with you and that your trip is going O.K. Best of Luck.\n\nWith kindest regards from Mrs. Pugh & self.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.P.B. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nMr. Hoey it is considered that this may be an opportunity to get goats started in the Saddle Lake Agency. If a male goat is being sent to Father Forcade from Spanish another one could be shipped to the Blue quill's school at the same time.\n\nLeask, Sask. June 15th.\n\nDear Mr Pugh,\n\nRe:-Goats for Blue Quill's School\n\nYour very welcome letter of June 2nd. finally caught up to me. I discussed the purchase of goats with Indian Agent Ostrander of Battleford and he is going to obtain six or seven female grade goats in that district. In fact while I was there we bought two milking nannies. He feels certain that others can be secured. You are requested to communicate with him and give him shipping instructions. Mr Ostrander suggested that the goats be delivered to a railway point immediately south of your location and have the school truck pick them up rather than send them all the way to Edmonton and then back out to St Paul. Note the shortest and quickest route should be arranged as the nannies are milking.\n\nPlease discuss with Father Letour the purchase and care of these goats and advise him that the Department is supplying them on the understanding that the senior girls and boys will be given instructions on their care. It should also be understood that an equal number of females will be given to some responsible Indians as the herd increases.\n\nRegarding a male goat for this herd I am suggesting that a Pure Breed Saanen be sent from the Spanish Herd. It is thought this could be arranged as we are shipping one from this herd to Father Forcade at Crouard, Sask. If it impossible to ship a male from Ontario you will be advised by Ottawa.\n\nJ. E.

That being so, it would be well if when the time arrives for your cattle to go on grass that you put them there if an inspector has not at that time arrived to test them.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH. W. Cowan,  \nInspector.\nSaddle Lake, Alberta.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\n13th June 1944.\n\nI beg to enclose copy of letter I have received from Father L.C. Latour, Principal of the Blue Quill's School, the letter is self explanatory, but the Principal is anxious to have the School Cattle tested and anything the department may be able to do to speed the matter along would be much appreciated. Thanking you in anticipation.\n\nW.P.B. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJune 22, 1944.\n\nMr. W.P.B. Pugh, Indian Agent, Saddle Lake, Alta.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 13th instant, I regret that I cannot do anything to assist Father Latour in the manner he requests.

MORRIS'S REPORT ON THE DUCK LAKE AGENCY -\n\nBEARDY'S RESERVE\n\nThe goats at this school are doing very nicely. They are milked regularly and the milk is used in the school. The Sister in charge of the dairy has successfully made butter from the milk and a sample and instructions are being sent to Ottawa for inspection. Father Latour has distributed ten (10) young female goats to Indians on the Beardy's Reserve. He visits this Reserve regularly and will give the goats constant supervision.\n\nNote: Father Latour requested that, if possible, a pure bred Saanen male be sent to him from Spanish. Mr. Roberts - kindly endeavour to obtain one for the Duck Lake School. Note: The understanding with Father Primeau is that all male goats of the Saanen herd at Spanish will be made available for our service at a cost of $30.00 each, crated f.o.b. Spanish. I have already asked that a Saanen male be sent to the Grouard and Blue Quills Schools. When these shipments are being made another one could be included for Duck Lake.\n\nJ. E. Morris,\nWelfare Division\nOttawa, July 8th, 1944.\n\nC. P. Schmidt, Esq., Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nCALGARY, ALTA.\n\nRequests have recently been received for Pure Bred Male Saanen Goats for the Duck Lake and Blue Quills Schools, and I would appreciate hearing from you regarding the possibility of obtaining two suitable animals somewhere in B.C.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. Welfare and Training.\nOttawa, July 8th, 1946.\n\nH. P. Baddy, Esq., Indian Agent, Golden Lake, Ontario.\n\nRequests have been received from a few of the Agencies in Saskatchewan and Alberta for Male Swansons Goats, and I would appreciate hearing from you as to whether you will have any animals this year which would be suitable for shipment.\n\nR. A. Hesey,\nSupt. Welfare and Training.\nOttawa, July 10, 1946.\n\nDear Mr. Morris:\n\nThe remarks in your Duck Lake report regarding male goats for the Duck Lake and Blue Quills schools have been noted, but we are advised there are no male goats available at Spanish this year; in fact, it appears the goats there were not bred this year due to Brother Grubb being short of help and unable to devote sufficient time to the goats. However, we have written Mr. Ruddy at Golden Lake, requesting that none of the male goats there be castrated until it is known definitely whether or not some of these may be required for the above schools or any other locations in the West. Would you drop me a line regarding your views as to whether or not the Golden Lake goats would be satisfactory.\n\nI have also written Inspector Schmidt asking him to make enquiries in British Columbia with a view to obtaining pure bred males for Duck Lake and Blue Quills. I might also state that Mr. Schmidt was instructed some time ago to purchase a male Sannen in British Columbia for Grouard.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J. E. Morris,\nc/o S. H. Simpson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHALGARRE,\nSaskatchewan.\nDear Mr. Rosey:\n\nRegarding the sending of male goats to the Grouard, Blue Quill and Duck Lake schools as recommended in my reports I wish to make it clear that I never intended that young goats be sent. I do feel that good animals six months old could be sent without any difficulty. These three schools are very interested in the raising of goats to be distributed to needy T.B. Indians and we will have to encourage the project by helping to obtain breeding stock.\n\nI investigated the possibility of obtaining Saanen male goats at Edmonton, Calgary and at any other place where I thought goats could be obtained. This question was very thoroughly discussed with Inspector Schmidt and all the agents I have visited today and in every case they state that there are no good breeding goats to be had. Mr. Schmidt stated regarding the purchase of goats in British Columbia that there are only a limited number available at a very high price and that in his opinion there has been a great deal of inbreeding already. He was of the opinion that if goats are to make a success of in the Agencies in the West good breeding stock will have to come from Ontario.\n\nI would therefore suggest that Father Primsen be asked to hold a number of good male goats until I return to Ottawa. I will provide him with shipping instructions so that the animals can be shipped, stopping over certain points where the Farm Instructors can feed water and exercise them, so that they will reach their destination without hardship.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd) J. E. Morris.\nBattleford, Sask.\nJuly 17th, 1944.\n\nDepartment of Mines & Resources, Indian Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nRecently I transferred one milch goat from the Red Pheasant Indian Day School to the Blue Quill Indian Residential School, Saddle Lake Agency, as on account of the teacher leaving we had no responsible party to take charge of goat. At a later date it may be advisable to purchase a goat for Red Pheasant School.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander.\nIndian Agent.\n528 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba,\nJuly 20th, 1944.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nRe: 109-1-14 - Purchase of Goats for Duck Lake and Blue Quills Schools.\n\nAcknowledging your letter of July 10th, I would recommend that young male goats be retained at Golden Lake for delivery to the above-mentioned schools some time this fall.\n\nIt is regretted that the pure bred herd at Spanish was not bred last year. If Brother Grubb is unable to devote sufficient time to look after this herd of goats it might be well to consider moving them to some other place. I might inform you that many of the Agents are very interested in the securing of goats to supply milk to Indians, and as there are very few pure bred herds in the West it will most likely be necessary to obtain goats in Ontario. It is therefore important that the herd at Spanish be bred this year and goats available for delivery next year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.E. Morris\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nREPORT ON SADDLE LAKE INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF JUNE, 1944.\n\nBlue Quill's School;\nVisited on June 10th. During the month Father LeTour received six goats, to be used in connection with schoolwork.\n\nW.P.B. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nMr. P. G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent,\nNORWAY HOUSE, MANITOBA.\n\nRE: GOATS.\n\nYou are authorized to buy sixteen female goats at fourteen dollars each ($14.00) and six male goats at ten dollars ($10.00) each from the Rev. Mr. Jones; payment to be made out of the Welfare Vote. You are also authorized to purchase two female goats and one male goat from Father Rivard at twenty-five dollars for the three animals.\n\nThis herd is to be established at Norway House; the milk to be used for tubercular patients and the children of families who are unable to provide milk.\n\nThere has been considerable inbreeding in this herd; therefore, you are requested to separate the males at the earliest possible date. Probably you can arrange to pasture them on another island until they are distributed. The male goat purchased from Father Rivard should be used with this herd.\n\nOne male goat has already been sent to Island Lake. The others should be disposed of as follows:\n\nOne to Father Trudeau to establish a herd at Cross Lake.\n\nOne to Indian Agent Lovell at The Pas.\n\n(Note: It is suggested that this goat be sent there by aeroplane when Dr. Yule next visits Norway House.)\n\nTwo good billies should be selected -\n\nOne to be sent to the Duck Lake Indian Residential School,\nDuck Lake, Saskatchewan.\n\nOne to the Blue Quill School in Alberta.\n\nIt is suggested that you write to Father George Letour, Duck Lake, Saskatchewan, and Father L.C. Letour, St. Paul, Alberta, asking them to provide you with the proper shipping instructions.\n\n- Over -\nNOTE: I understand they will not bring goats out on the \"Keenora\" until after the tourist season is over; therefore these two goats most likely will be shipped the later part of September or the first of October. In my opinion, it might be wise to send these goats via Prince Albert: the one for Duck Lake could be transported from there by truck, the one for the Blue Quill School could be placed off at a station on the main line to Edmonton. If this is done the goats will be delivered in the shortest possible time.\n\n(Sgd) J. E. Morris.\n\nWelfare and Training Division.\nOttawa, August 25, 1944.\n\nDear Mr. Morris:\n\nFurther to my letter of July 10th, regarding the shortage of male goats at Spanish, a letter has now been received from Father Prineau in which he states they expect to have more kids than was originally anticipated.\n\nI quote hereunder from Father Prineau's letter:\n\n\"Following up your letter of March 30th (File 84-15) in reply to my letter of the 6th to Mr. Morris, I am pleased to say that we expect to have more kids than we thought there would be at that time. There are already five that have arrived, four billies and one nanny. There will be a good number of others I hope, as more of the nannies were bred than Brother Crubb had thought. I shall let you know later this month as to the number of kids we expect to be able to provide this season.\"\n\nAs passing this information on as it has just occurred to me you may wish to alter the instructions you recently gave to Mr. Lansby regarding the shipping of billies to Saskatchewan and Alberta.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

Geuthier, O.M.I., missionary at Beaver Lake Reserve, has asked me for the male goat that you sent to the School, from Norway House, last summer.

It is hoped that this animal will improve your goat herd.\n\nRegarding your request that the male goat sent to you from Norway House last year be sent to the Beaver Lake Reserve as requested by Father L. Genther I wish to inform you that the goat may be sent there. It should be understood that after two years it should be moved to some other reserve. Every effort should be made to encourage Indians in the raising of goats so that a supply of milk will be available. Anything you can do in this respect would be very much appreciated.\n\nKindest regards to yourself,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. E. Morris,\nWelfare Division.\n\nReverend Father L. C.

In spite of the good care that was given him, he could not recover, and this morning he suddenly grew worse and died in the afternoon.\n\nFor your information, I beg to add that I took delivery of same, immediately upon his arrival in St. Paul.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev.

In the event you are able to make suitable arrangements for this Fall kindly advise, whether or not, you wish us to endeavour to locate a suitable animal for next Spring.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

Arrangements are being made to obtain another pure bred Saanen goat from the Spanish Herd. This animal will be shipped next Spring - during the month of May or early in June - with a stop off at Portage la Prairie for a week or ten days and then sent forward to your School.\n\nTo have this animal delivered to you in the best possible condition and in the shortest time it is suggested that you accept delivery of him at Wynne or Bemidji, and then taken to St. Paul either by car or truck, rather than have the animal sent all the way into Edmonton and back out to St. Paul.\n\nI might inform you three goats were shipped from Portage la Prairie; one to Duck Lake; one to your School and one to the Youville School at Edmonton. It would appear that the two other goats arrived in good condition which would indicate that some neglect or delay was made at Edmonton in the shipment of the goat sent to your school.\n\nIf this suggestion regarding the shipment is agreeable please advise, indicating your approval.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

I immediately wrote to Mr. J.

To assure you that the same mistake would be avoided by more personal supervision of the matter next time would be superfluous since the goat problem for us no longer happily exists.\n\nMay I have directions as to how we proceed in the matter of collecting for the goats which were sent by us to Golden Lake? Should we require a receipt from Indian agent Ruddy as to the number of goats received from us and then work on the price offered by the Department?\n\nIf it is not too late may we offer you all good wishes of success in this work, and invite you to visit us whenever the occasion may offer?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n(Rev) J.H.

It is noted that this flock was made up of thirteen nannies, four - one-year-old billies, and eight - four-months' old billies. The latter were later castrated and will be issued as 'goat meat' to the Indians during the coming winter.

I presume this is the way to do it, since I did not see how we could bill the Welfare Department directly.\n\nSince the young billies are destined for ration meat and since as you say the full price should not naturally be charged, what do you say to one quarter the price of the ordinary goats? If this is not suitable then the bill may be changed and suit your requirements. I presume that since the mistake was made regarding the goat for Blue Quills we have not the right to charge for it and will not put it on the bill.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nThis will advise that I have been approached with a request for assistance towards an improvement of a dairy herd at the Blue Quills Indian Residential School. The dairy herd at this school is not an asset in this line as they are more of a beef variety. The Reverend Principal is prepared to sell the milking class in this herd with a view of obtaining ten or twelve head of good milk stock. The proceeds for the sale of this stock will by no means cover the cost of the good milk strain required and the request was therefore being made to assist in covering the balance required.\n\nIt is felt that approximately $3000.00 will be required to make the total purchase. Of this, $1,000.00 will be covered from the sale of the present stock and the Reverend Principal is prepared to put up $1,000.00, which leaves a balance of $1,000.00. I advised Father Hollande, principal of the school, that I was not aware of this information but felt if any assistance was granted, that it would have to be covered in estimates.\n\nMay I please be advised what action should be taken in this regards. It is my opinion that a better class of dairy cattle would be obtained with the least possible delay and any information or assistance will be greatly appreciated. There is a dairy breeders meeting being held in St. Paul on July 15, 1950 and an answer to this letter by that time would give us fact on which to make further inquiries.\n\nW.K. Taylor,\nSuperintendent.\nJune 30th, 1950.\n\nMr. W.K.

When the Blue Quills Residential School was opened in 1932, a number of milking cows were purchased by the Department.\n\nIn view of our present policy, I regret that favourable consideration cannot be given to the Principal's request.\n\nBernard F.

A suitable person for this duty would be a Justice of the Peace or a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted or Provincial Police. A more or less permanent arrangement of this kind might be necessary in some cases. The Department is prepared to pay a reasonable fee for this duty, on the Agent's recommendation. The report of the Board, in any case, must reach the Department through the Indian Agent's office.\n\nThis inquiry is not designed to take the place of, or prevent, any other inquiry, including an inquest, which may be required by law.\n\nIf the pupil died as the result of an accident, the Indian Agent is required to take the statements of the witnesses of the accident, and attach them to this memorandum.\n\nForm No. 414.\nA.

Returned to the Saddle Lake Reserve from school at the end of June. The mother was approached to return the boy to School at the beginning of the term, this she refused to do saying that she had no transportation and the boy was not well enough to walk. Father Latour offered to come and get the boy and this she refused until Sept. 22nd when he came out with his car and took the boy to school from where he was removed on Sept. 23rd to St. Theresa Hospital, St. Paul where the boy died the same evening. This has been a most difficult case for this Agency to handle and the mother would only move thru other parties rather than thru me, owing to the fact that she is paid under Red Ticket No. 95 Blue Quill's Band, Saddle Lake Agency. This pupil was non-Treaty.\n\nAttached\u2014 Form No. 414 duly completed together with her statement, she was asked to attend the enquiry but made a mistake in the date, going to the school the day before on Sept. 29th she came to the office on Sept. 30th and I offered to take her to the enquiry but she stated she had no reason to go.\n\nThe enquiry was not convened within 48 hours of the date of the death owing to the fact that my wife was in hospital very ill at the time.\n\nW.F.B.

Mr. & Mrs. Edward Minocose were willing to go in the first place, then he said he had not got any money to go. Councillor Blackman said he did not need money as Father Letour would look after them, then Edward said he did not want to go because when I went to the School I told Father Letour I would take the girl home, and Father would not let the girl go, owing to her being sick. I also told their parents they could go and see their child but they would not go, after tried to coax them to go, the mother was willing to go but the Father told his wife that he would not let her go. I then left with Father Letour; and Minocose's boy Eli came to Cold Lake with myself and Father Letour, at Cold Lake we picked up Councillor Scanie and told Eli we would phone him from St. Paul. We arrived in St. Paul about 5 p.m., Monday - the child was very living and we both saw Caroline we stayed about half an hour at the hospital then went to Blue Quill's School with Father Letour had supper returned to the Hospital with Father Letour to see the child about 7.30 p.m., we stayed with Caroline, then back to Blue Quill's School where we stayed over night.

Father Lacome & the Department, it had been agreed to have a Boarding School established at the R. Catholic Mission on the Blackfoot Reserve.\n\nFor want of sufficient means we could not immediately think of carrying out our wishes, but we expect to be able, in the course of next fiscal year with a liberal assistance from the Indian Department to make a start towards the realizing of the project.\n\nHaving been instructed by the Right Rev. Bishop of St. Albert, with the Superintendent of the Reserve Estimates in Realty No. 7, I have the honour to inform you of our present intentions, and to ask you what would likely be the grant of the Indian Department towards the erection of the Buildings for a Boarding School on the said Reserve.\n\nHoping to be favored with an official answer on the subject, at an early date,\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour very respectful & obedient servant,\n\nRev.

Leavell; and as regards the one in which he asks for a grant towards the erection of buildings for a Boarding School on the Blackfoot Reserve, I have to request that you will be good enough to inform the Revd gentleman that \u00a31,000 towards that object has been placed in the Estimates for 1905-06. You may add that the Department hopes the item will pass the House, but that there can be no certainty of the money being granted until it has actually been voted.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nof Indian Affairs\n\nA.F. Forget Esq.,\nAssistant Indian Commissioner,\nRegina N.W.T.,\nI write to you to make application for a grant from the Ind. Depart. to build a boarding school at the South Blackfoot Reserve. The agent of this Reserve urges me for a long time to do so. I have delayed till now because we were not in measure to conduct such an establishment.\n\nFather Legal told me that he wrote to you on this subject.\n\nHoping that you will take my application under kind consideration,\n\nI remain,\n\nSir,\n\nYours truly:\n\nSouth Blackfoot Reserve\n\n[Signature]\n\nP. Doucet\n30th January\n\nDear Father Bouet,\n\nReplying to your private note of the 24th, I am happy to be able to inform you that I have a sum in the Estimates for the next fiscal year to meet the expenses in connection with the erection of a Boarding School building upon the Blackfoot Reserve for your children. It gives me no little pleasure to be able to meet your request in this regard, as I have never forgotten your kindness to me and other officials when your aid was sought.\n\nBelieve me to be\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. Father Bouet,\n\nGlacier, Alta.\nSt Albert,\nNov. 18th. 1895\n\nMy dear Mr Forget:\n\nReverend Father Legal, who has been given special charge over our Blackfoot Missions, urges me to obtain for him, one Boarding School at Blackfoot Crossing and this, as soon as possible. Upon my answer that the Department could establish but one of these during the next year, and that I did not wish to delay the establishment of that of Hobbema, there being Sisters there already, who have a good number of children under their care, he says \"It is nearly three years ago that the Boarding School for the Blackfoot Crossing has practically been granted\". I cannot believe that it is the question of funds which interferes with the Department granting this; it can always find money when it is needed.\n\nHow is it, that in Treaty Seven, the Protestants have six boarding schools, one Industrial school, and if I am well informed, they furthermore will have an hospital, for the Blackfeet, when we ourselves have but one Industrial School and one hospital, and a boarding school is refused for want of funds?\n\nYou\n\nMr A. Forget,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina.\nSir,\n\nAs the Parliament is about to convene again in short while, allow me to state before the Department, in the Boarding-school to be erected on the Blackfoot Reserve, under the auspices of the Rom. Cath. Church, the reasons why the support of the Government should not be delayed any more.\n\nThe first application for the erection of that school has been made three years ago, and although it has been objected to since by the Department that there were no funds available for the purpose, a liberal support has been granted, at the same time, towards the building of a large Industrial school, New Calgary, under the auspices of the Church of England, and besides another grant has been promised towards the building of a second Boarding-school of the same denomination on the Blackfoot Reserve. So that there are at present two Boarding-schools of the Church of England on that Reserve, while we have none.\n\nTaking the whole matter into account, at present, there is:\n\n1. Industrial School of the Church of England Denomination,\n2. Industrial School of the Rom. Cath. Denomination,\n3. Boarding-schools of the Church of Engl.

Grand Father Legal and cited by His Lordship why a boarding school should be immediately established at Blackfoot Crossing, in addition to the one proposed at Hobson, which His Lordship considered should take precedence; and in reply to inform you as follows:\n\nThe Rev. Father Legal declares himself unable to credit the assertion that it is any question of funds which interferes with the Department's granting the schools, and says it can always find money where it is needed, and asks how it comes about that in Treaty Seven, the Protestants have six Boarding and one Industrial school under their auspices, while the Roman Catholic Church has but one Industrial School.\n\nIn answer the Department may observe that it would be only too pleased had it the power to expend funds with the facility attributed to it by the Rev. Father Legal, but as a matter of fact it finds the very greatest\n\nA.B. Forget, Esq.\nIndian Commissioner\nRegina.\ngreatest difficulty in all keeping pace with the ever increasing educational demands upon its resources.\n\nIn distributing available funds the Department has endeavored to exercise strict impartiality in so far as the various religious denominations are concerned, and has no other desire than to get the best possible return for the funds intrusted to it for expenditure. It must, however, be always borne in mind relative to the denominational aspect of the question, that the Department has to deal with the work as a whole and not with the respect to any particular district, and consequently the Rev Father Loyol is doing it injustice in drawing the inference he does from the facts cited by him. If the number of Indians in the North West Territories as a whole professing adherence to the Roman Catholic and Protestant faith respectively compared, and also the educational grants, it will be found that if any appearance of discrimination exists it certainly is not against the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nWith regard to Treaty Seven. If the Anglican Church appear to have been favoured it is not because of any partiality on the part of the Department, but simply because that Church has selected that field which so far has been anything but an encouraging one for special effort, and has invested its own funds in the establishment of boarding schools, to at least the extent to which it has received assistance from the Department.\n\nIt is hoped therefore, that when the question is considered in the light of what has been herein pointed out, His Lordship will recognize that the explanation given by the Department of its inability for the present\nTo establish a boarding school at the Blackfoot Reserve (that is if His Lordship still desires that the one proposed for Mohawk Lake precedence) is a perfectly candid and sufficient one.\n\nIn conclusion the Department may remark that it would seem reasonable to infer from the fact that you were aware of the application but refrained from making provision in your estimates to meet it, that you were influenced by the same considerations which have not acted in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Superintendant\nof Indian Affairs.\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, stating certain reasons why in your opinion no further delay should take place relative to the establishment of a boarding school at the Blackfoot Reserve under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church, and in reply to inform you as follows.\n\nIt is observed that you appear to be somewhat skeptical as to the delay being caused by want of funds and state the present position in Treaty Seven to be that the English Church has one Industrial and six Boarding schools, as against one Industrial Institution under the direction of the Roman Catholic Church. In passing it may be noticed that in making this comparison you appear to have included among the six boarding schools, the Macdonell Orphanage at Morley, which is not connected with the English but with the Methodist Church, but as this does not materially affect the point at issue nothing farther need be said about it here.\n\nWhatever aspect the matter may present to onlookers, the Department regrets that the fact remains that\n\nRev Father Loyal\nSupt of Catholic Missions\nBlood Reserve,\nMacLeod, N.W.\nit finds the very greatest difficulty in obtaining funds wherewith to meet the ever increasing educational demands upon it. In appropriating such funds as it can command the Department's desire and endeavor have been to exercise strict impartiality in so far as the various religious denominations which co-operate in the work are concerned, and to get the best possible return for the funds intrusted to it for expenditure.\n\nThe Department, however, relative to the denominational aspect of the question has to deal with the work as a whole and not with regard to any particular district and it may well happen that one denomination may be compared with others seen in any given district to be somewhat favoured, and yet if a wider comparison be made it may be found that nothing of the kind exists. As an illustration of what is meant the Department may point to the large preponderance of Roman Catholic schools in British Columbia, as again to the enormous expenditure at the Okanagan Industrial School, in a district where there is nothing in the relative strength of the Indian Roman Catholic population to justify it. If the number of Indians in the North West Territories as a whole, professing adherence to the Roman Catholic and Protestant faiths respectively be compared, and also the educational grants, it will be found that if there be any appearance of discrimination, it is certainly not against the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nWith regard to Treaty Seven, if the Anglican Church seems to have been somewhat favoured, it has only been\nbeen because that Church has selected this field, so far anything but an encouraging one for special effort, and has invested more of its own funds in the establishment of boarding schools than it has received in the way of assistance from the Department and not on account of any denominational partiality.\n\nUnder the circumstances and in view of the fact of which you are doubtless aware that His Lordship the Bishop of St. Albert desires that provision for the establishment of a school at Hobema should take precedence. It is hoped that you will recognize that when the Department states that it is the inability to find funds that interferes with its acceding to your wishes for the present, it is dealing with you in a perfectly candid manner.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Supt: Genl:\nof Indian Affairs.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Department letter of the 10th inst., relative to the proposed Boarding School at the Blackfoot Crossing under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nIn reply to the last paragraph I would state, if the Department's reference is to the Estimates of 1895-6 that at the time of their preparation I had no application before me for this school. If however reference is made to the Estimates of 1896-7, I would observe that an item for this school was inserted therein as the result of an application made to me during last summer.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCommissioner.\n\nThe Deputy,\n\nof the Supt General,\n\nof Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your communication of the 16th inst., No. 124784, re the intended Boarding School at Blackfoot Crossing, allow me to state that I am indeed, to a certain extent, rather skeptical about the want of funds being the main reason for again putting aside the project. That the Department might find it expedient to give other destinations to the fund at its command, of course, it can be said that it is no concern of mine; that in the whole of the N.W.T. of these be any appearance of discrimination in the repartition of Educational grants to denominational bodies, this discrimination is not against the Roman Catholic Church, I am not prepared either to deny or to assert. But what I know is that, in the Treaty No. 7, with which I have to deal, this discrimination is rather shockingly manifest.\n\nAllow me to state again that our demand has been exceedingly reasonable and moderate.\n\nRelying on the hope, entertained after the communication of last year with the Department, that the grant for the erection of said Boarding school on the Blackfoot Reserve, would not be delayed any more, and taking into consideration the alleged scarcity of funds, we refrained from making any other application for assistance in the way of building on the other two Reserves, where we have established missions. And although there is a standing application for building a Boarding School and Hospital on the Peigan Reserve, recommended by the agent, I took the initiative previous to the discussion of the subject by the Department, while asking for the authority to take a few boarders there, to pledge myself that, for two years, we would not urge on the Department the necessity of a grant for building purposes on that Reserve. The only satisfaction obtained been the authority to take 8 boarders.\nBoarders but with such conditions that it is my doubtful\nif His Lordship the Bishop of St. Albert will consider it\nadvisable to take advantage of the same.\n\nNow in this, the Blood Reserve, we greatly long for\nthe day when we will be able to have a Boarding school\nin place of the two day schools actually existing. The result\nwould be a great deal more satisfactory, and there would be\na vastly greater return for our exertions and the expenses\ninvolved. But in view of the same alleged scarcity of funds\nI refused again to make any particular application for this\nobject.\n\nBut the only result of this moderation and the restraint in\nour demands is that we are ignored again, and the only demand\nmaintained is set aside; and although there has been\nrecommended by the Indian agent on Blood fort Reserve, the\ncreation of a Boarding School and a hospital under the\nauspices of the Roman Catholic Church, it has not been found\nadvisable to grant the smallest sum of money for this purpose.\n\nI cannot refrain to state again that I consider it a\ngross injustice, and in fact, I cannot consider the decision as\nfinal, but expect that the Department will reconsider it and\ndecide to come to our assistance. I know that the above\nhas been put into the Estimate for the project in view. Now\nis that sum cannot be completed this year, let a grant of\nat least $2,000 be secured and what we could manage\nto gather towards the erection of the buildings, a fair start\ncould be made this year, to be completed afterwards.\n\nRelying on the impartiality of the Department\nespecially assured in your letter.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour very respectful & obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nRev. Segal\nSup. of Cath. Miss.\nOttawa, February 8th, 1896.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, and in reply to inform you that despite your desire to confine the comparison which you may fit to institute to school matters within the limits of Treaty 7, the bearing upon one particular district or what may be done for any one denomination in the Territories as a whole is an essentially practical one, and cannot be disregarded by the department.\n\nWhile the department may regret your inability to accept its assurances as to the cause of its inability to meet your views for the present, and cannot but deplore the tone of your letter, the fact remains the same, and if His Lordship the Bishop desired that such funds as might be available should be expended in another direction, the responsibility does not rest with it.\n\nIn this connection I may say that the Rev. Father Legare, whom here the other day, endorsed the view expressed by His Lordship, that the school at Brimskin's Reserve should be first considered.\n\nUnder the circumstances of the case the department regrets its inability to comply with your request for a reconsideration of its decision and a grant of \u00a32000.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nRev. Father Legare,\nSuperintendent Catholic Missions,\nBlood Reserve,\nMacLeod, Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nMon cher Mr. Forget,\n\nLe dernier courier m'a apport\u00e9 votre lettre en date du 30 Janvier dernier N\u00b008.\n\nJe vous remercie d'avoir bien voulu faire application aupr\u00e8s du D\u00e9partement Indien en faveur du Boarding School at Blackfoot Crossing.\n\nJe comprends que Mr. le Surintendant G\u00e9n\u00e9ral des affaires Indiennes puisse difficilement se rendre aux d\u00e9sirs des diff\u00e9rentes D\u00e9nominations religieuses demandant aide et secours pour l'\u00e9ducation des sauvages. Mais si vraiment il tient compte des d\u00e9penses et efforts que font ces diff\u00e9rentes D\u00e9nominations, il sera difficile de trouver aucune D\u00e9nomination religieuse qui ait d\u00e9pens\u00e9 plus de z\u00e8le et d'argent que l'Eglise Catholique.\n\nSi on consid\u00e8re les sauvages comme faisant un tout; pour ne parler que de mon Dioc\u00e8se tel qu'il est constitu\u00e9 aujourd'hui, j'ai deux \u00e9tablissements consid\u00e9rables \u00e0 St. Albert et au Lac Labiche qui ont 35 et 30 ans d'existence que nous avons fond\u00e9s et renouvel\u00e9s enti\u00e8rement \u00e0 nos frais, o\u00f9 pendant des ann\u00e9es nous avons \u00e9lev\u00e9 des enfants sauvages de toute D\u00e9nominations sans recevoir une obole du Gouvernement.\n\nS'il s'agit seulement des Piednoirs, sans doute nous n'avons pas construit des \u00e9tablissements consid\u00e9rables parmi eux, leur vie nomade et guerri\u00e8re ne le permettait pas.\n\nMonsieur A.E.

Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nMy dear Mr. Reed,\n\nWhereas your department has informed us that they cannot now grant us two boarding-schools, one at Bearshill and one at Blackfoot crossing, and whereas you have notified us that we are to receive only one and to determine which one we want to select, we inform you that we prefer Bearshill, for just hoping that one day the government will give us another Boarding School at Blackfoot crossing.\n\nNow allow me to ask you when your department intends to begin the work of construction at Bearshill Reserve. Are you to give a contract or to give the mission the job, with so much money, the plan being determined by the department? We would be very glad if you would let us know regarding what you intend to do, as we would prepare to meet your conditions.\n\nWe hope that you will give the job\nRev: Sir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant asking when and how the Department intends to begin the work of constructing a building for the proposed Boarding School at Bear's Hills; and in reply I beg to say that the Estimates for 1896-7 have not passed, and cannot receive consideration until Parliament meets in July next, when it is hoped that the provision made for this school will be passed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Supt:Genl:\nof Indian Affairs:\n\nRev: Father Lacombe,\nEdmonton, Alta.:\nTo the Honorable,\n\nthe Minister of the Interior\n\n& Superintendent of Indian Affairs.\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nI have the honor to refer you to a previous correspondence of recent date with the Indian Department, in Boarding schools on the Indian Reserve of Treaty No. 7. By said correspondence it is shown that a shocking partiality has been displayed in regard to the grant of assistance to denominational Bodies for the erection of such schools. The result being that, at the present time, on the three Reserves of that Treaty No. 7 (Blackfoot, Blood & Peigan) where the Roman Catholic Church had regularly established missions for fifteen years, there are four large Boarding schools of the Church of England erected with the assistance of the Indian Department; while the Roman Catholic denomination has not been able, so far, to secure any assistance in the way of establishing a single school of that kind. It is true that, of late, we have managed to start a small Boarding school on the Peigan Reserve, for eight pupils; but the old Peigan house had to be fitted up for the purpose at our own expense. In consequence, as the need of such schools is fully recognized by all the officers of the Department, I respectfully urge the necessity of apportioning at the earliest date possible, the following grants:\n\n1) $500.00 to help cover the expenses already made and other improvements to be done to fit the school house on the Peigan Reserve for the new pupils.\n\n2) $1200.00 for the building of the 2nd wing of the Hospital on the Blood Reserve, such addition to be used as Boarding school for 25 pupils, until a grant might be secured for a separate building.\n\n3) $2500.00 as requested in the Estimates of the present year, for the erection of a Boarding school of the Roman Catholic denomination on the Blackfoot Reserve.\nBlackfoot Reserve, where there are already two prominent Boarding Schools.\n\nHoping for a satisfactory answer,\n\nI have the honor to remain,\n\nHonourable Sir,\n\nYour very respectful & obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Position: Superintendent of Indian Affairs]\nMEMORANDUM FOR THE INFORMATION OF THE ACTING\nSUPERINTENDENT GENERAL OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nIN RE REV. FATHER LEGAL'S LETTER ON ATTACHED\nDATE, DATED 10th INSTANT, MAKING\nAPPLICATION FOR CERTAIN GRANTS FOR ES-\nTABILISHMENT OF BOARDING SCHOOLS ON RE-\nSERVES IN TREATY NO. 7.\n\nThe late Minister, in declining to make pro-\nvision in the Estimates for current fiscal year\nprepared by the late Government for establishment\nof Boarding Schools on Reserves in Treaty No. 7,\nas requested last winter by the Rev. Father Legal,\nwas guided by the following considerations, which\napparently have as much force now as then.\n\nThe amount of funds available for educa-\ntional purposes are necessarily limited, and in-\nsufficient to meet the constantly increasing de-\nmands on them.\n\nThe Department has endeavoured, in so far as\nconcerns the connection of religious denominations\nwith Indian Schools, to exercise strict impartiality,\nbut has to deal with the work as a whole, and not\nwith respect to any particular district; and so\njudged if any appearance of discrimination exist\nit is not against the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nIf the English Church has apparently been fa-\nvoured with respect to Boarding Schools in Treaty\nNo. 7 it is simply the result of that Church having\nselected\nselected that somewhat discouraging field for special effort in that direction, and having invested its own funds when others remained supine. His Lordship the Bishop of the Diocese expressed a desire that if the amount of increased assistance to their work as a whole must be limited, it should be applied in other directions. Provision has accordingly been made to establish a Boarding School at Ermineskin's Reserve in the Hobbema Agency.\n\nProvision has also been made, despite strong protests from the Protestants, for the establishment of a Boarding School at Rat Portage, as also to extend the operations of existing Industrial and Boarding Schools conducted under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church in Manitoba and the North West Territories, and more particularly in British Columbia.\n\nThis matter was thoroughly gone into during the Rev. Father Lacombe's recent visit to the capital.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nDept Indian Affairs,\nAugust 19th, 1896.\nSt. John's Mission, Blackfoot Reserve,\nGleichen, 2nd January 1899\n\nMy dear Lord Bishop,\n\nThe Indian Agent (Wheatley) informed me today that the R.Cs intend to build a Boarding School, Church & Residence at the South Camp at once. Of course one cannot object to their extending their work and buildings on the Reserve, but I feel we have good reason for objecting to their putting them up within a mile of our Boys' Home. We can also, I think, question their right to a Government grant for a Boarding School. My reasons for saying so are as follows:\n\n1. When our Boys' Home was arranged for, the Government told us that we should be obliged to keep at least two miles away from the R.C. Mission, which we did.\n\n2. The Romans commenced their Mission here the same day that we did, namely in October 1883. That is to say that they did no regular work here prior to that date. For some few years previously they paid visits to the Blackfoot and baptized children. In this work they were assisted by the Interpreter Le H\u00e9roux, who refused to register any child on the Census list without a certificate of baptism from the Roman priest.\n\n3. It is now therefore over 15 years since they professed to be in residence here, and they have not until now endeavoured to do anything towards civilizing them and giving them Christian instruction. It was with great difficulty, as I well remember, that they were made to open a Day School even. It was only when they were told that if they did not do so at once, the Church of England would do so, that they finally yielded, and commenced work by putting in a Frenchman to teach English which he could hardly speak himself.\n\n4. The present Boys' Home was erected by us at the urgent request of the South Camp Chiefs. The request was made in public by the Chiefs to the Hon. T. Mayne Daly, and the site was chosen by themselves. The fact was duly reported to the Department by the Agent (Mr Begg) and sanctioned.\n5. The present site is in what is known as White Eagle's camp, and the proposed R.C. site is in the same camp, and within less than a mile of our School.\n\n6. The Indians, I understand, do not wish another School there. Every Chief except Iron Shield is against it, I am told.\n\n7. Our present Schools are by no means full, and the Agent says he is unable to obtain more children, though the parents express themselves as fully satisfied with the Homes and the management.\n\n8. The Romanists have by their own showing in the Government Blue book, been unable to obtain children from the Blackfoot Reserve for their High River School since 1893. What better success do they look for on this new venture?\n\nI submit that they have no right to erect a Boarding School nearer than the present Mission house. I also submit that under the above mentioned circumstances they have no right to look for a Government grant.\n\nI am writing this in the hope that your Lordship will take such steps as will secure a proper representation of the facts, and prevent if possible the erection of another Boarding school; but if not, that they will be made to build on the other side of their present Mission house.\n\nIan, my dear Lord Bishop,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S.

I should like to know from you whether the school referred to by Mr. Stocken is the proposed school at Crowfoot on the Blackfoot reserve for which an item is inserted in the estimates received from your office. This item is, I understand, in the nature of a re-vote of an amount previously appropriated, and which by an arrangement made by your predecessor was used for another school.\n\nI should like to have your views as to the grounds upon which Mr. Stocken bases his objection to the proposed school at South Camp, and if that proposed school be identical with the proposed school at Crowfoot for which provision is made. I should be pleased to have a full statement from you as to how far the Department is committed to the school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(SD) Clifford Sifton.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 12th ultimo, enclosing copy of a note from the Bishop of Saskatchewan and Calgary covering a communication from the Reverend Mr. Stocken respecting the proposed Roman Catholic Boarding School at South Camp on the Blackfoot Reserve, I forward you a map of the said Reserve showing the sites of the respective schools and the positions of the leading Indian Camps. You will observe that Old Sun's settlement is locally called the \"North Camp\", and the settlements of the other former Head Blackfoot Chief, Crowfoot, and of his subordinate Chiefs, are locally called the \"South Camp\", or Lower Reserve, because farther down the Bow River. The names are not appropriate, because what is called the \"South Camp\" is rather east than south of Old Sun's settlement.\n\nThe school referred to by Mr. Stocken is therefore the proposed school, for which an item is inserted in the estimates from this office, giving the location at Crowfoot, where the Roman Catholic Day School is now situated. The item, as you remark, is in the nature of a re-vote of an amount previously appropriated, and which was used for other schools. The\n\nThe Honourable\n\nThe Supt. Gen'l of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa.\nsite \"Crowfoot\" appears to have been connected with the item because on Nov. 18, 1895 the Bishop of St. Albert, named \"Blackfoot Crossing\" (near which Crowfoot Day School is located) in strongly supporting the then Father Legal's application for a grant towards the erection of a Boarding School on the Blackfoot Reserve. Now, as I understand from our Agent on the Reserve, Mr. Wheatley, the Roman Catholic Authorities wish to build the proposed new Boarding School at the place marked in pencil on the accompanying map \"Proposed site\", which is a little south-west of the mouth of White Mud Creek. No application has been made to me to sanction this site, which as you will see by the note at the bottom of the map is only one mile and twenty-five chains from the C.E. Boarding School or White Eagle's reserve. At first view, therefore, Rev. Mr. Stocker has good ground for objecting to the erection of the R.C. Boarding School so near the White Eagle C.E. Boarding School built in 1894.\n\nBut to do the Roman Catholics justice we must look back to the correspondence of 1893, when it was decided to establish a C.E. Boarding School at the so-called South Camp. Father Doucet strongly opposed the placing of the C.E. Boarding School within four miles of the R.C. Day School, now called Crowfoot. In this he was ardently supported by Father Lacombe. Their protests, however, were over-ruled, and the C.E. School was built two miles and thirty-one chains, by the trail, from the Roman Catholic Mission and School. In reply to Rev. Father Lacombe on the 15th Dec. 1893, Mr. Magnus Begg, the then Indian Agent on the Reserve, wrote:\n\n\"It has been pointed out to the Rev. Father Doucet for several years past, that, if the Roman Catholic Church did not build a boarding school at the Lower Reserve, it was very probable that one would be built under the auspices of the Church of England, and that in locating the site it was chosen where it would least interfere with the work of\n\nFather\n\"Father Douset; that they have Running Rabbit's, Rabbit\nCarrier's, Weasel Calf's, and Medicine Shield's villages to\nwork on, and at either Running Rabbit's or Weasel Calf's\nvillage there is a splendid opening for a boarding school,\nand that if they applied for a similar grant to that given\nto Rev. Mr. Tims, they would no doubt receive it.\"\n\nThis reply of Mr. Ross was fully approved by the\nDepartment on the 29th. of the same month, remarking in\nconclusion \"there is ample room for both schools on the Reserve\nas well as others in the near future.\"\n\nActing, I presume, on this encouragement Father Legal,\non Sept. 13, 1895, applied to my predecessor for a grant to\nerect a boarding school on the Blackfoot Reserve, enclosing\nplans. On the 18th Nov. of the same year as already stated,\nthe Bishop of St. Albert supported Father Legal's application,\nnaming Blackfoot Crossing. The reply was that nothing could\nbe done that year. On Oct. 22, '96, Father Leduc applied for\naid to erect a boarding school on Blackfoot Reserve, and in\nresponse an item of $2250 was placed in the estimates of\n1897-98 for R.C. Boarding School at Crowfoot; as well as\n$72.00 per capita for 20 pupils, and this sum not having been\nexpended on said proposed school, another item of $2500 was\nplaced in the estimates of 1898-99, as also $72.00 per capita\nfor 10 pupils. The grant was expended elsewhere, and\nthough I do not see in the correspondence any promise that\nthe item would re-appear in the estimates of 1899-1900, it seems\nto me the Department is fairly committed to the school.\n\nAs regards the site, the estimates point out Crowfoot,\nbut the R.C. clergy who knew the reserve best did not name\nCrowfoot as the proposed site. Our present Agent on the\nReserve, Mr. J.M. Wheatley, writing to me on the 23rd ultimo, says -\n\n\"The present R.C. Day School and Mission site, is not\nat all suitable for a Boarding School, as there is no available\nland.\"\n\"land near as it is between the Farm buildings and Running Rabbit's village. The chief reason is no water, at present the water is hauled to them from the river a mile away. To get a water supply at the present site a well would have to be sunk over 30 feet and that would require a wind-mill to bring the water up. At the proposed site, water can be easily obtained, as it is not very much higher than the river level.\"\n\nOf course it seems too near the C.E. School on White Eagle's reserve, but when we remember that Roman Catholics in 1893 were told by the Department in reply to their protest against placing the C.E. Boarding School within four miles of the R.C. Day School, that at either Running Rabbit's or Weazel Calf's Village there is a splendid opening for a boarding school, and that, if they applied for a similar grant to that given to Rev. Mr. Tims, they would no doubt receive it, they can scarcely be called very aggressive in seeking to build their boarding school at White Mud Creek, which is apparently the boundary between Running Rabbit's and White Eagle's Villages. I, however, think they ought certainly to keep some distance on the east side of the Creek if water is conveniently procurable. But I have not yet been approached on the subject by the R.C. Authorities, and would not have known of the new dispute, except for Rev. Mr. Stocken's letter forwarded by you, which I return, but retain a copy thereof.\n\nIf the item is retained in the estimates, it seems to me that the word \"Crowfoot\" ought to be struck out and \"Lower Blackfoot Reserve\" substituted therefor, leaving the exact site to be agreed upon between the Department and the R.C. Authorities.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, 24th February, 1899.\n\nMy Lord Bishop,\n\nAdverting to your Lordship's note of the 6th which I acknowledged on the 12th ultimo, and to the communication enclosed therein addressed to you on the 2nd instant by the Reverend Mr. Stocken on the subject of the site of the proposed boarding school to be conducted under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church upon the Blackfoot reserve, I have to say that I have now before me a very full report from the Indian Commissioner at Winnipeg, who has been in communication with Mr. Wheatley on the subject. That report calls attention to the fact that in 1897 when it was decided to establish a Church of England boarding school at what is called South Camp very strong opposition was urged by the Roman Catholic Church authorities to the establishment of such a school at that point on the ground that it was within four miles of one of their day schools. This opposition was overruled.\n\nAnd\n\nHis Lordship\nThe Bishop of Calgary & Saskatchewan,\nBishop's Court,\nCalgary, Alta.\nand the Church of England school erected at between two and three miles by trail from the Roman Catholic school and mission. Moreover, when the opposition was overruled it was pointed out in a letter written by the then Agent, Mr. Teag, on the 10th December 1893, to a representative of the Roman Catholic authorities that \"either at Burning Patches or Nezul Gull's village there is a splendid open up for a boarding school\" and that \"if they applied for a grant similar to that given to the Reverend Mr. Tims they would no doubt receive it.\" And the Department at the time fully and officially endorsed this action of its Agent.\n\nYour lordship will, therefore, see that the Department was long ago committed to acquiescence in the establishment of a Roman Catholic boarding school upon the reserve in the vicinity of the locality which according to the Rev. Mr. Stocken the Roman Catholics have selected. At the same time, however, the Department is prepared to go so far as it possibly can in arranging the matter of the selection of a site of any school which may be provided for on the reserve, as to guard against any possible friction with the Church of England boarding school; and the Indian Commissioner is being instructed\nto that end. I am sure that Mr. Laird may count upon the cooperation of the representative of your Church on the reserve in effecting an amicable arrangement.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYour Lordship's obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, 24th February, 1869.\n\nSir,\n\nI have read your report of the 13th instant respecting the objection raised by the Rev. Mr. Stocken to the establishment at South Camp on the Blackfoot reserve of the proposed Roman Catholic boarding school. I quite agree with your view as to the effect of the previous action of the Department as well as with the view that the Department is fairly committed to the school. I am, therefore, having the same provision made in the estimates this year as was made last year, namely $2,500 for a building for the school and $7.20 per capita contribution for ten pupils. When the provision is made it will be time enough to come to an agreement as to a site; and I am sure you will be able to arrange the matter satisfactorily between the Churches.\n\nI am,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHon.

You say the money is available at this present time and appropriations. Mr. Maclean suggests an item for the Estimates of next year covering the same thing. This can now be paid this year as he has done in his message. In the item in last year's Estimates please find the statement of the matter.\n\nS. M. S.\nMemorandum for the Secretary.\n\nThere is an item in the current year's Estimates for $2500.00 for building a new Roman Catholic Boarding School on the Blackfoot Reserve. We have provided for a re-vote of such amount in next year's Estimates, by the order of the Superintendent General, with the addition of the words \"on the lower Blackfoot Reserve\". Taking it for granted that our full contribution toward this school is to be $2500.00 we may spend a portion of our grant for this year, and a portion for next year, aggregating that amount. Or we may spend the full amount from either Appropriation. I see no objection to authorizing the Commissioner to proceed with the work, following the ordinary course in such matters. The location of the School building is of course a matter of importance and he should assure himself that the site is advantageous in every way before allowing the building to proceed. It is usual in the case of these building grants to Boarding Schools to allow the Church authorities interested to make the plans.\n\nMay 13th, 1869.\n\n[Signature]\n\n15/5/1947\nOttawa, 17th May, 1886.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your telegram of the 9th instant, which reads as follows:\u2014 \"Has two thousand five hundred dollar vote for Roman Catholic School at South Blackfoot Reserve for current year been expended? If not can I authorize expenditure if built near Blackfoot Crossing?\" I beg to inform you, by direction of the Deputy Superintendent General that no amounts can be paid out of this year's Vote unless work has been performed. A proportion can be paid if part of the work is under way \u2014 The balance to be paid next year when the work is completed. The whole expenditure must not exceed two thousand five hundred dollars.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Hon. D. Laird,\nSecretary.\n\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nThe Superintendent General\n\nIndian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the permission of my Bishop to address you direct in reference to his communication with you as to our Boarding School work at the South Camp on this Blackfoot Reserve. The correspondence by my letter to His Lordship on the 2nd January last.\n\nFrom your last letter to the Bishop it appears that the Department has already pledged itself to a Boarding School for the Roman Catholics on this Reserve. I cannot find however that any such promise was made or implied to them prior to 1897. Possibly it is of a more recent date.\n\nUpon looking carefully into the correspondence I find that Archdeacon Tims made every effort to prevent any conflict between ourselves and the Roman Church, and even suggested that the South Home should be put up nearer to the Agency, or at the Ferry. The Indians themselves chose the present site, and as it was in another village than that in which the Romans had their Day school, we agreed to put it there. Every effort has been made to prevent any interference with the attendance at that school.\n\nI desire to emphasize the statements contained in my letter to the Bishop, which he forwarded to you, and which I think should be of some weight with the Department in determining their action in this matter.\nAs I understand that the proposed new School is not to be erected in White Eagle's camp but in Running Rabbit's on the site of the present Crowfoot day school, I cannot object to the location\u2014though I still feel very strongly that the Romans have, for the reasons mentioned in my letter of the 2nd January last above referred to, forfeited any claim to public money in support of their project.\n\nI have now to call the attention of the Department and to ask for its assistance in reference to the proposed erection of a Roman Catholic Mission house on a piece of land adjoining my Mission at the North camp. From two circulars issued by the Department I gather that it expects to be informed by any Denomination desirous of opening up their work on these Reserves, and that permission to erect buildings be applied for. I do not know if this has been done in this case, but I am wish to protest against this present proposal, and to ask the Department to take such steps as are in its power to prevent this needless friction.\n\nI sincerely regret having to report this matter, but the present R.C. priest seems more anxious to create disturbance than to work for the general uplifting of these poor people. We have the nucleus of an earnest Christian congregation here, consisting of about 30 adults & several children of over ten years of age. We have also 19 Communicants and others are being prepared. We have a Church congregation of about sixty at this North camp Mission, and about forty at the South camp. So far I do not know that the Romans have any. I am told that even the ex-pupils of the High River School attend the heathen dances and hold\nto the old life. It is not unnatural therefore that we should be anxious that the peace and harmony which at present prevails should not be disturbed. I am thankful to be able to report that all our christians are endeavouring to carry out the wishes of the Department in the direction of self support, and in addition to comfortable homes have taken cattle and have farmed good sized fields, besides working out in order to earn money.\n\nI shall be most happy to send you any fuller information that you may desire, meanwhile I beg respectfully to submit what I have written for your careful consideration,\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours obediently,\n\nH.W.

Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th instant protesting against the establishment of a Roman Catholic Boarding School at the South Camp of the Blackfoot Reserve; and in reply I beg to say that the matter was fully dealt with by the Superintendent General in a letter addressed to His Lordship, the Bishop of Saskatchewan and Calgary in a letter of the 24th Feb. last to which you refer.\n\nI also beg to state that there is no correspondence on file in regard to the proposed erection of a Roman Catholic Mission House on land adjoining your Mission at the North Camp.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

Sefton,\nMinister of the Int. & Sup't of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa.\n\nHonorable & Dear Sir,\n\nBy a letter written from Ottawa to the Honor Indian Commissioner, a copy of which he kindly forwarded to me, I am informed that, out of this year's vote of $2,500 for a Cath. Boarding School, to be built at Blackfoot Crossing, a proportion will be paid, if part of the work is under way, and the balance will be available during the next fiscal year.\n\nAllow me to state that in account of a mistake, I have been unable to get the authority to start the work any sooner. About two months ago, when it was the proper time to begin, I wrote to ask this authority, but I was told that the money had been spent. Although I knew that not a cent of it had been expended, it took all this time to remove the mistake. Now although I am thankful that the part of the amount not expended this year will be available for next year, yet I am afraid that, on account of the delay to spend the money, there should be no appropriation made in the Votes for next year.\n\nLet me state that the Blackfoot Reserve is one of the largest...\nEv\u00each\u00e9 de Saint-Albert\n\nAlberta, T. N.-O. (Canada)\n\nAlberta\n\nTarget Revenue of the North-West, and that we cannot build a Boarding School there for less than 50 or 60 pupils. The sum of $2,500 is still certainly from insufficient to erect a suitable building. Consequently I most respectfully request that some appropriation be made also for that purpose in the next year's vote, as, at first, it was proposed to do.\n\nI so much more urge the request that the sum of $750 be voted for the maintenance of 10 pupils in that school, this year, could not be expended.\n\nI take the liberty also to remind you that for next fiscal year, not less than 50 or 40 pupils should be provided for in the vote.\n\nHoping that all these shall be promptly and satisfactorily settled,\n\nI have the honour to remain,\n\nHonorable dear Sir,\n\nYour very respectful obedient servant\n\n+ Emile J.

Sir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 30th ultimo, in reference to the grant for the establishment of a boarding school by Your Church on the Blackfoot Reserve; and in reply I beg to say that the sum of $1000 voted as a contribution for this purpose, and which has been confirmed, is included in the estimates for next year to be re-voted.\n\nThe Department is aware that this amount will not cover the full cost of such a building as you propose to erect, nor is it the practice of the Department to pay all expenses in connection with the erection of boarding schools, which are looked upon as missionary undertakings.\n\nI regret to say that the Department cannot comply with your request to have the per capita grant voted for this year increased in next year's estimates as 10 pupils are all that can be provided for. After the school is in operation the question of increasing the provision might be considered.\n\nI have the honor to be, Rt. Rev. Sir,\nYour most obedient servant\n\nHis Lordship,\nThe Bishop of Regina & Co-adjutor Bishop of St Albert\n\nJ.D.

There are only 10 authorized which is much too small a number for this large reserve - as to the actual cost of the buildings there it is as follows:\n\nAmount of Vouchers sent to the Ind. Dept. $2579.37\n\" paid by me $811.94\n\" still due on the buildings $1205.11\n\nAnd we will have to buy what is necessary to furnish the house.\n\nRespectfully submitted to the consideration of the General Dept. of Indian Affairs.\n\n(Sgd) + Emile J. Legal\nBishop of Regina.\nOTTAWA, 7th December, 1899\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nMemo re application of the R.C. Bishop of St Albert for a further grant of $1200.00 for buildings and $2160.00 for 30 additional pupils for the new boarding school at Blackfoot Crossing (Crowfoot).\n\nThe Estimates for the current year contain an amount of $2500.00 for buildings and $720.00 for the maintenance of ten pupils. When it was first proposed to assist this school, provision was made for 20 pupils at $72.00, which was reduced this year when the grant for buildings was being revised.\n\nHis Lordship is quite correct in stating that ten pupils are a very small number to start a school with. This year's census, however, shows that out of a school population of 148 on the South Reserve there are only 28 Roman Catholics, 36 Anglicans and 97 pagans, and if the Department is disposed to provide for more pupils, I suppose the pagan children would be drafted into the school.\n\nHis Lordship shows that they have spent $2036.42 over the amount granted for buildings, $1205.11 of which is still owing by him, and he asks for $1200.00 to wipe out this indebtedness, which would make the Department's contribution amount to $3700.00 out of a total expenditure of $4636.42.\n\nThis is a much larger percentage than the Department is usually called upon to contribute.\n\nHowever, as the buildings are erected, it might be well to give the assistance asked for, as equipment will have to be provided by the school.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Date]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nIndian Agent's Office,\nGleichen, Alta.\n27th Jan 1900.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to report for your information that the new Roman Catholic Boarding School was formally opened on the 25th instant by His Lordship Bishop Legal, the Rev.

There was a large gathering of Indians with the Indian Agent and several employees of the Reserve. Everything went on very satisfactorily. I found already five children admitted and there were applications made for the admission of eight more pupils; five of them must have been brought today, so that the full number of 10 is completed, and we are obliged to postpone the admission of others.\n\nAs I have stated already, 10 is much too small a number for so large a reserve, and I would ask you to recommend that, at least, 30 pupils be authorized, until the end of the present fiscal year; and 40 for next year, after the 1st. of July. There is a good opportunity of doing so, at the coming Session of Parliament.\n\nI\nI feel sure that there shall be not much difficulty in securing 30 pupils and it would be very unsatisfactory, were we obliged to refuse children, whose admission is consented by the parents.\n\nBelieve Me,\n\nHonourable Sir,\n\nYour very obedient servant\n\n(sgd.)

Superintendent of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nHonourable Sir,\n\nI have just paid a visit to the new Boarding School on the Blackfoot Reserve, \"Crowfoot Boarding School,\" which has been in operation only for a couple of weeks, and was formally opened the day before yesterday, on the occasion of my visit. The number of children authorized for this year is only 10, and this number must be completed today. Besides several applications are made for the admission of other pupils, in a short while.\n\nI have already pointed out to the Department that 10 is much too small a number for so large a Reserve, and that it would be very unsatisfactory for us to be obliged to refuse children whose admission is sought or requested by the parents.\n\nIt will be an easy matter at the coming session of Parliament to have greater number of admission authorized. I would recommend that the number of pupils authorized be so till July 1st, and 40 for the next fiscal year. I anticipate that there shall be no great difficulty to complete that number. I am writing on the same subject, to the Indian Commissioner.\n\nI have the honour to remain,\n\nHonourable Sir,\n\nYour very respectful obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nBp. of Pyla\nCoadj. of St. Albert\nOttawa, 14th February, 1900.\n\nMy Lord Bishop,\n\nI have before me Your Lordship's letters of the 27th ultimo, in one of which you acknowledge the receipt of a letter informing you that an arrangement had been arrived at whereby an additional contribution of $1,300 would be made towards the boarding school upon the Blood Reserve and ask that similar further assistance be granted towards the Boarding school on the Blackfoot Reserve. As Your Lordship is aware, the Department had at its disposal funds which enabled it to grant the $1,300 to the Blood Reserve school without having a special appropriation. To meet Your Lordship's wishes as to the school on the Blackfoot Reserve it would be necessary to make provision in the estimates. But as the estimates for next year have been prepared, and the limit of the expenditure for Indian education has been fixed, I am not, I regret to say, free to meet Your Lordship's wishes as to the school on the Blackfoot Reserve.\n\nIn the other letter Your Lordship points\n\nEmile J. Legal, O.M.I.,\nCalgary, Alta.,\nout that the provision which the Department has made for ten pupils at the school upon the Blackfoot Reserve is altogether inadequate.\n\nMr. Laird in transmitting the Agent's report upon the opening of the school had already suggested that the unexpended balance of the grant for the current year be used for the purpose of paying for pupils in addition to the ten already provided for up to the number of twenty-five. This I have agreed to; and I have directed that the same may be done for next year in so far as the general vote will admit. This, of course, must not be understood as strictly binding the Department to provide for more children than have been actually provided for in the estimates, for at this stage it is not possible to make special provision in the estimates for additional pupils, and the number that the Department can pay for, over and above the ten provided for, will be contingent upon the amount available from the general appropriation.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour Lordship's obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOTTAWA, 15th February, 1900\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant with enclosures respecting the new Crowfoot (Roman Catholic) Boarding school and the application made by His Lordship, the Bishop of St Albert for an increase in the number of boarders provided for at this school; and in reply I am directed to say that the unexpended balance of the grant for the current year may be used for the purpose of paying for pupils in addition to the ten already provided for up to the number of twenty-five. The same may be done next year in so far as the general vote will admit and His Lordship has been so advised. He was also informed that this concession must not be understood as strictly binding the Department to provide for more children than have been actually provided for in the estimates, for at this stage it is not possible to make special provision in the estimates for additional pupils, and the number that the Department can pay for, over and above the ten provided, will be contingent upon the amount available from the general appropriation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg\n\nJ.D.

E. about my application made for an additional grant of $1200, to help covering the expenses of buildings at Boarding School, Blackfoot Reserve, which you could not be in a position to grant. Although I would not press too hard, in order to have the sum available this present year yet will say that I am much anxious to have it, at least, in the Estimate of next year. Allow me to point out to you that there shall be a large sum not expended at two of our own institutions. At the Dunbow's Industrial school, there are only about 90 pupils, against 125 authorized, a difference of 30 pupils, at $40 each = $1200 or authorized. At Hoban's Boarding school, about 28 pupils $42 each = $116. So, on two of our own catholic Institutions, there shall be that total not expended & it would be easy to find the $1200 or wanted, out of that sum. I have paid up already more than a $1000 dollar on these buildings, besides all the cost of the furnishing, for which we have not received any assistance.\n\nI am afraid that if that sum is not paid up, inside of a few months, that is about the beginning of next fiscal year, there shall be the interest at 6% added, that will make quite an item. Leaving all this to your Consideration, I remain,\n\nHonourable Sir,\n\nYour very respectful servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 8th March, 1900\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nWith reference to the application of His Lordship the Bishop of Pogla for a grant of $1200.00 to wipe out the indebtedness incurred in building the Blackfoot R.C. boarding school, I beg to say that a similar application was made in December last when His Lordship was informed that he regretted that he was unable to meet His Lordship's wishes in this direction.\n\nIn his last application the Bishop points out that there will be over $6000.00 of unexpended grant to Roman Catholic boarding and industrial schools in the Territories and suggests that the $1200.00 asked for be taken out of this amount.\n\nI do not think from the Minister's letter above referred to that it is intended to make any further grant to the R.C.

Mr Agent Wheatley states that there are a number of sick children whose health prohibited them from entering the boarding school and it is to provide for such cases that this grant is asked.\n\nThe tuition grant is usually allowed for pupils who are really boarders at the school but being in excess of the no provided for cannot draw the full grant.

C.J. Denis, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nCrowfoot Boarding School,\nGleichen, Alta.\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 6th instant, allow me to say that my communication of the 28th of August was only intended to attract the attention of the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs to a letter written as far back as the 18th of June. I know that the Honourable Superintendent General has been in Ottawa several times since then, and I regret that my letter has not been communicated to him before this.\n\nIt was to him personally that I wanted the communication to be made, rather than to the Deputy Minister; because I always found that by calling the personal attention of the Superintendent to an important question, he would not fail to settle it in a satisfactory manner.\n\nI beg of you therefore, that you would be kind enough as to bring the subject of my letter of the 18th of June, to the notice of the Honourable Superintendent as soon as possible.\n\nAnd I have the honour to remain,\n\nDear Sir,\nYour very respectful Servant\n\n+ Emile J. Segal, O.S.B. of Regina\nCoadj. of St. Albert\nWinnipeg, 3rd October, 1900.\n\nMemorandum: Mr. Sifton,\n\nBishop Legal, of St. Albert, writes to the Secretary of the Department of Indian Affairs under date September 24th, with reference to his letter sent to you of the 20th August, regarding the payment of the balance on building of the Crowfoot Boarding School at Blackfoot Crossing, amounting to $1164.55.\n\nThe file has been sent to me here, and I find on looking at it that you wrote him in February last that you were unable to meet his wishes. I have thought that possibly it might be well if you would drop him a note,- his address is Bishop of Pogla, Coadjutor of St. Albert, Bishop's House, St. Albert, N.W.T.,- simply stating that you will take the matter under consideration. He seems to be rather put out that his letter of the 26th June has not been sent to you for your consideration, but it reached you just the same and you sent it to me to deal with. He was, however, given no definite reply as to the matter as I had already written him that the Department could not make grant. I did not care to do anything towards\n\nThe Hon. Clifford Sifton,\n\nBrandon, Man.\nmeeting his wishes after you had written him very clearly last winter that you could not see your way to accede to his request.\n\n(Sd) Jas. A. Smart.\nIndian Agent's Office,\nBlackfoot Indian Agency,\n\nGlenham, Alta., January 11th, 1901.\n\nSir,\n\nI see to inform you that the Rev. Father Dantas, of the Crowfoot Boarding School, has asked for 10 cows-on-loan.\n\nThe object is to gain a liberal supply of milk for the school and a means of educating the pupils to milk, make butter and the care of cattle.\n\nIf you supply the cows, or a less number, the Rev. Father has assured me that no more than 20 animals will at any time be kept, or a less number if you so direct, as there is no intention of starting a ranch.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nHonourable Sir,\n\nI have again to call your attention to the standing debt on the Boarding School built at Blackfoot Crossing.\n\nFrom the included bills you will find it to be:\n\n- Eau Claire & Bow River Co. Lumber - $1083.00\n- W. H. Cushing Doors, sashes etc. - $101.35\n- Peter Collins Bricks - $20.00\n- A. M'Brady & Co. Lime - $11.86\n\nThe Eau Claire Co. has been charging interest for about a year at the rate of 6%, and I am frequently asked by the other firms to settle the amounts.\n\nAs shown in a previous letter dated June 28th, 1900, we have supported heavy expenses in connection with this school that I am absolutely unable to pay the remaining bills.\n\nBesides the expenses of the construction which we have shared in, we have had to support nearly all the expenses connected with the furnishing a maintaining of the Institution, the Department having contributed the per capita.\nthe per capita grant for only a few children, never more than for ten pupils. And from the statement lately sent by Rev. Father J. Daniel, principal of the school, you may gather that we have spent already at least $7030. While we have received only $116.77, leaving a balance of $913.23 entirely supported by us.\n\nIn this condition, the Department will see the necessity of coming to our assistance, and it will easily find its way to do so, as there are several of our own schools (and I refer especially to the St. Joseph's Industrial School, Dunbow) for which provision has been made for a large number of pupils, which, for different reasons too long to explain, is far from being reached. Consequently from the surplus of this school alone the necessary sum of $116.77 could be easily drawn.\n\nThis building of the Boarding school at Blackfoot Crossing is the full property of the Department, and the firms which supplied the materials have a right to a prompt settlement of their accounts.\n\nHoping, Honorable Sir, that you will decide to settle the matter once for all,\n\nI have the honour to remain,\n\nYour very obedient & respectful servant,\n\nEmile J. Legal, Esq.,\nClerk of St. Albert.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 23rd January, 1901.\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nThe accompanying file contains the correspondence referred to by Mr McKenna had with Bishop Legal of St Albert in reference to the balance due on accounts in connection with the building of the Crowfoot Boarding school on the Blackfoot Crossing amounting with interest to $1216.01. I have turned out the documents particularly relating to this matter. You will see that Bishop Legal suggests that this amount could be paid out of the unearned grant provided for the St Joseph's Industrial school, and in this connection I beg to call your attention to the fact that the St Joseph's school is in a bad condition financially as it has at present a deficit of about $2000.00, which Rev. Father Naessens, Principal of the school is asking the Department to meet, on account of the great difficulty found in recruiting to fill vacancies caused by the discharge of pupils who have reached the prescribed age limit, the present enrollment having fallen to 52, while provision is made for 120 pupils at $140.00. Mr Oliver, M.P., has written the Department strongly urging it pay off this deficit and this question is now under consideration. The reason for the falling off in attendance is stated by the Inspector to be due to the\nestablishment of boarding schools on reserves where pupils were formerly recruited for the High River school, the Crowfoot school being one of those referred to. The interests of the boarding and industrial schools clash and unless a better adjustment can be made with the Church authorities conducting these two classes of schools, one or other will have to go to the wall, and it will be a case of \"the survival of the fittest\".\n\nNone of the industrial schools in the Territories can be economically and successfully managed on the per capita grant with less than 100 pupils and unless that number can be secured, the Department will have to assume the cost of maintenance and management or close the school.\n\nI have thought it right to refer to this matter in connection with Bishop Legal's application so that Mr McKenna may see exactly how the matter stands.\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, 28th January, 1901.\n\nThe Secretary /-\n\nBishop Legal is to be informed in reply to his letter of the 14th instant that as the Department has under consideration a proposal to pay off the Deficit of the St Joseph's Industrial School, his Lordship's suggestion that out of the unexpended portion of the per capita grant, the debt of the Crowfoot Boarding School be paid, cannot be entertained.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 31st January, 1901.\n\nMy Lord,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's communication of the 14th instant, transmitting accounts in connection with the building of the Crowfoot boarding school at Blackfoot Crossing amounting, with interest, to $1216.01, and asking, for the reasons stated therein that the Department assume this liability.\n\nIn reply I am directed by the Superintendent General to inform Your Lordship that as the Department has under consideration the proposal to pay off the deficit now existing in connection with the finances of the St Joseph's Industrial school, Your Lordship's suggestion that the debt owing on the Crowfoot boarding school might be paid out of the unexpended portion of the per capita grant provided for the St Joseph's school, cannot be entertained.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour Lordship's most obedient servant,\n\nEmile J.

As only 10 of these are grant earning pupils, the cost of feeding the additional 4 falls on the School. I will be glad if you will authorize the Head Principal to take in 5 more pupils\u2014if they can be got\u2014and allow them to draw the usual grant therefor, or up to 20 pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 6th February, 1901\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nMr Agent Markle reports that the Principal of the Crowfoot boarding school wishes to be authorized to draw the usual grant for 20 pupils, 10 being the number now provided for in the estimates, and no increase made for next year.\n\nIn a letter on No. 1 of this file, from the Superintendent General to Bishop Legal, the Minister agreed to pay the grant up to the number of 25, for this year of the General Vote would admit of its being done. As it is impossible to say how the General Vote will stand until the 30th June next, no additional payments could be made at present without express authority to that effect.\n\nThe last return shows that they have an enrollment of 14 new at the school, and Agent Markle states that 6 more pupils can be obtained if authorized.\n\nThe Minister's letter above referred to is turned out on the file herewith.\n\nI also wish to call your attention to a communication from Agent Markle on this file, in which he states that the Principal of the school has asked for the loan of 10 cows for the purposes of furnishing milk for the school and acting as\nobject lesson for dairy instruction.\n\nI should be glad to know what reply to make to the Agent in regard to both the above matters.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartha Brown\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 7th February, 1901\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th ultimo stating that the Rev.

We have paid already a large amount on the construction itself.\n2. We have had to support all the expenses connected with the furnishing of the whole house without any help from the Department.\n3. As the children admitted have been very few only 4 or 5, for several months we have had to provide the larger share in the maintenance of the institution.\n4. Lately, we have admitted some more children, but as the per capita grant is provided for 10 only there is another burden upon us. When the number of children receiving the per capita grant will have increased we will not be obliged, I hope, to come to the Department for special assistance.\n\nAs to the St. Joseph's Industrial School, I find after inquiry, that there is a deficit of $2000.00, and of course I hope that the inspection will show that there was...\nNo extravagant expenses made, and that the Department will be willing to pay off the deficit.\n\nYet there will be a large balance left, more than sufficient to pay the $1216.01 due on the Building at Blackfoot Crossing.\n\nThe number of pupils kept in the School this year will not average 80, while there are 110 authorized, I believe. If there shall be at least 50 children for whom provision has been made, and consequently a balance of at least $4000.00 not expended. After the deficit is paid there will remain a balance of about $2000.00, while $1216.01 only are needed for the debt at Blackfoot Crossing.\n\nI have done what I could to induce Missionaries to practice the strictest economy, and not to run into debts; and I expect that care shall be taken to that effect.\n\nI hope that these explanations shall be laid again before the Department, and that the decision taken as to regard the debt at Blackfoot Crossing, shall be reconsidered, in order to allow the special assistance required to be granted.\n\nI have the honour to remain,\n\nHonourable Sir,\n\nyour very respectful obedient servant\n\n+ Emile J.

Allow me to ask you to use your personal exertions in behalf of my requests. Here are the facts briefly:\n\nWe received $2500 for the construction of this school, and when the school was ready for opening, we have been authorized for ten pupils only, while the school is built for 100, and is fit even in its unfinished condition, to give full accommodation for 50.\n\nWe have received nothing for the fitting and furnishing of said school, and we had to provide all that, besides more than $1500 paid off on the construction.\n\nOf course the children came slowly and there were only four for a long time, so that the assistance received from the Department has been very small indeed; and as a consequence, the institution is already in debt for its maintenance, in spite of all the assistance and help that we have been able to secure from other sources.\n\nBesides there is also a debt on the construction itself, amounting to $216, so that I am fully unable to pay it.\n\nIf we had been authorized, from the beginning, to a\nBlackfoot Crossing March 2nd\n\nTo the Honorable\nThe Superintendent General of Indian Affairs Ottawa\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nI take the liberty of forwarding to you copy of a letter that I have just written to the Hon. Indian Commissioner in order to allow you to be acquainted with the grievances that I am complaining, and the requests that I am making to the Department.\n\nIn fact, the decision will ultimately rest with you, and when writing to Mr. Laird, I wanted only the situation to be made known to him, and his assistance, in the matter, to be secured.\n\nI have found this school financially, in a very precarious condition, and, after all the expenses I have had to undergo for its equipment, I am completely unable to give all the support that would be necessary.\n\nFor these reasons, I beg to insist again, besides the two points mentioned in the letter, that the Department would consent to pay off the debt of $1216. which is still extant against the construction of such school.\n\nWaiting for a satisfactory answer, I have the honor to remain,\nHonorable Sir,\n\nYour very respectful & obedient servant,\n\n(Signed) Emile J. Legal, P.S. of Pegla\nCounty of St. Albert\nBlackfoot Crossing March 2nd 1901\n\nTo the Honorable David Laird,\nIndian Commissioner Winnipeg, Man.\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nI am writing to you from Blackfoot Crossing and it is only natural that I should dwell on the present condition of the Boarding School there established.\n\nAllow me to say that I have been painfully impressed at the difficulties under which the Institution has been labouring from the beginning. Last year, I had succeeded to obtain that the number of pupils authorized be increased from ten to twenty or even twenty-five, if I am not mistaken; but, for some reason that I am unable to suspect, the number has been again reduced to ten.\n\nIt is generally supposed that the Department wishes to have the greatest number of Indian children educated. What could prevent them to authorize the admission of all the children that there is some hope of recruiting?\n\nThe consequence of having such a limited number of pupils authorized is that the Institution cannot possibly meet the heavy charges entailed by its management, even with the assistance received from other quarters.\n\nWe have been obliged to accept some more pupils for fear of losing them altogether, but it must be acknowledged that there is very little encouragement to take children who will be left entirely to our own charge, without the usual help from the Department.\n\nThere are five (5) such pupils accepted so far, and, with a little more exertions, the number of twenty could have been reached. Is it not reasonable that these five pupils should be authorized, by submitting\nTo the Honourable\nThe Superintendent of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nHonourable Sir,\n\nThe Indian Commissioner informs me, by a letter of the 8th inst., that after he had recommended, both for the present and the next fiscal year, to authorize the admission of 20 Boarders for the Crowfoot Boarding School, on the Blackfoot Reserve, this number has been reduced in Ottawa to 10. And he does not find open for him to make any further effort in that direction.\n\nNow I must inform you that the number of ten pupils has been reached a long time hence, that we have had for many months fifteen boarders in that Crowfoot School, and that we could have raised more, if not for the imposibility of maintaining them.\n\nIn consequence I strongly request that the number of admissions for this school be raised at least to 30 pupils; because I consider it as a wrong done to us to authorize only 10 admissions for our school, on so large a Reserve, where we are in possession of the Anglican Mission which is authorized to the grant for 40 pupils: 20 boys & 20 girls.\n\nHoping that so just a request will not meet with any difficulty, I have the honour to remain,\n\nYour very respectful obedient servant,\n+ Emile J Legal\nOfficer, Body of School\nHouse of Commons\n\nOttawa, 12th March, 1901.\n\nJas. A. Smart, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. Gen. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose a letter from His Lordship Bishop Legal of St. Albert to myself accompanying a letter to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, in which His Lordship asks that the indebtedness of $1,216.00 now standing against the boarding school building on the reserve be assumed by the Department so that the school may be placed on a sound financial footing.\n\nKindly give this matter your most favorable consideration, and reply for transmission.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nENC. CHOOOLS.\n\nMAR 23 1901.\nSCHOOLS,\n\nOTTAWA, 12th April, 1901.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 12th ultimo enclosing a communication from His Lordship, the Bishop of St Albert, covering a copy of a letter addressed by His Lordship to the Indian Commissioner in reference to the indebtedness now standing against the Crowfoot (Roman Catholic) boarding school building on the Blackfoot Reserve, amounting to $1216.00, which he wishes the Department to assume, I beg to say that as the Department has under consideration the proposal to pay off the deficit now existing in connection with the finances of the St Joseph's Industrial school, His Lordship's application cannot be entertained, and he has been so informed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Oliver, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOTTAWA,\n\nJ.D. McLean\nSecretary\nOttawa, 13th March, 1901.\n\nMy Lord Bishop /-\n\nI have your note of the 2nd instant enclosing a copy of a communication addressed to the Indian Commissioner upon that date. The communication to the Commissioner rather surprised me because I remembered that in a letter to Your Lordship (of the 14th February 1900) I had stated that I had agreed to the suggestion Mr Laird had made in transmitting the report on the school on the Blackfoot Reserve which was to the effect that the unexpended balance of the grant for the then current year might be used for the purpose of paying for pupils in addition to the ten provided for up to the number of 25, and I went further and then directed that the same might be done for the present year so far as the general vote would admit. The officer in charge of the school branch explains that until the last quarter the return for the school had not covered even the ten provided\n\nHis Lordship Bishop Legal,\nSt Albert\nAlberta.\nHis Lordship Bishop Legal,\n\nfor, and that there was no occasion for acting upon the authority to pay for pupils in excess.\n\nI will give instructions which will make it clear that available money will be used for the payment at the per capita rate up to 25 pupils, as intimated in the letter to which I have already referred.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) Clifford Sifton.\nSCHOOLS.\n\nAPRIL 1901\n\nTo the Honorable Chief Officer,\n\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa,\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nI have the honor to convey your kind regards, and to express my satisfaction in having received your letter of the 12th instant, in which you state that you have been informed by the Honorable Secretary of State for Canada, that the Boarding School at Blackfoot River will be closed for the present season.\n\nI am happy to say that by calling your attention to this subject, I can feel assured of reaching a decision.\n\nI have the honor to remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Seal]\nI am about $1200 dollars; it is higher now, on account of the accrued interest; yet I would ask only for the sum of $1200 dollars, and I would take the responsibility of paying off all what is due.\n\nBesides, I am informed that there is a sum of $400 is voted for the current fiscal year, to put up hot air furnace at said school. I would consent that these $400 be made part of the $1200 that I am asking, postponing till next year, all improvements to the school although some are sorely wanted. There would be only $800 then to be added to make up the sum.\n\nI hope Honorable Sir, that you will see your way clear to grant my request. Allow me to remind you that this school has had only a few pupils; that we secured the grant only for ten pupils even after more were accepted, and consequently we had to assume a heavy part of the burden, to maintain the school at all.\n\nEven after your ruling that we could accept pupils up to 25, the Rev. Father in charge, writes me that he experiences much difficulty in getting the grant for pupils admitted above the 10 authorized. But I suppose, and I tell him so, that there must be only some delay as I cannot believe that there could be any difficulty on that respect, after you have given your renewed decision.\n\nSo what I ask is? That the $400 is voted for hot air furnace apparatus, be made to cover part of the debt & that a sum of $800 be added to it from the unexpected grant for Indian schools; and with these $1200 I take the engagement to pay off the debt on this building, postponing till next year, all improvements wanted.\n\nI have the honour to remain, Honorable Sir,\n\nYour very respectful obedient servant:\n\n+ Emile Legay, Bp. of Pegla. Count of St. Albert\n\n[Signature]\n\n1875.\n216440 Bishop's House\nSt. Albert July 24th 1901\n\nTo the Honourable Clifford Letton\nThe Superintendent of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nHonourable Sir,\n\nI have to apologize for occupying too much of your busy time, yet I hope that you will be willing to give to the subject that I want to bring again before you, your personal attention and to settle it satisfactorily.\n\nIn a previous letter, dated 26th January of the present year replying to a communication of mine, in which I had asked the Department to wipe out the debt on the construction of the Blackfoot Boarding School, you pointed out to me that the Department was considering the proposition of paying off the deficit of about $7,200 on the St. Joseph's Industrial School and consequently it was doubtful that there could be any money left to pay also the debt at Blackfoot Crossing.\n\nNow, as you are aware, it has been decided not to pay the deficit at the St. Joseph's Industrial School, but only to lend to said school the sum of only $1,000 refundable in three years.\n\nI come again therefore, and ask that the indebtedness on the Crowfoot Boarding School be paid off by the Department. At this time of the year there are always large sums of money unexpended from the previous vote, and there is a large sum of money, I know, from the Vote concerning the St. Joseph's Industrial School itself, and certainly the payment asked for would be easily secured with your consent.\n\nThe debt, at the time of my previous letter on the subject, was $1216.\nOTTAWA, 25th August, 1901:\n\nMy Lord:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 24th ultimo, renewing your application for the Department to wipe out the debt incurred by the Roman Catholic authorities in the construction of the Crowfoot Boarding school, amounting to $1316.00 with interest, and suggesting that the $400.00 voted for the purchase of a furnace for this school be applied in part payment of this indebtedness and that the Department make up the balance.\n\nIn reply I beg to inform Your Lordship that arrangements have already been made to place a furnace in the school before cold weather sets in and that Your Lordship's letter was received too late to use any expended balance of last year's vote towards wiping out this debt, even if the Department considered itself justified in doing so, which it does not, as it has already contributed more than its share towards the erection of this building.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour Lordship's most obedient servant\n\nS. STEWART\nAsst. Secretary\n\nHis Lordship,\nBishop Legal,\nSt Albert,\nAlta.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 1st August, 1901:\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nBishop Legal of St Albert writes under date the 24th ultimo renewing his application for the Department to wipe out the debt incurred by the Roman Catholic authorities in the construction of the Crowfoot Boarding school on the Blackfoot Reserve, amounting to $1216.00 with interest. His Lordship states that if he is granted $1200.00 by the Department he will engage to pay off the debt and that he would be willing to take the $400.00 voted for the purchase of a furnace for this school in part payment and postpone the purchase of a furnace until next year, leaving only $800.00 to be made up by the Department, which he asks it to pay out of the unexpended balance of last year's vote.\n\nMr Agent Markle reports under date the 21st ultimo that having been advised by the Commissioner that $400.00 was voted for a furnace, he has already made the purchase and arranged to have the furnace put in the school before the cold weather. This disposes of $400.00 of the $1200.00 asked for by the Bishop and the remaining $800 could not now be had out of last year's balance which has lapsed.\n\nSimilar applications have been received from the Bishop for this purpose within the past two years which have not been complied with, at first being refused point blank. Mr Oliver M.P. then backed up the Bishop's application, when both he and the Bishop were informed that the Department then had under\nunder consideration the proposal to pay off the deficit existing in connection with the St Joseph's Industrial school and that therefore it could not entertain their application.\n\nThe Department has advanced $1000.00 to the St Joseph's school by way of loan and His Lordship claims that as it was not a gift outright his claim for recompense for the building of the Crowfoot school still stands good. This is correct from the Bishop's point of view but the Department has never yet recognized his claim.\n\nThe Department has already contributed $2500.00 towards the buildings of this school, which only cost about $4,500.00 including the $1200.00 now applied for, so that it will be seen that the Department has already paid more than half the total cost of the building.\n\n[Signature]\nDear Sir,\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 29th of Aug. No. 122/784, re. the indebtedness of $1216.00 at Crowfoot Boarding School, allow me to say that I am sorry that the Department has not thought proper to follow my suggestion of allowing the $500.00 voted for hot air furnaces to be used out the indebtedness, while supplying the balance.\n\nThis, of course, I did not ask as an obligation on the part of the Department, but as a favour. Yet I ought to have realized before now that favours go not our way. Consequently, the refusal I cannot consider as a wrong done to us; but I have many other sore wrongs to complain of, and I will be the first to air them in the best way I can, & to try to obtain redress by all means that I will judge best fitted for the purpose.\n\nIt will be an easy matter to show the discrimination practiced by the Church in all its dealings with the Department, and the constant opposition that we experience everywhere. There comes a time when patience and forbearance are no more possible, & besides they are inconsistent with duty.\n\nTo speak only of their refusal of Treaty No. 7, how to explain except on the ground of prejudice and opposition? The difficulty we have experienced to obtain boarding schools while Protestants had been in possession of such schools for\nmany years?... 2) The maintenance of only 10 authorized children for the Crowfoot Boarding school, while the Protestant have authorized for 50 or 60?... 3) The maintenance of only 20 authorized children in the Peigan Boarding school, while we have had as many as 28 admitted? But there is also a Protestant Boarding school there, and it is feared that if we are allowed to take as many children as we willing to come, this would interfere with the means of the other school.... 4) The easy and compulsory discharge from our Industrial school, even before the children are 18 years old, while, in the Protestant Industrial school, young men are allowed to stay after they are 18 years of age.... 5) The easy manner of obtaining the transfer of catholic children from our schools to Protestant institutions, while it is quite impossible to even obtain the transfer of catholic children from Protestant schools to our own catholic schools!... etc., etc.\n\nWhere to find the explanation of all that is not in the prejudice and opposition entertained against our catholic institutions? Yet the secretary of the Indian department has been able to see lately if our institutions can favorably compare with protestant institutions of the same kind.\n\nNow allow me to say that not only I am at liberty to publish all these grievances, but moreover I must consider it my duty to do so.\n\nI have the honour to remain,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEmile J. Legay, Bk of Peigan\n\n[Signature]\n\nCounty of St Albert\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 4th October, 1901\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nBishop Legal writes under date of the 9th ultimo complaining of undue discrimination against the Roman Catholic schools and favoritism towards similar Protestant institutions. His language is interperate and his arguments are no better than the juror who on being asked why the jury he served on did not arrive at a verdict, replied that \"eleven more prejudiced men he never met\".\n\nAlthough all the matters referred to in the Bishop's letter have been dealt with time and again I shall have to go over the ground again so that you may have a just conception of how they stand.\n\nFirst he complains that his suggestion to utilize the sum of $400.00 voted for hot air furnaces for the Crowfoot boarding school impartially wiping out the indebtedness on the buildings, was not followed, losing sight of the fact that this amount was placed in the estimates for a specific and much needed purpose and could not be applied in the manner he wishes.\n\nHe says that it will be an easy matter to show discrimination practised against his Church in all its dealings with the Department, and the constant opposition they experience. This statement is wholly incorrect as you will see. There are at present four boarding schools in the Province of Manitoba with\nwith a total provision for..................155 pupils\nOf these the two Roman Catholic schools\nhave provision for..........................85 pupils\nand the two Protestant schools have........70 pupils\n\nIn the North West Territories there are\n29 boarding schools with a total provision for 1005 pupils\n15 of these schools are Roman Catholic institutions with provision for.............577 pupils\nthe remaining 14 Protestant schools having provision for.........................428 pupils\n\nFour industrial schools are carried on in Manitoba with a total provision for...........430 pupils\nOf these one is Roman Catholic with provision for ..................................110 pupils\none is Methodist with .......................100 \"\nand two Government schools with..............220 \"\nwhich cannot properly be considered as denominational schools.\n\nIn the North West Territories there are\nsix Industrial schools with provision for..710 pupils\none of these schools in under Government control with provision for..................40 \"\nThe Roman Catholics have provision for.....345 \"\nat two schools, and the three Protestant schools have provision for....................325 \"\n\nThis does not look like undue discrimination against the Roman Catholics.\n\nRegarding the alleged difficulty in obtaining boarding schools in Treaty 7 I may say that the census of this treaty shows the total population to be........................................3633\nProtestants..................................888\nRoman Catholics..............................248\nPagans........................................2497\nThe Roman Catholics are largely in the minority in this Treaty, their adherents being less than one third the number of Protestants. There are 8 boarding schools in this Treaty with provision for...........230 pupils. Of these the Roman Catholics number..........70 and the Protestants......................160.\n\nThe Bishop specially calls attention to the provision for Crowfoot school which he states is only 10. This is the number voted for, but the Minister authorized payment up to 25 pupils, which has been made. This school has not been established two years.\n\nRegarding the Church of England boarding school on the Peigan Reserve I beg to say that this denomination was first in the mission field there and having more adherents would be justly entitled to provision for more pupils than the Roman Catholics.\n\nComplaint is also made of the compulsory discharge of industrial school pupils before they are eighteen years old, while in Protestant schools young men are allowed to stay up to 22 years of age. I know of no such discrimination as the rule for the discharge of all pupils at the age of 18 is applied to all schools equally.\n\nAs to the manner of procuring the transfer of Protestant children to Roman Catholic schools, and vice versa, the Bishop evidently has in mind the case of the Lachapelle children, whom he endeavored to have removed from the Church of England to the Roman Catholic boarding school on the Blood Reserve, the application\napplication having been refused by the Commissioner who was specially authorized to deal with the case.\n\nIf a comparison of the expenditure on Roman Catholic and Protestant institutions were gone into, it would show that the former had received the lion's share.\n\nIn conclusion I beg to submit a comparative statement of the census of Manitoba and the North-West Territories, showing the total population by religions:\n\nManitoba, total population..............6754\nProtestants.........................4488\nRoman Catholics....................997\nPagans.............................1269\n\nNorth-West Territories population.......17714\nProtestants.........................5503\nRoman Catholics....................3192\nPagans.............................5696\nUnknown religions..................3323\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa 27th March, 1903.\n\nI beg to inform you that acting under instructions from the Superintendent General the Department arranged in March last for payment at the per capita rate for pupils up to the number of twenty five at the Roman Catholic Boarding School on the Blackfoot Reserve. Through an oversight you were not advised of this arrangement at the time. Payment has been made, as you are aware, for the full number of pupils in attendance. It is possible, however, to pay up to 25, should that number be admitted. Provision for the additional outlay was not specially made in the Estimates, but the Department will be able to meet the outlay out of the General School Vote.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nThe Hon.

This material is said to have been used in the construction of the Browning Boarding-school and on this ground His Lordship considers that the Department should pay the account. The Department, however, considers that as it has met its agreement with the Church authorities in connection with the direction of the buildings for this school that it should not be called upon to contribute anything further for this purpose. The Department's contribution amounted to $2500.00 for buildings, which is more than half of the cost.\n\nThe usual practice of the Department in regard to assistance to boarding-schools has been to afford assistance to the extent of one-half the initial outlay and furnish funds to provide for the maintenance of the number of pupils agreed upon. There its responsibility ceases. Bishop Legal is well aware of this practice and it is only through persistence that he hopes to change its ruling.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Borden\nOttawa, 11th March, 1862.\n\nMy Lord:-\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 20th ult., inclosing an account amounting with interest to $1219.10 from the \"Eau Claire & Bow River Lumber Company\" for lumber supplied for the erection of the boarding-school at Blackfoot Crossing (Crowfoot).\n\nIn reply I beg to inform Your Lordship that the Department regrets that it cannot grant further aid to the Crowfoot School.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour Lordship's most obedient servant,\n\nFRANK REDLEY\n\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nHis Lordship,\nBishop Emile J. Legal,\nSt. Albert, Alta.\nHonourable Sir,\n\nI beg to respectfully draw your attention upon our situation as it is in the present time. I have found that on July 1st, 1906, this school had already 33 pupils and was paid only for 30. Since then many more children came and, as the grant remained the same, we had to discharge some of the older ones last winter, being not able to keep so many children unpaid for.\n\nHowever, about the same time, I was confidentially told by the Indian Commissioner that provision was being made for 40 pupils instead of 30, and consequently relying upon that promise I kept on receiving all the children presented by their parents. I must hurry to add that after all I could not do otherwise. But the said increase has not been granted and today we are still paid for 30 only; therefore I made a new application for a grant of 45, - I should have put 50 to be on the same footing as old Sun's school, - and I hope that this time my request will be complied with.\n\nBut in the mean time we are running into debt more and more: we have already 42 children and 5 or 6 more are promised for Christmas. The department might object to our harboring children over the number provided for, but I beg to say that to refuse children offered by their parents would be\nthe ruin of our recruiting; the Indians are not equally ready at all times to put their children in school and we must take every chance of profiting from their casual good will.\n\nThen the department might suggest to transfer some of our pupils to Dunbown industrial school; this indeed would relieve us to some extent and in the same time help that institution, but I regret to say that we should have the agreement of the Indians before doing that transfer and unfortunately all our efforts on that matter did not have any result.\n\nTherefore, Honourable Sir, I dare to apply to yourself in our urgent need; could not the Indian Department give us an extra grant even from now for all our pupils, out of the unspent money, viz.: Old Jim's school is paid for $50 and had only $35 on April 17, 1907; St. Joseph's Industrial School has a grant for $120 and had only $70 on the same date.\n\nI feel confident, honourable sir, you will realize our situation and kindly do all in your power to help us.\n\nThinking you by anticipation and begging pardon for all the trouble and wishing you a merry Christmas and a happy new year, I have the honour to be, sir, your faithful and devoted servant,\n\nJ. L. Levern, o.m.c.p.\nOttawa, January 7, 1869.\n\nTo the Deputy Supt. General,\n\nWith reference to the application made by the Rev. Father Levern for an increase in pupilage at the Crowfoot school I beg to say that he is correct in stating that the number now paid for is limited to 30 and the returns received from the school show that last year they had an average enrolment of 34 and last quarter there were 39 on the roll.\n\nThere is nothing on file to show that the Commissioner promised him 40 pupils. Mr. Paget, who visited the school, reports that he found it well conducted and neat and clean in every respect, but the dormitories were too small and without proper ventilation. There were 33 pupils in attendance when he was there, all neatly dressed and looking clean and healthy. Unless additional dormitory accommodation was provided, 30 pupils seems to be the maximum number they can take. There is an attic that might be converted into a dormitory and Mr. Paget recommends that this should be done to relieve the congestion, but he makes no recommendation for increased pupilage, even if additional dormitory space was provided.\n\nThe Commissioner in his last draft estimates makes provision for 40 pupils, but the Departmental estimates leave the number at 30, which is all they can accommodate with due regard to the pupils' health.\nIf Father Levern's application is entertained, more sleeping accommodation would be needed. In fact, from Mr. Paget's report it would appear to be necessary for the number now voted. I think an effort should be made to obtain the consent of the parents to transfer some of the pupils to the St. Joseph's Industrial School, which would relieve the congestion at Crowfoot.\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, March 18, 1908.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of December 16, last, addressed to the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, making an application for an increase in the pupilage of the Crowfoot School, I beg to say that the appropriations available will not permit of any increase at present, and owing to the necessity of curtailing to a great extent the estimates of the ensuing fiscal year it is not found possible to add to the general vote for school purposes.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. J.L. Levern, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nCrowfoot Indian Boarding School,\nGleichen, Alta.\nHonourable Sir,\n\nAllow me to ask you to be kind enough as to look into the matter of the number of pupils receiving government grant at the Crowfoot Catholic Boarding School (Blackfoot Crossing).\n\nApplication was made early in July 1907, to have that number increased from 30 to 40. The official answer came back stating that, after the current year, 40 pupils would receive the grant.\n\nAccordingly over 50 pupils were admitted, but in April 1908, it was declared that the grant could not be paid.\n\nDuring the year, Sept. 1908, Mr. Page, from the Ind. Dept., paid a visit to the school in the course of which he promised that this state of affairs would be soon remedied.\n\nYet a letter of March 18/1907, signed Ed. McCauley, declares that there is no available money for the purpose of paying the grant.\n\nNow, Honourable Sir, you may easily perceive that this is neither fair nor reasonable. As to make up the amount needed, it is plain that it can be easily be made up from other unexpended grants, viz., the surplus of the money voted for the maintenance of pupils at Dunbow Industrial School, whose number is not complete at present.\n\nI hope therefore that this matter will be promptly settled, that the Department will abide by its former promise. I ask only:\n\n1) That the number of pupils authorized be raised from 30 to 50,\nas there are already over 40 pupils admitted, exactly 16, and others have been refused admittance for lack of means to support them; 2) What the grant be paid, at the end of the present fiscal year, for all the pupils maintained during this year.\n\nAnd I will remain, Honourable Sir,\n\nyour very obliged and respectful servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEmile Legel, Bp. of St. Albert.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nBefore dealing with Bishop Legal's application for an increased pupilage grant for the Crowfoot Boarding School on the Blackfoot Reserve, I would like to site a few facts with reference to the Schools.\n\nIt was established in the year 1900. The Department contributed $2500.00 toward the building. From the day of its opening to the 31st. of March 1909 $13,111.00 was spent in per capita grant. From a report received a day or two ago, prepared by the School, it is shown that there are 28 boys and 16 girls in residence, a total of 44. 8 discharged pupils are now living; presumably on the Reserve. 8 pupils have died, 7 died in the school and 1, two months after discharge. This is what we have to show for an expenditure of $15,681.00. The outlook for the remaining pupils in attendance is not very bright and there is very little hope that the graduates of the School will attain to maturity and be able to exercise any civilizing influence. Of 39 pupils examined by Dr. Lafferty 22 are affected with tuberculosis of the lungs. In the face of these facts, how could the Department meet\nthe Bishop's request? The accommodation at the School is inadequate for the number of pupils in residence, and the unhealthy pupils should be discharged. I cannot under the circumstances recommend any increase in pupilage. There is nothing of record in our papers to show that the Indian Commissioner promised 40 pupils, and during Mr. Paget's visit to the School he made no promises of any kind.\n\nChief Accountant.\nOttawa, May 18, 1909.\n\nMr. Scott:\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of the 23rd ultimo, regarding Rev. Bishop Legal's application for increased pupilage for the Crowfoot boarding school, Blackfoot reserve, will you kindly take steps to ascertain what number of pupils this school can reasonably accommodate. It is proposed (of course this is not to be mentioned in your letter) to grant according to accommodation up to 40.\n\nD. S. G. I. A.\nOttawa, May 19th., 1909.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nI hardly think it will be necessary to ask for the information sought in your memorandum of May 18th because we are now in possession of the full facts here. The school has 43 pupils in residence, 27 boys and 16 girls. There is sufficient accommodation for the girls but the boys dormitory is too small. It has been proposed to fit up the attic as a dormitory and allow some of the boys to sleep there. It will cost us about $275.00 to make this alteration and the money is provided in the Estimates; so that if it is thought advisable to pay for 40 pupils, we could carry out the proposed expenditure to give more accommodation and provide the increase in pupilage from the General Vote.\n\nI think it well to quote from Inspr. Markle's last report on this School, as follows:- \"If a greater number of children are accepted into this School than are now enrolled it will be necessary to provide another teacher and a class room too. The class room now in use is not too large for about 24 pupils and, anyway, justice cannot be done to 40 pupils by one teacher. There is an available room for class purposes in the westerly wing. A few more forms,\nblackboard, etc., will be required, however, if a second class room and a second teacher is to be established.*\n\nChief Accountant.\nOttawa, May 27, 1909.\n\nMr. Scott:\n\nEXT.\n\nWith reference to your memorandum herewith of the 19th instant I beg to say that if after the money which has been voted for repairs has been expended on them the accommodation is sufficient for 40 the school authorities may be advised that 40 will be allowed.\n\nD.

Gooderham, Indian Agent, Gleichen,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI dare to ask you to be kind enough to send to the Indian Department this new application for a larger grant, -40 instead of 30,- to be paid from the present quarter. The reasons for this application have been explained several times, viz. my letters of July 12, 1907, Dec. 19, 1907, Nov. 23, 1908, to the Indian Commissioner; Dec. 16, 1908, to the Hon. Frank Oliver, etc., and I believe it is useless to repeat them.\n\nLet it suffice to say it cannot be objected that our school cannot give accommodation for over 50 children; the attic, which could not be used so far because it was not finished, is now completed with the kind assistance of the Department, and we have now plenty of room for 50 children at least.\n\nConsequently I beg to renew my application and I hope that from the first of this month we will be paid for 40 pupils.\n\nBegging pardon for all the trouble and thanking you for the great interest you take in the success of our school, I remain,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.L. Levern, O.M.C., P.M.\nINDIAN AGENTS OFFICE\nBlackfoot Indian Agency, Gleichen, Alberta\nAugust 11th, 1909\n\nIn your reply refer to File/5\nand date of this letter\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to, herewith, enclose a letter from the Rev. Principal of the Crowfoot Boarding School\u2014what he states in his letter is correct\u2014also Dr Bryce, who was here a few days ago informed me unofficially that accommodation and space allowed for 40 pupils.\n\nI would therefore beg to suggest that the grant for this number be allowed for present quarter.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nIndian Agent\nOttawa\nNo. 5\n\nOttawa, August 20, 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th inst., inclosing an application from the Principal of the Crowfoot Boarding School for an increase in pupilage at that institution.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the additional accommodation now provided, the Department will pay for forty pupils at $73.00 per capita from July 1, last, the first of the current quarter.\n\nYou will be good enough to advise the Principal accordingly.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nJ.

Original on file 356400/4.\n\nSchools - The Crowfoot Boarding School is going along in the usual way, everything clean and orderly, and children healthy. They have a change in the teaching staff; the sister - and Irish lady - is now Superior and one of the French sisters is teaching. The little lady is anxious and willing, but I do not consider she is familiar enough with the English language to impart it to the children in a proper way.\nHoly Trinity Mission\n\nCrowfoot Boarding School Cluny, Alberta, May 14th 1911\n\n388334\n\nThe Secretary Department of Indian Affairs,\n\nSir,\n\nI will be very much obliged to you if you will kindly let me know the grant that has been voted for our school for the present fiscal year.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ.

Sir,\n\nIn reply to your communication of the 14th instant I beg to say that the appropriation for the current fiscal year provides for forty pupils at the Crowfoot Boarding School at a per capita grant of $100.00 per annum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. L. Levern, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nCrowfoot Boarding School,\nOlney, Alta.\nFARMERS SHOULD MAKE DEFINITE PROPOSITION\n\nThe question of a produce market and a weekly market day in Pincher Creek was brought up before the council a few weeks ago by E. G. Ambrose and the market and town property committee was instructed by Mayor Dobbie to delve into the matter and bring in a report to the council.\n\nThis committee, through Alderman Harwood, now reports that a building can be secured at a reasonable rental, but the whole question seems to rest just there because the council apparently has no time to consider it.\n\nIt is all very well what we should do next.\n\nObviously, the communication between the farmers in this district have been neglected. We have eggs, etc., bring a visit from the market people who has figuratively spoken to us. This condition of affairs demands a produce market under the council.\n\nThat's about the situation. The council is instructed its market accommodation weekly and then, the council in a concise manner.\n\nWhile there does not appear to be any immediate action, just as soon as the market is opened, the next move will be suggested.\n\nPRACTICAL DEMONSTRATION OF FORCE OF HABIT\n\nBefore the days of the steam engine or the gas engine on the farm, the Canadian agriculturalist had to rely almost entirely upon the horse for power as well as transportation purposes. And the horses used on these primitive machines became so accustomed to their work that they would turn their heads away for hours at a time without requiring even a word from the farmer. Tramping around in a circle became a veritable habit with these animals. Indeed, the story is told of a certain horse whose owner becoming too old for further use, was placed in the paddock and spooked by his remaining days on earth. But so firmly had the force of habit gripped this superannuated animal that he would spend hours tramping around in a circle\u2014just as he had done for years on end. He simply couldn't break away from his old habit.\n\nThe above is an illustration of the force of habit which most of us can easily understand. But there is a similar practical demonstration which should be more speedily attended to by men who are sane and at all progressive.\n\nIn the early days here in the West, especially after the advent of the railway, it was considered impossible to have any kind of a public demonstration or celebration without cowboys and Indians. In fact there was nothing else much in the country. This condition of affairs continued until rapid settlement and the march of civilization and modernism advanced, so the old order of things was forced into the background until today nobody but a tenderfoot thinks about the Indian or the old time blood-and-thunder cowboy. And still, like the old horse referred to, some towns and communities cannot shake off the force of habit.\n\n\"MADE-IN-CANADA\" TRAIN VERY ENCOURAGING TO FARMERS\n\nThere is a \"made-in-Canada\" train going up and down western Canada at the present time which is naturally attracting a great deal of attention. This train is filled exclusively with goods manufactured in Canada. But while it is being described as a splendid advertisement for...\nPRACTICAL DEMONSTRATION OF FORCE OF HABIT\n\nBefore the days of the steam engine or the gas engine on the farms, the Canadian agriculturist had been very almost entirely upon the horse for power as well as transportation purposes. And the horses used on these primitive machines became so accustomed to their work that frequently they would turn a horse-power for hours at a time without requiring even a word from the farmer. Trailing around in a circle became a veritable habit with many of the animals. Indeed, the story is told of a certain \"horse\" becoming too old for further use, was turned loose in the pasture-field to spend his remaining days in ease. But so firmly had the force of habit gripped this superannuated nag that he would spend hours trampling around in a circle\u2014just as he had done for years on the horse-power. He simply couldn't break away from his habitual routine.\n\nThe above is an illustration of the force of habit which most of us can easily understand. But here is a similar practical demonstration which cannot be comprehended by men who are the same and all progressive.\n\nIn the early days here in the West, especially after the advent of the railway, it was considered impossible to have any kind of a public demonstration or celebration without cowboys and Indians. In fact there was nothing else much in the country. This condition of affairs persisted until rapid settlement of the broad prairies began. And as the march of civilization and modernism advanced, so the old order of things was forced into the background until today nobody but a tenderfoot thinks about the Indian or the old time blood-and-thunder cowboy. They still like the old horse referred to, some towns and communities cannot shake off the force of habit.\n\nTake Macleod for instance.\n\nThose people seem to have the idea that the Indian is an absolute necessity in all public celebrations. They cannot get away from the primitive. They have a high priced paid commissioner and there are a bunch of tramps as well. Yet with these modern \"conveniences,\" shall we call them, the Indian and his belongings occupy a position of increasing prominence in that town.\n\nFirst, they wanted an Indian parade, but were partly forced and partly shamed into abandoning that an ignorant idea. Now they have broken out in a new phase\u2014they want to pack the Peigan Indians off, bag and baggage, and squat them down on a portion of the Blood reserve, thus leaving the Peigan reserve available for settlement. That would certainly be a splendid thing\u2014for Macleod. But what about the Peigan Indian? He has prior rights and his claim must be considered first.\n\nIn the first place the Peigan reserve contains less land than the 450 Indians therein are actually entitled to under the treaty of 1887. In the second place, taking the provisions of that same treaty as a basis, there is not sufficient room on the Blood reserve for these Peigans. In the third place, it would be an utter impossibility to put two tribes on one reserve. And again, even Indian educationalists who are prominent in the country will agree with us that the best method of dealing with Indians is to keep them in small groups, the smaller the better.\n\nThese are points on which the Macleod people can easily satisfy themselves if they care to be honest about it. But the welfare of the Indian seems to be no concern of theirs\u2014never was. Macleod has revelled in the remaining traces of savagery, the humiliation and degradation of the Indians for years past, and it is indeed that they parade them on the streets every time they get the least excuse for doing so. Certain Macleod citizens have also obtained considerable wealth through grazing leases obtained on the nearby reserves for next to nothing\u2014and now they brazenly seek the very land itself.\n\nAll this has been going on for years on the square as well. But in all western Canada at the present time Macleod is the only town which persists in clinging to old ideas and fossilized notions about the Indians and nothing in Indian affairs, and particularly their move in that direction is carefully scrutinized by those who believe that even an Indian should be accorded British fair play, and when it comes to a showdown in the matter above referred to Macleod is likely to get a real surprise.\n\nIt might be feasible to have that 1887 treaty amended somewhat so that a small portion of the Peigan reserve could be opened for settlement, say 10 or 20 sections along the south side. That, we think, might be feasible if the Indians were willing. But to open up the whole reserve, never, not while there is an Indian left to claim any of it.\n\n\"MADE-IN-CANADA\" TRAIN VERY ENCOURAGING TO FARMERS\n\nThere is a \"made-in-Canada\" train going up and down western Canada at the present time which is actually attesting a great deal of attention. This train is filled exclusively with goods manufactured in Canada. But while it is being described as a splendid advertisement for the country by the press generally, it really is the biggest hoax that has been perpetrated in this country for some time. The whole scheme is engineered by the Canadian Manufacturers' Association, one of the members of which was sufficiently enough in Toronto the other day to remark that \"this train would do much to rid the western farmer of his low tariff or free trade ideas.\"\n\nIt will, eh?\n\nNow while the western farmer has to pay $8.00 more for a binder than the same machine can be purchased in England or Australia for; not while a Canadian-made wagon costs the western farmer $10.00 more than the American farmer has to pay for the same vehicle; not while the Cockshutt people are selling ploughs to Americans cheaper than to Canadians. Not much.\n\nThe only good feature about this \"Made-in-Canada\" train is the fact that it acts as a sort of thermometer and shows the western farmers just about how badly he has the high tariff people buffaloeed. If the Manufacturers' Association was not seriously alarmed over the growing prestige of the western farmers, with their U.F.A., etc., it would never in the world go to the trouble or expense of fitting out such a train.\n\nYes. Looked at from that standpoint, the \"Made-in-Canada\" train should greatly cheer and encourage the western farmer.\n\nKeep on organizing.\nSir,\n\nFollowing is an extract received from Pere Leverne, Principal of Crowfoot Boarding School, Calgary, Alta.,\n\n\"You will notice also that I wrote \"R.C.I\" instead of Crowfoot School; Crowfoot being the name of a near station and Post Office.

Indian Boarding School\". As there are a number of other Roman Catholic schools in the west, it is necessary to give each one some distinctive name and, as Crowfoot has been in use for some years, it is thought well to adhere to it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

Doucet, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nCrowfoot Boarding School,\nCluny, Alta.\nOttawa, December 11, 1920.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nHonourable Sir James Lougheed,\n\nI beg to send herewith important reports from the Indian Commissioner and Doctor F. A. Corbett, of Regina.\n\nWhen I was in Regina last summer I had an interview with Doctor Corbett, and it was arranged that he should make these inspections. Doctor Corbett is greatly interested in the welfare of the Indians, and his report justifies the inspection.\n\nI regret extremely that it is possible to draw such a comparison between the Protestant and Roman Catholic schools. The Crowfoot, Ermineskin's and St. Albert schools are all conducted by the Roman Catholic Church, and the Old Sun's and Sarcee are conducted by the Church of England. The comparison does not hold good over the whole field, however, as we have excellent Protestant schools in other parts of the country. The Anglican schools in the diocese of Calgary have always unfortunately been badly managed.\n\nThe conditions at the Old Sun's school are disgraceful, and the principal and medical attendant are worthy of serious censure for allowing such health conditions to exist.\n\nAs you are personally aware of the general conditions at the Sarcee reserve, this additional information with reference to the school and the Indians there will be of special interest. If this band is to be saved at all we must take vigorous measures and I would propose to turn the school into a hospital and to treat the whole reserve as a hospital area. These Indians have a large reserve and more of it should be turned into cash as soon as possible and used for their benefit, and the funds we have on hand should be fully used.\n\nIt would be advantageous if Doctor Corbett could continue his inspections and visit all our reserves and schools, but as he has a large practice in Regina, I do not think we could expect him to spend the necessary time in making inspectorial visits.\n\nI should like to discuss these matters with you.\n\nDuncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nCommissioner's Office,\nRegina, Sask., Dec. 5, 1920.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI was particularly pleased at what I saw at the Crowfoot School. The building is large, airy and well lighted. The Dormitories were in excellent shape. The beds clean and comfortable; the classrooms large and well ventilated; and above all, the children looked the very picture of health. They were clean and well clad. There was nothing in the whole Institution, that a person looking for trouble, could find fault with. In fact I can say nothing but praise for the school, for such it deserves.\n\nW. M. Graham,\nCommissioner.\n\nD. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nRegina, December 7, 1920.\n\nTo W. M. Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nHere we find 30 girls and 40 boys housed in a building that is thoroughly up to date and modern in every particular. Though this school is only seven miles from the Old Sun School the contrast is most marked, and exemplifies what may be accomplished with the same people under different school conditions. Here all the pupils are fully up to a high standard of health and appearance. They are plainly well fed and clothed, clean and wholesome, standing erect and soldierly, strong and vigorous and would compare well with the children of any school. Gross evidence of tuberculosis was almost absent. One child in the 70 showing any scrofulous sore on the neck, and that child in good general condition, one side of the neck having been completely healed and the affected side now healing nicely. Another boy is noticed to be somewhat anaemic but examination of his lungs shows no active disease present. Both these children are young and are late arrivals in the school. There is little doubt that they will become quite well under the ordinary treatment of the school. Here any children below par are specially fed with milk and eggs between meals and sleep out on the roomy balcony on the south side of the building and make speedy recovery.\n\nOne older girl has a tubercular gland on one side of the neck, which it would be well to have removed before she goes to take up the duties of a home. During her stay in the school, the good treatment she has received has kept the trouble under control and prevented its spread but only the removal of the gland can insure\nher safety once she is removed from the wholesome surroundings of this most excellent school.\n\nThe children's eyes are well cared for, and though a few cases of ancient trachoma are found, they are all cured so far as it is possible and are not at present a menace to the children themselves or their fellows.\n\nThe teeth are all in good condition and no evidence of enlarged tonsils or adenoids found. Neither are there any suppurating ears or skin diseases present. One boy requires glasses and the sisters have arranged that these shall be supplied.\n\nFor the number of inmates in the school at present, the building itself leaves but little to be desired, and in favour of the administration too much praise cannot be given. Every part is kept most scrupulously clean and sanitary. The woodwork and floors are varnished and polished allowing no possible lodgment for dust or dirt.\n\nThe dormitories are roomy, well lighted and ventilated and open upon wide balconies to the south which are used for sleeping balconies and would be used much more if they were provided with proper screening.\n\nThe cloak rooms are a perfect model of neatness and cleanliness the apparel of each pupil being clean and neatly folded and kept in a separate locker. The Halls, corridors, and classrooms especially the desks in the class rooms are in a state so perfect that it seems difficult to believe they have been in constant use for six years.\n\nThere is a pleasing infirmary for the girls and one for the boys and a well filled and spotless pharmacy insures the sick of all necessary aids to recovery.\nThe outbuildings and grounds are sanitary and attractive and a well kept garden gives wholesome outdoor occupation for many of the children. The whole air of the school breathes care and cleanliness and I doubt if another school could be found in Canada that could equal and I am sure none could surpass this school in its thorough neatness and in preservation of the original state of its equipment.\n\nF. A. Corbett, M.D.\nI find that Indians have always used horses as their medium of exchange and even to this day they have not been taught that this is the wrong medium and it has been the cause of unprofitable and unnecessary purchases of horses from white men. The schools must teach the boys that this medium must be dispensed with and supplanted by the dollar and that the value of the dollar as a purchasing agent must be clearly understood.\n\nIn regard to the girls, I do not think that they get the training which fits them to run a house after they are discharged. Girls work in the kitchen of the school but it is next to impossible to teach them to cook under the existing system; they do the scullery work and watch some white person do the cooking,\u2014this will never make a cook of an Indian girl. Advancement of the Indian depends a very great deal on the ability of the girl to keep a good house and be a good cook. I, therefore, advocate that facilities for cooking lessons be made in the schools and that this be the first consideration in the education of the girls. Crowfoot staff do what they can but I am satisfied that 75% of the girls in this school, as well as others, are discharged without a practical knowledge of the very thing they should know.\n\nHave asked that more attention be given to this phase of their education.\n\nG.H. Gooderham,\nAgent\nOttawa, February 17, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your report for the month of January on the Crowfoot Boarding School.\n\nThe school authorities should instruct the boys regarding the system of currency in use and the proper value of the same in the making of purchases.\n\nArrangements should also be made to allow the girls to have practical experience in cooking, it not being sufficient that they should watch others in the work and not be given the opportunity to perform this work themselves. They should also be instructed fully along practical lines in all matters of household and domestic work and a certain amount of such duties should be given to each of the older girls to do themselves under proper instruction.\n\nYou should bring these matters to the attention of the school authorities.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\nSir:\n\nReference your letter of the 17th inst:\nfile # 104-2-1, I have given the schools instructions to teach the girls practical housekeeping with particular training in cooking and sewing.\n\nThis is being followed but the facilities and grant per pupil is not sufficient to properly carry out the work.\n\nPractical cooking and sewing should have first place in the education of an Indian girl, and to properly teach these things, a special kitchen should be provided, and sufficient extra money granted to operate it.\n\nAgriculture and Domestic Science schools supply these for the white girls, and I am sure the Indian girl need the training far more than the white girl.\n\nIn the education of the Indian the home must be the first place to get an improvement otherwise the English, Arithmetic, etc., which these children learn is of little good.\n\nTherefore, Sir, I would ask that assistance be given the schools to develop a good cooking and sewing dept:\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst: Deputy & Secretary,\nDept: of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 26, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st instant in further reference to the instruction of the girls at the boarding schools in your agency in practical housekeeping, cooking and sewing and requesting that assistance be given the schools in order to enable them to give the girls a course of instruction.\n\nIn reply I have to request that you will be good enough, after consulting the staff of the schools, to furnish a recommendation as to the nature of the assistance that would be required in order to provide facilities for the carrying out of this instruction to the girls and the cost that would be involved. As soon as this information is received the Department will be in a position to consider the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nG. H.

There is but one thing that does not insure the best results, and that is the fact that the teaching teacher with a limited knowledge of English and not the best accent cannot teach English to the best advantage. I would say that the Catholic Church should try to pick their teachers from their English speaking people.\n\nThe roll showed 35 boys and 29 girls.\n\n| Boys | Girls |\n|------|-------|\n| Grade 1 | 17 |\n| Grade 1 | 11 |\n| Grade 2 | 6 |\n| Grade 2 | 6 |\n| Grade 3 | 4 |\n| Grade 3 | 7 |\n| Grade 4 | 4 |\n| Grade 4 | 5 |\n| Grade 5 | 4 |\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst: Deputy & Secretary,\nDept: of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, March 10, 1921.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nThe attention of the Department has been drawn to the work being performed by one of the teachers in the classroom at the Crowfoot Boarding School. This teacher is French speaking, with a limited knowledge of English and cannot teach English to the best advantage.\n\nRegarding this matter I beg to draw your attention to the agreement relating to the maintenance and management of Indian boarding schools whereby it is stipulated that no teacher or instructor is to be employed unless able to converse with the pupils under his or her charge in English and able to speak and write the English language fluently and correctly. The Department desires that the teachers employed be capable of teaching and speaking the English language.\n\nThis matter is being drawn to your attention and you should see that teachers capable of instructing the pupils in the English language are employed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. Riou, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nCrowfoot Boarding School,\nCluny, Alta.\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 10th inst.\n\nNo. 104-2-1 re teacher in class-room at the Crowfoot Boarding School and in reply must manifest my surprise at the remarks there must be a mistake somewhere, or we are not to believe any more the reports of the Inspectors of our class-room work.\n\nWe have 2 female teachers for class-room work in this Boarding School, the one an American born has a twenty years teaching record to her credit, she has been over 6 years teaching in this school and I have never heard any complaint against her way of teaching.\n\nThe other is younger but has been here over 4 years teaching class-room work. This teacher is a Canadian born French speaking, but speaks and writes the English language fluently and correctly. She can certainly teach English as well and better than many English speaking teachers.\n\nI was present at the examinations July 1920, where our Indian Agent Mr. Geo. Gooderham could not give enough praise to teacher and pupils for work done during the year.\n\nAlthough I was not here at the last Inspection of Mr. Marke I am sure he gave a good report of this school.\n\nI thank you, dear Sir, for drawing this matter to my attention as it will enable me to clear out the bad impressions produced on the Indian Department concerning this school. For 20 years that this Boarding School has been open, we have had from our Inspectors the best references in regard to teachers and pupils and I am anxious to further its good name in that respect.\n\nHoping for further light on this subject.\n\nI am dear Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, March 22, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nIn your report on your inspection of the Crowfoot Boarding School for the month of February, last, you stated as follows: \"There is but one thing that does not insure the best results, and that is the fact that a French speaking teacher with a limited knowledge of English and not the best accent cannot teach English to the best advantage. I would say that the Catholic Church should try to pick their teachers from their English speaking people.\"\n\nThe attention of the Principal was drawn to this matter, and it was pointed out to him that, under the Agreement relating to the Maintenance and Management of Indian Boarding Schools, no teacher or instructor is to be employed unless able to converse with the pupils under his or her charge in English and able to speak and write the English language fluently and correctly, and that the Department desires that the teachers employed be capable of teaching and speaking the English language.\n\nIn a reply from the Principal, dated the 15th instant, he states that, of the two female teachers employed, one is an American with twenty years' teaching record to her credit and she has been six years in the school. The other, while a French Canadian, has been four years teaching in the school and speaks and writes the English language fluently and correctly and can certainly teach English as well and better than many English speaking teachers and he states that this is the first complaint he has ever received regarding her work. I am forwarding this for your information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nG. H. Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMR. J. D. MCLEAN -\n\nThe attached letters were handed to the Honourable the Minister by Bishop McNally of Calgary. They refer to a number of matters upon which the Minister wishes to be advised. Kindly return them with your remarks.\n\nBishop McNally also spoke to the Minister with reference to the lack of baths and sanitary arrangements in connection with the school buildings on the Blood Reserve. Kindly let the Minister have some information in this connection as well.\n\nEnclosures.\n\nPRIVATE SECRETARY.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nWith reference to the attached letters which were handed to The Honourable The Minister by Bishop McNally, of Calgary, I beg to say regarding the request made by the Principal of the Crowfoot Boarding School:\n\n(1) That authorization be granted by the Department to erect a separate building on the Crowfoot School premises for the purpose of educating the Catholic children of the Cluny Parish. In support of his request he states that authority has been granted by the Department in other places and mentions especially that this was done at Dalmas, Sask. (Thunderchild's Boarding School). The Crowfoot Boarding School is located on an Indian Reserve, while the Boarding School at Dalmas is situated off the Reserve on land owned by the Sisters of the Assumption. There is no correspondence to show that they have provided a building for teaching accommodation for the children of the Parish. As the Boarding School at Dalmas is the property of the Church Authority who own the building and site, the circumstances are different from those at Crowfoot where the land and school are the property of the Department and were set aside for Indian School purposes. There is no record of any authority having been granted at any school located on a Reserve to erect a building in which to teach children of the Parish.\n\n(3) Regarding the Principal's request for more land, I beg to say the present site consists of 4 Section 32, Township 21, Range 21, part of the Blackfoot Reserve set aside for school purposes. In March, 1918, Inspector Markle stated that the present site of 160 acres is too limited an area for school and mission purposes. He reported that the adjacent land was all occupied or claimed by individual Indians, and consequently the livestock of the school must be kept and pastured within the 160 acres. The Inspector stated that the north east quarter of the same section on which the school is located could be obtained in exchange for another section from an Indian named Catface. This Indian intended to abandon this quarter section, and the Inspector recommends that 160 acres be given to the school, which he states would be sufficient providing arrangements could be made with the owner for another section in exchange. Nothing further seems to have been done in the matter.\n\n(4) Regarding the building of an implement shed; an item of $750.00 was included in the estimates prepared by the Agent for the erection of an implement shed but this was not allowed as it was, owing to the extensive building programme of the Department for the present year, found unable to provide the necessary funds.\nRegarding the erection of a hospital on the Blackfoot Reserve under the charge of the Reverend Sisters, I beg to say that this is a matter which should be referred to the Accountant's Branch for a report.\n\nReferring to the letter from the Principal of St. Joseph's Industrial School regarding the case of Stephen Johnson, I beg to say that there is considerable correspondence on the matter. This boy was formerly pupil of the Red Deer Industrial School, and at the closing of that school in August, 1919, he was sent home. He entered Red Deer in 1915, and his religion was given as Methodist. His parents both died in 1918 with Influenza. His father was a Methodist and his mother a Roman Catholic.\n\nIn April, 1920, application was made for his admission to the Ermineskin's Boarding School, but his guardian, John Okeymow, and the Principal of the school were informed that the Department had decided \"not to transfer any of the children formerly enrolled at the Red Deer Industrial School to any other institution at present.\" The Reverend Mr. Woodsworth, former Principal of the Red Deer Industrial School, protested against the admission of any of his former pupils into other schools until he was anxious to have the old buildings and school buildings were completed at Edmonton. This boy's admission to the Ermineskin's School was not approved.\n\nEarly in 1921, he was taken to the St. Joseph's Industrial School and Mr. Agent Kirby stated when forwarding his application to this school as follows:\n\n\"This application is supposed to be signed by Charles Johnson, a brother of the boy, but on interviewing Charles Johnson he states that he did not sign nor make his mark on any application and also that he is not the boy's guardian. John Okeymow is the legal guardian of the lad, and states that he did not give his consent to the boy being placed in a Roman Catholic School. Stephen was baptized in the Methodist Church. He was taken to St. Joseph's Industrial School by Rev. Father Moulin, Principal of the Ermineskin's Boarding School.\"\n\nIn view of the information before the Department regarding his situation, his admission to Ermineskin's Boarding School was refused as was also the admission to St. Joseph's Industrial School, and the Principals of both these schools were informed accordingly.\n\nRegarding the lack of baths and sanitary arrangements at the Blood (R.C.) Boarding School mentioned by Bishop McNally, I beg to say that the buildings at this point are in very bad condition and it was felt that the cost of putting them in a proper state of repair would be prohibitive. I would point out that a scheme is now under way to purchase a site near Claresholm, Alberta, and to erect a modern school building to accommodate the Roman Catholic Indian children of the Blood and Pelican Reserves. For this reason only a few minor repairs have been authorized at the Blood (R.C.) School pending the erection of this new building and the closing of the present school on the Blood Reserve.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, July 19, 1921.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. McLean.\n\nRegarding the erection of a hospital on the Blackfoot Indian Reserve, I beg to report that no definite arrangement has yet been arrived at.\n\nIn April of this year, Mr. Graham forwarded a petition from the Chiefs and Principal men of the Blackfoot band, asking that a hospital be erected on this reserve at an expenditure not to exceed $12,000.00.\n\nIn a later letter, Mr. Graham suggests that the hospital might be used for all cases that arise in the surrounding reserves.\n\nBefore proceeding with the erection of this building, it was thought that the plans should be carefully matured; that the question of maintenance was an essential one, and that a careful estimate should be made as to the probable expenditure in operating the hospital, and the source from which the revenue is to come; also if the hospital was to be used by other bands, they should contribute to the cost of it.\n\nArchitect.\nMemorandum\u2014 July 19, 1921.\n\nHon. Sir James Lougheed,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your memorandum of the 15th instant, inclosing a communication addressed to you by Reverend Father Rieu, Principal of the Crowfoot boarding school, located on the Blackfoot reserve. I shall reply to the different matters in the order in which they are presented by the Reverend Father\u2014\n\n1: The Department has never granted authority for the erection of a school on an Indian reserve for the education of white children, which is apparently what is asked for in this instance. The Thunderchild boarding school, to which Father Rieu refers, situated at Delmas, Sask., is not the property of the Government, nor is it on a reserve. The building and lands in connection therewith belong to the Sisters of the Assumption.\n\n2: The Department is contemplating the erection of a hospital on the Blackfoot reserve, to be built from the land funds. The Indians have already voted a certain amount, but a suggestion having been made that this hospital should be for the accommodation of the Indians of the surrounding reserves as well, the Department would like to erect a larger building, and the matter is, therefore, at present in abeyance, pending more mature consideration. As to the management, the proposal has been that it should be undenominational and under the direct control of the Department, represented by the local Agent. This would seem to be necessary, if Indians of all denominations are to take advantage of the facilities to be afforded.\n\n3: Some years ago a recommendation was made by the late Inspector, Mr. Markle, that additional lands should be secured for the use of the Crowfoot school, but no action was taken to carry this recommendation into effect. I would propose to take the matter up now with Commissioner Graham, and, if the School Vote, from which funds would have to be taken, if found necessary to purchase, will bear the expenditure, the Principal's request might be favourably considered.\n\n4: Regarding the implement shed for the boarding school, this is a matter that was under consideration last year. The Department asked the Church authorities to build an implement shed from material in the old\nschool, which the Agent recommended. This they refused to do, and, as the funds at the disposal of the Department were very limited, no action was taken. This question I would also propose to take up with Commissioner Graham.\n\nWith reference to the admission of Stephen Johnson to the St. Joseph's industrial school, I beg to say that this boy was a former pupil of the Red Deer industrial school (Methodist), which was closed in August, 1919, and the pupils sent home, pending the erection of a new boarding school near Edmonton, which has since been undertaken. His father was a Methodist and his mother a Roman Catholic. His parents died in 1918, from influenza, and in 1920 application was made for his admission to Ermineskin's boarding school. A protest was made by the former Principal of the Methodist school, and the boy's admission to the Ermineskin school was not approved, as it is contrary to the regulations of the Department to admit Protestant children to a Roman Catholic school or vice versa. Early this year he was taken to the St. Joseph's school by the Principal of the Ermineskin school, without authority, and our Indian Agent at Hobbema now writes, stating that John Okeymow, who is the legal guardian, says that he did not give consent to his being placed in the Roman Catholic school.\n\nIn view of these facts, the Department could not consent to the admission of this boy to a Roman Catholic institution.\n\nRegarding the installation of baths and sanitary arrangements at the Roman Catholic school on the Blood reserve, concerning which His Lordship Bishop McNally spoke to the Minister, this is a very old building, almost beyond all usefulness for the purpose of a boarding school. Just at the present time, we are concluding the purchase of a lot near Claresholm, on which it is proposed to erect a school, to be used jointly for the Catholic children of the Blood and Peigan reserves. It is probable that, if funds are available, we will go ahead with this work next year, and, in view of this, it is not considered advisable to spend very much on the old school building, either by way of repairs or equipment. We will, however, make inquiries, and see if some bath tubs could be installed, which might be used when equipping the new school. We have not the data before us to enable us to decide that here.\n\nI am returning herewith your papers.\n\n(Sd.) J.D.

Concerning the matter of diet at this school I am pleased to note that you have gone into the matter carefully and submitted a tentative diet sheet showing the food which each child should receive daily. The Department is pleased to learn of your action and trusts that it will have immediate response on the part of the principal and others.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\nOttawa, November 14, 1921.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nThere is a matter arising out of the report of the travelling nurse that I have been asked to draw to your attention. Miss Ramage heard complaints in the vicinity of Cluny that French was being taught in the Crowfoot boarding school on the Blackfoot reserve.\n\nYou are in a position to know what credence to put in this complaint, and, if you see fit, you might ask Mr. Agent Gooderham to look into this matter and make a report to the Department. As you know the agreement with the schools in the Prairie Provinces calls for English as the sole language of instruction.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, January 17, 1922.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 10th instant, concerning disciplinary methods at the Crowfoot Indian Boarding School. I have read your communication carefully and I am convinced that you will make an effort to see that there will be no recurrence of grounds for complaint.\n\nIn reply I wish to state that the Department did not charge you and your officers with \"pitiless treatment\". What I asked in my letter of the 16th ultimo was a discontinuance of any practices that might be considered by parents or others pitiless or jail-like in character. The Department is aware of the fact that parents are prone to find fault.\n\nFurther, I wish to intimate that the Department approves of corporal punishment, but we demand that it be of a certain type and within reason. In the near future, a circular letter is being addressed to all principals, which will, I trust, clearly indicate the Department's position and wishes concerning disciplinary methods.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nReverend A. Ricou, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nCrowfoot Boarding School,\nCluny, Alta.\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 17th last.\n\nNo. 104-2-1 re disciplinary methods used at the Crowfoot Boarding School and in reply to say that the report you have received on the subject was purely exaggerated. Your letter seems to say it is of common occurrence. It is true some pupils have been chained to benches once to my knowledge since I have been back to the Crowfoot School nearly 3 years now, and the same pupils got a whipping from the Sisters. The Indian Agent did not approve of chaining the pupils and this corrective measure has not been renewed, although it had good results in bringing shame on the truant. I do not consider solitary treatment, corporal punishment on a boy or a girl of 15 and 16 years old, even if it leaves the boy or the girl marked, when this punishment is given by the Sisters. The Indian agent himself has approved of it. But since the Indian Department does not approve of this corrective measure it shall not be used. Our policy is to give proper treatment to our pupils. But corrective measures must be taken in regard to the delinquents, otherwise there shall be no order nor discipline in the school and I would be only too glad if you would suggest the corrective measures to be taken in certain grievous cases in the future.\n\nI see you a long way in regard to the formation of the superintendence but it is not always sufficient, especially when we have to deal with Indians. The allurement around them are too many and too tempting, and they are so weak willed, that they must fear in order to overcome temptation. If the parents could be made to understand, it would render the work easier, but you understand the Indians. I blame some officials of the Indian Department, Inspector and Nurse etc., in regard to the troubles we have had these last 6 months. The Indians do not need to be invited to bring forth some pretended grievance to be reported to Ottawa, they are only too ready with their tricks. We try to complain against any white man with whom they are in touch, and much say they have been treated too cruelly lately. The work we are carrying among the Indians needs the support of the Indian Department and experience is being that should be despised in this regard.\n\nBelieve me, honorable sir, Yours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge your report, B-11, on the Crowfoot Boarding School for the month of December 1921. The Department is grateful for the careful attention that you are paying to school matters at this time.\n\nIf no change is made in the personnel of the staff at the Crowfoot Indian Boarding School in the near future, I would be grateful if you would draw the attention of the Department to the fact that the boys' teacher is non-English and that the principal had promised to make a change.\n\nIndian schools are being asked to adhere to the curriculum of the Department of Education of the province in which they are located. As each province has a separate course of studies, examination papers for the various grades have not been prepared. I am sending you, under separate cover, a copy of the new register that the Department has caused to be printed, and you might ask the Alberta Department of Education for a copy of their current course of studies. You will note that I have emphasized in the regulations on the back of the register some educational features that the Crowfoot Indian Boarding School has neglected. I am convinced that this school does not foster individual initiative. You will remember our efforts to teach a game or two to the boys at the time of my visit to southern Alberta.\n\nI have to inform you that the Department is making overtures with the Provincial Departments of Education in Western Canada with a view to arranging for the inspection of our classroom activities by the public school inspectors. We hope that final arrangements will be completed in the near future and that the benefit of such inspection will be great.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nG. H. Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit the following report on Crowfoot Boarding School for the month of December, 1921:\n\nI visited Crowfoot Boarding School on the 9th and 23rd of the month. On the first visit I found a number of the pupils suffering from skin infection, but the Doctor and school Nursing Sister were treating them, and when I visited the second time a great improvement was evident.\n\nThe school was in the same good order, but the more I visit this place, the more I am impressed with the French atmosphere which exudes from every corner.\n\nComparing this school with the Anglican school on this Reserve, I must say that the pupils of the latter place speak English more freely to a visitor than those of the former school, and I account for this partly to the fact that they live with people who speak nothing but English, and with whom they converse very freely.\n\nParents complain that their children are not progressing as rapidly as they should at the Crowfoot school, and I wish to go into these complaints during the month of January. I find that no real examination papers are set, and would ask if you could send me type questions for the various subjects in all grades up to and including the Fifth, and with such a test I can possibly find where and why the pupil is backward.\n\nMay say that the principal of the school promised an English speaking teacher for the boys some months ago, but to date no change has been made.\n\nThe register shows 62 pupils distributed as follows:\n\n| Grade | Boys | Girls |\n|-------|------|-------|\n| 1     | 11   | 17    |\n| 2     | 13   | 7     |\n| 3     | 4    | 7     |\n|       | 28   | 34    |\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst: Deputy & Secretary,\nDept: of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nExtract from letter dated December 19th, 1921,\nfrom W. M. Graham, Indian Commissioner, Regina.\n\nI have your letter of the 15th inst., No. 109-x-2 in regard to Miss Ramage's report on the Blackfoot Agency, and may say that I have had a reply from Mr. Gooderham to my letter in which I drew his attention to the treatment of the children at the Crowfoot School. He explains that he went to the school after the receipt of a telephone message informing him that there was trouble there which needed his attention, and took Miss Ramage with him. When there he found three boys chained to the benches in the dining room. He immediately took up the matter with the Principal informing him that such disciplinary measures were not to be resorted to. He also investigated the complaint that one Indian girl was severely marked from the result of a thrashing, and Miss Ramage's inspection of the girl disclosed that \"there was a mark on one limb\", but the Nurse did not inform the Agent that the child was badly marked. He requested the Principal to give him a written assurance, which was done, that his instructions in regard to the treatment of the children would be carried out. This was all done by the Agent prior to the receipt of my letter, but he states that when my communication was received by him, he again visited the school, and emphasized his own instructions by bringing mine to the attention of the Principal. The Agent, therefore, acted promptly and correctly when the complaint was drawn to his attention.\n\n(Sgd.) \"W.M. Graham\"\nRegina, Sask., Dec. 3rd, 1921.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nNurse Ramage's report for November.\n\nI draw your attention to that portion of the report dealing with the Crowfoot School. I think it is decidedly wrong to chain Indian boys and girls to benches as they are doing there, and I have written to the Agent instructing him to see that this practice is discontinued immediately. There must be some other way of punishing children without resorting to this method. I am also drawing his attention to the remarks of the Nurse that a child is badly marked from being strapped, and I am instructing him to see that this mode of chastisement is discontinued too. I intend following the matter up to see that my instructions have been carried out.\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nNara Ramage's Report for November, 1921.\n\nNov. 1.\n\nLate in the afternoon motored to Crowfoot School with the Indian Agent to settle dispute between the parents of the children who ran away from school, and the Sisters. Chief complaint from the children was the poor food. Did not wait in the sitting-room to have dispute settled, but went straight down to the dining room to note the evening meal. Many boys had cups of tea while others had plates with meat stew and tea.\n\nFour boys were in chains and chained to the benches. Later returned to the locked dining room to examine one of the girls who was reported marked badly by a strap. Several marks were found on her right lower limb. Five girls were in chains.\nOttawa, December 16, 1921.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nIt has been drawn to my attention that rather severe disciplinary methods have been used at the Crowfoot Boarding School.\n\nI wish to state that the Department of Indian Affairs will not countenance such corrective measures as chaining pupils to benches and corporal punishment that leaves a boy or girl marked. Treatment that might be considered pitiless or jail-like in character will not be permitted.\n\nThe Indian children are wards of this Department, and we exercise our right to ensure proper treatment whether they are resident in our schools or not. Your earnest attention to this matter is desired.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. J. Hume, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nCrowfoot Boarding School,\nStandoff, Alta.\nOttawa, November 30, 1921.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 26th instant, referring to the report that French was being taught in the Crowfoot Boarding School on the Blackfoot reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that the Department is grateful for the prompt attention that you and your staff gave to this matter, and that we are pleased to learn that there is no ground for the belief that French has been used at any time as the language of instruction.\n\nI agree with you that there is much improvement desired in the matter of English in connection with our graduates of residential schools. You will remember that I took exception to a teacher in the Qu'Appelle Industrial School and had the matter taken up by the Department upon my reporting here for duty. It will be my aim, as Head of the School Branch, to equip Indian children with correct English as if they had been brought up in Anglo-Saxon communities. Then, and then only, will our wards at the age of maturity be at ease in the general Canadian environment.\n\nI am convinced that it is part of the Department's present policy to engage teachers for our Indian schools, who are properly qualified in every respect. I will not hesitate to bring to your attention any matters in this connection that come before the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK. Nov. 26th, 1921\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th inst., regarding a complaint from Miss Ramage that French is being taught in the Crowfoot Boarding School on the Blackfoot Agency. On receipt of this letter I took this matter up with Agent Gooderham, who informs me that French is not being taught in the school. He says that on one occasion this year, he was informed by an ex-pupil of the school that had been taught French songs which he did not understand, but were sung on a special occasion. This man has been out of school ten years.\n\nMr. Gooderham visited the school on receipt of my letter, and he asked one of the bigger boys if he knew French or had ever been taught the language, and he said he had not. He also took the matter up with the Sister Superior, and she informed him that the children had joined in a chorus of two lines at Christmas, when an entertainment had been put on in the Church for the French people of the district, but on no other occasion had they been taught anything French. Mr. Gooderham goes on to say that all the members of the staff are French, and that even some of them do not speak English very well, which, in my opinion, is not as it should be, as no doubt these people converse with the Indians, and it gives them a bad accent. There is no doubt that the children who hear this language, and are probably spoken to in French, give the impression to their parents and others that they are being taught French.\n\nOn several occasions we have objected to teachers in our schools who cannot speak English properly, and have a decided accent. I cannot impress upon the Depart-\n\nR. T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nment too strongly the importance of insisting on having English teachers, or French who talk English without an accent, in our various schools. When Indians are taught by teachers who speak imperfect English it shows very readily on the pupils. It is hard enough to get perfect pronunciation when the pupils are taught by English teachers.\n\nThe foregoing remarks do not apply only to the Crowfoot but to all schools, and the Department should insist on having teachers who speak without an accent, to teach our Indians.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\nI find that the boys are not given very good instructions in farming, and stock raising, and wish to suggest that more thorough training along this line be given hereafter.\n\nBigger boys should be made to do considerable of the farm work, and should have capable instructors to direct them.\nROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE.\n\nK.

Mounted Police.,\nCalgary Sub-District.\n\nSir:\n\nRe: Bob Poor Eagle, Blackfoot Indian.\nNeglecting to send child to school.\n\nI have the honour to state that on August 15th last Mr. Gooderham, Indian Agent, Blackfoot Indian Reserve informed me that Bob Poor Eagle had failed to send his boy, Joseph Poor Eagle, back to the Crewefoot School after the holidays. I therefore had Mr. Gooderham write a letter to Bob Poor Eagle instructing him to send his boy back to school within three days. This letter was dated August 15th 1922. I delivered this letter and explained it to Bob Poor Eagle.\n\nOn August 15th the boy had not yet been put in school, but Mr. Gooderham requested me not to prosecute as he did not wish to take extreme measures unless forced.\n\nOn Friday September 1st Mr. Gooderham reported to me that although Bob Poor Eagle had been repeatedly spoken to, his boy was still out of school. He requested me to put the boy in school and prosecute.\n\nTherefore on the afternoon of September 1st I proceeded by Indian Agency car to Bob Poor Eagle's, where I took charge of the boy, Joseph Poor Eagle, and placed him in the hands of the Sisters at Crewefoot School. I also instructed Bob Poor Eagle to be at the Indian Agency at 2 P.M. of Tuesday September 5th.\n\nOn Tuesday September 5th 1922, I laid an Information before Mr. Gooderham charging Bob Poor Eagle that he, after having received three days notice in writing, did fail to cause his child, to wit Joseph Poor Eagle, to attend school. Contrary to Sec.10 Sub-Sec.3 of the Indian Act.\n\nBob Poor Eagle appeared before Mr. Gooderham on this same day, Sept. 5th 1922., at 2 P.M. and pleaded guilty.\n\nMr. Gooderham stated that this Indian had been given every opportunity to put the child in school but he deliberately defied the law. Therefore he would not be given the option of fine. Mr. Gooderham gave Bob Poor Eagle the choice of going to Lethbridge jail for 10 days, or working on the Indian threshing gang with his team and wagon for 10 days at $1.00 per day, instead of the usual wage of $7.00. Bob Poor Eagle agreed to work the 10 days on the threshing gang.\n\nCase concluded.\n\nI have the honour to be\nSir\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE. A. Harper\nCorp.\nReg.

It was abundantly demonstrated that they were at least the equals with training of the white children in art and athletics. They enter into the spirit of the occasion with zest in which they were encouraged by the sisters.\n\nD. H. McKenzie,\nInsp.\nOttawa, March 26th, 1923.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, who visited the Crowfoot Boarding School in December last, has drawn the attention of the Department to the splendid exhibit made by the pupils at the Gleichen School Fair, and states that it was abundantly demonstrated that they were the equals in training of the white children.\n\nI wish to congratulate yourself and the Reverend Sisters of the school on the excellent training given the pupils and the results achieved by them. We are very pleased to have such encouraging reports from an outside source regarding the work being done at your school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR. T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. J. Ricou, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal, Crowfoot Indian Boarding School,\nCluny, Alta.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF INSPECTOR CHRISTIANSON\n\nRE: CROWFOOT (R. C.) Boarding School.\n\nDated April 11, 1923, addressed to Comm. Graham.\n\nOriginal on File 77-104\n\nI wish to point out that I found the same condition here as I have found on visiting several other schools and have pointed out repeatedly, that although the work inside of the school is all that can be asked for, the boys are not getting the proper training in the outside activities. The ground allotted to this school is about 200 acres and as 125% is pasture there are only about 75 acres or so left for farming and, as a man is employed by the school as farmer, he does all the farm work himself, the boys very seldom being called upon to do any of this work and outside of some gardening they are not taught any farming whatever. There are also very few head of stock kept by the school, they have seven work horses, nine cows, six of which were milking and four calves, a few hogs and a few chickens. By this you will see that the boys on leaving school have had practically no experience along farming lines or stock raising and are placed upon a reserve where they are supposed to make their living from this source, without any experience.\n\n(Sgd.) M. Christianson,\nInspector.\nI would particularly draw attention to the Inspector's remarks relative to the inadequate training in farming given to the boys at these two schools. The Principal of the Old Suns school has had no agricultural experience, and knows very little about the care of stock, while the Inspector's report with regard to the farmer and stockman attached to the school is not very encouraging. The prospects of the boys receiving good grounding in agriculture and stock raising under the tuition of these men are not very bright. As I have pointed out to the Department on numerous occasions, training in agriculture and the care of stock is of greater importance to Indian boys than class room work as it is to these occupations they must look for a livelihood when they return to the reserves. Our experience has been that school graduates, in many cases, are very much less capable as farmers and stockmen than Indians who have not received a school training. This is disconcerting, and unless Indian boys receive an education which they can put to practical use when they return to the reserves the period spent by them at school represents a waste of time and money. I am of the opinion that the remedy for this state of affairs lies in the Department insisting that only men who are practical agriculturists be appointed as principals of our boarding and industrial schools, and trust that this matter will be taken up with the Church authorities as it is too bad that all these schools do not function as they should.\n\nI am disappointed to hear from Mr. Christianson that the teachers at the Old Suns School are not qualified in so far as that they have not received Normal training. The reports of the Provincial School Inspectors on Indian schools have been in the majority of cases unsatisfactory, and these gentlemen have invariably stressed the necessity for employing as teachers in our schools only men and women who have received Normal training. I am sure that this matter is one which will receive earnest consideration from the Department.\n\n(Sgd.) W. M. Graham.\nOttawa, May 5, 1925.\n\nDear Father Riou:\n\nMr. Commissioner Graham has reported that the boys at the Crowfoot Indian Boarding School receive entirely inadequate training in farming. I am surprised at this criticism, for it is understood that school authorities in the Prairie Provinces will engage instructors qualified to give the male pupils training in farming, gardening and the care of stock. Such instruction is highly important for boys at Indian residential schools, and I should be pleased if you would inform me what training has been given in past years and concerning the remedial measures you can undertake in the immediate future.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. J. Riou, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nCrowfoot Bdg. School,\nCluny, Alta.\nOttawa, May 5, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have to refer to that portion of your No. 401-9 of the 16th ultimo, relative to the inadequate training in farming given the boys at the Crowfoot Indian Boarding School. I have directed a communication to the Rev. Principal, asking him to take remedial measures in the near future.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nTo the Honourable Duncan C. Scott,\n\nDeputy Minister, Indian Affairs\n\nHonourable Sir:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 5th inst., No. 104-2-1, in regard to the Commissioner Graham on the inadequate training of the Boys in farming, and in reply to say that there is a good deal of exaggeration in this criticism.\n\nIt is true, these last years, the boys have done very little work in tilling the land, seeding and cutting the grain for the reason they were too young to be trusted with this kind of work. I did not consider them strong enough to handle a 4 horse team or a plough, a scythe or a binder. They were discharged at the age of 16, just at the time they could begin to learn how to handle horses and machinery. But outside of the above mentioned work they helped the Instructor in the caring of the stock around the Barn as well as other kinds of work in the field viz the hauling of manure, the repairing of fences, the weeding of the grain and vegetables in the summer, the hauling of the coal, hay in the winter. As for gardening, they have been thoroughly trained on this line, and I must say they obtained some good results. The Public School Inspector who visited the Crossfoot Boarding School in December last, has drawn the attention of the Department to the splendid exhibit made by the pupils of this School and the Superintendent of Education wrote to me on March 26th last congratulating the staff of this School on the excellent training given the Pupils and the results achieved by them.\n\nAt the present the school had only \u00bc section of land to be divided between farming and pastures and the last 3 or 4 years of dry weather have compelled us to reduce our stock considerably. This was no way to be had on the prairie, and the crops were light. This spring Mr. Gooderham, our Indian agent, has provided the School with another \u00bc section of land, about \u00bc mile from the School; it will be of great help, but on account of the distance it cannot be worked to advantage, so the arrangement is only temporary. In the future, the Boys shall have a better chance in having a training in farming, provided they do not leave the School until they are 18 years old. Now, in order to be able to carry on farming successfully I would suggest that a silo be built adjacent to the Barn, so we may provide the fodder needed for the wintering of the cattle.\n\nHoping these explanations to be satisfactory, I am, Honourable Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, School Files,\n(RG 10, Volume 6348, File 752-1, part 1.)\nOttawa, June 11, 1923.\n\nDear Father Riou:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th ultimo, with general reference to the training in farming for the boys at the Crowfoot Indian Boarding school. I have noted that several conditions militate against a complete instruction in farm operations. Relative to the age for discharge, I should be pleased if you would bend every energy towards enlightening the parents concerning the added opportunities if the children are kept in school until they have reached the age of 18 years. I am directing, in the near future, to all principals and agents in the Prairie Provinces a communication with special reference to the training of the older boys and the age of their discharge.\n\nI am pleased to learn that Mr. Agent Gooderham has arranged for an extra quarter section of land for the purposes of the school. You would do well to discuss with him the possibilities of securing a similar block closer to the school itself. It might be possible to arrange for a surrender, and, if so, please count on my help. I wish to assure you, further, that the need for a silo will not be overlooked when we are preparing our estimates for the coming fiscal year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. J. Riou, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nCrowfoot Indian Bd. School,\nCluny, Alta.\nHonourable Sir,\n\nI beg to tell you that in his last visit Inspector Christiansen had promised to have outside water closets to be built at once for the pupils of the Crowfoot School. It is absolutely necessary that improvements be made at once, as the work is going on at present on the school. I hope you will give orders in that respect.\n\nKindly let me know also if the pupils have the right to have more than one month holiday. In some places they have too much; in others too little. I would like to follow the Indian Department's views on that respect.\n\nI have the honourable Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, August 3, 1923.\n\nRev. Sir,-\n\nI have your letter of the 14th ultimo addressed to the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nIn reply I have to inform you that on the 2nd instant instructions were directed to Mr. Agent Gooderham relative to the outside water closets at the Crowfoot Indian Boarding School.\n\nIn reply to that portion of your letter asking for the Department's instructions with reference to the duration of the annual holidays, I beg to state that one month's leave only is allowed in the case of Indian residential schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F. MacKenzie\nActg. Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. Rice, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nCrowfoot Indian Boarding School,\nCluny, Alta.\nExtract from Agent's Report for the month of August, 1923, CROWFOOT RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nIndians parents complained to me that the principal spent considerable time on religious training in the native tongue and that they felt that their children were not making progress as they should.\n\nI took the matter up with the Rev. Father Riou and he informed me that no religious training is given in school hours and that the children get religious exercises only in the early morning and for a half hour at noon. He did, however, talk partly in Blackfoot as many could not understand English.\n\nA number of Indians complain there is too much religion - personally I am no judge of how much religious training an Indian child should have and am passing on the complaint and the principal's explanation for your information.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nExtract from Agent's monthly report on the CROWFOOT RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL for the month of OCTOBER, 1923.\n\nThe junior teacher, SISTER ANN ELIZABETH, was leaving the next day and her successor was not known.\n\nIt is to be hoped that more sisters, who can speak English, will be supplied for this institution, because on the date of inspection it was noted that children were under the charge of sisters who are only learning to speak English. It must be stated, however, that the staff has lately been depleted owing to illness and accidents of sisters who spoke English.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\n\nAgent,\nBlackfoot Agency,\nGleichen, Alta.,\nApril 8th 1924.\n\nRe Schools: Neither school is giving sufficient attention to the training of boys in farm work and care of stock. More efficient work must be done in this branch of the Indian education. At Crowfoot School the farmer is industrious but not scientific and I found that the boys do little or no milking. Stock is mediocre and not fed to the best advantage. I arranged that this school get another 160 acres of land, which adjoins their present farm. The Department has therefor done its share and it is now up to the principal to show results.\n\nAt Old Suns School the conditions are somewhat similar, though the boys do milk and attend to the stock, but their instruction is far from being satisfactory.\n\nThe present farmer at this school is an old man of the old school - these Indians must have a young up to date instructor, and the authorities of this school must lose no time in getting such a person on the job. The principal of this school is conscientious but lacks force to get things in order and properly done at the right time and in the right way. He must buck up and with his staff get into the harness and get results.\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\n(fgd.) G.H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nRegina, Sask.,\nApril 11th 1924.\n\nI would also draw your attention to the Agent's remarks regarding the Old Sun and Crowfoot Schools. I doubt very much if the Principal of the former school will begin to carry on the work to the satisfaction of the Department. The latter School is scrupulously clean, the children well fed and clothed and the classroom work good. The farming, however, is not all that is desired, but I have promises that there will be a great improvement in this branch of the work in the future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) W.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nThe visiting nurse was advised to note particularly the diet of the pupils and reported to me that it was not as good as at Old Sun's. The Department should insist on more milk and butter for the children of this school, and that the older pupils be given more instruction in the care of stock and in dairy work.\n\n(Sgd.) G. H. Gooderham.\nOttawa, August 1st, 1924.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nA report of the visiting nurse on her visit to the Crowfoot Indian Residential School has drawn attention to the shortage of the quantity of milk and butter supplied the pupils. As milk forms a staple article of diet, especially for the younger children, I have to request that you will arrange to see that they are furnished with an ample supply of milk and also that butter is provided in sufficient quantities.\n\nThe Department desires that the older boys be given more instruction in the care of stock and dairy work. This should be an important part of the training given the boys in order that they will have a fair knowledge of this work after leaving school.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear regarding the steps taken to provide a good supply of milk and butter for the pupils' use, and also what instruction is being given in the care of stock and dairy work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Aast. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. Riou, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal, Crowfoot Res. School,\nCluny, Alta.\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 12th inst., re visiting nurse's report and in reply to say that there is exaggeration in the report or lack of frankness towards the staff. The pupils have all the milk they want, but drink what is the use of wasting good nourishment? They have butter once a day, if this is not sufficient we are only too willing to give more, we are anxious to give the pupils strong and nourishing food.\n\nI do not see how I could give the boys more instruction in the care of stock and dairy work. They do all the work around the Barn under the supervision of the Farmer; five of the older boys work one half a day on the Farm and garden and the other half day they go to school, but after the school is over they have again to attend to cattle and horses.\n\nI would suggest that when hereafter a school Inspector or a visiting nurse visit the school, they give a report to the Principal at least they point to him the defects they have noticed. Sometimes they go back with a wrong conception of the daily routine of the work they cannot see in one hour what takes a whole day to do, with an understanding with the Principal, they return with a fair idea of the work done.\n\nI am sending you a copy of the letter sent by Miss Brand to Sister Superior and of which I had communication only after the receipt of your letter.\n\nIndian Agent's Office, Glace Bay, July 1924\n\nSister Superior \u2014 Knowing as you do the great need of nourishing food to build up strong bodies, allow me to respectfully remind you to do the best in this line that your allowance will afford.\n\nYou have a good milk supply and if there are some little ones who are not fond of it, I feel sure that in most cases he or she will soon forget prejudice and learn to take milk as a food.\n\nIn witness,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nIn anti-tubercular work we use good milk so much\nin dieting that while caring for these children who\nare predisposed to and afflicted with tuberculosis\nyou will understand my speaking of the food\nof such importance.\n\nYour boys are behind the girls in caring for\ntheir teeth. I dislike to be so plain with them as\ntheir deportment (as well as that of your girls) was\nso pleasing, while undergoing physical inspection, as\nwell as during my visit to the classrooms, and while\nI was speaking to them on habits which promote\ngood health.\n\nI thank you and your staff for such kindness\nand hospitality extended to me while with you.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\nSigned, Annie Brandon.\n\nNow this letter does not point to the shortage\nof milk and butter supplied the pupils. However,\nI will try to make the children drink milk although\nthey do not like it and have told Sister Superior\nthis in the future, shall be the only beverage at\ntable for children under 12.\n\nI will ask you to let me know the sufficient\nquantity of butter to be provided to each\npupil every day; we were thinking to give\nbutter once a day was ample enough, and the\nNurse should have given her opinion\non this point to Sister Superior or\nto the Principal if she thought it was insufficient.\n\nHoping these explanations will be\nsatisfactory,\n\nI am yours ever truly\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, August 21st, 1924.\n\nRev.

I am very pleased to note that you are giving serious consideration to these important questions and that you have asked the Sister Superior to supply milk as the only beverage at meals for children under twelve. I have noted that it is your programme to give a generous helping of butter once a day to each pupil.\n\nYou will please make arrangements to definitely instruct the older boys at the school in farming, gardening and the care of stock. It is important that the graduates are well trained in this respect.\n\nThe Department is pleased to note that you are bending every energy towards improved maintenance and instruction of the Indian children in your care.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

On the first date the midday meal was inspected and the Supervisor advised that the children be given more milk and more varied diet. To cope with the milk demand the Sister Superior has purchased two good Holstein milch cows which have been added to the herd.\n\nPupils were not in the classroom, they were employed on garden, farm and household duties.\n\nThe senior teacher was sick and may have to be replaced.\n\nJ. H. Gooderham,\nAgent.\nAt the Crowfoot Roman Catholic School everything seemed to be in good order. The school, as usual, was spotless from top to bottom, and the children appeared healthy and well-cared for.\n\nThe farming operations at the school showed a great improvement since my last visit. The crop, I believe, was light this year owing to the dry weather, but it had all been harvested and threshed, and I found 100 acres of summerfallow in first class shape. In general, conditions were very favorable.\n\nThe Sister Superior, who is in charge, informed me that she was to be transferred some time in the near future. I must say that I regretted to hear this, as she has been a hard worker at this school, and I have found her to be very capable in carrying out her duties. She will be greatly missed at this institution, no matter who may come to take her place.\nCrime Report.\n\nRe- George Many Shots - Blackfoot Indian Boy.\nCrowfoot School - Alta - Common Assault.\n\nOn Tuesday the 25th inst., the Rev. J. Rigou head of the Catholic School at Crowfoot, Blackfoot Indian Reserve, laid an information before G.H. Gooderham I.A., charging George Many Shots, a pupil of Crowfoot School, that he on the 27th inst., at Crowfoot School, did assault him contrary to Section 291 of the Criminal Code of Canada.

Many Shots to help him, both boys then came upon Father Rion, raising their fists, and striking him. He at once called for the Janitor, and had the two boys locked up. Both are under 15 yrs of age, but big boys for their age.\n\nAt their trial, when asked by the court why they acted as told in evidence, stated that there was too much praying and work at school, and when they had to go to bed, they were not allowed to move or talk.\n\nThe Court wanted the parents of these boys to inflict the punishment, they refused, but consented in writing, giving Mr. Gooderham permission to do so himself. A cane was used, each given several strokes on the hands, and few across the back. Parents were present, and apparently satisfied. Both boys have been expelled from the School.

Worsley\nAssistant Commissioner.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nM. Enc.\nOttawa, May 14th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge, with thanks, receipt of copies of the reports from the officer Commanding at Lethbridge, Alta., in connection with the cases of common assault committed by Simon Wolf Leg and George Many Shots, former pupils of the Crowfoot Indian Residential School. The action taken in the case of these two boys is noted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThe Commissioner,\nRoyal Canadian Mounted Police,\nOttawa, Ont.\nI might say that the school is having a lot of trouble with boys running away and on some occasions lately the Principal informed me that some of the bigger boys, when the bell was rung for school, paid no attention to it, defying the authorities at the school. The trouble, in my opinion, is that the Rev. Fr. Riou has evidently lost control of the boys. He admitted himself that he had not been feeling well for the last year or so and could not cope with the situation and that he had already asked His Lordship the Bishop for an assistant principal, and I think it would be well for the Department to insist on the Church authorities sending a younger man there to assist Fr. Riou.\nA favourable report is made on the farming operations at the Crowfoot School. They have a good farm at that point and as time passes it will improve. They have the right idea of giving the children a good training on the land. The transfer of Sister Gilbert from this school was a great loss, as I consider she was not only a matron, but had practically the full management of the school; in fact Fr. Riou had little to do with it, further than to look after the spiritual welfare of the children. I note the Inspector points out that Father Riou has not been well for the past year or so. He is not an old man, and it seems to me that there is only work for one man at a school of this kind. I doubt very much whether it would be well to have an assistant to work under Father Riou's direction. I am told that Sister Gilbert's successor is a very capable woman, who was transferred from the Superiorship of the Lacombe Home near Calgary.\nOttawa, May 23, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department is desirous of learning if the elder girls at the Crowfoot Indian Residential School are being trained in milking work. As most of the graduates of your school will return to reserves that are largely farming communities, it is very important that the girls be fully competent in this particular. The Department expects that the elder girls, under proper supervision, will be given a course of instruction in milking, and I shall be pleased to learn that suitable arrangements have been made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. J. Rigby, O. M. I.,\nPrincipal,\nCrowfoot Indian Res.

He has more than 20 years' experience at Indian schools in western Canada. He is a mechanic, carpenter, musician and artist as well as a farmer. He should be a good man for this Institution. Senior pupils are very bright, in fact, they are the most intelligent children I have seen at any time on this reserve. The Juniors are doing alright in class work but the small children looked tired and physically below par. They need more rest\u2014this is more important than 5 A.M. mass. Surely some other time can be chosen for this religious instruction.\n\nG. H. Gooderham.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 15, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to your May report on the Crowfoot Indian Residential School. You refer to S.A.M. Mass. Please inform the Reverend Principal that the Department cannot allow formal religious exercises for pupils at Indian residential schools earlier than 6:30 in the summer months and 7 o'clock during the winter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.F.

June 9th, 1933.\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nI have the honour to report that on a recent visit to the Blackfoot Reserve I called at the Crowfoot Indian Residential School and found things there in very good condition. The children looked well and everything around the school was in good order.\n\nThe school authorities were getting through seeding and were working on the gardens, &c.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE\n\nPB CALGARY, ALTA., June 12th, 1936.\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nAfter having read my report on the Crowfoot R. C. School at Cluny; also my letter in connection with the care of the children, I trust the following will be given consideration:\n\nWhen the new school year commences on September 1st I would recommend that another sister be added to the staff, and that a grant be given to the school sufficient to take care of her salary and board. The Principal pays the sisters at the rate of $15.00 per month, and therefore I would say that if the school received an additional grant of $25.00 or $30.00 a month, this would take care of both salary and board. If the Department have not funds available, I know the Blackfoot Band would take care of this extra expenditure, as I believe they appreciate what is being done for the T.B. children. If they had the proper room to take care of these children it would make it much easier on the staff. The boys are at one end of the building and the girls at the other and someone has to be there all the time watching them. The Sister Superior was taking this matter up with her Mother House.\n\nI shall be glad to have your decision in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nDoctor Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nJune 17, 1936.\n\nDear Mr. Christianson:\n\nI have your 401-11A. R.C. of the 12th instant, recommending that a grant be provided towards the salary of another Sister on the staff at the Crowfoot Indian Residential School, and stating that, if no funds are available in the Appropriation for this purpose, the Blackfoot Band would likely take care of the extra expenditure required.\n\nWhile the Department is aware of the difficulty under which the staff are carrying on the work, owing to lack of proper accommodation, I would point out that it has not been the practice to provide any grant towards teachers' salaries at the residential schools. There are no funds available for this purpose in the Appropriation for Indian Education, and, as you are, no doubt, aware, no part of the cost of education is chargeable to the funds of any of the Indian Bands. I regret that it will not be possible to favourably consider your recommendation in providing for an additional Sister to the staff.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nM. Christianson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nCalgary, Alta.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE\nPB CALGARY, ALTA., June 12th, 1936.\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nI have the honour to report on an inspection of the Crowfoot School which was done yesterday; I wish to point out to the Department that the Staff of this school have had a very difficult proposition to deal with during the past year. As you are aware, a T.B. clinic was conducted by the Keith Sanatorium last September, and about 30 children were placed under observation and 13 cases of active tuberculosis were discovered. To carry out instructions as to treatment has made it very difficult for the school, and the regulations have been followed faithfully and the children have been given three meals and two lunches every day, which has meant a great deal of extra work. Also, it has not been possible to carry out the training in household science for the girls and manual training for the boys, as extensively as heretofore. The Staff have done their level best in meeting the situation.\n\nAt the time of my visit there were 80 children on the register. Thirty of these are T.B. suspects and 13 active T.B. cases, the latter being kept in bed most of the time.\n\nDoctor Harold W. McGill,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nThe children all looked very well, and from a layman's point of view, one would not imagine any of them were suffering from T.B.\n\nClothing - Ample; several changes for both boys and girls.\n\nFood - Good. The children are given 3 meals and 2 lunches daily.\n\nThe girls who are able to work help with the housework, cooking, making bread, &c., and receive the usual training given in these institutions, but on account of several of the girls being unable to work on account of the tuberculosis, a great deal of extra work has been thrown on the Sisters.\n\nThe boys milk the cows, look after the garden, help on the farm and in a general way help with all the outside work.\n\nThe school building was as well kept as possible. Furniture and furnishings are all in good order. The building is beginning to need a great deal of repair work and this will be dealt with in a separate letter.\n\nThe machinery is in a fair state of repair. I wish to point out that the laundry is very old and out of date, and they have neither a mangle nor a dryer. With a good engineer there they keep the machinery in good working order.\n\nThe barn is in a very good state of repair except that it is badly in need of painting, as the paint is practically washed off the shingles and walls.\nFarming Operations:\n\nThis spring the school seeded 30 acres of wheat, 135 acres of oats, and put in 5 acres of garden.\n\nThey have 54 head of cattle of which 24 are cows, and 16 were being milked at the time of my visit. The children get all the milk they can drink and butter is on the table for every meal, as they churn 3 times a week. They have 300 chickens and a few pigs.\n\nFrom personal observation I would say the children are well cared for in every way.\n\nThey have a good staff at the school; as I stated in my last report there was a new Sister Superior, and she is giving excellent service, and things have greatly improved since she took charge. They also have a good engineer now, as well as a good farmer who has brought about quite a change in the method of farming and the quality of the milch cows, &c. Father Riou has an Assistant in the person of Father G. A. Levasseur. He was ordained a year ago and joined the school staff as Assistant Principal last fall. The Staff consists of 10 Sisters, the Principal, Assistant Principal, Engineer and Farmer, a total of 14.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nJune 26, 1936.\n\nDear Mr. Christianson:\n\nYou are, no doubt, aware it was the intention to erect an addition to the present building at the Crowfoot Indian Residential School, on the Blackfoot Reserve, to provide accommodation, primarily, for 30 Roman Catholic tubercular Indian children of the reserve. However, owing to definite instructions for a drastic cut in the appropriation for the current fiscal year, it was found impossible to obtain the funds - approximately $50,000.00 - required to erect the addition. Pressure is being made by the Church and School authorities to have this work carried out.\n\nAs you will remember, at the time the present building at the Old Sun's Residential School was erected, the Indians of the Band petitioned that the sum of $50,000 be loaned from the Interest Funds at their credit in the Department, and this amount was used towards the cost of the erection of the building. It is possible that the Indians would consent to relinquish, from the Interest Funds at their credit, the sum of $50,000.00, to carry out the extension to the Crowfoot School building. I would request that you take up this matter with the Band in Council, with a view to obtaining a resolution, authorizing the Department to utilize funds to the above amount from their Interest Funds to carry out the work. Mr. Agent Gooderham and yourself should discuss this matter with the Indians and, if possible, obtain their consent. The Department is desirous to proceed with the work at as early a date as possible, but the only way it could be done would be to\n\nM. Christianson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nCalgary, Alta.\nobtain the amount required by the consent of the Band, from their Interest Funds. You might report the result of your conference with the Indians, and, if you obtain a resolution of the Band, setting aside the amount mentioned above, you should forward same to the Department.\n\nThe Department will await your report as to the results achieved.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMOA337 51 COLLECT NL XU\n\nSTANDARD TIME\n\nCALGARY ALTA 30\n\nDR HAROLD W MCGILL\n\nDEPUTY SUPT GENERAL DEPT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS OTTAWA ONT\n\nRE PROPOSED LOAN FROM BLACKFOOT BAND OF FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR BUILDING ADDITION TO CROWFOOT SCHOOL I HAVE ARRANGED TO MEET INDIANS FRIDAY STOP PLEASE WIRE REPLY BY RETURN TO FOLLOWING QUESTIONS STOP WILL INDIANS RECEIVE USUAL GOVERNMENT INTEREST ON LOAN AND FOR APPROXIMATELY HOW LONG WILL LOAN BE REQUIRED\n\nM CHRISTIANSON.\n\nThis is a Collect message and will be charged to your account unless we are notified at once to the contrary.\nSend the following message, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\nOttawa, July 2, 1936.\n\nM.

When Government Interest at 5% is added it will bring the credit of the Interest Account to $956,930.88. There has been approved by the Minister, for expenditure from interest funds during this fiscal year, the sum of $112,411.00.\n\nIn connection with the use of $50,000.00 from interest funds, I would remind you that in 1930, in the months of February and March, the sum of $60,000.00 was taken from the interest account for expenditure on the erection of Old Sun Boarding School. No part of this loan has been repaid to Band Funds nor has the band received any interest on the $60,000.00 advanced.\n\nTo protect the Band's interest in the building, insurance was placed on the building in July, 1933 necessitating a premium of $800.11 being paid from the interest account of the band.

The same to be returned to our Band Funds at such time as the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, acting in our behalf, may determine, and that current rate of Interest be paid to our funds each and every year until such time as the principal sum is repaid. And it is also asked that the said Department of Indian Affairs will protect the interest of our Band by having the proposed addition adequately insured against fire during the tenure of this loan. And in this we act on behalf of the whole of our Band.\"\nI beg to recommend, for approval, the acceptance of the above offer of the Band, on the conditions as set forth in the resolution. It will be necessary to obtain an Order in Council, authorizing the use of the funds of the Band for the purpose mentioned and approving of the terms upon which the loan is made.\n\nI should be pleased to be advised if you approve accepting the offer of the Indians of the Blackfoot Band and if it will be in order to take the necessary steps to proceed with the work.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nGleichen, Alta., Oct. 6, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit the following report for the month of September 1936.\n\nSCHOOLS:\n\nCrowfoot school was inspected. There are 3 classes with a change of teachers in the senior and primary rooms. The Nursing Sister looks after the T.B.'s only. All bigger boys returned and new pupils are being enrolled. Two girls went to the Lacrosse Home for their final year. All was good order and running smoothly, and the T.B.'s were getting proper attention. At Old Sun's pupils were busy and all new pupils of age 7 admitted. A nursing matron has been added to the staff.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nBlackfoot Reserve, Nov. 1936.\n\nI beg to submit the following report for the month of November 1936.\n\nSCHOOLS:\n\nCrowfoot school only was inspected. Classes were good, midday meal fine and the sick pupils well looked after.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nBlackfoot Reserve.\n\nI beg to report for the month of December, 1936.\n\nSchools.\n\nAll went along smoothly at the schools. Christmas concerts and feasts were given and pupils were allowed to go home for three days between the holidays. The pupils at the Crowfoot School are particularly well trained in singing and orchestra work. Their concert was excellent.\n\nG. H.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The average capital per day for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Crowfoot Ind.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Crowfoot Ind.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return, and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby Certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Blackfoot Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1941.\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated September 30, 1941.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nBLACKFOOT AGENCY\n\nDated at OCTOBER 1941.\n\nthis GLEICHEN, Alta., 1941.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. L.A. 403\n\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Redacted] Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1941.\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated December 31, 1941\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Blackfoot Agency, Dec. 31, 1941\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRep.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days of residence of all pupils entered on the Return, and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Blackfoot Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1942.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated June 30th, 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nBLACKFOOT AGENCY.\n\nDated at GLEICHEN, Alta., July 7, 1942.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case shall any payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n|

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days present of all pupils whose name appears on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A.403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days of residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days attended by all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Crowfoot Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: June 30, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: July 4, 1944\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 460\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days pupils are shown on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pagging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in absence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the number of days in quarter.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils actually attending school.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils are enrolled during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the BLACKFOOT INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended JUNE 30, 1944.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nBLACKFOOT AGENCY\n\nDated at GLEICHEN, ALTA., this 1944.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 408\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cDays pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, tagging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..................................................

PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days present at all times during the quarter and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils present.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................School for the Quarter ended .................................................. 19......\n\nPrincipal ..............................................................\n\nDated .................................................. 19......\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent ..............................................................\n\nDated at .................................................. this .................................................. 19......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I A 408\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per pupil grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payments be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the GRODNO INDIAN RES.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nthis\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paginating No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days the attendance of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, can payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated March 31st 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated at Blackfoot Agency MAR 31 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFonds No. I.A. 409 Reps.

No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days pupils in residence during quarter, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the CROWFOOT INDIAN RES.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case shall any payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the GLEICHEN INDIAN RES.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days present of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the CROWFOOT INDIAN RESIDENCE SCHOOL, GLIECHEN, ALBERTA School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1947.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated December 31, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated at CROWFOOT AGENCY, this January 3, 1948.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payments be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the GROUPE INDIAN RESIDENCE SCHOOL CLINTON, ALBERTA School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1948.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: March 31st 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly filled out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at BLACKFOOT AGENCY APRIL 5th 1948\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403 R. 3444\n### INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Blackfoot Agency**\n\n**GROUPE INDIEN RESIDENCE**\n\n**School at:** [Blank]\n\n**Reserve for Quarter ended:** March 31, 1948\n\n**REPORT of the**\n\n**CLASS OR STUDY**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | BAND OR RESERVE |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----|-----|------|-----------------|\n| 0214            | Morrison, M.

Quarter**\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in quarter all pupils ended on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ____________________________ School for the Quarter ended _______________.\n\nPrincipal ____________________________\n\nDated ____________________________\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent ____________________________\n\nDated ____________________________\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nR. 3444\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Blackfoot Agency**\n\n**REPORT OF the School at Blackfoot Reserve for Quarter ended 30th Oct. 1948**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS          | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE, DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|--------------------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|--------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 0216            | Kathleen Half Horse      | 7   |     |      |                |                    |                        | Jan. 20, 47                | 92 -

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of pupils in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the CROWFOOT INDIAN RES.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet or the Return, use another sheet, piling it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is obtained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 1st 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated APR 4 1950\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 408\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Blackfoot Agency**\n\n**School at:** Blackfoot Reserve\n\n**Reserve for Quarter ended:** March 31st, 1950\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS       | AGE | BOY | GIRL | BAND OR RESERVE | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE, DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|-----------------------|-----|-----|------|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 0229            | Maria Hab.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of this Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, may payments be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the CROWFOOT INDIAN RESIDENCE SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended January 30th 1956.\n\nPrincipal A.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the OLD SUN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended SEPTEMBER 30 1950\n\nPrincipal (Rev.)

RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days mentioned in all cases entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payments be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 2nd, 1950.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Blackfoot Agency Oct 11, 1950.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. IA 403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS          | AGE | SEX | CLASS ON STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|--------------------------|-----|-----|---------------|-------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|------------|\n| 0229            | Marie Rab.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for whose grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupil in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the rate fixed for the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the CROWFOOT INDIAN RES.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days of residence of all pupils entering the Return and is determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case shall any payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grants is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means everyday in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days pupils are in all rooms entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due per quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the CROWFOOT INDIAN RES.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The column of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI declare that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1951.\n\nPrincipal: A. Charon\n\nDated October 1st, 1951.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at BLACKFOOT AGENCY OCT 5, 1951\n\nGLEICHEN, ALTA.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, posting No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Peget,\nAccountant.\n\nThe Manager,\nBank of Toronto,\nCalgary, Alta.\nMontreal, P.Q., Canada February 25/24\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir-\n\nWe duly received your letter of the 30th ultimo in regard to the Linabestos fireproof Wallboard at present stored at the Crowfoot School, and are sorry to note your attitude in this connection.\n\nAs formerly advised you, our factory records show that this material was shipped according to your order in first class condition. We therefore cannot account for the breakages of which you complained, and are much inclined to think that they were due to some defect in the sheathing or lumber to which the Linabestos was applied, or probably in the manner of application; circumstances which we are in no way responsible for. Other shipments of this material made at the same time and in the same way as that sent to the Crowfoot School were found eminently satisfactory. This goes to substantiate our claim that the material was not faulty.\n\nDespite this, however, we have made every possible effort to dispose of this material for you but regret we have been unable to place it, owing to the depressed state of the building trade in the West and on account of there being so little demand for materials of this nature in the rural districts surrounding the school. We think, however, you could advantageously use this fireproof, permanent material to good advantage in the School building, as its return to Lachine is out of the question on account of excessive freight rates and the likelihood of damage if improperly loaded.\nWe assuredly regret the circumstances very much indeed, but believe on reviewing the matter fully you will appreciate that we cannot accept any responsibility and that we are not to blame in any way for the unfortunate experience.\n\nYours very truly\n\nASBESTOS MANUFACTURING CO. LIMITED\n\n[Signature]\n\nSales Department\nMr E. Gariner Smith\nCleichen Alta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe beg to submit the following price for changing the wiring and installing two 8\" fire gongs and changing the whole system over to work from the Lighting plant, as requested by the Principal.\n\nWe can make this change as stated above for the sum of Seventy Five Dollars.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nBrotherston Electric Co Ltd\n\n[Signature]\n\nMgr.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe- Electric Lighting of Crowfoot School.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Reverend Principal is desirous that the fire alarm system be extended to include two more fire-gongs, and that the gongs be connected to the lighting system instead of using dry cell batteries as they have had to do in the past. This could be accomplished by reducing the electric current through a rheostat at the switchboard in the engine room. The electric bells in the building would be similarly operated.\n\nI enclose an estimate from Brotherston Electric Co. of $75.00 covering this work, and I would respectfully ask if it is the Department's wish that this additional outlay be incurred.\n\nI was at the Crowfoot School on the 25th & 26th insts. and carefully checked up the work being performed by Brotherston Co. The wiring of the school was completed, and the pole line to the other buildings was finished, but the wiring was not yet carried into the outbuildings. The generating plant had arrived, and was well mounted on a suitable base in the engine room of the school. The switch board was set up, but an addition to same was being procured from Calgary, on which the controls, fuses, etc., will be mounted that are required for the outbuildings. The storage batteries were also in place. The acetylene plant was being taken out, and the first electric light was being delivered to some of the rooms on the 26th inst. The lighting fixtures had arrived, and are now being hung. I was fully satisfied with the manner in which the contract is being carried out. The local engineer is working with Mr. Brotherston and is being instructed along technical lines in the operation of the plant. On the completion of the contract the work will all be inspected by the official inspector of the Western Canada Fire Underwriters Association, and his certificate procured.\n\nThe generating plant has sustained an injury, presumably while in transit, which is shown by a crack across the casting which encloses the outer end of the generator. This casting also serves as a bearing for the generator shaft. Mr. Brotherston suggested that the crack be repaired by oxy-acetylene welding, which he thought would be equal to new, but I objected to this and stated that the Department would insist on a new casting to replace the damaged one.\nAs the crack does not yet extend all the way across the casting, it is not likely to cause any interruption to the lighting service while the new part is being procured.\n\nThe engine room of the School, in which the electric plant is being installed, and which also contains the pumping plant, has a very poor cement floor. Owing to either poor workmanship when the floor was laid, or else to the settlement of the building, the floor now slopes away from the floor drain in the centre, and is lowest along the walls, where water often lies. The surface is also badly cracked in places. The Rev. Principal is desirous that this room be kept in a clean and tidy condition,\u2014particularly since the new lighting plant has been installed there\u2014and has asked that a new surface be laid on the existing floor with grade from all sides to the existing floor drain in the centre. This room measures 15'x 26'. To lay a new floor averaging 3\" in thickness, properly graded, and with 1\" wearing surface, would cost about $30.00 in labour and materials. I told the Rev. Principal that I would refer his request to the Department, and be guided by your instructions in this matter as well as in the matter of the fire gongs mentioned in the first part of this letter.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\nThe Secretary:\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nRe--Electric Lighting of Crowfoot School, Cluny.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to advise you that I have today issued a second certificate to the Brotherston Electric Company, Limited, Calgary, being a payment of 90% of the value of labor and material supplied to date.\n\nThe work in connection with this contract is now well advanced, and the electric lighting of the school is being provided. In about a fortnight the work will be entirely completed and a final certificate issued.\n\nI have inspected the payroll of the contractors and find that all labor is paid to date. The materials are also being paid for as the payments fall due.\n\nWill you kindly let me have a further supply of certificate blanks and diary sheets.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMarch 3, [Year]\nOttawa, March 11,\n1924.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 28th ultimo with reference to the electric lighting plants now being installed at the Crowfoot School, I beg to say that the Department approves of your action in refusing the contractor permission to repair the injury to the generator, and that he must furnish new parts to replace the damaged ones.\n\nWith reference to the additional work asked for, I beg to say that the Department cannot approve of any additional expenditure on this plant and it is thought with reference to the concrete flooring that if the Department will supply the material that the school could undertake the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

It is needless for me to state that the buildings are depreciating rapidly for want of paint. I would be glad to have your authority to spend $500 or $600 to have this work done; it may take a little more, but the utmost economy will be exercised in getting the work done.\n\nI would draw your attention, at the same time, to the fact that this school has recently been remodelled throughout the inside, and brick veneered outside, and the building presents a nice appearance. The roofing, however, is much in need of paint, in fact the shingles are quite bare in places.\n\nIf this is unsatisfactory, perhaps the work could be done for $500.00. I have no estimate at the present time; but there is no doubt in my mind the work should be done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

I visited the Blood, Peigan, Sarcee, Blackfoot, Hobbema and Edmonton Agencies, and eight Indian Boarding Schools.\n\nI visited the Crowfoot School, which is under the direction of the Sisters of Providence. I found this Institution in its usual good order. The place was scrupulously clean from attic to basement. The school had recently been given a quarter section of land, on which I am told they are going to carry on farming in a small way. I hope it will be in a small way.\n\nThere is a shortage of water, even though we provided a well here last year. This will be reported upon separately.\n\nMight I ask, while we are on the subject of this school, what steps have been taken to remove the linabestos board, which is piled in the warehouse at the school. This is taking up valuable space which cannot be spared.\n\n(Sgd.) W. M. Graham.\n\nW. M.

MacKenzie, Acting Assist. Sec'y,\nYour file 104-2-5D\n\nWe have just received your letter of April 26th in connection with the Linabestos which we supplied for the Crowfoot School, and may respectfully make exception to the word \"unsatisfactory\" if same is intended to apply to the condition and nature of said material. As we informed you before, the Linabestos shipped for this order was strictly in accordance with your request. It was dispatched from our factory at Lachine in first class condition, as all reports go to show. If the material was not suitable for your requirements then the fault is not ours nor should you try to hold us responsible for same, as we shipped exactly according to your order Linabestos fireproof wallboard, the quality of which was unquestionable.\n\nWe are very much inclined to think that the inconvenience you have been caused was due to improper application or to the unsuitability for material of this nature of the building to which you applied it. We regret your decision to hand this over to the Department of Justice, as we have assured you from time to time that we were making every effort to dispose of the material for your account in the West. Heretofore we have been unsuccessful, but now the spring building season is just opening up, so that the prospects for early disposal look much brighter than in the past winter months. We would therefore ask you to give us sufficient time to place the material elsewhere, and again assure you we will make every effort to do so without delay.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nASBESTOS MANUFACTURING CO. LIMITED\n\nSales Department\nOttawa, May 7, 1924.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 26th ultimo with further reference to the Linabestos stored at the Crowfoot School, I beg to say that I will withhold referring this matter to the Department of Justice, until the end of this month, in order to give you an opportunity of disposing of this material.\n\nUnless I hear from you before May 31, the matter will be dealt with as mentioned in my letter of the 26th ultimo.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nAsbestos Mfg. Co.,\nMontreal, Que.\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that the Asbestos Manufacturing Company of Lachine, P.Q., which had the contract to supply \"Linabestos\" for Crowfoot School in 1922 and on arrival was found unsuited for the purpose for which it was intended still have their stuff here occupying valuable space on the school premises. Would you please have this firm remove this from the school premises as early as possible as the space occupied by them is urgently required for school purposes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst: Deputy & Secretary,\nDept: of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa, May 12, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant with reference to the Lina-\nbestos that is stored at the Crowfoot School, and in reply to say that I have been in correspondence\nwith the Asbestos Mfg. Co. recently, with reference to this matter.\n\nI may say that they have been given until the 31st of May to dispose of the Lina-bestos. If no action\nis taken to have same removed by that time, the Depart-\nment will make arrangements for the removal of this\nmaterial.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG.H.

If possible, competitive prices should be obtained, and the purchase made from the firm quoting the lowest price. Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred for each of the schools separately should be forwarded, together with an abstract showing the firms asked to quote and the prices quoted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Gooderham Indian Agent\nGlencoe\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 19th last re application for lumber for fence in front of the Creaseet School, and in reply to say the 18 pieces 6x6x7 will not be sufficient for the intended work. I applied for 18 pieces 6x6x12, this was leaving us with 6 posts short, these we would have provided ourselves, but as things are Sister Superior does not seem to be in a position to make any other expenses besides what she has done in buying oil for floors. So it means the fence cannot be built unless you supply us with 10 extra more pieces 6x6x12 or 360 ft of lumber. The Depart. cannot refuse this if the mistake in making the application was explained to them. The Bill for the material supplied will be sent to your office certified correct unless you have objection to it. I believe it amounts to $32.50.\n\nYours truly,\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nSir,\n\nHerewith please find attached a letter received by me from the Principal, Crowfoot School, which explains itself.\n\nAuthority was given to erect this fence by departmental letter of the 25th June, File 104-2-5, but in applying for this authority I underestimated the amount of material required by 6 posts. Rather than hold up the work I have given authority for the 6 posts required and ask that the Department approve of my action in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.H.

The principal will assume the erection if the Department will supply the material.\n\nI have secured a bill of material and a working plan.\n\nThe material will cost approximately $120, and I would ask that authority be granted to purchase in the usual way, as the request is justified.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.H.

The treads are badly worn on stairs going to the basement; some material is on hand from last year.\n\nRepair and lining of two porches leading to the basement from the rear of the building - estimated cost $130. The present porches are dilapidated and not weatherproof; they are necessary and should be repaired before winter.\n\nTwo bins for use in kitchen pantry. The Sister Superior has been asking for these bins for two years. No doubt they are necessary. Estimated cost $40.\n\nTwo Bread boxes - estimated cost $30. These are wanted for use in the dining room. At present there are none.\n\nThe above cover the extraordinary requirements not already granted; please advise me as soon as possible whether any or all will be authorized.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nBest, Deputy & Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 6, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th, recommending that authority be granted for certain repairs and additions to the Crowfoot Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is considered that the repairs to the stairs and the repairs and lining of two porches, as well as the supplying of two bins for use in the kitchen pantry and two bread boxes, should be carried out by the school management. We have no funds available in our appropriation for the present fiscal year to provide for the expenditure required in carrying out the above work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nG. H. Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to inform you that The United and Electric Company of Alberta will have completed their line to supply lighting power to Cluny and Gleichen within the next two weeks, and the principal of the Crowfoot School proposes to put in a transformer at Cluny within the next four weeks if the department will agree to take the power at the rate set forth when the Indians surrendered a right of way.\n\nI have not a copy of the surrender here, and do not know the rates quoted, but there is no doubt in my mind the Department should take advantage of the power which passes right by the door of the school, as it would certainly be economy. I am told that the cost of putting in a transformer at the school will be $100.00. If you will advise me by wire if I may do this I will have the necessary action taken.\n\nWhen this is done I would recommend that the electric lighting plant which is a new Lister Truston 6 KW plant be taken out of this school and installed in the new St. Paul's school on the Blood Reserve, and the Department will thereby be saved an expenditure of possibly $3000.00. You will see from this that prompt action is necessary.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.\n\nOct. 1st, 1924\n\nThe question of lighting the Old Sun's School in the same way is one that should receive the immediate consideration of the Department and if this is done the plant that is in use there can be transferred to the Union Lake School. We also have a plant in the hospital there which could be used at some other point at a later date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. J. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, October 7, 1924.\n\nW. M. GRAHAM,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nReference your letter second instant you may install transformer Crowfoot school at cost of one hundred dollars - STOP -\n\nFuture of present generating plant can be decided by letter which follows upon Architect's return - STOP - If only cost for similar change at Old Suns school is that of transformer you may take similar action - STOP - School authorities must be responsible for charges for current used.\n\nJ.

GOODERHAM,\nINDIAN AGENT, GLEICHEN, ALTA., Dated Sept. 29,\nEstimates, Blackfoot Agency, 1925-26.\n\nThe Crowfoot School barn is now too small to house\nthe stock and is also poorly laid out. It is 36' x 60' with\nstalls for 8 horses and 10 cows, a feed room on the ground\nfloor and a good loft above. It is recommended that it be\nextended 40' and the loft carried throughout; the extension\nto be used for horses only and the existing stable to be\nremodelled into a cow barn. I enclose a small rough plan\nof suggested changes and an endeavour to economize and\nutilize space to advantage has been made. The present barn\nwas built in 1912 and since then this Institution has\nincreased its farming pursuits and the stock is being\nmaterially increased.\n\nAs mixed farming and care of stock is an\nimportant branch of the School work, the larger barn is a\nnecessity. No silo is included for the obvious reason that,\nto date, ensilage has not been grown in sufficient\nquantities to justify the expense.\nThis work which was supposed to be done during the present fiscal year would be a complement to the magnificent work undertaken by the Department a couple of years ago. A sum of $500.00 would be necessary for such purpose and I hereby request that it be included in the estimates.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nNoted & Estimates\nEXTRACT FROM AGENT'S REPORT FOR THE MONTH OF OCTOBER, 1924, ON THE CROWFOOT RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nThis institution is now using light supplied by the United Electric Engineering Co. and the plant formerly in use has been shipped to the Blood Reserve. The light is cheaper than can be supplied by the plant and is giving satisfaction. It is hoped that in the near future all institutions will have this power, not only for light but also for all other essential purposes. It would, I believe, be a great economy to supplant all gas engines with electric motors.\n\n[Signature]\n\nNov 12/24\nCLUNY, Alta., Oct 31/24\n\nMest Indian Affairs Indian Education Vote.\n\nGleichen Alta.

Authority should be given to make the change as soon as possible, as the engines are a source of trouble and expense. The motors could be secured for about $400, I believe, though I have not yet gotten definite figures. I recommend that the Department give this matter consideration immediately.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nThey have agreed to meet from Mr. Graham.\nOttawa, December 22, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer to that portion of your report for the month of November in which you recommend that motors be supplied the Crowfoot Indian Residential School, to replace the gas engine used to pump water and to operate the laundry machinery. As the institution has gas engines for this purpose, the cost of changing to motors, if they wish to use electricity, will have to be met from school funds.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

I might inform you that some time ago the Department refused this request, on the grounds that the school had gas engines and if they wished other equipment the school management should meet the expense. This last report of the Indian agent, indicating that the gas engines are worn out, puts a somewhat different complexion on the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, April 17, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that that portion of your March report on the Crowfoot Indian Residential School, relative to the advisability of replacing the gas engines with electric motors, is being referred to Mr. Indian Commissioner Graham, for his recommendation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nG. H. Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\nOttawa, April 23, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nThere is an item in the Indian Education Estimates for painting the roof of the Crowfoot Indian Residential School. In this connection see your 401-11A of April 5, 1924, and your estimates for the Blackfoot agency. You are authorized to make the necessary arrangements for this painting and your estimate of $200 should not be exceeded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 17th instant 104-2-5, informing me that Indian Agent Gooderham has reported that the engines at the Crowfoot School are constantly in need of repairs to keep them in working order, and recommends that motors be installed at this institution and the engines discarded.\n\nI am not prepared at the present time to make this recommendation. I, like the Department, feel that if the engines are doing the work they should continue to use them. However, I shall be going to the Blackfoot Agency some time in the near future, and will then go into the whole question and see what can be done.\n\nIt seems to me that we are coming to the point where everything that is required at our Indian Schools the Department is expected to supply it. We are called upon to do five times as much as we were fifteen years ago. In the olden days the institution was prepared to bear some of the expense, but not so now.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 5th., 1925.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nReferring to your letter of the 11th October 1924, enclosing voucher No. 264 in favour of the Rocky Mountain Paint Company Ltd., I beg to say that there was an error of $3.00 in the first item which is extended at $43.00 instead of $40.00. An overpayment of $3.00 being made to that firm, I have to request that you will obtain a refund with the least possible delay.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.H. Paget\nChief Accountant and Purchasing Agent.\n\nG.H. Gooderham Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit the following report for the month of March 1925:\n\nSCHOOLS\n\nCrowfoot was visited on the 20th. Children were well, the work well under hand and the Institution orderly and spotlessly clean. The matter of motors to supplant gas engines for pumping and operating the laundry was gone into and the writer seriously recommends the change. The gas engines are worn and require repairs - this is costly. Their value in present condition is estimated at $150.00. Two motors and cost of installation could be secured I believe, for about $40.00. The expenditure is justifiable in my opinion and I believe that the Dept. should assume the obligation.\n\nG. H.

The shed in question is situated on a quarter section which adjoins the Crowfoot Indian Boarding School, which was taken over for use by the school, but no compensation was made to Little Light for the shed and it still remains on the original site. I recommend therefore that it be taken over by the Department and later it can either be sold to another Indian or put to good use by the Farming Instructor. The amount of the voucher will be employed in paying the debts of Little Light, and for the purpose should be forwarded to the Agent \"In Trust\". The voucher is for $294.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nM. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI beg to forward herewith and recommend for payment Blackfoot Agency voucher #143 in favor of the Crown Lumber Company for $25.15. This lumber was purchased to make a culvert on the side of the road allowance at the drive entrance to Crowfoot School. The necessity for putting in this culvert is due for the most part to the rush of water from the flowing well on the land occupied by Duck Chief, which is directly opposite the school. In view of the circumstances therefore I think this is a fair charge against Band Funds, and I beg to recommend the voucher for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nM. Graham\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI have received a letter from Mr. G.H. Gooderham, Indian Agent at the Blackfoot Agency pointing out that the heating boiler at the Crowfoot School is in need of repairs. He reports that the arch and fire brick were in bad condition during the early part of the year, but weather conditions necessitated the use of the boiler as long as possible. It should be repaired before next winter and an estimate forwarded by the Agent shows that the sum of $117.00 will be required to replace the fire brick including the arch and bridging and furnish a new cast iron arch over the fire door. I shall be glad if the Department will give me authority to incur this expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\n\nREGINA, SASK., August 21st, 1925.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of a telegram from the Indian Agent at Gleichen, which reads as follows:\n\n\"Two hundred forty-five dollars have been expended in painting roof and cupola of Crowfoot stop painter estimates that two hundred dollars further will cover cost of painting verandahs and other necessary exterior work stop Principal states that Father Guy informed him that five hundred dollars allowed for this work stop will you authorize the further expenditure.\"\n\n(Sgd.) G.H. Gooderham.\n\nA year ago I took up with the Department the matter of painting the outbuildings at the Crowfoot School and also the roof of the school building. I received a reply from you stating that there was no money available to paint the roof of the school, but that I could spend $600.00 on re-painting the outbuildings, which was done in 1924.\n\nThis spring the Department took up with me the matter of painting the roof, which could not be painted in 1924, and informed me that there was $300.00 available to do this work, which must not be exceeded. I passed on these instructions to the Agent and the work was done at a cost of $245.00. I am now in receipt of the above quoted telegram, which indicates that Father Guy has again been interfering and has informed the Secretary.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nPrincipal that there is $500.00 available for this work, and he naturally expects it to be spent. I took exception to Father Guy going to the Hobbema school and telling them that there was $5000.00 available for the laundry, when I was sent there to put up the laundry at the least possible cost. It seems to me a most peculiar situation to have a Priest, who is not even employed by the Department, going through the country advising the school authorities as to the amounts of money that are available for work at their schools, and on the other hand, the Department advising me that the work must be done for a certain figure which does not correspond with the amounts mentioned by the Priest. This is a most unsatisfactory way to run a business and such methods would not be applied in any business concern.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

This floor is badly needed and the Agent has again drawn my attention to the matter. I am told that the floor can be put down at a total cost of $110.00, and as this service is really necessary, the floor having been in bad shape for two years, I would recommend that the request be met.\n\nThere is another matter in connection with this institution which requires attention. In 1924 repairs were asked for two back porches but were refused owing to lack of funds. For $50.00 these two porches can be lined, the doors repaired, and the porches made water-proof. As the porches are quite a size and lead to the basement it is hoped that the authority to proceed with the work will be granted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

The Sister pointed out that their school has never had very much laundry equipment and that the Dryer which they had supplied years ago at this institution is obsolete.\n\nI am attaching hereto a cut of the Ironer which they would like to have supplied, and I believe we can buy this for considerably less than $235.00. I would be glad if you could see your way clear to authorize this purchase, as it would mean simplifying the work a great deal. I may say that I have seen one or two of these machines at work here in Regina and they appear to be very satisfactory and certainly save a great deal of labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M.

Please incur no unnecessary expense and when making purchases or engaging labour bear in mind the regulations relating thereto.\n\nI have also your 401-11A of the 24th ultimo with reference to additional laundry equipment at the school.

When this work was underway it was noticed that the boiler was settling in front and the front part was getting detached.

This is true as the present pens are in a mere shell of a building which is cool and too small. The cost of improved quarters would not be great and when figures can be obtained they will be submitted for your consideration. Ample feed has been saved for the winter but the feeding sheds erected two years ago were blown down this fall and must be rebuilt with stronger supports. This will not be costly.

I am of the opinion that a pump to suit will cost at least $50.00.\n\nG. H.

F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF MR. AGENT GOODERHAM dated June 9th, 1927, on the Crowfoot Indian Residential School, for the month of May, 1927.\n\nOriginal on File 104-2-7.\n\n\"Farm-work was in good shape and stock in fine condition. Mr. Scott, the new Farm Instructor is doing good work in his instructions to the boys in feeding and care of stock. This school needs a new pig-pen. Estimates for 1927-28 did not include this item and the Principal has been compelled to discontinue the raising of pigs until some sort of pen is supplied. Could not the Department allow sufficient money to build some pens? This should not cost $500.00.\"\nOttawa, June 18, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that Mr. Agent Gooderham strongly recommends that a hogpen be erected at the Crowfoot Indian Residential School. He states that Mr. Scott, the new farm instructor, is doing good work in his instructions to the boys in feeding and the care of stock. Please let me know if you consider this sufficiently urgent to warrant the Department making special provision at this time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, No. 104-2-5, informing me that Agent Gooderham recommends that a hog pen be erected at the Crowfoot Indian Residential School, and in reply would say that I have taken this matter up with Inspector Christianson, who has visited this school quite frequently, in fact once or twice a year, and he is of the opinion that there is no urgent necessity for a hog pen. This is borne out by the fact that it would have been inserted in the agency estimates had it been needed very badly. I will not give my recommendation until I have the Inspector look into this and if it is found necessary, an amount can be placed in next year's estimates.\n\nIf the Department have any money to spare under the School Vote, I would once again strongly urge that a residence be built for the Farming Instructor at the Gordon's Indian Residential School. This school is in far more need of additional outbuildings than any other residential school that I know of. The stables are small and inadequate to house a sufficient number of cows and the horse stable is very small. The Farming Instructor was brought from the east on the understanding that he would be given a residence. The man has arrived and he is a good man, and now we will be called upon to tell him that he will not be able to bring his wife to live with him this winter. A married instructor is necessary at this place, and I do hope that the Department will scrape up $2500.00 to meet this request as this school is deserving of some consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, School Files (RG 1C, Volume 6349, File 752-5, part 1)\nOttawa, July 6th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 401-11A R. C. of the 29th ultimo, regarding the erection of a hog pen at the Crowfoot Indian Residential School. If the Inspector considers this building is necessary, an item to provide for the cost of same might be included in next year's Estimates.\n\nRelative to the erection of a residence for the farming instructor at the Gordon's Indian Residential School, I beg to say that, as you have already been advised, no funds are available for this purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

General.\n\nOriginal on\n\nRE SCHOOLS\n\nCROWFOOT:\n\nYou authorized the extension and rebuilding of the existing pig-pen. The request for a piano was also made in order that the pupils might be given music lessons. In this connection, it was brought to your attention that the Sisters had purchased play-ground equipment at a cost of nearly $500.00 and that they might be reimbursed with a piano if it is not the policy of the Department to supply pianos to the schools.\nSeptember 27, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Gooderham:\n\nWith reference to that portion of your letter of the 20th instant, relative to a piano for the Crowfoot Indian Residential School, I believe it might be advisable for you to see what second hand reconditioned instrument you can secure in a reliable piano store in Calgary. You might ask for either a Mason & Risch or a Haitszman. It is not the practice of the Department to supply pianos, but you may explain to the Reverend Principal or the Sisters that I want to do something for them in this connection.\n\nIf you are satisfied that you can make a good arrangement, you should make the purchase and forward a properly certified voucher for payment.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nG.

The building is constructed for the amount shown hereon. The building is on a concrete foundation and the floor is concrete. The school holds 40 pupils and all other materials. The house is divided into four good rooms with ample space for pigs of various sizes and age. The cost of the building was kept under $500.00 by making use of all materials available and by the school buying wherever possible. Contractor Mr. Scott did a very good job.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA - Ont.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nREGINA, SASK., Nov. 17th, 1927\n\nSir:-\n\nAfter some correspondence with the Principal of the Crowfoot School regarding fire apparatus I thought it advisable to take the matter up direct with the Indian Agent and have him go to the school and make a report, and he now recommends that at least six more lyrene extinguishers be supplied. He also reports that the hose is in poor condition and that the Principal is being asked to test it. The Agent goes on to say that it is thought the hose system which we have is practically useless. Now the Agent must accept some responsibility for allowing this apparatus to reach such a state before taking action to have it put in good order. Of course it is primarily the duty of the Principal to attend to this, but when the Principal does not do it the resident Agent who inspects the school every month surely should be expected to look after it.\n\nSix additional Pyrene machines are asked for, and my opinion is that it would be better to buy Tyr-Eyter apparatus, which machines are more easily handled, especially in a school where the entire staff are women.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, November 23, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 401-11A R.C. of the 17th instant, relative to correspondence which you had with the Principal of the Crowfoot Indian Residential School regarding fire apparatus. In this connection I beg to say that the Department will approve of your arranging for the supplying of 6 additional fire extinguishers of the Fyr Fyter type, forwarding a certified account, in duplicate, in the usual manner covering the cost.\n\nAfter a test of the fire hose on hand it is found that the same should be renewed, you may arrange for the purchase of the quantity required. In this connection the Department agrees with you that the Principal and staff should take every possible care of the fire hose and see that it is kept in good condition and available for use in case of fire.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nReplying to your letter of the 23rd ultimo on the subject of fire-fighting apparatus for the Crowfoot Indian Residential School I beg to advise that Agent Gooderham now reports the hose and attachments to be in good condition, so that it will not be necessary to purchase additional hose.\n\nThe Principal has made a request to be supplied with two ladders, which he proposes to house in the dormitories. The Agent, however, considers that it would be impracticable to keep these ladders in the dormitories and I agree with him. He asks to be supplied with two ladders in any event for general use and also to be used in case of fire. It seems to me that this is an item which the school could well supply themselves. However, if you wish me to have ladders supplied I will do so. I am told that the cost would be $20.00 each, which seems excessive for a plain ladder.\n\nThe Principal also asks for an electric gong. Would you agree to having this installed? My opinion is that if he depended on a gong to rouse the children he would be taking chances. If a fire breaks out I think it is the business of the Principal and members of the staff to go to the dormitories, rouse the children and keep them together. There might be some sort of an alarm put in the bedroom of the member of staff who has charge of the building during the night. Personally, I am strongly of the opinion that we should have a night watchman in the place.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M.

I checked over the fire fighting apparatus and found it in good shape. The six fire extinguishers that had been supplied this winter had been installed in convenient positions, and fire axes hung up etc. In case of fire the children would, of course, have the inside stairs to go down, or an outside stairs at the back of the building. The bigger children sleep in the front dormitories and for them it would simply be a matter of crossing the hall and getting into the back dormitory and from there a door leads on to the stairs which run down to the veranda platform. The only improvement that I could suggest would be a fire escape on each end of the building leading from the front dormitories, but I doubt very much whether this is necessary as, in my opinion, they are pretty well equipped. I am just mentioning this to point out that if these fire escapes were installed, or they had some means of getting down to the ground from the front it would be absolutely safe no matter where the fire occurred. I may say that they have regular fire drill at this school.\n\nW. M.

If this work is carried out, you should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified in the usual manner, covering the cost, which should not exceed approximately the amount above stated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

F. Boyce, of his visits on the 11th December to the Crowfoot Indian Residential School. In regard to the Inspector's comment concerning the metal ladder fire escape now in use at this school, I would refer you to my letter of the 10th December, 1927, and subsequent correspondence with Ottawa ending with Department letter No. 104-2-5, dated the 13th January last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI have your letter No. 104-2-5, of the 7th instant, with regard to the Provincial School Inspector's comments on the metal ladder fire escapes now in use at the Old Sun's School. You will remember that before these ladders were installed I reported that I doubted their efficacy, and Mr. Gooderham, in passing the Principal's request on for these, expressed the same doubt, so that the Department is already in possession of my opinion and that of Mr. Gooderham. After these opinions were expressed the Department made the purchase of the ladders, as per advice to me on the 19th January, 1928, No. 104-2-5.\n\nBefore this expenditure was incurred and the ladders installed, we had a report on the matter of fire escapes from Mr. Inspector Christianson, who expressed the opinion that the fire protection was fairly adequate at the school. He described the situation and how the children could pass out from the dormitories in the event of fire, and he tells me that when he went into this matter with the school authorities on the ground, everyone seemed satisfied that their protection was adequate. Of course, at that time the fire at the Old Sun's School had not taken place.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nnot taken place, and I suppose the authorities have a feeling now that they want every protection possible. I cannot suggest anything more. The Department know the building well. You have met the request of the Principal in supplying these chain ladders, and you have a report from your Inspector who says that the fire protection, in his opinion, was adequate before these ladders were supplied, so that with this additional protection, everything should be quite satisfactory. This report of the Inspector was dated February 11th, 1928, and was forwarded to you under cover of my letter dated February 15th, 1928.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M.

Principal approached the writer and offered to drill a fresh well provided the Department supplied the necessary pipe, couplings etc.\n\nThe material was secured on a competitive basis from the Cluny Hardware. The new well is now in operation.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nCrowfoot School,\nCluny, Alberta.\n\nAugust 24th 1929.\n\nTo the Honourable Dr. Duncan Scott,\nDeputy Supt. Gen. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nHonourable Sir,\n\nAt the occasion of your visit to the Crowfoot School on the 19th of August 1927, I had suggested some improvements in the way of an addition to the Girls' Play-room to be used as a sewing-room for them, and you had readily consented to have it done. The approximate cost for same was put in the Estimates, but I regret to say that this work has not yet been done.\n\nTo day, moreover, I would ask that a similar addition be done to the Boys' Playroom, as the present playroom is altogether too small.\n\nI also beg to request that better alcoves be provided for the Sisters who supervise the Dormitories, in order to give them a little more privacy and healthier accommodation.\n\nAnother subject on which I feel bound to call your attention, is the necessity of Fire-escapes for the Dormitories on the North side of the building. I know the wishes and the strict instructions of the Department in that respect, especially since the disastrous accidents in different schools during the recent years. I have spoken to the Indian Agent on this matter in order to find some way of exit in case of a fire. We have come to the conclusion that a double verandah at each end of the building, the same as the one built on the South side, would supply the desired exit, and that with less expense and without interfering with the aspects of the building. This suggestion could be gone into more thoroughly by having Mr. Gardner Smith or some competent Inspector to come and plan what could be done in that respect, as well as for the other improvements mentioned in this letter.\n\nHoping that you will give these urgent matters your serious consideration, and that you will deign to favor me with an early reply,\n\nI am, Honourable Sir,\n\nYour devoted servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nHonorable Sir,\n\nIn forwarding the enclosed letter of Rev. J. Riou, Principal of the Crowfoot Indian School, I wish to say that from personal observation, I know that his requests are not only reasonable, but of real necessity, especially in the matter of Fire-Escapes. Like you, I realise the responsibilities that hang over the shoulders of the Department and of the authorities of the Indian Schools, and that we should take all possible precautions for the protection of the lives of the children in case of a fire.\n\nHoping that you will favorably consider these requests for the desired improvements,\n\nI remain, Honorable Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nProvincial.\nSeptember 9th, 1929.\n\nDear Father Beys,\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, enclosing copy of a communication from Rev. Father Riou, Principal of the Crowfoot Indian Residential School. There has been some correspondence with Mr. Commissioner Graham in connection with the improvements requested and I am writing again to him.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nM. D. McLean\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nVery Rev. J. B. Beys, O.M.I.,\nProvincial,\n9916 - 110th Street,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nSeptember 9th, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nI wish to refer to your 401-11 R.C. of January 10th, last, and to Mr. Inspector Christianson's report of February 11th, 1928, forwarded under cover of your 401-11 of February 15th, last year. The Church authorities have asked the Department to note for Estimates the advisability of arranging fire escape provision at each end of the building by the erection of a two-storey verandah. They also are urging an addition to the girls' playroom to be used as a sewing room and an addition to the boys' playroom. When you forwarded the Estimates for 1928-29, you referred to the additions, as follows:\n\n\"I would like to have an opportunity of going over this school and looking into the suggestions made before spending this money.\"\n\nWhen forwarding the Estimates for the current fiscal year, the item was again included from the Indian Agency but your covering note read \"I cannot recommend this\".\n\nIn view of the urgent request from the office of the Provincial of the Order, I should now be glad to have a special report before the Estimates are prepared.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK., September 20th, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, with reference to the request of the church authorities to have the Department note for the Estimates the advisability of arranging for fire escape provision at each end of the Blackfoot R.C. School by the erection of a two storey verandah.\n\nI beg to point out that this school has an attendance of about 70 pupils, divided, perhaps, equally between boys and girls. The school is quite large enough (indeed, there is accommodation for more than are now in attendance) for the number of children in attendance, and I cannot see the necessity of spending money for glassed-in verandahs at each end of the school. In my opinion they are not necessary.\n\nOn the Blackfoot Reserve we have two boarding schools and the children at these schools receive all the advantages that we give children at other schools; in fact, more. In addition to this they have the advantage of a hospital which has been carried on at a great expense to the band, and it seems to me that if it is necessary for children to sleep outside, the hospital is the place for them, not the school.\n\nWith regard to the fire escapes, the Principal was asked for his opinion on the matter and he advised some sort of a ladder business which would throw out the windows when a fire occurred, and from information I have, even adults would hesitate to go down these ladders. They are not braced. I would, however, recommend that at each end of the building a door be put in and an iron bracket with a pole fire escape.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nescapes erected. The drop would only be about 18 ft., perhaps 20. This would solve the question. I do not consider it desirable to spend a great amount of money on a school of this kind. The Inspectors, who have been on the grounds and know the situation, are also of the same opinion.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nSeptember 26, 1929.\n\nDear Father Beys:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 27th ultimo, concerning improvements at the Crowfoot Indian Residential School, I have now to inform you that Mr. Commissioner Graham has been authorized to erect pole fire escapes at each end of the building. The Commissioner believes that it is not necessary to erect two-storey verandahs or other additions at the present time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nVery Rev. J. B. Beys, O. M. I.,\nOblate Fathers' Provincial House,\n9916 - 110th St.,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nSeptember 26, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your 401-11A R.C. of the 20th instant, with reference to improvements at the Crowfoot Indian Residential School. You are authorized to cut a door at each end of the building and install pole fire escapes, as recommended.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nW. M.

In using this system in the case of fire, the Pupils would fall on one another from a height of twenty-two feet and meet with direvert accidents. Besides, this kind of fire escape would look shabby and mean on such a beautiful Building.

In order to have this urgent repair done, I sent one of our Farm Instructors to Calgary to get a mechanic and to bring the necessary tubing which was ordered by Mr. L. Michael the Local Plumber.\n\nBy so doing considerable expense was eliminated and the plant was in use in 24 hours.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\n\nOn the 28th. of September you authorized me to have pole fire escapes erected at the Crowfoot Indian Residential School, one at each end of the building, and also to have doors cut leading to same. I accordingly instructed the Indian Agent to get quotations for the iron work and also to arrange with the local contractor to erect the escapes after they reached Cluny. The Agent now writes me that he went to the school with the local contractor and that the Rev. Principal refused to go into the matter with him and stated that he had asked for certain additions at the school and that these escapes were to be worked into the additions. My instructions from the Department, however, were that fire escapes were to be placed on the existing building. I am not at all surprised at Father Riou's action in this matter. He feels that when an officer of the Department goes there and gives instructions he is at liberty to have such instructions cancelled or to refuse to go on with them. I have had trouble with this man in the past.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 29, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge your 401-11A R.C. of the 21st instant and to inform you that, following receipt of a communication from the Rev. Principal, the Deputy Superintendent General wrote to him in part as follows: \"There has been considerable correspondence with Mr. Commissioner Graham in this connection, and I have placed the matter in his hands. He has written that he does not consider the verandahs necessary, and, as he recommended two pole fire escapes, the Department authorized him to proceed with the installation.\"\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nCluny, Alberta, October 25th, 1929.\n\nDr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Bupt.Cen.of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nHonourable Sir;\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 19th instant No.104-2-5 re pole fire escapes and in reply to say that I am very much surprised to note that Mr. Commissioner Graham considers the verandahs not necessary. I suppose he sees in them something like a luxury. I should perhaps have named the improvements mentioned in my first letter by another appellation.\n\nTwo years ago you judged necessary to have separate rooms for sewing and you readily consented to have it done. As to the request that better alcoves be provided for the sisters who supervise the dormitories, that they may have healthier accommodation, I do not think it unreasonable. The members of the staff are obliged to use the girls' infirmary as a dormitory, they have no other rooms available.\n\nIf Mr. Commissioner Graham had considered all this he would have found my request right to the point. I thought while the Indian Department had to undergo expenses for fire escapes it would simplify the things and be more economical to have all these improvements made at the same time and this would give the fire escapes the maximum of safety. All these improvements were to be taken from the proposed verandahs.\n\nI am, honourable Sir, yours ever devotedly,\n\n[Signature]\nJ.

I found that the floors in the senior pupil dormitories (boys' & Girls') are in need of repair or replacement. The flooring is soft wood and has worn through at the top & bottom of the beds by the action of the castors. The floors in these dormitories are therefore a mass of cup-shaped holes.\n\nIf you were disposed to grant hardwood floors throughout, the condition would be corrected for all time, but this would be too costly. I would recommend that strips of hardwood about one foot wide be laid across each dormitory where the feet of the beds rest. This would require from 150' to 200' hardwood in each room and the total cost of the labour and material should not exceed $150.00 for the two rooms. These floors should then be good for many years as the floors otherwise are in reasonably good condition.\n\nIf authority were granted, the material and labour would be secured and the work done in the usual manner and as early as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to apply for your assistance in regard to some improvements to be made on the Crowfoot Residential School.\n\nAt the time of your visit to this Institution in September 1927 you noticed that the Sisters supervising the Pupils at night had to sleep in the dormitories, and you made the remark that this was not sanitary, and they should have better alcoves in order to give them more privacy and healthier accommodation.\n\nAt the present time some of the staff are using the girls' infirmary as their dormitory having no other place available so you see we have no infirmary for the girls.\n\nYou have noticed also that the recreation rooms have to be used as sewing rooms which has many inconveniences, and that especially of being too small for the two purposes.\n\nThe Honourable Dr Duncan Scott at his last visit on Aug. 1927 had noticed it also and readily consented to have special sewing rooms built. The approximate cost for same has been put in the Estimates but I regret to say that the work has not yet been done.\n\nIn August last, I wrote to Dr. Scott in regard to these improvements and that also of having a fire escape for the dormitories North of the building and I suggested that verandahs be built on the East and West end of the Building and this would allow us all the above mentioned, and that with less expense and without interfering with the aspects of the building. In his answer Dr. Scott said, \"There has been considerable correspondence with Mr. Commissioner Graham in this connection, and I have placed the matter in his hands. He has written that he does not consider the verandahs necessary and as he recommended two pole fire escapes, the Department authorized him to proceed with the installation\". Regina did not approve the other improvements needed, even those already granted by Mr. Scott hoping you will use your influence to obtain them promptly and I am dear Sir,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nOttawa, February 20, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nDr. Stone has asked me to reply to your letter of the 14th instant, with reference to improvements at the Crowfoot Indian Residential School. As the Deputy Superintendent General stated in his letter of October 19th, last, Mr. Commissioner Graham did not consider verandahs with extra space necessary, and, of course, no provision was made. I regret that nothing further can be done in the matter at the present time. I am pleased to state that Mr. Indian Agent Gooderham is being authorized today to repair the worn places in the dormitory floors at the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

There has been considerable correspondence with your office concerning verandahs or additions at either end, and I know that when you reported on the 14th ultimo you were not favourable to an addition.\n\nFather Langlois has recently visited this school.

In the first place it must be replaced and a new steel arch installed. This work could have been done last year but the arch ordered from the John Inglis Co. of Toronto was not shipped so that the old one has had to secure with bricks. If the Company made the arch the local plumber will order it to be shipped immediately. The bricks can be secured locally.\n\nThe main job, however, is in the tubing. The Provincial Inspector on a recent tour found a large number of the tubes leaked under very light pressure and ordered replacement. Last year, one tube burst and was replaced at considerable expense and it appears to me that it might be as well to replace the boiler completely. I am informed that the tubes are twelve feet long which is not a standard length and that this will increase the cost of replacement. The cost according to an estimate that I have received will be about $1,200.00.\n\nI am reporting this condition to you now in order that the necessary work may be done before the boiler is put into use for the winter months. Your early instructions in this matter will be appreciated.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nIn Account With L.

The tender submitted by Mr. Michael was the only one received although I tried to get a Calgary firm to do so. The price was reasonable for the work and material, I believe.\n\nIt is the extra work in connection with the brick work that I wish to explain to the best of my ability. Artesian water from a tank worked its way into the brickwork and this was located when work had started on the job. Brickwork was found to be in so bad condition that it had to be pulled down. I secured the services of a bricklayer, Mr. Joe Davenport at $1.00 per hour. Mr. Michael contends that I was penny wise and pound foolish as Davenport required more time and more new brick than a man of his choice. The Rev. Principal was very keen to have a good finished job and many trips were made to look over the work.\n\nA lot of brick was purchased as you will note and even the top of the boiler is covered with brick and cement. This was needed as otherwise the escape of heat would have been considerable. The boiler was filled with river water and will be used in future as it was found that water secured from the well was very hard on the boiler tubes. The total of the accounts is in excess of my original estimate. I did my best to keep down the cost but all forces were against that.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n| DATE   | ARTICLE                                      | FOLIO | CREDIT | DEBIT | TOTAL |\n|--------|----------------------------------------------|-------|--------|-------|-------|\n| July 14| Rep. to Plumbing                             |       |        | 8.80  |       |\n|        | 8 Hours time                                 |       |        | 1.80  |       |\n|        | 18 Miles                                    |       |        |       |       |\n|        | Union 1/2                                    |       |        | 6.5   |       |\n|        | 6 Hipples 1/2                                |       |        | 9.0   |       |\n|        | 4 Elles                                      |       |        | 8.0   |       |\n|        | 7 Hours time in Labor in Plumbing            |       |        | 7.70  |       |\n|        | 18 Miles                                    |       |        | 1.80  |       |\n|        | Basin Tap                                    |       |        | 3.50  |       |\n|        | 5 Hours time in Plumbing                     |       |        | 5.50  |       |\n|        | 18 Miles                                    |       |        | 2.80  |       |\n|        | Union                                        |       |        | 6.5   |       |\n| Oct 14 | Safety Valve                                 |       |        | 11.00 |       |\n|        | Tee 2x2x1 Galv.                              |       |        | 8.5   |       |\n|        | 2 Hipples                                    |       |        | 4.0   |       |\n|        | 3 Valves 3/4                                 |       |        | 9.25  |       |\n|        | 5 Hours time Pump Laundry & Sheet Packing    |       |        | 3.50  |       |\n|        | 18 Miles                                    |       |        | 1.15  |       |\n|        | Pipe Brush & Scraper                         |       |        | 1.80  |       |\n|        | Closet Angles                                |       |        |       |       |\n\nEXAMINED and found correct.\n\nRaymond Carroll\n\nWork done and material received adjusted.\n\nJ.

INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nDuring my visit to this school, I inspected the two classrooms, the building, equipment, and premises, as well as outbuildings, and I must say that I found everything in A1 condition.\n\nThe main building is in an excellent state of repair. The Sisters themselves have done considerable painting inside of the school to make it look brighter and more cheerful. The furniture is all well arranged, and looks almost like new. I was noticing the desks in the senior classroom. The Sister Superior told me that they had been used in the school for 20 years, and there was hardly a scratch on them. This gives you an example of how well things are looked after. The building was clean and tidy throughout, and everything was polished.\n\nThe children looked exceptionally well, and were well clad, although they only had on their everyday clothes. I was also pleased to note that the work in the classrooms was good. The two teachers have become members of the staff within the last year. At the present time, the highest grade taught is 7.\n\nThere were 71 children in residence at the time of my inspection.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nThe Sisters\nThe Sisters were busy preparing their gardens and grounds in front of the school. As you will remember, the grounds around this school are beautifully laid out and are certainly well kept during the summer. This school is one of the show places in that part of the country.\n\nThe outside work was also in good shape. They have 26 head of cattle, 10 of which are cows. They were milking 7 cows at the time of my visit, and getting thirteen gallons of milk per day.\n\nThe farm consists of about 350 acres, part of which is pasture. They seeded about 110 acres to crop this spring. Their farming operations are not very extensive, and I think this is a drawback at this institution. The boys do not get the amount of practical farming and stock raising experience that they should. However, to enable them to bring this about, more land would have to be set aside for this institution, and this can only be done by getting some of the Indians to move off their places around the school so that the land may be turned over to the school. I believe this will be brought about in time.\n\nThe boys do the milking in the winter, and the girls in the summer time.\n\nThe Rev. Father Riou is in charge as Principal, in name only. As far as I know, he takes no active part in the management of the school. The Reverend Mother Superior is the actual head and business manager.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., May 27, 1931\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a report on the Roman Catholic and Anglican schools in the Blackfoot Agency.\n\nThe report on both schools seems to be quite satisfactory. The attendance is fair.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt.

Michael to make an inspection of same. He informs me that the tanks are of the wooden type and were installed in the year 1912 and that repairs for this type of tank cannot be secured today - they are out of date. The only remedy is to replace either with a wooden tank costing $18.67 or a tank in vitreous china at $21.34.\n\nThree tanks are leaking, one in the Sister's room, one in the girls' infirmary and one in the boys' dormitory. The school authorities repaired two in the girls' dormitory last November at their own expense. I have given authority to Mr. L. Michael to install one tank in the Sisters quarters - this is badly needed. The others are also required and if at all possible, it is hoped that authority to purchase and install the other two tanks will be granted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 19, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, regarding the condition of several of the closet tanks at the Crowfoot Indian Residential School. It is noted that you have already given authority to install one new tank in the Sisters' quarters, as this was badly needed.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase and installation of two more tanks - one for the girls' infirmary and one for the boys' dormitory. The tanks supplied should be of vitreous china. Please keep all expenditure in the purchase and installation of the tanks as low as possible. When the work has been completed, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nG. H.

You will remember that we borrowed $80,000 from the Blackfoot Band Funds to expedite the reconstruction of the Old Sun Indian Residential School. Would you consider a similar scheme in this case? At the present time, the Capital to the credit of the Band is over $1,453,000 and the Interest, over $785,000.\n\nR.

While a serviceable quality of hose of the dimensions required should be obtained, the cost should be kept as low as possible. The purchase should be made from a firm on the list to receive consideration, in accordance with departmental instructions. After the purchase has been made, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nRegarding burglar alarms for the doors leading to the fire exits, I would draw your attention to official letter dated March 2nd, last, regarding a similar system for the Old Sun Residential School. As it would appear necessary to have the exits leading to the fire escapes locked from the outside only, it is thought that a suitable door lock could be installed. For example, a lock of the Yale type, where the outside door lock refuses to turn the lock and the inside one opens freely. It should not be necessary to have the doors locked on the inside, as the school authorities should be able to arrange that the pupils would not leave the school surreptitiously by the fire escapes. You might report regarding the installation of locks of the type suggested, stating the number required and the approximate cost of same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

There remains only the second inspection, at midnight, to be seen to.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, March 16, 1932.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, in reference to the fire escapes at the Crowfoot Indian Residential School. It is noted that the southern part of the building is well provided with fire escapes - by means of wooden stairs leading from the dormitories - but that the northern end of the building is only equipped with sliding poles.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that, in carrying out fire drills from time to time, the escapes at the southern end of the building should be used by the pupils. In case of fire, the pupils could leave by the balconies and go down the escapes at the southern end, or, if absolutely necessary, the sliding poles at the northern end of the building could be used. The Department considers that, in case of fire, there should be little difficulty in the pupils leaving the building by means of the balconies and fire escapes at the southern end.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The Principal states that the southern part of the building is well provided with fire escapes (wooden stairs leading from the dormitories to the balconies), but that the northern part of the building has only sliding poles, which he states are dangerous for the use of the pupils. He also states that the only exit for the pupils in the dormitories at the northern end of the building, if a fire occurred in the hall, would be by these sliding poles, as there are no balconies on that side of the building.\n\nI have to request that you will state whether you consider the present means of exit in case of fire are adequate. If not, please furnish a report stating the type of exit you would recommend be installed at the northern end of the building, together with an estimate of the cost. I may add that our funds are extremely limited and, unless it is absolutely necessary to install a fire escape at the northern end of the building to augment the present sliding poles, the Department would not be prepared to incur any expenditure.\n\nWe are informing the Reverend Principal that this matter has been referred to you for report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. H. Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen,\nAlta.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Fire protection at Crowfoot School: the Sisters are Matrons in charge of both boys' and girls' dormitories. One of the Sisters sleeps in a cubicle off each dormitory.\n\nRealizing that limited funds are available this year, I will again discuss the situation with the Sister Superior and it is hoped that with the cooperation of the Staff, some reasonably good scheme will be arrived at which will cost very little.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nAnswering yours of March 31st re fire escapes at the Crowfoot Residential School, it is quite true that these are not the best that might be provided but they would serve in an emergency.\n\nThe wooden stairs off the dormitory verandah on the South side would be adequate provided they were not on fire. Any wooden construction is not dependable as a means of escape. The pole escapes at the East & West ends of the school are placed opposite a window of the dormitories on the North side. The bad feature in this case is the window but if it is kept unlocked, the pupils can quickly get on the platform and slide down the pole.\n\nIf systematic drill is carried out, and all doors and windows leading to escapes are kept unlocked, I believe the building can be readily evacuated and no pupil seriously hurt. Of course, the iron poles might cause serious burns in extremely cold weather. At this time, when funds are so limited, I would not recommend any expenditure in installing a more elaborate system.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nCROWFOOT SCHOOL\n\nMATERIAL FOR EXTRA ELECTRIC WIRING.\n\n1) 50 ft. canadian black core rubber covered cable - size 14.\n2) 50 ft. type BX sprague flexible steel armored conductors, size 14\n3) 6 No 753 switch boxes for non-metallic flexible conduit\n4) 6 No G.E. 1414 flush plates for pony convenience outlet\n5) 2 only A1075 with plug.\n6) 12 Marr insulated connectors for No 14 wires.\n7) 3 lbs 1/3\" galvanized conduit straps.\nDear Sir:\n\nI attach hereto a list of electrical supplies, submitted by the Slater Superior of the Crowfoot Residential School, required for some extra wiring and convenience outlets etc. It is estimated that the cost of this material would be around Ten Dollars and I beg to ask for authority to purchase.

The boiler is leaning towards that side and if the condition is not remedied the boiler will be ruined. Apparently, the cause of the trouble is water from some source not yet located. There is water in the boiler room floor and on investigation, this does not appear to come from the surface as the walls of the room are dry. It does not come from above as this room is even below the basement of this three-storey building. Possibly it comes from unused artesian wells near the building or seeps through the ground from currents which are numerous about this locality.\n\nIt will be necessary to find the source of this seepage and then check it if possible. The wall will then have to be rebuilt as the old bricks are crumbling and some method of supporting the leaning boiler must be found. I have secured an experienced bricklayer to inspect it and he advises that about 300 firebrick and about 100 lbs fire clay will be required. At this time it is impossible to estimate the cost of the repairs and to find the source of the water, and I beg to ask for authority to proceed before anything is done. I enclose a small sketch of the boiler etc. and in the meantime I will await your instructions in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 13, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your B.ll of the 6th instant, with reference to the boiler at the Crowfoot Indian Residential School. You may take what steps are necessary to find the source of water seepage and check it, if possible. You may also purchase 500 fire brick and 100 lbs. of fire clay and arrange to have the wall rebuilt. No unnecessary expense should be incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Over this period, types of equipment have varied, but \"Penberthy Quality,\" the foundation of Dependability, has always been the standard of comparison in the mechanical fields.\n\nThe Automatic Electric Sump Pump, a worthy member of the Penberthy family, when once installed, stays on the job, alert, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Its action is just as certain as that of gravity and buoyancy, upon which it depends. It operates only when there is water to pump and stops immediately when the water has been discharged.\n\nManufactured by\nPENBERTHY INJECTOR CO., LIMITED\nWINDSOR, ONTARIO\nElectric Sump Pump\n\nMADE in various sizes to more fully meet the demand for electric pumps at popular prices the Penberthy line is carefully designed for real and lasting service. Conditions favoring the electric pump are:\n\n1. For districts where city water pressure is not available, or at least very low.\n2. Larger quantities of seepage water to be handled.\n3. Discharge heads up to 20 feet.\n4. Low cost of operation.\n\nInstallation\n\nThe Automatic Electric Sump Pump is set in a floor sump which can be conveniently made by sinking a piece of 15 by 18 inch sewer crock 2 feet below (larger size preferable). The pump outlet is piped to the nearest and lowest sewer or surface outlet by the shortest and straightest route, never, however, exceeding a total of 18 to 20 feet (depending upon the unit used). The 3 wire switch cord is plugged into the nearest plug or light socket and the pump is ready for operation. Be sure that the electric current is left permanently connected to the motor switch. See that the electric current is entirely suited to the pump.\n\nGeneral instructions accompany each pump.\n\nNo. 1-G with 1/6 H.P. motor is made in one height only, i.e., for use in sump two feet deep. Nos. 2-G, 3-G, 4-G and 5-G all have the same size motor (1/4 H.P.) and same capacity, the difference being in height only. No. 2-G is for use in a sump 2 feet in depth while 5-G is for use in a sump 8\u00bd feet in depth. That part of the pump including motor and switch box must always be above the top of the sump.\n\n\"Penberthy\"\n\nAutomatic Electric Sump Pump\n\nConstructed of Copper and Bronze Throughout\nMade in Five Sizes\n\nSpecifications\n\nMotor\u2014Reputation induction, 110 volts 60 or 25 cycle A.C.; Ball thrust bearings.

Today I am in receipt of a letter from Mr. Gooderham, the Agent, pointing out that the school is having a great deal of trouble with the water in this basement, and as we have power in the school an electric pump would be of great assistance to keep this water out of the basement. The cost of this would be approximately $100.00.\n\nThe Department are aware that the water will gradually affect the basement of the school and I would therefore recommend that if the Department can provide the funds, the pump in question be purchased. I am attaching hereto a cut of the pump that is required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, May 10, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 401-11A R.C. of the 3rd instant, regarding the installing of an electric sump pump to remove the water from the sub-cellar of the basement of the Crowfoot Indian Residential School and enclosing a leaflet giving a description of the pump required.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will have no funds to provide the cost of supplying the pump. The school authorities will have to arrange to pump out the sub-cellar by hand, periodically, as is at present being done. I regret the extra work occasioned the staff in removing the water from the basement, but, as our Appropriation has been so greatly reduced this year, it will not be possible to provide the expense required in the purchase and installation of the pump.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nM. Christianson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nCalgary, Alta.\nOttawa, May 17, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of the voucher which you submitted to the amount of $6.25, covering the cost of urgent repairs to the water front of the stove at the Crowfoot Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to say it is considered that the cost of these repairs should be paid by the school authorities from their per capita allowance or other receipts, as these repairs are in the nature of replacement. The account which you submitted is being returned herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. H. Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\nGleichen, Alta.\nMay 26th, 1883.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSome weeks ago the water front on the cooking stove in the kitchen of the Crowfoot Residential School burst. Immediate repairs were necessary and on the request of the Sister Superior a plumber was rushed to the school. He replaced the water front with an old one which answered the purpose temporarily and rendered an account amounting to $6.25\u2014a very moderate charge since he had to drive 30 miles.\n\nA voucher was forwarded for payment but was returned under cover of letter of the 17th instant File 104-2-5. It was considered that the account should be paid by the School authorities from their per capita receipts, as the work was in the nature of a replacement. I draw this to your attention as it is an unusual ruling. If the Department compels the School authorities to make all repairs or replacements in the institution under their charge, it is submitted that the Agent should be definitely instructed that he is not to authorize any emergency repairs. In the case under consideration, the repair was urgent and no time was lost in getting the work done. If the School authorities had refused to pay the account, the plumber would still be awaiting settlement. However, the Sister Superior, at my request, paid the bill.\n\nThe School has its financial troubles these days\u2014the grant has been reduced and the earnings from the farm are very small. The demands for this school have been for absolute necessities. It is realized that funds are limited but it is hoped that the schools will not be forced to make replacements or repairs which are unavoidable and necessary.\n\nDr. H. W. McGill\nDeputy Superintendent General\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 30, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th instant, regarding the voucher which you submitted, to the amount of $6.25, covering the cost of urgent repairs to the water front of the stove at the Crowfoot Indian Residential School and which was returned to you, with the request that same be paid by the school authorities, from their per capita allowance or other receipts.\n\nIn reply I have to say that our Appropriation for the current fiscal year was so greatly reduced, that no funds have been provided to supply equipment or repairs for this school, and any minor repairs or replacements of an urgent nature required during the balance of this fiscal year will have to be paid by the school authorities. They should attend to the carrying out of minor urgent repairs and pay the cost of same, without authority from you.\n\nIn the event of any repairs involving a considerable sum of money, the matter should be brought to your attention, for reference to the Department, and you should give full particulars as to what is required as well as the cost involved. Consideration will then be given, and, if possible to provide funds, you will receive the necessary authority. As stated above, owing to lack of funds, it will not be possible to authorize any expenditure, unless there is absolute necessity for same, and, in that event, it will be very difficult to obtain funds.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. H. Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen,\nAlta.\nSir:\n\nI beg to forward herewith report of W. H. Edwards, Provincial School Inspector, on Crowfoot Indian Residential School in the Blackfoot Agency. It is noted that, although the teaching methods of fundamentals is very satisfactory, in both class rooms there is a tendency to mechanize subject matter. The Inspector states that the teachers accepted his suggestions in the way of improving their teaching methods and no doubt will put into effect what he has suggested.\n\nI would recommend that the additional desk needed for the junior room be supplied.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nBishop's Residence, Crowfoot School\nCluny - Alta\n\nJuly 24th, 1933\n\nRev. W. H. McGill\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn confirmation of our conversation over the telephone on the 14th inst., I beg to draw your attention and that of the Department to the lack of space in our Crowfoot School. As you are well aware the accommodation is absolutely too limited to properly house all our children. Therefore, since the department cannot proceed with the extension to the building, I am prepared to put up a temporary dormitory, 20' x 30', which will relieve the congestion for the present.\n\nI therefore respectfully request the formal permission from the Department allowing me to proceed immediately on my own financial resources to put up this building. Later on, if the Department judges fit, to re-imburse this expenditure, the building can be put to useful service, and in the meantime will give adequate accommodation to the children in our school.\n\nOn the other hand, I beg you to bear in mind that this last consideration should not stall off the immediate building of this dormitory for at all costs I must have this accommodation by the First of September.\n\nAwaiting your immediate reply in the affirmative,\n\nI beg to remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. J. River s.m.\nPrincipal\nOttawa, July 31, 1933.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nIn the absence of Dr. McGill, who is at present in the West and will not be returning to the Department until about the 15th of August, next, I wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 24th instant, regarding the erection of an extension to the Crowfoot Indian Residential School building, in order to provide more dormitory facilities. Your letter will be placed before Dr. McGill, for his consideration, upon his return. In the meantime, I regret that the matter will have to remain in abeyance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

School,\nCluny, Alta.\nTHE SECRETARY\nDEPT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS OTTAWA ONT.\n\nFIRE STARTED IN CROWFOOT SCHOOL IN THE BLACKFOOT AGENCY LAST NIGHT AND DID APPROXIMATELY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS DAMAGE. A FULL REPORT WILL BE FORWARDED TO THE DEPARTMENT.\n\nM CHRISTIANSON\nDr. W. H. McGill  \nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs  \nEdmonton, Alberta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs you are well aware, the accommodation at the Crowfoot School is by far too limited to properly house all our children in attendance. Since the Department is not in a position to finance the extension to the building which we have been requesting for the past few years, I feel that the only solution is the building of a temporary dormitory that will give room for twelve or fifteen children, girls, and one supervisor. The need is so pressing that Father Riou is prepared to put up the building himself. All he requests is permission to proceed at once. I am forwarding this letter to Edmonton to you, so as to hasten the answer and permit us to have the building ready by the end of August.\n\nThere seems to be no ground for any refusal or delay since the Department is not asked to assume any responsibility of the expenditures. You will please realize that this is an expression of self-sacrifice on the part of the priest to care for his little Indian children in a suitable manner and should excite on the part of the officers of the Department admiration and a spirit of cooperation.\n\nHoping that you will see your way to give us an immediate answer and thanking you in anticipation, I am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBishop of Calgary\nEdmonton, August 11, 1936.\n\nHis Excellency, The Right Reverend P.

MURPHY\n\nWith reference to my memorandum of the 21st instant, enclosing copy of a letter from the Bishop of Calgary, in connection with providing more accommodation at the Crowfoot Indian Residential School, and your enquiry as to whether these children could not be accommodated at other residential schools in the province, I would say:\n\nThis school is located on the Blackfoot reserve, for the benefit of the Catholic Indian children. The nearest Catholic residential schools are located on the Peigan and Blood reserves. There are tribal prejudices between the Indians on these reserves and the parents of the children on the Blackfoot reserve would not consent to having their children sent to schools on either the Peigan or Blood reserves.\n\nA number of years ago, at the request of the Bishop of Calgary (Mt. Rev. J.T. McNally), the Department purchased a farm near Claresholm, Alta., on which it was intended to erect a large residential school for the Catholic children of the Blood, Peigan, and Blackfoot agencies. Owing to tribal prejudices, the plan of erecting the school had to be given up, and we still have the farm on our hands.\n\nIt is extremely doubtful if the parents of the children on the Blackfoot reserve would now consent to having any children surplus to the accommodation at the Crowfoot School enter any of our other residential schools. Further, the Catholic residential schools on both the Blood and Peigan reserves are filled to capacity.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nAugust 22nd., 1933.\n\nBlackfoot Agency\nGleichen, Alberta.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to report that at about 2 o'clock P.M. yesterday the telephone operator at Cluny reported to this office that Crowfoot Residential School was on fire.\n\nI immediately proceeded to the school by car and found that the fire was in the girls' lavatory, which is situated in the basement at the west end of the school. The local fire brigade had the fire well in hand using the school fire fighting apparatus which worked very well.\n\nThe fire apparently started in a clothes closet in a corner of the room and spread to the toilet stalls and up between the ceiling which was of metal, and the floor of the classroom above and into the air space between the partition walls and into the hall and laundry. Owing to the prompt action of Mr. L. Cretin, the School engineer, who discovered the fire and the local fire brigade a serious fire was averted. Not much damage was done by the fire, but a quantity of plaster, flooring and V joint was destroyed by the firemen in cutting holes to get at the fire between the ceiling and floors and between walls. Several of the plumbing fixtures were also destroyed. Someone thinking the fire was much worse phoned to Gleichen for the fire brigade who responded by the fire was under control upon their arrival.\n\nI requested Mr. E. Gardner-Smith to make a survey of the damage done and he is of the opinion that it will cost approximately $1000.00 to make the necessary repairs and replacements. The Sister Superior is of the opinion that it will take much more than this estimate.\n\nWill authority be given to make the necessary repairs and replacements, please, in view of the school opening almost immediately.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.H. Gooderham,\nPer. L.\n\nM. Christianson, Esq.\nInspector of Indian Agencies, Calgary.\nSir:-\n\nI am attaching herewith copy of a letter received from Colonel Lewis, at Gleichen in connection with the fire at the Crowfoot Residential School at Cluny.\n\nI wired you last night as follows\u2014\n\nFire started in Crowfoot school in the Blackfoot Agency last night and did approximately one thousand dollars damage a full report will be forwarded to the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM. Christianson\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn discussing certain matters with the Principal of the Crowfoot Residential School after the recent outbreak of fire, he made a request for the employment of a night watchman to begin his duties on September 1st and to continue until March 31st or April 31st.\n\nIn this connection, I beg to refer you to Department Letter of December 21st, 1932 File 104-2-5. You will note that a grant was made for this purpose last winter. I believe the request is a fair one and I would respectfully ask the Department to consider the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nAugust 30, 1933.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 23rd enclosing a letter from Mr. Indian Agent Geoderham, with reference to the fire at the Crowfoot Indian Residential School. Mr. Geoderham is today being given the necessary instructions to have the necessary repairs to the building carried out.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nM. Christiansen, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alta.\nAugust 30, 1933.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to the fire which took place recently at the Crowfoot Indian Residential School, I beg to say that you may arrange to have the necessary repairs caused by the fire carried out. It is thought that the most economical way of having the work done would be by day labour, under the supervision of Mr. E. Gardner Smith. Kindly keep the expenditure as low as possible and only work that is absolutely necessary is to be undertaken.\n\nReferring to your letter of the 25th ultimo you may authorise the Principal to employ a night watchman for the Crowfoot School, from the period from Sept. 1st to March 31st. The Department will allow a grant towards his salary at the rate of $40.00 per month. Vouchers for this purpose should be forwarded by you in the usual manner.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. H. Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\nMemorandum:\n\nHONOURABLE THOMAS G. MURPHY\n\nWith reference to my memorandum of the 21st instant, enclosing copy of a letter from the Bishop of Calgary, in connection with providing more accommodation at the Crowfoot Indian Residential School, and your enquiry as to whether these children could not be accommodated at other residential schools in the province, I would say:-\n\nThis school is located on the Blackfoot reserve, for the benefit of the Catholic Indian children. The nearest Catholic residential schools are located on the Peigan and Blood reserves. There are tribal prejudices between the Indians on these reserves and the parents of the children on the Blackfoot reserve would not consent to having their children sent to schools on either the Peigan or Blood reserves.\n\nA number of years ago, at the request of the Bishop of Calgary (Rt. Rev. J.T.McNally), the Department purchased a farm near Claresholm, Alta., on which it was intended to erect a large residential school for the Catholic children of the Blood, Peigan, and Blackfoot agencies. Owing to tribal prejudices, the plan of erecting the school had to be given up, and we still have the farm on our hands.\n\nIt is extremely doubtful if the parents of the children on the Blackfoot reserve would now consent to having any children surplus to the accommodation at the Crowfoot School enter any of our other residential schools. Further, the Catholic residential schools on both the Blood and Peigan reserves are filled to capacity.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nDR. MCILL: Aug.30.35 -\n\nThe Minister's remarks in this connection follow:\n\n\"other residential schools in the Province have been represented to me as being under-populated, and it would not appear to be good business to enlarge the premises of certain schools under such conditions.\"\n\nF.Clapp\nfor Private Secretary.\nSeptember 7, 1933.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI beg to refer you to your letter of July 24th and my reply of August 21st, with reference to the accommodation at the Crowfoot Residential School.\n\nThe proposal contained in your letter has been carefully considered by the Superintendent General, and I have been requested to advise you that he is not prepared to approve the erection of an addition to the Crowfoot School at the present time.\n\nI may add that, even if there was accommodation at the Crowfoot School for a larger number of pupils, the Department would not be able to provide per capita grant for more than 75, which is the number for which per capita grant is provided in our Appropriation for the current fiscal year. If there are children on the Blackfoot reserve who require institutional care and who cannot be accommodated in the Crowfoot Residential School, their cases should be brought to the attention of the Indian Agent, with a view to having them placed in some of the other Indian residential schools in Alberta which have not their full quota of pupils.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRight Rev. P. J. Monahan,\nBishop of Calgary;\n910 - 7a Street N. W.,\nCalgary, Alta.\nOn the morning of the 25th August I received instruction to investigate fire at Crowfoot Crossing, from the Officer Commanding, Calgary Division.\n\nI made enquiries at the Indian Office, and learned that there was a fire at the Crowfoot School, but they had no knowledge of any fire at Crowfoot Crossing.\n\nIn the afternoon of the 26th August I proceeded to the Crowfoot School near Cluny. On arrival I saw the Sister Superior, I asked her about the fire they had at the school, and she then told me that on Monday night a fire was started in the lavatory, and that with assistance it was put out but not until it had done about $1000.00 damage to the lavatory, she took me to the lavatory where I saw the inside of the lavatory, and the adjoining laundry was damaged a little, also the lavatory which had been damaged by having to cut away woodwork to get at the Sister Superior, if she had any knowledge who had set the fire, she said she had found out from the girls who had set it, and that she had already had their story, so if they told the same story.\n\nThe Sister Superior then brought the girls into me, one at a time. Maggie Sitting Eagle, age 15 years of age was the first brought in, and gave the following statement:\n\n\"I was speaking to Rosa Mayfield, on Monday 25th August, I took her to the Cupboard, and I got light to it, and went upstairs to play, I did this because I wanted to help my mother.\"\n\nSigned, Maggie Sitting Eagle.\n\nRosa Mayfield was then brought in and gave the following statement:\n\n\"I am 15 years of age; on January 15th 1935, I got light to the Cupboard after us, we made up our minds on Monday night to turn down the School, and we set fire to the Cupboard on the 10th August. Maggie said Rose Mayfield went to the lavatory by the Cupboard when we got in and lit the fire, and took some papers, Maggie said to me, 'Rose, she then set the fire,' and we went to play after the fire was out of school, I...\"\n\n[Signature]\n\nMaggie Sitting Eagle, Kettle, and...\nMr. Christianson, Esq.,\nSupt., Dept. of Indian Affairs,\n507 Public Bldg.,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nSir:\n\nRe: Fire at Crowfoot Crossing, Cluny.\nRe: Maggie Sitting Eagle & Rosa Mayfield\nArson.

It is noted that two of the pupils of the school were responsible for starting the fire. It is also noted that the R.C.M.P. suggest that proceedings be taken against these two girls.\n\nIn this regard, I may say that any action taken would be under the Criminal Code, and the Department is not responsible for the expenses incurred. The expenses in such a case are paid from the same source as when a white person is prosecuted.\n\nThe R.C.M.P. report refers to two girls, Maggie Sitting Eagle and Rosa Mayfield. The first mentioned girl is shown on the June quarter return of the Crowfoot School as No. 077, but I have been unable to find on that return any girl by the name of Rosa Mayfield. Please let me know if a mistake was made regarding the name in the R.C.M.P. report, or has there been a girl in the school by the name shown on the report whose admission has not been approved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

No.: 957\nOffice of the Blackfoot Indian Agency,\n\nNovember 13, 1933\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 345, amounting to $280.60 in favour of L. Michael Gleichen, Alta., for plumbing repairs at Crowfoot school.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. E.R. 957 dated September 18, 1933.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nNovember 24, 1933.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 7th instant. With reference to the proposal to erect a building for temporary dormitory accommodation for a number of the girls at the Crowfoot Indian Residential School, I have to say that it is not our general policy to grant permission to erect additions or other buildings in connection with schools which are government property, even if no cost to the Department is involved. However, our local officers will be requested to report as to the need for extra dormitory accommodation at this school.\n\nRegarding the high mortality rate among the Blackfoot Indians, I would say that the Department's concern has been manifested by the measures taken in recent years to improve and extend the medical and health services on the reserve. This situation is not a recent growth. These Indians decreased very rapidly after their settlement on the reserve and have barely maintained their numbers at any time during the past twenty years. During the past three years, they have had to contend with recurrent epidemics of children's diseases, which have taken many lives, not only among the Blackfoot Indians, but among many other Bands in the country. I am in a position to know that the losses among the children have been the subject of the greatest concern to those officers directly responsible\n\n- for their\n\nRight Rev. P. J. Monahan,\nBishop of Calgary,\n910 - 7 A Street N. W.,\nCalgary, Alta.\nfor their welfare. I am firmly convinced that no pains have been spared, on the part of the Medical Superintendent and her assistants, to give these people the best possible attention in this regard.\n\nI find nothing unreasonable in your request that one of the nurses at the Blackfoot Hospital should be of your religious faith. I must point out, however, that there is no religious test for appointment in the Civil Service of Canada, and that the Department and the Civil Service Commission are unable to specify in advance the religious faith to which persons to be appointed should belong. There is record of the religious faith of some, though not all, of the departmental nurses, and when a vacancy occurs at the Blackfoot Hospital, the Department will endeavour to give consideration to your request.\n\nWhile on this subject, I wish to point out that the nursing staff of the Blood Indian Hospital at Cardston is entirely religious. If you are familiar with the history of your Diocese, you will know that great objection was taken to this circumstance when the new hospital was built a few years ago at that place. The Department found this controversy very embarrassing, and I may be allowed to hope that no one will insist on raising the issue again, either at the Blackfoot or Blood Agencies. I think this phase of the matter will bear consideration on your part, when you are dealing with the situation at the Blackfoot.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nHAROLD W. MCGILL\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, November 24, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nHis Lordship the Bishop of Calgary has requested permission to erect a building for temporary dormitory accommodation for a number of the girls, pupils of the Crowfoot Indian Residential School. His Lordship is being informed that it is not the general policy of the Department to grant permission to erect buildings in connection with schools which are government property. However, I should like to have a report from you, setting out your views concerning the necessity for the providing of the extra dormitory accommodation.\n\nThe last return received shows that there was an enrolment of 43 girls. Mr. Sutherland, who visited this school at the end of September, last, states that, while the room appeared crowded - the beds being very close together - there are ample facilities for ventilation, as the dormitory has a very high ceiling, and, with the windows open at night, the air could be kept quite fresh.\n\nWould you approve of the church authorities being granted permission for the erection of a temporary building for dormitory accommodation - they to provide the entire cost? You might discuss this matter with Mr. Agent Gooderham and furnish a report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nM. Christianson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nCalgary, Alta.\n| DATE       | DESCRIPTION                                      | PONO | DEBIT | CREDIT | BALANCE |\n|------------|--------------------------------------------------|------|-------|--------|---------|\n| Nov 30 1933| Crowfoot School                                  |      |       |        |         |\n|            | 8 foot blocks 80                                 |      |       |        |         |\n|            | 2 lamb catches 40                                 |      |       |        |         |\n|            | 2 cement catchers 3 pounds                       |      |       |        |         |\n|            | 2 fuel buckets 40                                 |      |       |        |         |\n|            | 25 lbs flour 75                                   |      |       |        |         |\n|            | 20 gal sugar containers 15 lbs                   |      |       |        |         |\n\nTotal: $710\n\nVote: 188\nSchool Number: 75-2\nSchool Number: 243\n\nTRIPPLICATE FOR FILE\nVoucher in duplicate detached for Accountant to pay.\n\nSignature: [Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nIndian Education Vote.\n\nOffice of the Blackfoot Indian Agency,\n\nNovember 21, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 358, amounting to $7.10 in favour of McKay Hardware Co., Gleichen, Alta., for General hardware for Crossfoot School repairs.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. ER 957 dated\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE,\nCALGARY, ALTA., December 6th, 1933,\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter No.104-2-5 of the 25th ultimo and in reply wish to state that I have just returned from Blackfoot Agency where I visited the Crowfoot School in company with the Agent. There are two girls' dormitories in this institution and I found 19 beds in each dormitory. Four girls sleep in the infirmary with one of the sisters. The beds in the dormitories, of course, are very close together, but there is lots of air space as the ceiling is 18 feet high, and with several windows in each room there is ample opportunity of getting all the fresh air that is required. The school, with the exception of the boys' dormitories where there are only 27 boys in the two rooms, is quite crowded, but those who are most inconvenienced by the crowded conditions are the Sisters: They have no real dormitories are their beds are in small corners in each dormitory that are partitioned off.\n\nI discussed the matter of erecting a separate building with the Rev. Principal, Father Rioux; also with the Rev. Sister Superior, and tried to show them that in my opinion it would not be in the best interests of the school to put up a separate building: The Father evidently intended to buy some old lumber north of Cluny where he said he could get it at a very low cost. The building would be erected in the back yard and heated by stoves. There were no sanitary arrangements whatever, and outside toilets would have to be erected. In my opinion this building is unnecessary at present and Mr. Gooderham concurred with me in this. The Church authorities have been asking for an addition to the school and no doubt in time to come this will have to be provided to take care of the children of the reserve. In the meantime I see no reason at all why the school cannot carry on with the accommodation they now have. The matter of so many more girls than boys attending the school will, in time, rectify itself.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

If the service is changed to 220 volts, it is claimed that the motors in use would last longer and would therefore save the Department expense in purchasing new motors later on.\n\nThe local representative of the Company, accompanied with Mr Hunter of the Hunter Electric made a survey some days afterwards and I attach hereto an estimate made by Mr Hunter showing the cost of making the necessary alterations in the service, totalling $59.45.

McGill, M.D.,\nDeputy Superintendent-General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI see by the Press that the Government is launching on a program of public works. I think the general public will approve of this manner of alleviating unemployment in the country. The thought therefore came to me that this would be an excellent time to renew our request for the enlargement of the Indian school at Cluny.\n\nSince the state can find money for \"Military Barracks, Post offices, bridges, and what not,\" should it not be possible to salvage some to provide proper accommodation for the Indian children at this school.\n\nYou are conversant with the conditions existing and you know that the number of children to be provided for is increasing and will increase. When alterations are made provision should be made for a school of 90 or 100. No one knows better than yourself the need for air space etc. in schools, that of course is sadly neglected at Cluny.\n\nI sincerely hope therefore that you will exert all of your influence with the proper authorities to have the money set aside for this urgently needed alteration.\n\nThanking you, sir, in anticipation,\n\nI remain, sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop of Calgary\nJanuary 31, 1935.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 24th instant, requesting that funds be provided to enlarge the Crowfoot Indian Residential School, at Cluny, Alberta.\n\nIn this connection I would state that there are many pressing demands for the providing of educational facilities for Indian children on reserves on which there are at present no schools or where the Indian children are greatly in excess of the available accommodation. While the need of extended facilities at the Crowfoot School is realized, I regret there will be no funds available during the coming fiscal year to enlarge the present school building.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRight Rev. P. J. Monahan,\nBishop of Calgary,\n910 - 7 A Street N. W.,\nCalgary, Alta.\nBUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT: I checked over the school and outbuildings, equipment, &c.\n\nThe school building itself is in very good condition. It is brick veneered outside, and the woodwork, trimming, &c., should be painted as soon as possible. The roof should also be repaired, as I understand it leaks in places and especially around the dome. This should be looked into next summer, as naturally when water comes through the ceiling it also damages the walls within the school. I might say, however, that we are not burdened with too much precipitation there as it hasn't rained since last June. The interior of the school could also stand some paint in places, and the Sisters advised me that if a small amount was supplied next summer they would paint during the holidays.\n\nThey also brought to my attention that a refrigerator was something they needed very much as it was very difficult for them to operate during the summer without this equipment. They asked me to bring this to the attention of the Department. A refrigerator plant for this institution would cost about $1000.00.\n\nThey also asked me to inform the Department that they had no bread-mixer and had never been supplied with one.\n\nThis school is connected up with the Hydro-electric, and the only machinery there is, is the laundry machinery. This is a very antiquated plant, but it still is in working order and the Sisters in charge informed me that it was still fairly satisfactory. I had a talk with the fireman and he seems to be very satisfactory. He has been there three years, looking after the boiler and whatever machinery there is, and he keeps everything in very good order. This was borne out by Mr. Gooderham, our Agent, who was with me at the time.\n\nThe outbuildings are in a fair state of repair but all could do with some paint.\nSir:\n\nI beg to bring to your attention my report on the Crowfoot Indian Residential School addressed to the Deputy Superintendent General, and the following are matters that require consideration: The supplying of a refrigerator; bread-mixer; some paint for the exterior of the school if funds are available; also some paint, varnish, oil and stain for interior decorating this coming spring, the work to be done by the staff; and the repairing of the roof on the school building around the dome, to stop leakage.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christiansen,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nSir:\n\nI beg to bring to your attention my report on the Crowfoot Indian Residential School addressed to the Deputy Superintendent General, and the following are matters that require consideration: The supplying of a refrigerator; bread-mixer; some paint for the exterior of the school if funds are available; also some paint, varnish, oil and stain for interior decorating this coming spring, the work to be done by the staff; and the repairing of the roof on the school building around the dome, to stop leakage.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, February 5, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nIn further reference to official reply to your 401-11A R.C. of the 25th ultimo, in connection with the report on your inspection of the Crowfoot Indian Residential School, I have to say that it is very doubtful if there will be funds available to provide a refrigerator and a bread mixer. No doubt, the Department will be able to authorize the expenditure to purchase the paint required for interior decorating. Further, it may be possible to provide paint for the exterior of the school building. I would request that, early next spring, a detailed estimate be submitted, stating the quantity and the approximate cost of the paint, varnish, oil, etc., required for both the exterior and interior painting and also the cost of the repairs required to the roof on the school building, around the dome.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nM. Christianson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nCalgary, Alta.\nFebruary 12th, 1925.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nWith further reference to the subject of my letter to you of January 31st, I would say that Dr. Stanley, M.P., for East Calgary, called to see me yesterday and we discussed the matter at considerable length.\n\nWe have recently had reports from our officials in Alberta with regard to the requirements of the Crowfoot school. Your Lordship will understand that for the past three years we have found it next to impossible to maintain our buildings in a proper state of repair with the funds at our disposal, to say nothing of new buildings and additions. The two residential schools that are now under construction, one of them being at Lebret, Saskatchewan, are in the way of replacements and are being financed through the Public Works Construction Act.\n\nAccording to our official reports from Alberta the Crowfoot school is in need of considerable repairs and renovation, such as repairs to the roof and painting. The need for a refrigerating plant is also indicated. We purpose having Mr. Phillip Phelan, of our Educational Branch, visit British Columbia in May or early June. We shall arrange to have him break his journey at Calgary in order to visit the Crowfoot school and to obtain first-hand information as to the requirements. He will also call upon Your Lordship to discuss the matter.\n\nAny decision in regard to building extensions must be held in abeyance until we know whether or not the scope of the Public Works Construction Act will be extended to take care of further work during the coming building season.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRight Rev.

McMillan, M.D.\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of the 12th of this month duly received.\nSince you had told me in your letter of January the 31st, that your Department was without funds for further building purposes, I went abroad to seek sources of help. I do not suppose you should be adverse to the Public Works Department spending some thousand dollars on your buildings.\n\nThe fact of delaying Mr. Thalen's visit till May or June does not look good to me. By that time the present session will be over, and all the recommendations of the world will be of no avail. Why all this delay? The figures at your disposal are more than convincing that additional space is needed at this Crowfoot school. If most of the Catholic children who are at present detained at the Gleichen hospital were to be returned to school tomorrow they could not possibly be accommodated.\n\nI am not asking your department to finance this project, since you told me you could not, but I would ask you not to hinder someone else from doing it.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop of Calgary.\nFebruary 21, 1936.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 16th instant, with further reference to your request for the provision of funds to enlarge the Crowfoot Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Public Works Construction Act, 1934, provided a sum of $40,000,000 for construction purposes throughout Canada. However, of this amount, only $500,000 was allotted to the Department of Indian Affairs. This sum has been completely assigned in providing certain Indian schools and hospitals.\n\nAt the present time, no definite information is available indicating that it is intended to provide a further amount for construction purposes. If this is done, it is possible that a portion of the money would be allotted to this Department. In this event, further consideration will be given to the requirements at Crowfoot. You will understand, however, that, in view of the uncertainty of additional funds being made available, I am not in a position to make you any definite promise.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRight Rev.

I concur.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI would refer you to Department's letter No. 104-2-5 of February 5th, last, in connection with repairs, &c., for the Crowfoot Indian Residential School on Blackfoot Reserve.\n\nI took this matter up with the Indian Agent and asked him to submit an estimate of the cost and the following is what he submitted:\n\n- Repairs to roof and dome ... ... ... ... $75.00\n- Supplying refrigerator ... ... ... ... $900.00\n- Paint, &c., for interior decorating ... ... ... $75.00\n- Bread Mixer ... ... ... ... $550.00\n- Outside painting, roof, windows, &c. ... ... ... $450.00\n\nI have taken the matter of the refrigerator up with the Bruce Robinson Electric Company here, who are Agents for the Frigidaire, and they advise that the price will be approximately $700.00 or $750.00. If the Department can possibly see their way clear to supply this I would ask that they do so, as the Sisters there have a very difficult task in trying to keep food fresh in the summer time. I would also recommend that the repairs to the roof and dome be attended to; also the inside painting. The bread mixer and outside painting may be left over if the Department have not the funds.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

You are no doubt aware that every classroom is overcrowded, and that the present fire escapes are totally inadequate.\n\nI feel that it is really necessary to provide an addition that would accommodate approximately 40 children. This should be built on the South side of the building. In erecting this it will be necessary to install a new heating plant as the present one is very old. Some new laundry machinery would also be necessary.\n\nThe Principal has rough plans ready. These include placing the addition in two sections on the South side, with a heating plant between them. On our return to Calgary Mr. Christianson and I called on Doctor G. D. Stanley, M. P., and he is very anxious to have the work go ahead this year. I explained to him that we had not the funds available, but he stated that he intended to wire the Prime Minister requesting that funds be provided in the Supplementary Estimates to erect at least a part of the proposed addition. If such funds were made available it would be possible to erect part of it this year on the lines suggested by the Principal.\n\nMr. Christianson suggests that Mr. Gardner-Smith be engaged to go to the School and prepare a detailed plan of the best way of proceeding. Mr. Gardner-Smith would also give us complete information in connection with the new heating system that would be necessary.\n\nFor your personal information I may say that I called on His Lordship, Bishop Monahan on Thursday evening and discussed all matters in connection with the school.\n\nDoctor Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nWhile he would like to see the work go ahead this year, he understands that it may not be possible to secure funds, and after my conversation with him, I feel I can assure you that if funds are not secured, Bishop Monahan will not raise any objection to the work being delayed until next year. I informed him, of course, that you had told me that if funds were not secured this summer, you would see that the necessary amount was provided in next year's Estimates.\n\nInspector Christianson is aware of the contents of this letter, and will be only too pleased to carry out any instructions that you care to give him in connection with it.\n\nI am having a very pleasant trip and expect to leave here on Monday for the Blood and Peigan Reserves.\n\nWith kind personal regards, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nJune 5, 1935.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General:-\n\nMr. Phelan, of the Education Branch, who visited the Crowfoot Indian Residential School, on the Blackfoot Reserve, on the 30th ultimo, in company with Mr. Inspector Christiansen and Mr. Agent Gooderham, recommends that a cold storage plant be installed for use at the school.

He stated that you estimated the cost to be, approximately, $750.00, and recommended that it be secured and installed through the Bruce Robinson Electric Company, of Calgary.\n\nThe Honourable the Minister has approved the supplying of this equipment. You may therefore arrange with the above named company to supply and install the cold storage equipment. It is hoped that the entire cost can be kept within the estimate, viz.: $750. After the plant has been supplied and installed, to the satisfaction of the Principal and yourself, I have to request that you forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, for payment of the cost.\n\nMr. Phelan states, further, that four new bath-tubs are required, as at present there are only two in the building. He states there are water connections for the new tubs and that, consequently, the only expense would be the cost of supplying the tubs. I would request that you arrange for the purchase, from a firm on the approved list, and for the forwarding to the school of four bath-tubs, of the type required. You should obtain an account, in triplicate, covering the cost, which you should certify and forward for payment.\n\nMr. Phelan states, also, that he authorized Mr. Agent Gooderham to proceed with the following work:-\n\n1. Repairing the roof of the main building;\n2. Installing new eaves-trough on the north side;\n3. Repairs to the roof of the barn; and\n4.

Osborne Calgary, Alta amounting to $38.40. This expenditure was not authorized but the material was purchased by the Sister Superior of the Crowfoot Residential School to equip a third class-room, and later asked if the Department would pay the bill. I can assure that the expenditure was incurred without my knowledge, though I did know the Sister had in mind the opening of a third class room for beginners. The increased accommodation is commended because the second class room was crowded.\n\nThe voucher is for your disposal, please. I beg to recommend payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nAnswering yours of the 13th August re Fire Escapes at the Crowfoot Residential School, I beg to report that this matter was discussed with the Principal and the Sister Superior at the school on the 24th instant.\n\nNeither of these officials deemed it necessary to make any changes to the fire escapes at this time. It was realized, of course, that the pole escapes are not the most suitable to get children out of a building in a hurry; they would be used as a last resort. Fortunately, a very efficient and conscientious night watchman will be on the job this winter and every precaution against fire will be taken.\n\nThe writer did make a suggestion and that was to have a fire axe near the window through which the pupils must go to reach the poles. I would go further and recommend that fire axes be hung in the 4 main dormitories to be used either to break the windows or doors leading to the escapes. If these were supplied a senior pupil or the matron could use the axe in an emergency. Needless to say, doors and windows might be locked, even when they should not be, and an axe could effectively and quickly break an opening. Would the Department supply four axes?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 1st, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your B. 11 of the 25th ultimo, I beg to say that you may purchase the number of fire axes which you consider are necessary for use at the Crowfoot Indian Residential School. You should see that they are placed in position where they can be easily used, if necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. H.

Father Riou, Principal of Crowfoot Indian Residential School at Cluny, was in the office here a few days ago, and he informed me that Doctor Windsor had mentioned to him that owing to the T.B. conditions that exist there, a great many of the children would not be able to do the ordinary work around the school, and he asked for the following equipment to lighten their work: a power churn and a bread mixer.\n\nThe churn could be purchased for about $60.00, but I think they should be able to get along without same. Father Riou claims that he knows where he can purchase a satisfactory bread mixer, second-hand, in good condition, for $90.00. This has been asked for on several occasions, as the Department are aware, and if a satisfactory one could be purchased for the above amount, I would ask that it be considered by the Department.\n\nI might say that before writing this letter I talked the matter over with the Agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

The Department is desirous that, if possible, the purchase be made previous to the end of the current month, in order that payment can be made from our Appropriation for the current fiscal year, before the books are closed. If the account covering the cost of the bread mixer is dated previous to the 31st instant and reaches the Department by the middle of April, it will be in time to be paid from this year's Appropriation. This account should be certified by Agent Gooderham or yourself. It is noted you consulted the Agent in the matter of the purchase.\n\nIn view of the above mentioned desire of the Department to pay the cost before our books close, I would request that you give the matter your prompt attention.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

As indicated above we are the agents for the Iron Fireman automatic stoker and we would like to have our stoker specified in connection with these residences and additions.\n\nThe use of our stoker would mean the saving of approximately 40% over the present methods of firing and being thermos-tactically controlled would insure even temperatures, a healthful atmosphere throughout the houses with the least amount of labor to the householder. Our stoker is built in Canada and is produced by the oldest and most experienced and best financially rated company in the business.

School at Cluny on the Blackfoot Reserve and also that there probably will be some houses built at G\u00e4\u00e4ichen for some of the agency staff.\n\nI wish to call your attention to the fact that we handle the Iron Fireman stoker and we respectfully wish to point out that it would be greatly appreciated if these stokers can be specified in these buildings. As I pointed out to you last year the fuel saving is enormous and the convenience afforded the householder is greater than anything obtainable in any other method. Kindly advise me at your earliest convenience if we may expect to supply our stoker in the above proposed buildings. We have one of our machines in the administration buildings at Banff and if you will refer to Mr Wardell of the Dominion Parks Dept he will give you first hand information as to\nthe performance of our stokers in his department. We shall also be glad to give you other valuable references, all of which will afford clinching proof that no building is really complete today that is not equipped with an IRON FIREMAN stoker.

G. O.\nSir:\n\nI beg to refer you to my report on the Crowfoot School, and I wish to herewith enumerate the repairs required at this institution: As the Department know, we have been waiting for several years for an addition to the school but as there is apparently no hope of this a great many repairs will have to be carried out.\n\n1.- Girls' playroom: Floor badly worn; size of room: 30' x 30'.\n\n2.- Girls' dormitory: Floor in very bad shape; size of room: 30' x 30'.\n\n3.- Plaster throughout building and in basement requires patching; Cement floor in basement badly broken in places.\n\n4.- East and West Porches: Floor needs renewing: Size 12' x 10'; Steps on both sides also need renewing: 5 steps 12' x 12\"; Porch on South side, floor and steps need renewing: Size of porch - 90' x 10'; Steps - 5' x 12\".\n\n5.- Screen windows, all full-size: Wire has pulled away from the sides and is badly broken, and a great deal of wire netting will have to be renewed. This is the work of a carpenter.\n\n6.- Eaves-troughing: On the South side of the building this needs renewing as when the rain comes from the South or West it does considerable damage to the building in its present state.\n\n7.- School roof needs painting and patching; also the trim around windows, eaves, &c.\n\n8.- The barn needs painting.\n\n9.- For the laundry they have asked for a mangle and a tumbler dryer.\n\n10.- Twelve (12) chairs for the sisters' recreation room. Those now in use are in poor shape and I would ask that this be allowed.\n\n11.- Paint for interior decorating as follows:\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nMaterial for interior decorating:\n\n10 - Gals. of White paint,\n5 - \" \" Brown \"\n10 - Gals. of Light Buff paint,\n20 - Pkgs. Kalsomine,\n6 - Brushes and\nSmall barrel of boiled linseed oil,\n(for wood-work).\n\nI realize the Department have not the funds to go on\nwith all the repair work that is required, but as you know,\nnothing has been spent in the way of repairs to this institu-\ntion for some time now. I would suggest that I be advised\nas to what money would be available, and then the Agent and\nPrincipal could have the most urgent repairs attended to.\nThis is what we agreed on before I left the school, as the\nmost satisfactory manner of handling it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nOttawa, June 17, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your 401-11A. R.C. of the 12th instant, enumerating the repairs required at the Crowfoot Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that funds, to the amount of approximately $500.00, are available for repairs at this school. The Department will approve of carrying out the work as enumerated in the first five items mentioned in your letter. You should arrange for the purchase of the materials required, from firms on the approved list. The Honourable the Minister has directed that, for any building to be done on the Blackfoot Reserve, the following building contractors and carpenters should be given an opportunity to do the work:-\n\nHarry Holmes, Bassano, Alberta,\nLarry Edwards,\n\nand the following located at Gleichen, Alta.:-\n\nChas. Thompson, Building Contractor,\nL. Michael, Plumbing and Heating contractor,\nH. Hunter, Electrical Contractor.\n\nIt is hoped that the work authorized, viz.: renewing floor in girls' playroom and girls' dormitory; repairing plaster throughout building and in basement and repairing cement floor in basement; renewing floors and steps of\n\neast and\n\nM. Christianson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nCalgary, Alta.\neast and west porches; and renewing wire screens in windows, can be completed for the amount available and, if possible, at less cost.\n\nRegarding the painting of the barns, I would say that, if the above authorized work does not exceed the amount of approximately $500.00, the Department would approve of the purchase of the quantity of paint required for the barn, provided the school authorities can assist with the labour.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase of 12 chairs for the Sisters' recreation room - these to be obtained from firms on the approved list.\n\nAfter the above authorized work has been completed, please forward itemized accounts, in triplicate, stating in detail the work done, and accounts, in triplicate, for the labour, showing the number of days or hours employed and the rate paid.\n\nThe Department will be unable to consider the repairs to the eaves troughing and school roof and supplying paint for interior decorating. There will be no funds available to supply a mangle and a drier for the laundry.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nDear Mr. McCull,\n\nWe all went over the Creesfoot School at Calgary, and I want to commend the people there for their effort to improve their work. They have really done wonders.\n\nThe school is shockingly overcrowded and something will have to be done to help them out. We all agreed on a cheap isolation building for the consumptive children. Four or five would do it. The Principal holds out for his extension, but I told him that in the present temper of government toward residential schools, there was a good chance that he would never get it.\nCluny, Alta., June 12, 1936\n\nSenator Buchanan,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe St. Joseph's School\nBlackfoot Reserve, Cluny, Alta.\n\nThis school has been on the Government list for enlargement for some time. It is very much overcrowded, and Father Rioult and the Sisters have repeatedly been asking for the building to be enlarged to accommodate the increased number of pupils who are in residence.\n\nIt was understood that this work would be done this summer, and apparently the Blackfoot Indian Reserve has some funds available for this purpose. The area between Cluny and Gleichen was totally hauled out last year, with the result that a large number of people are in distressed circumstances. The extension of this school would mean a great deal to this district and to the Indians if the work were done this year and the year after.\n\nI am sure that if you would take this matter up with the Indian Department, you would be able to very materially help us in this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd) David Nelson\nMinister's Office\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nJune 19, 1936\n\nDr. McGill,\nD.S.G., Indian Affairs\n\nRe: Increased Accommodation,\nSt. Joseph's School,\nBlackfoot Reserve.\n\nOn May 8th you reported in this matter.\n\nPlease note the attached copy of a letter which Senator Buchanan has now sent me, from David Nelson, of Cluny. Senator Buchanan says - \"Mr. Nelson is a man of standing in the district in which he lives and I always feel that I can rely upon his representations\".\n\nWill you please let me have a further report.\n\nC.W. Jackson\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nEnc. (June 12).\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nI have Mr. Jackson's memorandum of the 19th instant, with copy attached of a communication to Senator Buchanan, from David Nelson, of Cluny, Alberta, regarding the erection of an extension to the present building at the Crowfoot Indian Residential School, on the Blackfoot Reserve, to provide increased accommodation.\n\nAs you are, no doubt, aware, this matter received attention at the time our Estimates were being prepared for the current fiscal year. Further, an effort was made to have the funds required for the purpose included in the special vote allowed this Department to construct a number of school buildings. The amount required to erect the addition, viz.: $50,000.00, was not allowed.\n\nMr. Inspector Christianson, Calgary, is being written, with the request that he consult the Indians of the Blackfoot Band and endeavour to obtain their consent to provide the amount required, viz.: $50,000.00, from the Interest Funds at the credit of the Band in the Department. If the Indians refuse their consent, there is no other source from which funds would be available to carry out the work in erecting the extension to the Crowfoot Indian Residential School during the present fiscal year.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 104-2-5 of the 17th instant in connection with repairs to the Crowfoot School, and I note there is $500.00 available for the painting of the barn. I might say that as far as I know it will not take $500.00 to paint the barn, and in that event would it be in order to expend the difference for interior decorating, &c.?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, June 26, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your 401-11A. R.C. of the 22nd instant, in connection with repairs to the Crowfoot Indian Residential School and the funds available for the painting of the barn. In this regard I would refer you to official letter of the 17th instant, in which you were informed that only the sum of $500 was available for repairs at this school and the work to be carried out was enumerated.\n\nIn the letter referred to, you were informed regarding the painting of the barn, that, if the repairs authorized did not exceed the amount of the appropriation - $500.00, the Department would approve the purchase of the quantity of paint required for the barn, provided the school authorities could assist with the labour. It is considered that the cost of the repairs authorized might not use up the entire amount available and that there would be sufficient funds remaining to purchase the quantity of paint required for the barn.\n\nThe Department will leave the matter of the repairs in your hands, to carry out the work you consider most urgent for the funds available, and you may utilize the sum of approximately $500 in the manner in which you consider most advantageous in the interests of the school. If you believe it would be better to expend some of the funds available for interior decorating, rather than any of the other work enumerated by you in the first five items of your letter of the 12th instant, you may do so. However, I would request that you keep the total expenses as close as possible to the amount available, viz.: $500.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nM.

It proves that the children were getting the very best attention. Food is good. Milk is plentiful as well as meat, -the farmer sees to that. Unfortunately, the water supply is low and nothing more can be done until spring, when an artesian well should be dug. Water for washing is being hauled in barrels.\n\nG. H.

The work was done in the month of October.\n\nIn January the pumping plant from the Agency was moved to this school to be used as an auxiliary plant as the water supply was insufficient. I beg to refer to my letter of November 17th addressed to the Director when authority was asked for the purchase of a new plant. You will note that the cost of installing it in the school pump house totals $28.20 of this account. I trust this is in order.\n\nI regret the delay in submitting the voucher. Mr Michael mailed it to the Principal of the school and apparently it was mislaid until now.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, April 21, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nFor the past two or three years, the Department has been endeavouring to secure funds to make necessary alterations at the Crowfoot Indian Residential School, in order to provide adequate accommodation for the number of pupils that could be enrolled at this school. The estimate of the cost of the repairs that we have received was, approximately, $50,000.\n\nI regret that it was not possible to provide this amount in the current year's appropriation, but a much smaller amount might be made available and, for this reason, you are being written with a view to obtaining your opinion of the suggestion offered in this letter.\n\nInspector Schmidt is being requested to visit your agency in the very near future and, when he does so, you should visit the Crowfoot School and discuss with the Principal the advisability of erecting either of the following buildings:-\n\n(a) A two-roomed building with full basement - This would provide two classrooms and the basement would be intended for vocational training.\n\nG. H. Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\n(b) A four-roomed building with full basement - This would provide three classrooms, a room for sewing and, in this case also, the basement could be used for vocational training.\n\nEither of the above buildings would have to be erected at a short distance from the present school. The erection of either building would make more room available in the main building for dormitories.\n\nWhen you have discussed this matter thoroughly, you should advise the Department and, at the same time, you should give an estimate of the cost of both buildings. You should, also, state if, in the event of the Department proceeding with the work, it could be done by day labour, employing Indians under the charge of a competent foreman or whether you consider it would be cheaper to let the work by contract.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. A. Hoey\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nG. H. Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\n\nCOPY OF THIS LETTER SENT TO INSPECTOR SCHMIDT.\nAGENT'S REPORT ON BLACKFOOT RESERVE FOR MONTH OF APRIL 1937.\n\nSCHOOLS\n\nI made very short visits to the schools this month. Pupils did not have holidays at Easter but got three days when Interest payment was made on the 15th & 16th. All pupils look well. The school farms and gardens are being seeded and work is being done very well. Some handiwork has been started and Coronation Programmes are being prepared. The Principal at Crowfoot School wants more land, a problem to be considered and one which is not easy because Indian farmers are close neighbours and have valuable buildings on the land which the school desires. However, I believe there is a solution.\n\nThe Old Sun school is not so situated; unoccupied land near the school and in the flats where irrigation is possible is now capable of intensive production of feed and garden crops for this institution. This year, I expect that Old Sun's will grow all vegetables and feed required. Formerly this was impossible on dry lands.\n\nG. H.

The School people and the Inspector were agreed that such a building was necessary and after hours of deliberation, its location and dimensions were more or less fixed in our minds.\n\nThe Inspector is away on a visit to the Northern Agencies and in the meantime, I am getting other rough plans prepared. The type of construction, the method of heating and the approximate cost will be given. These will be submitted after a consultation with Inspector Schmidt when he returns from his tour of Inspection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Superintendent\nWelfare & Training\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nGleichen, Alta.\nJune 4, 1937\n\nAttention Mr. R.A. Hoey\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFurther to my letter of May 20th last regarding the erection of a building to relieve the overcrowded condition at the Crowfoot Residential School on this Reserve, I am now in a position to report our findings.\n\nInspector C.P. Schmidt spent a greater part of the 3rd instant with me at the school where alternative plans were considered. At the outset we agreed that a two-roomed building would not answer the purpose. There are 92 pupils on the roll and the Assistant Principal estimates that there may be at least 140 pupils by 1943. Whether or not his computation is actually correct matters but little. We do realize that there is a definite increase from year to year and we must build to take care of the increase over a period of years, if the existing system is likely to continue. There are now three classes and as the number of pupils increases, a fourth class must be started. Therefore the building should have 4 class rooms and should be large enough to accommodate 140 to 150 pupils. That is Inspector Schmidt's definite conviction. Originally, I had rough plans prepared for an entirely separate building but we immediately ran into opposition from the Principal and the Sister Superior. We then surveyed the possibility of connecting with the main building and attached rough plans will indicate what is suggested.\n\nThe central heating plant is certainly an advantage and we understand that the boiler is capable of heating not only the basement and class rooms but could also heat a second storey if this was desired at some future time. The Principal wants the addition despite the fact that certain light and possibly ventilation is taken from the present building. The rooms affected are either store rooms or staff rooms and occupied only a few hours each day. He and the Sister want the addition so connected with the main building that pupils may get back & forward in all kinds of weather without added clothing. Another reason for an addition and an important one, is the hope and desire to have a second storey at some future date, to be used as a chapel. The basement of the addition would be used for vocational training and a boys' playroom; there is room for both. In fact, such an addition as is suggested would leave three class rooms and a large playroom on the ground floor for other use which is much needed. You realize, of course that a 60 pupil school is housing 90 odd pupils and increased staff and overcrowding is terrible.\nThe addition recommended would be 52' x 60' with passages continued from basement to basement and ground floor to classrooms through a glassed in passage way on the existing verandah, and would be frame construction with a ledge left for brick veneer. The foundation and footings would be strong enough to carry a second storey and the roof would be flat tar & gravel.\n\nYou will note that a 10' passage runs down the centre of the addition, with the end room walled off beyond the doors to the two south class rooms. In fact, there is a room which would disappear if folding doors were constructed to turn it and the class rooms into one large auditorium. An auditorium is a crying need at this institution and we know no better way to supply an excellent one. The small room at the end of the hall is, by the way, an idea of Inspector Schmidt's. He knows the need of such as a quiet music room for the Sisters.\n\nIn arriving at the estimate of cost, I secured the technical advice of a representative of the Crown Lumber Co., L. Michael, Local steamfitter, and the Calgary Manager of the Dunham Heating System; also a local electrician. The heating main from the boiler is estimated large enough to heat a second storey and the general heating system to take care of class rooms where there is extra glass space. We have followed recognized school plans. We have not indicated emergency exits from the addition. We realize these must be supplied but our submission is a rough plan of our ideas.\n\nThe estimated cost, if done under contract, is $12,500.00. It cannot be done by day labour employing Indians, nor would I recommend day labour with a white crew. Bitter experience has shown us that this is a very expensive way to construct a building. We haven't a copy of the plan of the main building here but the basement and ground floor must conform to it. As a matter of fact, the basement is high - 8' above ground and 4' below, while the studding is, we believe, 14\". This means big airy rooms and basement. We hope the addition is not larger than anticipated; we started with plans of much smaller buildings and had to keep on enlarging until nearly double the size and cost that I originally submitted for the consideration of the Inspector and the Principal. But there was no alternative if the Department is building with any long term vision but to supply something along the line suggested here. I trust with the assistance of Mr Christianson and others who know Crowfoot School, you will be able to get a mental picture of our idea.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nIndian Agent.\nMinister's Office\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nJune 17, 1937.\n\nDR.

For the past three years, an endeavour has been made to secure the funds that are required to increase the accommodation at this school, as it is not only overcrowded at the present time but information that has been forwarded to us indicates that the number of children requiring education will increase during the next few years.\n\nWhen preparing our Estimates for the current fiscal year, an amount of $50,000 was included in order that a proper and adequate building could be added to the Crowfoot School. However, this amount did not finally remain in our Main Appropriation and, when preparing the Special Supplementaries, it was again requested but not allowed.\n\nRecently, Inspector Schmidt and Indian Agent Gooderham visited the Crowfoot Residential School and, while they consider a large addition necessary, they\nThe Deputy Minister,\n\nnow advise that, if an addition estimated to cost $12,500 could be erected this year, the present overcrowding could be temporarily alleviated.\n\nOne item of Vote 321 - Special Supplementary Estimates 1937-38 - read as follows:-\n\nTo provide for\n\nRepairs and Improvements to Residential Schools;\nBuildings at Residential Schools;\nAgency Buildings, and all other government buildings, and assistance to building projects relating to Indian administration - $33,000.\n\nThe above amount has been partly allotted, as follows:-\n\nGrant to Pine Falls Hospital - $10,000.\nBalance of Payment for Berens River teachers' residence - 1,500.\nNorway House and Caughnawaga Agency residences - 5,000.\nSalary and travelling expenses of H. Halcrow - 5,500.\n\nTotal - $22,000.\n\nThis leaves a balance unallotted of $11,000. As noted above, we would require, approximately, $1,500 more to erect the frame addition recommended by\n\nInspector\nThe Deputy Minister,\n\nInspector Schmidt and Indian Agent Gooderham. You might consider taking this amount from the Contingency Reserve of the Main Appropriation.\n\nAs you will note from the preceding part of this memorandum, an addition to the present accommodation at the Crowfoot Indian Residential School is absolutely necessary and I would appreciate your favourable consideration to authorizing the funds required for the erection, this year, of the addition mentioned above.\n\nActing Director.\nBlackfoot, June 1937.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit the following report for the month of June 1937.\n\nBoth schools were inspected. At Crowfoot, the pupils were happy and healthy. An unfortunate accident occurred when one of the Sisters broke a bone in her heel sliding down the fire escape pole during a fire drill. This type of fire escape is a heck of a contraption for a big institution.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nAgent\nSir:\n\nWith reference to Page 9 of the Estimates for 1937-38 for the Blackfoot Agency, I beg to ask whether the item of $100.00 for painting at Crowfoot School will be allowed.\n\nIf funds are available for this purpose, I would ask that the Agent be advised so that the work may be proceeded with during the holidays.

A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nC. P. Schmidt, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alta.\nOttawa, August 3rd, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department received your letter of June 4th, with reference to the Crowfoot Indian Residential School.\n\nVery careful consideration has been given to the proposed erection of the building that you suggest and, in this connection, it is noted that your letter mentioned an amount of $12,500 as the cost of the addition. It is presumed that this only provided for an unfinished building. The Department feels, however, that it would be inadvisable to build an addition and leave it in such condition.\n\nThe funds at our disposal are so limited that it is not possible to provide the amount that would be necessary to erect a completed addition of the size suggested in your letter. Past experience shows that it costs approximately 25\u00a2 a cubic foot to erect a completed building. Under these circumstances, it is found that funds could be secured for a completed building, 50 feet by 37 feet, with basement and one floor. This would give considerable extra space but would only be slightly more than one-half the size of the building suggested in your letter. However, in view of lack of funds, it is all that we can consider this year.\n\nI would appreciate your immediately discussing our proposal with the Principal and advise me, by wire, if he concurs in the erection of the addition which we suggest. If so, arrangements will be made to proceed with the work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG. H. Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\n\nR. A.

GOODERHAM INDIAN AGENT\nREPORT ON BLACKFOOT AGENCY FOR MONTH OF JULY 1937.\n\nSCHOOLS\n\nAll children were on holidays but a few T.B.'s, and some older girls who remained at school till after Calgary Stampede. Gardens at both schools are irrigated and are good. Old Sun school has a good fodder crop under irrigation. At Crowfoot grain crops were poor and are cut for feed; the Principal augmented this by purchasing between 30 and 40 tons of prairie hay and wheat hay from Indians. We allowed this to co-operate, but God Knows, every ton offered is needed and then it will cost $10.00 to $15.00 per ton for extra feed for Indian stock. The well at Old Suns was inspected again by an engineer of our Department. The water level is dropping and an auxiliary well is needed, I believe. The basement of this school is being repaired. The Chief's are prepared to supply nurses at the schools for the year 1937-38 on condition that they have T.B. experience, are recommended by the Medical Branch and follow the instructions of the Medical Superintendent; all of which is reasonable, I think. The time is near at hand when this should become a Departmental and not a Ban obligation.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nGleichen, Alta.\nAugust 26, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nA Night Watchman has been employed at the Crowfoot Residential School during the past two or three years and the Principal has made a request for a Night Watchman for the coming winter months.\n\nThe duties usually commence October First and continue until April 30th.

Rough sketch plans were prepared on this basis but it is found that a four-classroom school conforming to the existing building cannot be constructed for the amount available, namely, $12,500. It is now understood, however, that the Indian Agent has wired you that three classrooms only are required. This will mean a complete revision of the preliminary drawings that have been recently prepared.\n\nWould you kindly advise me if we should provide for four rooms or three rooms, and if the former, would another $2,000 be available.\n\nIn view of the late date this addition was decided upon, it is doubtful if work could be proceeded with economically by the time the plans are ready.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Wardle\n\nI am in receipt of your memorandum of October 7th with reference to the addition to the Crowfoot Indian Residential School, Cluny, Alta.\n\nIt is noted that rough sketch plans have been prepared on the basis of a four-roomed addition, but that the cost of construction of this building would be $14,500.\n\nI consider that a four-roomed addition is necessary and I would therefore appreciate if you would arrange to go ahead on this basis.\n\nIt is very important that this addition should be built at the earliest possible date and I would appreciate any action you take to rush construction.\n\nDirector.\nCalgary, October 14th, 1937.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to bring to the attention of the Department that the following letter has been received from Mr. Geo.

Of course these remarks should have been submitted to you before today, but we were not consulted about the plans officially and no blue prints were communicated to us.\n\nThe schools have been built for the accommodation of the pupils and staff; the Indian Department has in the past, been very well disposed to give us conveniences as needed, and I am very thankful for this.\n\nOn June 3rd, Mr. C.F. Schmidt, Inspector of Indian Affairs, with Mr. Gooderham, our Indian Agent, inspected the School in view of finding the most suitable place for the proposed extension, and after having thrown the school building in order to determine other alterations necessitated by this new addition, he came to the conclusion that the only place for the extension was the south side of the building and this also is the unanimous opinion of all contractors who have come to make their estimates before sending their tenders to Ottawa.\n\nOn the west side the main difficulty is the heating problem, not only for the initial cost of carrying a main to such a distance from the boiler; in fact we already have a great problem on hand in trying to heat the west side of the actual building, exposed as it is to all winter winds. On the east side, we run into the pressure tank, the cistern and the pipe running from the flowing well into the cistern. And on both sides the building will take up the play ground space of the children; infact on the west side it would entirely do away with the girls' playground which is already very small.\nAlso if the actual plans for the addition are kept, only the south side of the building would furnish adequate light for the basement class rooms. The actual ice-house will be torn down in any case as it was never satisfactory and is now useless since a frigidaire has been installed in the building itself.\n\nWhen your Department first consulted the Indian Agent about plans for the new addition, we were glad that an open basement had been provided for vocational training, and in which a dairy room would have been installed, as the actual room in the building used for such purpose is to be used to enlarge the dining-room. In this open basement a carpenter's shop for the boys and a room for Indian work had been proposed by us and accepted by the Indian Agent. However on the new plans, there is no more possibility of doing such a thing, as two class-rooms are located in the basement.\n\nI submit these remarks to your Department in the hopes that they will be taken into consideration before the contract is definitely given. Thanking you for all the trouble you have taken and the interest you have shown in approving an addition to our School. I remain,\n\nCROWFOOT INDIAN RESERVATION, SASKATCHEWAN\n\nCLUNY - ALBERTA\n\nPrincipal\nOttawa, November 8, 1937.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of November 4th with reference to the proposed extension to the Crowfoot Indian Residential School.\n\nI note that you would prefer to have the extension on the South side, but our plans have been prepared and it has been decided to place the extension on the East side of the building. If a change were made to the South side at the present time, it would involve very extensive changes in the plans and, as the season is advancing, it is doubtful if we could undertake the work this fall.\n\nThe Department is extremely anxious to erect the proposed extension at the present time and I feel that you will find when it is built that it will greatly ameliorate the conditions that have existed owing to overcrowding.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Class/work O.K. and general conditions satisfactory. Pupils at Old Sun might have been more tidy and cleaner but a number of changes in staff disorganizes a big institution. A nurse arrived on the 30th for Old Suns. A good flow of water was obtained at 185 feet in drilling at this school. At Crowfoot, girls downstairs were much overcrowded but now that an addition is to be erected, many of the housing troubles should disappear.

Hoey,\n\nPour faire suite \u00e0 ma lettre du 8 courant que vous avez sans doute d\u00fb recevoir, je puis vous dire que je me suis rendu moi-m\u00eame \u00e0 Cluny pour examiner sur place les nouveaux plans propos\u00e9s et les avantages que l'Ecole pourrait en retirer. Apr\u00e8s une discussion assez prolong\u00e9e et une \u00e9tude s\u00e9rieuse des conditions actuelles, nous sommes venus \u00e0 la conclusion que, sans r\u00e9pondre absolument aux besoins qui se font sentir depuis si longtemps, les am\u00e9liorations offertes par les nouveaux plans seront tr\u00e8s appr\u00e9ciables et m\u00e9ritent d'\u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es telles quelles.\n\nIl me reste \u00e0 vous prier de vouloir bien pousser ces travaux le plus rapidement possible. Il faudra aussi penser que certaines modifications seront n\u00e9cessaires pour adapter la vieille partie; j'esp\u00e8re que le D\u00e9partement verra \u00e0 les faire ex\u00e9cuter en m\u00eame temps que se poursuivront les travaux de construction.\n\nAvec l'assurance de mes sentiments les plus distingu\u00e9s,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEl. [signature]\nProvincial\n(Translation)\n\nEdmonton, Alta., November 13, 1937.\n\nMr. Hoey,\nDirector of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nIn further reference to my letter of the 8th instant which no doubt you must have received, I may tell you that I went to Cluny for the purpose of examining on the spot the new proposed plans and the advantages the School could derive therefrom. After a somewhat prolonged discussion and serious study of existing conditions, we came to the conclusion that while they do not fully meet the needs that have been pressing for so long, the improvements offered under the new plans are very appreciable and are worth carrying into effect such as they are.\n\nI must also ask you to use your good offices to expedite these works as speedily as possible. It will also have to be borne in mind that certain alterations will be necessary to adapt the old structure. I trust the Department will see to it that such alterations are effected at the same time as the main construction work.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nU. Langlois, O.M.I.,\nProvincial.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nSir;-\n\nI beg to draw to your attention at this time to the fire escapes at the Crowfoot Residential School. There are two iron poles set in concrete on the West and East wings of this institution and a wooden stairway at the rear. The iron poles lead to senior dormitories and access to them is through windows. Access to the wooden stairway is by door from junior classes dormitories.\n\nIn a fire drill last term, one of the sisters broke a bone in her foot which will give you some idea how dangerous the iron pole escape is. Everybody must climb over a bed onto the window sill and then slide down to the cement base.\n\nDuring the past summer I saw a simple chute escape on a Municipal Hospital and it appealed to me. The chute which was frame construction covered with thin sheet iron. There was a landing at the top and bottom and access to the top landing was by a door. The door could be equipped with a theatre escape fixture, so that there would be no delay in getting it open. Escapes by the windows should be replaced by doors in any event.\n\nThis institution was erected in 1912 of wooden construction and then brick veneered in 1922. It is crowded and good fire escape facilities should be supplied. This is not the first time this has been reported, and I repeat it now when you are considering the erection of an addition\u2014a very good time to fix up the escapes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nSir:\n\nMr. Geo. H. Gooderham, Indian Agent, at Blackfoot Reserve, has written me as follows:\n\n\"On a recent inspection at Crowfoot School, the Principal and Sister Superior showed me the need of a large table in the Sisters dining room, and also the need of longer tables in the children's dining room. The Staff of Sisters is nearly double the original number and the same is true of the pupils.\n\n\"At the moment, we should look after the Sisters; They put up with every form of inconvenience and overcrowding. To build a proper sized table, labour and material will cost $30.00 and I ask for authority to get it. The present table used by the Sisters would be moved to the children's dining room and used properly.\n\n\"Since there has been a wired enquiry about the proposed addition to this school in October, it may still materialize and if it does, that will be the time to look after the children's tables, don't you think?\"\n\nI would recommend that the request be granted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. Pant. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, November 30, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Inspector Schmidt with reference to a recent letter he has received from you regarding the new table for the sister's dining room at the Crowfoot School. You may expend an amount not exceeding $30.00 in securing this table.\n\nRegarding your letter of the 16th instant, the Department is unable to consider making any changes in the fire escape at Crowfoot School, owing to lack of funds. However, you may arrange for the escapes by the windows to be replaced by doors. No doubt you can have this work done in the near future at a reasonable cost.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nG.H.

This procedure would\nseem to simplify accounting work and at the same time\nconforms to the arrangement approved at the time reorganiza-\ntion was effected.\n\nI do not know to just what extent, if any,\nthis arrangement can be made to cover funds that have already\nbeen made available to this branch by the issue of cheques,\nbut I would be very glad if you could make such arrangements\nas may be necessary to have all future transfers approved by\nthe usual Treasury Board Minute.\n\nWould you kindly advise me in this respect.\n\n(Sgd.) J. M. Wardle,\nDirector.\n\nE. A. Sawyer, Esq.,\nChief Treasury Officer,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources.\nOttawa, December 10th, 1937.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Wardle,\n\nRe Funds transferred from Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nReferring further to your memorandum of December 8th, I quite agree with the suggestion contained in your second paragraph that all funds transferred from the Indian Affairs Branch should be with the approval of Treasury Board. It has been my contention that the practice of issuing cheques from Indian Affairs Branch for deposit in our Branch should be discontinued.\n\nArrangements will be completed with the Treasury Officer of the Indian Affairs Branch so that no further cheques will be forwarded, but at this time I do not think it would be practical to attempt to set up allotments for those funds that have already been transferred by cheque owing to the number involved.\n\nChief Treasury Officer.\nOttawa, December 10th, 1937.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. McCutcheon,\n\nConfirming phone conversation, will you kindly arrange with your Director for application so that you may prepare a Journal Voucher for the transfer of $14,000.00 to the Surveys and Engineering Branch to cover the completion of an addition to the Crowfoot Indian Residential School, Blackfoot Indian Reserve, Cluny, Alberta.\n\nChief Treasury Officer.\nMy visits to Crowfoot school were in connection with the construction of an addition. At last it has become a fact, not what was anticipated, nor where the Principal wanted it, but in a good location, I think. As all construction is now under the charge of the engineering branch, we don't know anything about tenders, plans and specifications until someone comes to us for information, and that is how we get the information of what is going on.\n\nDoes it not appear that there is a lack of co-operation between branches? We are very glad indeed to see the engineers take over this work; that is real good business, but complications can be avoided by letting our branch field men know what is going on before it is too late, I think.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nRepresentative of the Treasury\n\nPlease transfer from Vote 321, to the Surveys and Engineering Branch, an amount of $14,000 in connection with the erection of an addition to the Crowfoot Indian Residential School.\n\nDirector.\nHOEY, OTTAWA, ONT. 13\n\nCORRIDOR ENTRANCE AT WEST WALL STOP I RECOMMEND THIS CHANGE\n\nPLEASE WIRE REPLY.\n\nG.

Gooderham, the Indian Agent of the Blackfoot Reserve, is in Ottawa at the present time and has strongly recommended certain changes in the basement of the new addition to the Crowfoot Indian Residential School.\n\nPresent plans call for a classroom on the south side of the basement. It is recommended that this be divided into two rooms with partition between them - one room to be utilized as a dairy with outside entrance, and the other as a lavatory.\n\nThese changes have already been discussed by the Principal with Mr. Snelson and the contractor, but of course, they will require confirmation from you before making any change in the original plan.\n\nIn order that this work will not be delayed, I would appreciate very much if you would wire your engineers and authorize the changes mentioned above, on the understanding that the total cost will not exceed $250.00. The actual cost of the changes may exceed this amount, but there will be a saving in the elimination of flooring, wainscoting and plastering, provided for the south classroom in the original plans.\n\nDirector.\nGLEICHEN, ALTA., JAN., 20 1938\n\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH,\nDEPT., MINES AND RESOURCES, ATTENTION MR.

McGill\nDirector of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.\n\nDear sir:\n\nI have received your circular re: Fire Prevention and Fire escapes.\n\nThough the matter has been reported many times to the Department in the last few years, I again take the liberty of accepting your invitation to make some remarks.\n\nWe have a night watchman, who patrols the house regularly; our fire extinguishers are in order but our system of fire escapes is very precarious. We have a fire escape at each end of the building. These are windows, leading unto platforms outside with an iron pole leading to the ground. This iron pole rests in a base of concrete which is raised a few inches above the level of the ground.\n\nWe are unable however to make regular drills. Every time a drill has taken place, someone has been injured. So far in the last few years three members of the staff had to receive treatment in hospital. And last year, the girls' matron broke her heel. Since then, the children are so nervous about drills that the only thing we can do is to practise them to get in line and be prepared to go down.\n\nAfter last year's accident a report was made by the agent, but the Department reported lack of funds for a suitable system of fire escape. The only thing granted was to change the windows into doors. It is therefore my duty again to report this deficiency in our system of fire escape and hope that something will finally be done about it.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nJ. River, Principal\n\nCROWFOOT INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nCLUNY ALBERTA\nOttawa,\nMarch 3, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to the circular recently issued regarding fire prevention at Residential Schools the Principal of the Crowfoot Indian Residential School has written me along the same lines as your letter of November 16, 1937.\n\nAs you were previously informed there are no funds available at the present time for a new fire escape. It is considered, however, that until such time as funds are available for the erection of a new fire escape it should be possible to place some padding at the bottom of the pole which would at least eliminate serious injury to anyone using the fire escape.\n\nI note from the Principal's letter that the instructions contained in the last paragraph of my letter of November 30 have been carried out. In reviewing your letter of November 16 I note that anybody using the fire escape has to climb over a bed to the window sill. You should arrange with the Principal that no bed should be near the window sill where the fire escape is located. There should be easy access to the fire escape.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

As you know, this work was cancelled insofar as the contract was concerned in order that the latter could be closed out on March 31st last and all payments made from funds available in the past fiscal year.\n\nHowever, the contractor has forwarded a signed undertaking to carry out the unfinished work for the sum of $90.00 when instructed by the Department to do so. Our Engineer in charge of this work states that the contractor has done an excellent piece of work.\n\nIt does not appear that we will have other construction work in the neighbourhood of Cluny this season and it seems advisable for your Indian Agent at the Blackfoot Reserve to supervise the completion of the interior painting and decorating and that accounts for the amount involved, namely $90.00, be paid directly by your Branch. Will you kindly advise me if this arrangement is satisfactory to you. If so, we will instruct our Supervising Engineer at Banff to give the Indian Agent all details in regard to the uncompleted work.\nIn the meantime you might kindly regard this memorandum as formally transferring the above building to you. It is expected that we will be able to supply you shortly with some photographs of it.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\n14 Window Screens\nCedar 1/8\" thick\nBlack wire\n\n22 Window Screens\nCedar 1/8\" thick\nVertical bar in centre\nBlack wire\n\n\"F\"\n12 of these\n1/8\" thick\nCedar\nVertical bar in centre\n1/4\" mesh wire\nfor stone guards\n\n\"G\"\n3 of these\n1/8\" thick\nCedar\n3 Vertical bars\n1/4\" mesh wire\nfor stone guards\n(figure 6 angle on outside)\nCrowfoot Indian Res School\nCrowsnest Pass, Alberta\n\n1/4 Panes / Basement\nStorm Sash\nNot more than 1/8\" thick\nRabbeted in centre to open\nin to building.

We would gain nothing by purchasing and paying him for the labour. You will realize, I am sure, that screens and storm windows are necessary; at this time, of course, the most urgent need is screening.\n\nWith the estimate are plans which will show in some detail the type of windows required.\n\nI shall await your instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nApril 22, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of a memorandum from the Director of the Surveys and Engineering Branch of this Department in which he states that the work at the Crowfoot Residential School is now completed with the exception of some interior painting and decorating.

A report just received from another Residential School this morning contained the information that the boys, under the direction of a member of the staff, had made some 50 screen windows at a minimum of expense.\n\nIf the Principal is prepared to carry out the suggestion made in this letter the Department would consider supplying the material that would be necessary. In this event detailed information should be supplied in order that purchase can be made by our Purchasing Branch.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nG. H.

Would it be asking too much of you to ask them to hurry up with the return of $1200.00 deposit cheque. The job has been done nearly two months now and I need the money. I have certain work on that calls for some outlay of money, and owing to the damn fool legislation of our present idiotic provincial government, it is getting next to impossible to borrow money at the Bank. Hate to bother you with my troubles, but hope you can hurry them along.\"\nYour memorandum of May 19 stated that the work at the Crowfoot School had been completed and I would, therefore, appreciate if you would arrange to return Mr. Holmes' deposit cheque.\n\nDirector.\nAttention Schools Branch.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe addition to the Crowfoot Residential School is complete except for storm windows and plumbing which the Principal wants installed and moved from the main building. There is also a request that certain plumbing changes be made in the main building.\n\nThe Local Plumber was asked to submit a quotation on this work. To install two baths, four basins, four closet combinations, one urinal trough 4' with flush pipe, one apron sink 42\" cast (in dairy), build one partition and taking up floors and repairing same in the addition; moving bath and supplying new closet combination for Sisters' bath room adjacent to the room they propose to use for a dormitory and doing all repairing and supplying all necessary fittings, he asks the sum of $384.00.\n\nTo make the necessary changes in the dormitories as, the removal of a wall; making a door and putting a partition in the Sisters' dormitory, it is estimated that the cost will exceed $200.00.\n\nThe total cost of the changes, including the plumbing will then be in the neighbourhood of $600.00 and this does not include the storm windows for the addition. The plumbing changes are necessary and so is most of the work if this school with its new addition is to overcome the overcrowded condition. Please instruct us in this as the work should be done during the summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa,\nJune 7, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 1st instant with reference to the Crowfoot Residential School.\n\nIn our current year's appropriation the amount of $750.00 was provided for repairs, improvements and new equipment at this school. We have already expended $22.90 for rebuilding the chimney and $90.00 for painting, or a total of $112.90. This leaves a balance of $637.10 and it will, therefore, be possible to favourably consider the recommendations made by you in the second and third paragraphs of your recent letter.\n\nHowever, before authorizing you to proceed with the work I would appreciate your advising the name and address of the \"local plumber\" from whom you have obtained a quotation. I presume that his quotation of $384.00 includes both material and labour.\n\nIn connection with the changes to the dormitories I think you mentioned this when you were in the Department last winter and I am under the impression that your estimate of $200.00 refers to material only. In that event, or even in the event of the material costing more than $50.00, it will be necessary for you to supply full particulars regarding what is required in order that purchase may be made through our Purchasing Branch.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG. H. Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 1st instant and my reply of the 7th instant I was talking to one of the engineers from the Surveys & Engineering Branch this morning and he felt that if at all possible it would be advisable to secure quotations for the work required at the Crowfoot Residential School from two or three qualified parties. No doubt you will endeavour to do this before replying to my letter of yesterday's date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nG. H.

I would appreciate very much receiving an early reply to that letter, giving the information requested.\n\nMy letter of June 7th stated that there was a balance of $637.10 available. Recently, we received an account for $14.35.

Partition 25x14 and door.\n\n3. Junior class room to be Sisters' dormitory, visitors bedroom and a cloak room. Partitions 28\u00bdx14 & 14x20 and two doors.\n\n4. Boys' (basement) lavatory and bath room to be 4 storerooms for vegetable, fruit and trunks etc. One partition 28\u00bdx10 and one door. Shelving for fruit 2 walls 24\u00bd' each.\n\n5. Move bath toilet and partition from West end to small room adjoining Sisters' (new) dormitory.\n\n6. Move 12 long wall closets to new locations and also build 2 new ones 10x12 and 10x23 in new cloak rooms.\n\n7. Rear verandah (rotten) on first floor must be rebuilt. New flooring 95x9 required. This is much used and important.\n\n\u00a7 IN NEW ADDITION:\n\n1. Toilet, bathroom and dairy in basement - new partition 8 x 22 and door; moving from main building 2 baths, 3 toilets 4 wash basins with partitions and setting up. Dairy already equipped with 2 motors, drain boards etc. - a splendid dairy and the Department did not buy any new equipment for it.\n\n2. Principal is installing a drinking fountain on main floor also in Indian waiting room of Main building at no expense to the Department.\nThe action of the Principal is something new but is refreshing. We have gone over the programme of work and consider every move is either very necessary or a decided improvement over the existing layout. In fact, the new addition is of little value unless these changes are made nor will the overcrowding in the main building be eliminated without them. Needless to say, it is the least costly method and we are satisfied that the Principal and his assistants are quite capable of doing all the work set out on the list.\n\nAn early reply is requested as the work should proceed through the holiday period.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nGleichen, Alta.\nJuly 7, 1938.\n\nAttention Mr Phelan - Schools Division\n\nRE: Crowfoot Residential School - Blackfoot Res.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nUpon receipt of yours of June 7th file 104-2-5 I got in touch with the Acting Principal of the school, Revd. Father Lessard. When it was known that only $337.10 was now available for repairs etc., it was quite evident that all could not be done that should be done unless labour costs were reduced materially. So Father Lessard got busy and worked out a programme of work using cheap labour and I think you will agree that he will do more with this allowance than we've ever done in the past, if the scheme is authorized.\n\nIn the first place, he would eliminate all highly-prized mechanical labour by using a handy man whose wages are $40.00 per month. He then went to the Crown Lumber Co. with a bill of material and ascertained the cost of lumber required. Attached hereto is a list of the work already done or to be done and the Lumber Company's quotation on material. You will note that the Crown Lumber Co submits anet price of $466.00 which leaves $174.00 to pay for everything else. The Revd. Father asks for necessary hardware and paint which he estimates at $75.00 and an allowance of $30.00 to assist in paying for the labour. This will bring the cost to slightly more than the allowance for this school but I trust this may be authorized.\n\nThe Crown Lumber Co in Gleichen is the only firm in these parts and is on the Patronage List. Hardware should not exceed $50.00 and can be purchased locally from firms on the list; likewise paint. In regard to the labour, would it be possible to allow the Principal $30.00 per month for the months of June, July & August for a mechanic, by submission of a Voucher through this office as is done in the case of the Night Watchman?\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF\n\nCrowfoot Indian Residential School, Cluny, Alberta.\n\nVOTE 76 Allotment\n\nSHIP TO G.

The Indian Agent has secured a quotation of $466.02 from the Crown Lumber Company, Gleichen, Alberta. This firm is on the approved list.\n\nThe Indian Agent considers that the price mentioned is very reasonable. The school management is prepared to do practically all the work without cost to the Department. The school is now closed for holidays and any repairs should be made within the next few weeks. I therefore recommend that purchase order be issued, authorizing purchase of the articles mentioned on the quotation from the Crown Lumber Company, Gleichen, Alberta, at a cost of $466.02.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, July 15, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to the repairs that you consider necessary at the Crowfoot Indian Residential School.\n\nThe tender of the Crown Lumber Company has been submitted to the Purchasing Agent and we have recommended the purchase of the material from them. As soon as we have the decision of the Purchasing Agent, you will be advised.\n\nYou may purchase, from firms on the approved list, the necessary hardware and paint, the cost of which is estimated at $75.00. I understand from your letter that two or more accounts will be submitted in connection with these purchases. This method will bring each account under the $50.00 limit.\n\nI am sorry that present regulations will not permit our paying the $90.00 for labour in the manner that you suggest. However, this amount can be expended by keeping paylists. As soon as we hear from the Purchasing Agent regarding the tender of the Crown Lumber Company, I will forward you an accountable cheque for $90.00 to cover the cost of labour to that amount.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nG.

The children, of course, were still on holidays and did not return until the sixth of July. The improvement and repair work to the Crowfoot school was being carried out with local labor and the acting Principal is to be commended on the class of work and the amount that he was able to do with very limited expenditure. This school was in good shape to properly care for all the pupils this year. The crop at this school was excellent and is now being threshed. At the Old Sun School the staff was concentrating on the harvesting which came off irrigated lands. This land has produced abundance of feed and a good garden as well as some threshed grain. Both schools had done well with their exhibits at the Calgary Fair and prize money was here for the pupils on their return this fall. This coming year more stress will be given to handicraft work and the general work will undoubtedly be more pleasing to the Indian pupils.\n\nG. H.
