We sincerely sympathize with the bereaved relatives and friends.\n\nA meeting composed of French and English half-breeds, was held at Lindsay school house on Tuesday last; the object of the meeting was to consider and pass a set of resolutions which have been passed at previous meetings, and resolve that the same be sent to the government of Canada, by said French and English half-breeds.\n\nThe substance of resolutions passed was substantially the same as with the addition of two, viz., one protesting against the participation of the French members in the election, while the other is agreed to sending a delegation to Louis Riel. Opposition was made by the English half-breeds, who objected to the manner in which the chairman, Mr. Andrew Spencer, conducted the business in which he said it was impossible that they could be expected to fight themselves to the death over a matter of food.\n\nThe whole meeting was left to commence. The meeting ended without any resolutions as presented by the French. It appeared to be the mind of the meeting to adjourn, but Mr. Spencer insisted instead of having to send out all of our men to meet the resolutions concerning the surrendering of the territory of the North West Territories into the Union. With the aid of all their means, the French members could not do this, but as was stated in the resolutions, it will only mean to get the government to make a treaty with the Indians, but Canadians from Ontario with guns, one of the latter taking the lead, opening fire, and killing the Indians, and then saying that they were doing it for the purpose of driving the Indians out of the country.\n\nRed Deer Hill, May 13, 1884.\n\nCORRESPONDENCE\n\nWe do not hold ourselves responsible for the views expressed by correspondents.\n\nAGRICULTURAL SOCIETY.\n\nTo the Editor of The Times.\n\nSir, \u2014 As I have promised a short time since, I am obliged to send you some news, allow me to state that our Agricultural Society has been getting along very well, thanks to kind contributors and advisers. Of course this being the first of the kind in this district, there were many difficulties at first. A board has been elected, and the whole thing is started in a way that will give satisfaction to the farmers, which is said by the business community to be the proper thing, though they say that the farmers should reign in favor of the mercantile community taking that part, in being supplied with goods, etc., which the business community could afford to better. Of course this is all talk at present, but the farmers are anxious to see something done. In June, it is their intention to hold a general meeting in Prince Albert with a view to electing officers, and to have the majority of the directors to make Prince Albert the central place for the quarter of the district. The plan seems to be working, and though he did not dictate or suggest anything to that effect, still to make Prince Albert the center of the district would be greatly appreciated by the experienced adviser and help in different ways. For instance such men as the Hon. L. Clarke, Hon. Mr. Macdonald, Messrs. Swanson, Kennedy and Hughes and Col. Spear, with other gentlemen, who are interested in the success of the institution, either with funds or advice, for both are acceptable. We feel sure that the members will gladly interest themselves in it, but we are unfortunately not acquainted with them as yet. We are glad to hear that Mr. Clarke has taken the lead only with a subscription of $100 towards his fund and has been assisted by several others.\n\nIn the width of the Society for all funds to take an active part in the proceedings.\n\nWe have received several letters from any friends of a similar nature, chiefly as to making Prince Albert the center or headquarters of the district. We are glad to find that the Society of accommodation in case the exhibition in the fall is held here. Also, the Albert Agricultural Society would also be grateful to any gentleman, not giving any stated sum, should they be disposed to give something in particular.\n\nThe by-laws will be printed as soon as the price list, and will appear in the local newspapers in a few days.\n\nCHAS.
