Hoey, Esq.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith regard to (2) it is detrimental to the health of the Indian children to allow them to study in buildings in which the wind blows through the walls, and the only warm spot is immediately round the stove. We realize that building material is hard to obtain, but a large number of schools are being built in this Province. The Indians notice this, and say that if schools can be built for the white children, why should they not be built for the Indian children.\n\nYours Faithfully,\n\nBishop of Saskatchewan.\nPrince Albert Saskatchewan.\nJune 14th, 1946.\n\nH.A. Hoey, Esq.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAt a meeting of the Synod of The Diocese of Saskatchewan held on June 13th, 1946, the following resolution was passed: \"That a letter be addressed to the Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, asking (1) that the question of the Salaries of the Teachers of Indian Day Schools be reviewed, and that these Teachers be classed as Civil Servants, and have the advantage of the Government Pension Scheme. (2) That old log school buildings, which are cold and draughty in winter, such as exist at Red Earth and Shoal Lake in the Pas Agency, and at Stanley in the Carlton agency, be replaced by well-built lumber class rooms. (3) That new Day Schools be established on those Reserves which have no school at present, and when there are a sufficient number of children to warrant a school. One such Reserve is that of Loon Lake, Saskatchewan.\"\n\nHoping that these request will receive the earnest consideration of the Department, I Remain,\n\nyours faithfully,\n\nBishop of Saskatchewan.\n**STATEMENT**\n\nRed Earth, Sask., 1946\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nThe Pas Agency, Man.\n\nIn Account With\n\nR.A.

I would suggest, therefore, that you advise us as soon as the Nelson House School is erected and ready for occupancy, as to whether you would wish prefabricated buildings also at Shoal Lake and Red Earth.\n\nI would point out that the Nelson House School is without an attached teacher's residence. It is presumed that at Shoal Lake and Red Earth you would want the different plan of building provided. This other plan is for a one-room school with attached teacher's residence. North American Buildings, Limited, are providing one of these for Mr. Olson at Little Grand Rapids. It is suggested that you contact him directly and have his advice you as to the suitability of this plan for your requirements at Shoal Lake and Red Earth.\n\nBernard P.

Neary\n\nChg. Indian Affairs.\nPP/EGD\nExtract from letter signed by T.A. Bowman, The Pas Agency, dated June 21st, 1948. Original on file 1-1-5.\n\nShoal Lake, Sask., and Red Earth, Sask., schools, both should be shipped direct to Carrot River, Sask., for onward transportation to Shoal Lake Reserve and Red Earth Reserve. These two schools should not be shipped until the winter as they will have to be hauled by caterpillar tractor over frozen swamps and lakes.\n\nIn connection with the above, see letter of June 29th to Assistant Agent Bowman on file 1-1-5\nExtract from letter from Mr. Ostrander dated June 21st, 1948. Original on file 107-9-1.\n\nI examined the classroom and teacherage at the Red Earth Reserve. The classroom is an old log building and certainly no credit to the Department. The teacherage is very small, difficult to heat, and would not attract any teacher. School attendance is poor, partly because the school is situated at a point which is surrounded by water a great part of the year, and many of the children cannot reach the school for long periods because of the water, and partly because the Indians are trappers and do not seem to be much interested in education.\n\nI did not visit the Shoal Lake Day School as I was informed that it was closed, but Mr. J.R. Bell, in charge of the Sipanok Rat Project, who resides at Red Earth, informed me that conditions at Shoal Lake are even worse than at Red Earth.\n\nBoth of these points are so situated that the erection of classrooms and teaching quarters at the two places is out of the question at the present time because of the cost.\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n304 Post Office Bldg., Regina, Sask.\n\nOttawa, June 28, 1948.\n\nRed Earth Indian Day School; Shoal Lake Indian Day School\n\nReference - your 1148-300-11 of June 21 -\n\nRed Earth Indian Day School; Shoal Lake Indian Day School.\n\nReference - your 1148-300-11 of June 21 -\n\nRed Earth Reserve\nOne-room Indian school with attached residence $14,000.00\n\nShoal Lake Reserve\nOne-room Indian school with attached residence $14,000.00\n\nWe have had considerable correspondence with both the present and former Agent at The Pas with regard to these two projects.\n\nIt was our intention to order prefabricated schools to be shipped in next winter for erection during the summer of 1949. In view of your comments concerning the Red Earth Reserve and the Shoal Lake Reserve and the possibility of educating these children at the Prince Albert Residential School, I would suggest that you write to Mr. Law at The Pas concerning your findings.\n\nBernard F.

Indian Day School.\n\nThis will enable us to order the materials required for this school and have them shipped in by winter freight to Nelson House. Thus, we will have on hand by the Spring a complete bill of materials as required for a one-room school. I am sending a copy of this letter to Mr. Indian Superintendent Law and am attaching thereto copies of the standard bill of materials for this school. It would be appreciated if Mr. Law could submit a requisition attached to one copy of this bill of materials. On this requisition he can indicate the names of local suppliers for the lumber required. It is presumed that it would be cheaper to buy the lumber in The Pas than in Winnipeg. However, we will await your comments concerning this.\n\nIt is not necessary to have this bill of materials retyped on the requisition form but merely state on the requisition form as follows -\n\n\"To bill of materials as required for standard one room school with attached teacherage.

Dr. Strath told me he had over 90 children at this school on the day we arrived, and where they could be packed appeared to me a mystery, notwithstanding his arrangement of biscuit boxes around the stove, and in any available vacancy. The fact is the school house is altogether inadequate in size for so important a point, and as to facilities for proper ventilation there are none. The chimney is both too small in its lateral dimensions, and too low for a proper draught, and into this enters the smallest sized stove pipe. There should be a large chimney with good fire place and built sufficiently high to ensure a draught, which, with a good stove, would give the requisite ventilation in the winter; and the school house doubled in size.\nOTTAWA 29th September 1894\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith for information and report thereon an extract from the Annual Report of Dr Orton for '94 relative to the sanitary condition of the Rossville School house.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFor the Deputy Supt:Genl:\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nE. McColl, Esq.\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th, and with enclosing for any report thereon an extract from the Annual Report of Dr. Oliver for 1894 relative to the sanitary condition of the Roseville Schoolhouse, and in reply thereto, I beg to inform you that the Schoolhouse in question belongs to the Methodist Mission Society, and was only built three years ago.\n\nThe Deputy\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6246, file 540-1, part 1)\nor four years ago. It is a frame building, shingled, plastered and painted without, and well floored and ceiled within. Has seats with backs, and tables for writing in it. But it is not large enough to accommodate more than 40 or 50 children whereas according to the latest returns received from the school, the number of pupils enrolled was from 52 to 64, and I assume at time of treaty payments the number would increase during that time to 70, but this number is no criterion of the attendance. I do not understand why the biscuits were...\nstood in the schoolhouse as the old schoolhouse would answer for that purpose, instead of crowding the new building with them. The chimney is a very good one, the stovepipe entering it is six inches in size, a seven inch pipe would doubtless be preferable, and if Dr. Oterius or some other patent ventilator were placed in the stovepipe I think the ventilation would be reasonably satisfactory.\n\nI waited upon the Rev. Mr. Demmery, the Superintendent of Methodist Missions here, and he informed that the facility had been con-\ntemptation the erection\nof an addition to the\nSchoolhouse in order\nto afford ample ac-\ncommodation to all\nthe pupils in atten-\ndance.\n\nShow the house\nto be fit.\nYour obedient\nServant\n\nJ.J.A.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to forward the School returns of the Rossville Day School, Norway House, for June quarter last.\n\nIt will be noticed from this office receipt stamp that these returns have been delayed here over twenty days, a fact which I beg to explain as follows: The returns were brought to the office by the teacher himself, Mr. Joseph H. Lowes; during a conversation with whom the following facts were elicited: that, contrary to the impression prevailing in the office to the effect that the Rossville Day School and the Norway House Boarding School were some seven miles apart, they are, as a matter of fact, quite close to each other; so much so that the teaching of Boarders and Day Scholars alike is done in the Day School by the Day School teacher.\n\nThe consequence is that the names of the Boarders appear on both the Day School and Boarding School returns which the Department may discover by comparing the returns for the March quarter. If this has not been noticed already, it would, I suppose, mean that whilst the Day School was paid on its average, the tuition grant was at the same time paid the Boarding School which, I assume, would have been an overpayment.\n\nAfter being provided with this information from a person aware of the facts, I thought it better to keep back the returns.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nreturn now sent until I received the Boarding School one, compare both and make such remark as would suit the case.\n\nThe Boarding School returns have not yet come to hand, a delay caused, I am afraid, by lack of forethought, and as it would be unfair to keep the others any longer, they are now being forwarded. When the Boarding School returns come they will be examined carefully.\n\nIf, as I presume, there has been an overpayment, I suppose it can be withheld from the June quarter return.\n\nAs Mr. Lowes has direct arrangements with the Methodist Missionary Society, I dare say we have nothing to do with his having received a smaller contribution than he would otherwise have received had he been in direct communication with the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Commissioner.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA, 20th February, 1905.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nThe teacher of the Rossville Mission school at Norway House reports that this school was closed and on the 8th November by order of the Agent Dr Campbell the building being turned into a temporary hospital on account of an epidemic of diphtheria, scarlet fever measles and mumps. I notice that Mr Laird makes a marginal note to this effect: \"The school was only open 17\u00bd days but there was an outbreak of scarlet fever which probably accounts for this\". I think we should have Dr Bryce's opinion as to the turning of the schoolhouse into a hospital for such contagious diseases as scarlet fever and diphtheria. The boarders at the Norway House school receive tuition in this building which is close to the boarding school.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6246, file 540-1, part 1)\nMemo for the Deputy re the Rossville Mission School.\n\nMr. Benson's memorandum on the report of the Hon. David Laird received.\n\nWith regard thereto I would say that it is rather difficult to express an opinion without more definite information re location of the Rossville Day School and Norway House Boarding School. What I am inclined to think occurred is that, in the absence of any other suitable building, since disease had got amongst the children generally, it was thought best, since the school work had been interrupted, to make isolation possible by sending all sick to one building, thus removing from the Boarding School any new case which might occur. In the absence of any other suitable building, the action taken was wise, provided that the disinfection of the school building is thorough.\n\nApril 14th., 1905.\n\nChief Medical Inspector.\nBrandon August 7, 1911.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI would like the following teachers with salary mentioned sanctioned by the Department for the fiscal year commencing July 1st.\n\nMiss Ida Golding, Cross Lake $450.00\nMr Thomas Bolster, Norway House 500.00\nMrs J.H.

F Ferrier.\nOttawa, August 23, 1911.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant in which you recommend an increase in salary from $300.00 to $500.00 for Mr. Thomas Bolster, teacher of the Methodist day school at Norway House.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that under present conditions the Department is not prepared to carry out your request. I would draw your attention to the fact that the average attendance of day school pupils at this school for the past four quarters has been only 8.6, 4, 4.7 and 5 respectively. Of course as you are aware the Department is not responsible for Mr. Bolster's salary as teacher in the Boarding School, but should he be successful in obtaining a much better attendance at the day school the Department would then be prepared to consider your request. In any event at the present time the Department would not be prepared to make the large increase asked for.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nNorway House\nMay 18th 1914\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIt is my intention (with the consent of the Indian Department) to close the Rossdale Methodist Day School on this Reserve on or about the 6th of June 1914. I will have taught two hundred (200) days by that time.\n\nThis is rendered necessary by the fact of my having to seek medical advice in order to be ready for the opening of school after the summer vacation.\n\nThis communication would have been sent to you at an earlier date, but I was under the impression that it was within my province to close school at any time after I had\ntaught two hundred (200) days.\n\nPerhaps I have been wrong in this opinion. I regret having read the instructions in this way.\n\nHoping that matters may be arranged satisfactorily,\n\nI am yours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTeacher Rossville Methodist Day School\n\nNorway House Agency\nSir,\n\nIn my school report for the Roseville day school for the month of May, I mentioned that Miss DeWolff was closing the school on the 5th of June. I have now received a letter from Miss DeWolff explaining why she wishes to close the school before the 30th of June, and which I forward to the Department, trusting that the explanation will be found satisfactory.\n\nI may say that Miss DeWolff requires a thorough rest, as she has not only taught her day school, but has taught IS of the Indian boarding scholars as well, which has been an extra labour to her. I hope that the summer vacation will be the means of restoring her to her usual health, so that she can take up her duties again next fall. Miss DeWolff is a very capable teacher, and it would be very hard to get another like her.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.G. Stewart,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 11, 1924.\n\nSIR,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th ultimo enclosing a communication from Miss DeWolf, teacher of the Roseville Day School, stating that on account of ill health she was closing this school for the summer holidays on the 5th instant.\n\nIn reply I beg to inform you that, as she will have taught the required number of days by that time, the closing of this school on the above date is approved. It is hoped that she will be able to resume her duties after the summer vacation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. G.

If it is possible for you to allow the\nschool to be closed at the end of May I think that it\nwould be in the interest of teacher and pupils to do so.\nMiss Royan would like to take on the school for another\nyear but in order that she can do so she ought to have\nmore than a month's holiday.\n\n(Sgd.)

Her appointment has been approved by the Department, with salary at the rate of $650.00 a year.\n\nI may say that all cheques for salary are sent to the Treasurer of the Methodist Missionary Society, Toronto, upon receipt of quarterly returns of attendance. A cheque for $58.50, being salary for the 18 days she taught during the month of September, as shown by her return, has been sent to the Treasurer of the Methodist Missionary Society.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nW.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, September 4th, 1930.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to inform you that the authorities of the United Church of Canada have nominated Mrs. Annie W. Hill as teacher of the Rossville Indian Day School. The Department is approving of her appointment at a salary of $95 a teaching month. I have to request that you will give her every assistance you can.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nWm. Gordon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nOctober 8th,\n1930.\n\nMr. Russell T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nOn October 2nd we received a telegram from the Principal of our Industrial School at Norway House, stating that Mrs. Hill, the day school teacher on the reserve, had resigned and asking us to secure someone for the school\u2014to go up on the last boat, which they thought was leaving on Monday the 6th from Selkirk. I immediately wired Mr. Gordon, the Indian Agent, asking him for official confirmation of the vacancy and whether or not he was depending upon us to fill it. His reply came Saturday afternoon, stating that the school was vacant, that they were depending upon us, and that the last boat did not leave Selkirk until Wednesday the 6th.\n\nWe tried by telegram to locate a couple of teachers in Manitoba who had made application for a position of this sort. Unfortunately, we did not succeed in securing their consent and on Monday morning it was necessary to find someone who would be willing to step into the vacancy\u2014either we had to send a teacher up on that boat or wait for six weeks until someone could go in over the ice. Under the circumstances, I decided that I would send Osborne Earle. He is about twenty years of age and is a son of Mrs. Shoup, wife of the Principal of the Norway House Boarding School. I have known Osborne for a good many years, as he was born in China and we lived at one time in the same station. There is no doubt about his ability, nor did we have any difficulty in persuading him to go. He has his lower school complete, but lacks the languages in his upper school subjects. I felt that this would not be a serious handicap, as it is scarcely likely that he will have any students beyond the fifth or sixth grade in the day school at Norway House. Besides, I knew in sending him up there he would be sure of a home in which to live and certain of a reasonable amount of supervision from his mother and step-father. He has had no previous experience in teaching school, but he has had experience as a Sunday School teacher and as a leader of junior Tuxis groups.\n\nI have written Mr. Gordon a full explanation of the reasons why Osborne Earle was appointed and asked him to forward to you his sanction of the appointment. I shall be pleased to hear from you at your convenience as to what salary the Department will allow him. I may say that in sending him off we provided him with\nticket, berth and $100.00.\n\nNo word whatever has yet come through as to the reasons for Mrs. Hill's sudden resignation, but when we do get particulars as to exactly what happened, I shall be glad to forward them to you.\n\nDr. Cochrane and I are expecting to be in Ottawa on the 17th November, and I am looking forward with keen anticipation to meeting you personally.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nKJB.MLT\nOttawa, October 13, 1930.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, informing the Department that you have been advised that Mrs. Annie W. Hill, teacher of the Rossville (Norway House) Indian Day School, had resigned. I have also noted the action taken in obtaining the services of a teacher to replace Mrs. Hill, and the Department will approve of the appointment of Mr. Osborne Earl, with salary at the rate of $85 per teaching month. The qualifications which Mr. Earl possesses have been noted. It is hoped that he will meet with success in the work.\n\nMr. Agent Gordon is being informed of the approval granted for the appointment of Mr. Earl, and is being requested to give any assistance he can in the work at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Kenneth J. Beaton, B.A.,\nAssociate Secretary, Board of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. W.,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nOttawa, October 13, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Department has been advised by the authorities of the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada, Toronto, that Mrs. Annie W. Hill, who was appointed teacher of the Roseville Indian Day School, had resigned and that arrangements were made by them for the appointment of Osborne Earl to succeed Mrs. Hill and that he had proceeded to Norway House. Mr. Earl has no professional qualifications, but, in view of the short notice received of the resignation of Mrs. Hill and the difficulty in obtaining a qualified teacher, the Department is approving of his appointment, with salary at the rate of $85 per teaching month. It is hoped that he will meet with success. I have to request that you will give him any assistance you can in his work.\n\nThe Church authorities have been informed of the approval granted for his appointment and the salary he will be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nWm. Gordon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nOttawa, October 13, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to official letter of the 4th ultimo, informing you of the appointment of Mrs. Annie W. Hill as teacher of the Rossville Indian Day School, I now have to inform you that Mrs. Hill has resigned. The authorities of the United Church of Canada have nominated the services of Mr. Osborne Earl, and the Department is approving of his appointment, with salary at the rate of $85 per teaching month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith the Quarterly Return for the Rossville Day School, for the quarter ended March 31st, 1931.\n\nThe teacher of this school, Mr. Osborn Earl, left Norway House April 12th without giving any notice of his intention. He had taken the Easter holiday week, so that his work was not carried over into this quarter.\n\nOn learning that the teacher was gone, and did not intend to return, I consulted with Rev. R.T. Chapin, the United Church Missionary at Norway House, and we engaged the services of David Nanowin as teacher until we could communicate with the Department and the Board of the United Church. We made no arrangements as to salary. David was glad to get the work, as he had come to Norway House from Poplar River several weeks earlier, with the hope that he might secure work of some kind here, and had been idle the greater part of the time, and was on the point of returning to his home at Poplar River.\n\nDavid Nanowin graduated from the Norway House Indian Residential School in 1923, at the age of nineteen years, and had reached Grade ten in the classroom. He has acted as assistant to Rev. Mr. Caldwell at Poplar River at times, and also Mr. Scheuteze, at Little Grand Rapids. I am keeping in close touch with the school work, and think it will be quite satisfactory. At any rate, it was the best we could do under the circumstances, as the last winter mail had gone, and we have no wireless now, and consequently no means of communication until June.\n\nTrusting the Department will approve our action, and will pay David for his work.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nWm. Gordon\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 29th, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nIn forwarding the March quarter return of the Rossville Indian Day School, Mr. Agent Gordon writes, in part, as follows:\n\n\"The teacher of this school, Mr. Osborne Earl, left Norway House on April 12th without giving any notice of his intention.

Mr. Caldwell at Poplar River at times and, also, to Mr. Schuetze at Little Grand Rapids.\"\n\nA cheque covering the amount due for Mr. Earl's services for the March quarter will be forwarded to your treasurer as soon as funds are available.\n\nIn view of Mr. Earl's departure from the school, the Department is approving of the temporary appointment of David Nanowin, who will, no doubt, conduct the school until the end of the current quarter. Payment for his services for the period he is in charge will be made direct to himself.\n\nI should appreciate if you would nominate a qualified teacher to take charge of this school on or about September 1st, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

The school was closed for a time on this account during the quarter, but when it was seen that Miss Blackford had to go out to Winnipeg I arranged to have Mrs Chappell substitute for her till Christmas.

F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nP. G. Lazenby, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nRe: Indian Day School, Norway House\n\nWe are in receipt of the resignation of Miss Verna Blackford, who for several years has been the very efficient teacher of the Indian Day School at Norway House, as she is expecting to be married in September.\n\nDuring my recent visit to Norway House I discussed with Mr. P. J. Lazenby, the Indian Agent, the question of the amalgamation of the teaching service. My profound conviction, after having been on the ground five times, is that both the Department and the Church made a serious mistake when the building which is now used as a day school was moved off the residential school site and the teaching services entirely separated. I recommend - and in this recommendation Mr. Lazenby concurs - that the position of teacher of the day school at Norway House be abolished; that the salary now being paid to the day school teacher be added as a special to the income of the residential school; and that the two teachers now employed in the residential school teach the few pupils who are in the day school.\n\nAt the present time - until we have tried this plan out for a year - it would be inadvisable to move the day school building back to the residential school site. It is about 100 yards away on the Reserve and the building could very well be used for teaching the junior grades.\n\nThe advantages of the plan are as follows:\n\n1st.- A unification of the education being received by the children on the Norway House Reserve.- At the present time those who are in the residential school are getting a very much better training - even in the class-room - than the day school pupils get.\n\n2nd.- The residential school could take the responsibility for giving the day school students the same hot dinner at noon that the boys and girls in residence receive, and the Nurse could assume responsibility for giving them their rations of Cod Liver Oil and other medicines which are recommended.\n3rd.- The day school pupils could be given some of the same training in sewing, handicrafts, &c., which the pupils in residence receive.\n\n4th.- It would place the whole educational process as applied to the Reserve directly under the supervision of the Principal of the residential school. At the present time there is no place for the day school teacher to live except in the residence, and she enjoys all the privileges of life in the residential school which are enjoyed by the other staff members, without any of the after-hour duties which are inevitable in the carrying on of such an institution. The result has naturally been a certain amount of lack of harmony.\n\n5th.- The extra grant which would be available for the residential school could be used to provide a really competent instructor in manual training for the boys.\n\nI sincerely trust that this proposal will meet with the approval of the Department. Dr. McGill is aware that the matter has been under discussion for some time, as we talked it over informally with him during his visit to Norway House last year.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nKJB.MT\nNorway House, Man:\n18th September 1935.\n\nRef: 11-A\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to Departmental letter No; 123-8-1 of the 31st July last, regarding the new arrangement for the teaching of the pupils of the Rossville Day School in connection with the junior pupils of the Norway House Residential School, I beg to say that the question of the supplying of fuel for the Rossville Day School has been brought to my attention.\n\nThe Principal of the residential school wishes to know whether he should furnish the fuel and cleaning for this school now, or whether this will continue to be provided by the Department as heretofore.\n\nThe Department's letter states that it is understood that the classes will be held in the residential school. This, however, is not the arrangement in practice. Previously, the junior classes of the residential school were held in a separate class room building, apart from the main building. It is now the object of the Principal to turn this into a gymnasium at an early date, and the classes are being held, combined, in the Rossville Day School building.\n\nWill you please advise me if the fuel and cleaning of the Rossville Day School building is to be provided from the funds at the disposal of the Principal of the Residential School.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G.

LETTER FOLLOWING.\n\nP. G. Lazenby.\nNorway House, Man:\n28th October 1936.\n\nRef: 20-A\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that on the 27th October, I inspected the Rossville Indian Day School, which is conducted in conjunction with the Junior Classes of the Norway House Residential School.\n\nOn the roll of this school, there are 58 pupils, 47 of these being from the residential school, and 11 belonging to the day school. The residential school pupils only attend for half days; 21 attending in the mornings, and 26 in the afternoons. At the time of my visit, which was in the afternoon, all 26 pupils from the residential school were present, and six of the 11 day school pupils were present. Four of the day school pupils were away with their parents to their winter camps, and one was absent through sickness.\n\nAll of the residential school pupils are in grade 1. Of the day school pupils, 8 are in grade 1, 1 in grade 2, 1 in grade 4, and 1 in grade 5.\n\nThe work of the pupils generally is good. Their book work; writing, drawing etc. is commendable, but there is room for much improvement in their reading still. The discipline is very good, and both teacher and pupils show much interest in the school work.\n\nThe school building was clean and tidy. The new stove recently furnished for this school was in operation, and the building was warm and comfortable. Two new panes of glass were needed in the windows, and these have been installed. The teacher complained that as there was no lock on the outside door of this school, outsiders were frequently going in, and interfering with things. I therefore purchased a hasp and padlock, and had them put on the door.\n\nI would recommend that a woven wire fence be erected around this school and its small grounds next summer, with two gates; one large one and one small one. This would keep horses and cattle away from the building, and greatly improve the appearance of the place. As it is now, the fire wood gets scattered about, and in all probability it is the animals that break the windows.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.;\nNorway House, Man:\n26th June 1937.\n\nRef: 20-A\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that on the 23rd instant I inspected the Rossville United Church Indian Day School, which is conducted in conjunction with the junior class-room of the Norway House Residential School.\n\nThere were 50 Residential School pupils, and 14 Day School pupils on the roll; the residential school pupils attending class room on the half day system. Of the 50 residential school pupils, there were 21 present, and of the day school pupils there were 9 present, at the time of my visit. The register was marked up to date.\n\nAll the pupils were clean and tidy, and were well clothed.\n\nThe school building inside was kept clean and orderly.\n\nThe discipline was good. Reading aloud was only fair, the pupils not speaking out at all well, but the book work was better, being well done.\n\nWith reference to this school being conducted in conjunction with the junior section of the residential school, I beg to call attention to the final paragraph of Departmental letter No; 123-8-1 of the 31st July 1935.\n\nReference to the quarterly reports for the Rossville Day School reveals that the average attendance has declined greatly since the amalgamation of this school with the residential school. Before the amalgamation, the average attendance had stood at approximately 12 to 14, but during the past year, it has dropped to an average of 5. I talked this matter over with the Principal of the residential school, and the only conclusion I can come to, is that the 'Day School' aspect has been practically lost sight of; interest being centered chiefly in the 'Residential School' aspect.

Before the amalgamation, the average attendance had stood at approximately 12 to 14, but during the past year, it has dropped to an average of 5. I talked this matter over with the Principal of the residential school, and the only conclusion I can come to is that the 'Day School' aspect has been practically lost sight of; interest being centered chiefly in the 'Residential School' aspect. Prior to the amalgamation of the two schools, the teacher of the Rossville Day School gave her entire time to that school, and when any of the pupils were absent she was at pains to discover the reason for the absence.\"\n\nRev. Geo. Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nRev. Geo.

The \"experiment\" has not proven to be the success hoped for.\n\n\"In these circumstances, unless the Department wishes to continue the present arrangement for another year, I would recommend that the Roseville Day School either be put back on its former basis, with a separate teacher who would be responsible solely for that school, or that the Roseville School be made a seasonal school and operated for four months during the summer when the Indians are practically all at home with their families.\"\n\nIn view of the information supplied by our Agent, it is considered that, beginning September 1st, 1937, the teacher appointed for the Roseville Day School should devote her full time to that school and, in the event of some children not attending regularly, she should visit the parents and endeavour to obtain a regular attendance. This will necessitate the management of the Norway House Indian Residential School making provision in the school for teaching their own pupils.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. Geo. Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMy dear Mr. Hoey,\n\nI beg to acknowledge your letter of July 7th, addressed to my Associate, Dr. Dorey, in reference to the teaching services at the Norway House Indian Residential School and the Rossville Indian Day School.\n\nI have noted the contents of the report which you received from Mr. Indian Agent Lazenby. I confess considerable disappointment that the experiment which you tried at Norway House has not, in the opinion of Mr. Lazenby, worked out satisfactorily. I know that my former colleague, Rev. K.J. Beaton, was very strongly in favour of the arrangement and felt that it would be successful. I would like to have seen the arrangement tried out for another year or two, but, in view of the fact that Mr. Lazenby says he has discussed the matter with the Principal of the Residential School, I suppose there is nothing to do but to accept, without any further discussion, your decision in the matter.\n\nI will send on your letter at once to Mr. Chapin and will ask him to make the arrangements for the changes which you desire.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRBC: EWS\nOttawa, July 15th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOn receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo regarding the teacher at the Rossville Indian Day School, the Department wrote the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada.\n\nI am now advised that they are writing to Mr. Chapin, Principal of the Norway House Indian Residential School, directing him to make the changes which you desire.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nP. G. Lazenby, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nSir,\n\nOn receipt of Mr R.A.Hey's letter No; 123-8-1 of the 15th July, I again discussed with the Principal of the Norway House Residential School, the best policy to pursue in the future, for the best interests of the Rossville Indian Day School, which for the past two years, has been conducted in conjunction with the Residential School.\n\nOn going thoroughly into the matter, it was found that to re-establish this school on its former basis, as a separate entity, a number of new desks, some blackboard, and a stove would have to be furnished, in order that the junior class room of the residential school, (which was always conducted in a separate building), might be started again; and the residential school would have to get a new junior class room teacher, when there was only a very short time left before school commenced after the vacation.\n\nIf the Rossville school is carried on for another year, in conjunction with the junior class room of the residential school, the Principal has agreed to make the following arrangements:- Give the teacher only one after 4 p.m. duty; Saturdays free; two only, evening duties; and a smaller Residential school junior class. He has also offered to give every assistance himself, to see that the Rossville Day School progresses.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, and with more time and attention given by both teacher and Principal, to the interests of the Rossville Day school, I see no reason why the day school should not make headway, and I therefore recommend that these schools be carried on as heretofore with the above mentioned changes in policy adopted, and should be glad if you would advise me if this has approval.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.,\nOttawa, August 30, 1937\n\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant with further reference to the Rossville Indian Day School.\n\nIn view of the arrangements made between the Principal of the Norway House Residential School and yourself, the Department approves the continuation of the Rossville Indian Day School. The same salary as formerly will be allowed the teacher.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nP. G. Lazenby, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nOttawa, August 30, 1937\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to my letter of July 7th and your reply of July 9th in connection with the teaching services at the Norway House and the Roseville Indian Day School - Indian Agent Lazenby, in a letter dated August 22nd, states that he has recently discussed the future policy with the Principal of the Norway House Residential School.\n\nThe Principal of the Residential School has urged the continuation of the Day School during the coming academic year, and is making arrangements to enable the teacher to give more time to the day school activity. Under these circumstances, the Department is advising Mr. Lazenby that we approve of the continuation of the Roseville Day School during the coming academic year, and that we will allow the teacher the same salary as formerly.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. Robert B. Cochrane, D.D.,\nSecretary, Board of Home Missions,\n299 Queen Street West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nSeptember 10th,\n1937.\n\nMy dear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of August 30th, acquainting us with the fact that you have decided to approve of the continuation of the Rossville Day School during the coming academic year in connection with the teaching services at the Norway House School. I am glad that the Department has consented to this, and I hope the arrangement will work out more satisfactorily than in the past.\n\nDr. Dorey and I would like very much to have a chance to talk with you some time before long. I am sorry we were not able to get together in August. I am to be in Ottawa over the last week-end in October, but perhaps you will be coming to Toronto before that and we might make arrangements to meet you here.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nR.B.C. MIT\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6246, file 540-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that on the 9th instant I inspected the Rossville Indian Day School.\n\nAt the time of my visit, there were 19 pupils present; 7 of these being Day School pupils, and 12 being junior pupils from the Norway House Residential School, as this school is being conducted jointly with the junior portion of the Residential School.\n\nThe registers, of which there are two, one for the Day School pupils and the other for the Residential School pupils, were both marked up to date.\n\nThe pupils were all neat and clean, and all were well clothed.\n\nThe school building and the furniture, were in good condition, clean, and well cared for.\n\nThe book work of the pupils was fairly good, being neatly done, and fairly accurate. The reading and speaking of the pupils, however, shows much room for improvement. Most of the pupils present of course, were just beginners and those in the lower grades, and excellence in reading aloud, and speaking out when answering questions, cannot be looked for at so early a stage in their education. The teacher Miss Edythe Smith-Windsor, is keen and very interested in her work, and I think she will make progress in due course of time, in this particular phase of it.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Ont.:\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that owing to the regular teacher at the Rossville Indian Day School, Miss E. Smith-Windsor, being held in quarantine in the Norway House Residential School, on account of the Diphtheria cases there, I have arranged to have the Rossville Day School carried on with Mrs R.L. Stevenson as teacher, substituting for Miss Windsor, beginning from today, December 9th 1940. Miss Windsor is quarantined on Dr Corrigan's instructions.\n\nMrs R.L. Stevenson is a qualified teacher, and was engaged in the teaching profession before her marriage.\n\nAlthough I have made no definite arrangements as yet, as to Mrs Stevenson's pay, I would recommend that she be paid at the rate of $3.50 per teaching day, which is less than the rate paid to Miss Windsor, the regular teacher. Whether or not Miss Windsor should continue to receive her full salary, I leave to the Department to decide, but I expect she will be carrying on the teaching of the junior classes in the residential school while they are quarantined. How long the quarantine will remain in force, depends upon whether or not any further cases of Diphtheria develop in the school later on.\n\nKindly advise me if the above recommendation and action is approved by the Department.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nP.C. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Ont.,\nOttawa,\nDecember 20, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant with reference to the teaching services at the Rossville Indian Day School. The attendance at this school has, no doubt, been very small due to the absence of the pupils from the residential school and the additional fact that the holiday period was approaching. It is regretted that you made any arrangements for a substitute teacher. However, if you submit a voucher for the period Mrs. Stevenson was in charge a cheque will be issued.\n\nIf the regular teacher is not out of quarantine by the time the school should re-open after the Christmas holidays the school should remain closed until she is able to resume duties.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

We have had no reply to that letter, stating the date on which she opened the school and, as a consequence, no payment of salary has been made to her.\n\nPlease let me know at once if Miss McLeod took charge of the school on September 1 and, if so, the usual forms should be completed and returned immediately, as these are required before payment of salary can be made.

There are none in this office and so far as I am able to ascertain, none were sent for her completion by the branch. It is requested that these forms be sent to this office for completion as soon as possible in order that her salary may be paid.\n\nThe only communication we have had from you with regard to Miss McLeod was a notification from your office that Miss G.

We have reviewed our file very carefully and cannot find any information on it to the effect that Miss McLeod gave up duties at the end of June. As a consequence cheques were issued and sent to her for September, October, November and December.\n\nWe are anxious to obtain the return of the cheques for September, October and December and you should make inquiries of the Postmaster and advise us as to what address these cheques were sent.\n\nBernard F.

We have not yet received the September, October and December cheques although we have now been informed that someone cashed the October cheque.\n\nDo you know the present address of Miss McLeod? We would like to have this information so that we can write to her.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard F.

This last cheque was not opened in this office.\n\nTo date this office has not received the cheque for the month of October, however will make inquiries of the Postmaster and Miss McLeod, and will forward same immediately it is received.\n\nE.B.

The cheques for September, November and December have been returned but we have not received the cheque for October, and we understand that this has been cashed.\n\nPresumably you were under the impression that this cheque represented the return of the amount to your credit in the Retirement Fund. The Treasury advised me, however, that the cheque you received was more than the amount to your credit as the following statement will show -\n\n| October salary cheque | $126.05 |\n|-----------------------|---------|\n| Amount to Credit in Retirement Fund | $ 77.61 |\n| Balance               | $ 48.44 |\n\nPlease forward the above balance at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBernard F.

I have the receipt of this cheque to prove this fact. Therefore by deductory the amount I have returnable in Retirement Fund is seventy-seven dollars and sixty-one cents ($77.61). From this I still have a balance payable of twenty-four dollars and eighty-four cents ($24.84) and not forty-eight dollars and forty-four cents ($48.44) as you have stated.\n\nI would appreciate it if you would look into this matter and I shall forward the amount payable when this has been corrected.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Cheques for September, November and December were returned but the October cheque is still outstanding. You question the amount of $125.05 overpaid. This was not all overpaid in October but is made up as follows:\n\n- Retirement Fund A/c overpaid September $5.90\n- October overpaid (not salary $102.45 plus $5.90 R.F.) 108.35\n- Retirement Fund A/c overpaid November 5.90\n- December 5.90\n- Gross overpayment - 125.05\n- Retirement Fund A/c credited against overpayment - 74.00\n- BALANCE OWING - $51.05\n\nIn connection with the credit of $74.00 Retirement Fund contributions plus interest, I wish to advise that at the time Mr. Henry wrote you the Retirement Fund Branch quoted the amount of $77.63 at your credit but on further checking the account there was only $74.00.

In this connection we wish to advise that although Miss McLeod was only actually teaching on the Indian Affairs Branch staff to the end of June, 1946, we were not advised at the time of her separation and cheques were issued to her for the months of September, October, November and December making a total overpayment of $472.00. On the 31st December, 1946, we were advised of her separation which was too late to adjust the salary and income tax for the year 1946. Central Pay Office have thereafter issued a T4-1947 Supplementary form showing a credit of $472.00. A copy of the form has been submitted to the Income Tax Branch and to Miss McLeod. It would appear that Miss McLeod will have to deduct this credit from her income for the year 1947 and have her income tax adjusted for the year 1947 accordingly.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.

If you will refer to this form again you will notice that you have been credited with salary, in the amount of $472.00, not debited. You will recall that during 1946 you taught at Norway House Indian Day School from January 1st to June 30th and gave up duties effective July 1st. Your separation from the Service was not reported until December 31st, 1946, which was too late for the paying office to adjust your salary and income tax for that year. Central Pay Office were therefore obliged to furnish you with an income tax form for the year 1947 showing a credit of the money refunded, which will have to be credited against your 1947 earnings and your income tax adjusted for that year. Nothing can be done to adjust your 1946 tax.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of a letter received from the Director of Income Tax, Winnipeg, dated February 20, 1948, and my reply of the 9th March, which is self-explanatory.

Lowes and Hardiman, the teachers of the children of Norway House Band, that favourable mention should be made of them for the able manner in which their schools are conducted.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nExtract from the Annual Report of Agent T.J. Fleetham, Norway House Agency, June 30, 1904.\n\n\"While on this subject I should mention that there is a day school at Norway House under the Church of England, doing good work, but not supported by the Department. I think it should be, as it is situated in a populous part of the new addition to the reserve, and some four miles from the Methodist day school, much too far for small children to attend.\"\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to report that all the schools in the Norway House Agency are now manned by teachers, but owing to the arrangements made by the Department of Indian Affairs that I should make the payment in that Agency, It was impossible for me this season to make the Inspection called for by the Department. In any event with the exception of one school (Jack Head) all the schools were closed for the Holidays, and I was at that point on a Saturday when of course school was closed. (see diary of payment trip)\n\nYours Truly\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nFrank Pedley Esq.\nThe Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nSir,\n\nThere is a matter to which I wish to refer;\n\nIn connection with the day-schools on the different reserves on my Agency, I find it impossible to get the Indians to take enough interest in these schools to furnish the wood required to keep the buildings warm during the winter. It frequently happens that the teacher is compelled to close the school for want of wood to heat the building. Spending a day on each reserve twice in the year, you can understand that the Agent has very little chance to get after them. Now I have a proposition to make and I am convinced that it will work so well that it will rarely have to be used after the one example is made of those who fail to do their share. I want to be allowed at treaty time to impose a fine of $1.00 on each able bodied head of a family who has not during the year put in a cord of wood to the school. In anticipation of this, during my winter visit to the reserves, I informed them all that I wanted every man to put in his wood, get the teacher to measure it and give him a note stating that he had supplied his wood, and this certificate he is to present at treaty time. I would collect the fine from each delinquent in the presence of the chief, and when finished would hand the amount collected, to the teacher or missionary in charge, taking his receipt for it and would arrange with him to use the money in hiring the Indians to supply wood, and have him take receipts from each Indian for the amount paid him for wood. In this way everything would be kept straight, and as I have said, after the first year I am confident it will not be ne\nbe necessary. The chiefs and head-men of the various reserves are altogether in favour of adopting this method, as they claim that the work of supplying the wood falls upon a few who are more reasonable than the others.\n\nIf some such method is not adopted, I can see no other way than for the Department, to provide for wood in the estimates, and I think that would be wholly bad.\n\nI have gone into the matter very fully, for two winters now on each of the reserves, explaining to the Indian how the white man is compelled by law to build his own school, furnish it supply fuel, pay the teacher, and everything, while the Indian has all these done for him, only being asked to supply the wood, and send his children; but it is pretty much lost upon an Indian. There is nothing in him to appeal to, and the only way is to make him feel it, through his pocket. I would be very grateful for an early reply.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir;\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 29, 1906.\n\nSir\u2014\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th inst., suggesting that you be allowed to impose a fine of $1.00 at treaty time on any able-bodied head of a family, who has not during the year put in a cord of wood for the use of the school which his children should attend.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department regrets that it cannot meet your views in this respect, as it has not the power to make any deductions from treaty payments. The only way to get at these delinquents is by moral suasion.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ. D.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Neary,\n\nOur Superintendent of Missions in Manitoba, Dr. Best, is looking out for teachers and is asking if each School at Norway House will have all the grades or whether or not they will be divided. I understand that there will be three Schools and I presume that the pupils will be graded.\n\nHe also wants to know what is the exact remuneration.\n\nIt is our understanding that the teachers will be able to find boarding accommodation either with Mrs. Jones or with the missionary, Mr. McLeod.\n\nIn order to save time, I wonder if you would reply directly to Dr. Best, 441 Somerset Building, Winnipeg, Man., sending me a copy of your letter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAugust 8th,\n1946.\nOttawa, August 10, 1946.\n\nNorway House Schools.\n\nDear Doctor Best:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from the Reverend Dr. Dorey about the above schools.\n\nIt is our intention to have these three schools graded into junior, intermediate and senior. When the teachers arrive at Norway House, it is suggested that they contact Mr. Goodman, the Agent, and decide how the pupils can best be divided. It is felt that the Reverend Mr. Jones will be able to render considerable help in this regard.\n\nWe are prepared to offer the following salaries:\n\n(a) Senior Room - $110.00 a month plus bonus.\n(This will total therefore approximately $135.)\n\n(b) Junior and Intermediate Rooms - $105.00 a month plus cost of living bonus.

He referred specifically to\n\n(a) division of grades between the three schools,\n\n(b) teachers' salaries.\n\nI attach a copy of a letter I sent in answer, to both the Reverend Dr. Dorey and to Dr. Best in Winnipeg. Will you, therefore, be prepared to meet these teachers and decide how best the pupils can be divided.

I enclose the application in his case, and you will note that he has not received any professional training, but this is one of the difficulties that many of the Provinces have to face.\n\nI may say that we have arranged for board accommodation for all three teachers.\n\nThere has been a tentative suggestion that Miss Henrichs, who was appointed to Oxford House, be transferred to Norway House, and that a Miss Brandt be appointed to Oxford House. Her brother is the missionary at that point. However, I have had to make inquiries from Dr. Best in Manitoba about this.\n\nI should be glad if you would confirm these nominations.

This form, when completed, should then\nCivil Service Health Division,\nDepartment of National Health and Welfare,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nPlease note that any expense attendant upon this examination will be borne by you.\n\nElection to Contribute for Past Service:\n\nWhen a Civil Servant has served in a temporary capacity, prior to being a contributor to the Civil Service Superannuation Act, he may, within twelve months of the date of his permanent appointment, elect to contribute an amount equal to five, five and one half or six percent of the total salary received by him during such period of service with simple interest thereon at the rate of four percent per annum. By reference to section II para 2 of the Civil Service Superannuation Act pamphlet (FA 74) attached, you can determine the rate of contribution in your instance.\n\nOur records show that you have been an Indian Day School Teacher for a period of approximately three years. Therefore, it will be necessary for you to pay contributions, if you so elect, to the fund in either one lump sum or in installments. You will find a table of installments on page 2 of the election form (Fin No. 64).\n\nIf you desire to have this temporary service count for Superannuation purposes, kindly complete the enclosed forms (Fin No. 64) and return them in duplicate to this office. I may point out that by Section 7 A (1) of the act, only service which is fully paid for shall be counted.\n\nWar Service:\n\nA memorandum is attached for the information of contributors who may be eligible to count their War Service for purposes of the Civil Service Superannuation Act.\nPensionable Employment:\n\nIf you have had service with the Dominion Government prior to your present appointment, you should immediately furnish this office with full particulars regarding the nature of such service and the salary received.\n\nIf you have had other pensionable employment (e.g., as a provincial teacher) you will find details as to conditions, procedure, etc., outlined in the memorandum attached, dealing with \"Pensionable Employment\" (6/1947).\n\nYour attention is directed to para 2 under \"Conditions\" in this memorandum in which you will note that your contribution \"for such employment shall be twice the amount that he would have contributed etc.,\".\n\nUnder para 2 of \"Exceptions\", you are not entitled to count provincial service for Dominion Superannuation services, when you are already receiving or have received a provincial superannuation benefit.\n\nDeductions:\n\nI may add that from December 27, 1947, a percent (as determined by the Civil Service Superannuation Act Form 74 A) will be deducted from your salary on account of the superannuation fund. Whether or not you decide to contribute for past service, I would appreciate being informed at the earliest possible date of your decision.\n\nI would finally remind you that you are given twelve months to make the election described above and that this offer expires on December 27, 1948. Therefore, it is most important that you inform the Department of your decision whether to allow for past service or not.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

I feel sure that you will be glad to confirm this appointment. Miss Gunn seems to have had a lot of experience -- she can take over the work done by Miss Flemming.\n\nBy the way I note that Miss Gunn has filled in two questionnaires. Will you tell me if by any chance any more questionnaires have to be filled out? I must say that I cannot understand why your Department asks applicants to fill out so many forms.\n\nI am also sending you an application from Miss Edith Lorne Traub. Miss Traub has a permit teacher's certificate of a temporary nature for the Province of Manitoba. She took a Teacher Training course at Tuxedo.\n\nWe are finding it very difficult to get teachers, although you are paying good salaries.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEnclosure.\nAttention of Colonel B.F.

I understand that Miss Gunn is to replace Miss Fleming as Principal. If so, she would be classified as a Grade 1 Principal, at a salary of $1920, an academic year.\n\nMiss Traub would be classified as a Grade 1 or Permit Teacher at a salary of $1089.00 an academic year.\n\nIt is presumed that Mr. Peter Mitchel will be returning to the Norway House School as a third teacher. As yet, we have received no indication as to his plans for the future.\n\nIn view of the fact that Miss Gunn has completed two questionnaires, when only one is required, it is presumed that she is the type of person who really enjoys her work. For your information, I would point out that the following disposal is made of the forms required:\n\n(a) Application for employment form is used by the Education Division for assessing the teacher's qualifications and experience and in setting her salary.\n\n(b) The Employee Questionnaire form is sent to the Personnel Division of the Department of Mines and Resources.\n\n(c) Income Tax forms are sent to the Chief Treasury Officer for the information of Central Pay Office.\nPlease note that for classification as a Grade 1 Principal that three teachers are required at the school - hence the question raised with regard to Mr. Mitchel.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard P.

She got her B.A., but as she was getting married she did not qualify for her First Class Teacher's certificate. She recently taught for the D.V.A., Grade XI and XII English and they gave her a First Class rating and paid her $3000 a year.\"\n\nPerhaps Dr. Dorey took this matter up with you but I do not seem to find the answer anywhere.

In that conversation I relayed to you our desire to nominate Miss Laura Butler, 1908 Dufferin Street, Toronto as teacher of the Intermediate Class at Norway House and Mr. Peter Mitchell, now teacher of the Intermediate Class at Norway House, as the teacher for Island Lake.\n\nMy understanding from you was that it was quite in order for us to proceed on the assumption that these appointments would be confirmed by your Department and so I have sent the information to Dr. C.H. Best, Superintendent of Missions for Manitoba.\n\nOur reason for asking for immediate confirmation is that Miss Butler who resides in Toronto must arrive in Winnipeg Oct. 4th in order to catch the boat for Norway House which leaves on its regular trip north on that date. I appreciate very much your kind consideration and cooperation in making this possible.\n\nI am enclosing the form of application completed by Miss Butler. You will please send us written confirmation of her appointment and that of Mr. Peter Mitchell. You will also give us a salary rating for Miss Butler. When I discussed this latter point with you on the telephone you were of the impression her salary would run at the rate of $102. per teaching month.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nM.C. Macdonald\nSeptember 30, 1948.\n\nMemorandum for File.\n\nReverend Mr. MacDonald of the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada phoned on September 28th and stated as follows:\n\n(1) That they recommended the transfer of Mr. Peter Mitchell from the Norway House School No. 540 to the Island Lake U.C. Day School.\n\n(2) The appointment of Miss Laura Butler, 9108 Dufferin St., Toronto, to replace Mr. Mitchell at the Norway House School.\n\nThey stated that Miss Butler has senior matriculation but is not a fully qualified teacher. However, if she were to reach Winnipeg in time to catch the last boat for Norway House, it would be necessary for her to leave Toronto on the 28th instant. An immediate decision had to be made and I notified them that the above appointments would be later confirmed. Mr. MacDonald promised to forward us an application from Miss Butler on one of our regular forms.\n\nP. Phelan.\nAPPLICATION FOR EMPLOYMENT IN INDIAN DAY SCHOOLS\n\nI.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThere are certain aspects of Indian education in this area which I thought it worthwhile to bring to your attention. First there is the matter of the location of Day Schools associated with the United Church. The present arrangement of three schools in a block at Rossville results in severe hardship to a significant number of pupils to the point where those most seriously affected find it very difficult to secure education at all or at least have their schooling seriously delayed. I refer here to those families living on the Jack River. The distance between Rossville and the nearest school down the river is about five miles. The real problem, however, is not so much the distance involved as the fact that these children have to cross a windswept bay of one mile just before reaching school. The result is that children cannot start to school until they are about 8 or 10 and even then lose many days when the weather is not good and at freeze-up and break-up. Besides this at present 10 or 11 of our children are forced to attend the Catholic School. Let me assure you, however, that this situation calls for attention aside altogether from the war of churches. I know from personal experience what the situation is because neither my son nor the daughter of the H.B.C. manager here would be receiving education were it not for the courtesy of\nyour department in allowing them to attend your schools as it is impossible for them to cross the same bay (in a different direction) to attend the Provincial school.\n\nI have carefully investigated the population of the area concerned and find that there are at least 43 children who would be benefited by the erection of the proposed school. This is aside from one or two Catholic families. There are about 35 pre-school age children. At the present time there are at least two families who have gone off trapping, fishing etc., taking their children for the simple reason that they could not attend school. This area has a fairly stable population and many of the people are genuinely anxious to further their children's education. In fact, if this school could be erected I doubt if any of the children would be taken to winter camp. From personal contacts I know that there is a unanimous desire for this school.\n\nOne reason I have written you at this time is that I have heard that it has been proposed to build a four-room school at Rossville. If this is for use as a Residential school that is an excellent idea; but if it is intended to serve as a day-school it will not meet the education requirements of this district. We had the same problem in connection with the provincial schools last summer when a central two-room school was discarded in favour of two one-room schools separately located. It might well be that all of the higher grades could be taught at Rossville as it would not be so hard for the older children to cross the above mentioned Bay, but certainly for the beginners there should be a school which can be easily reached. If you have a large scale map of this area which you could send me I would be only too glad to indicate location of\nsuch a school. I think the school would be best located about a mile from the mouth of the Jack River.\n\nI have spoken to Mr. Hughes, the local agent, and although he had not personally investigated the matter, he was inclined to agree with me. At any rate if it is true that a four-room block is to be erected it should be perfectly clear that there is a need for this school as well and that such a block can never meet the educational needs of the children to which I have referred.\n\nIt is hard for one up here to get a clear picture of the future policy of your Department relative to the Residential school and I am writing what immediately follows to try and emphasize one point i.e. that the use which is to be made of the four room block should be clearly determined as for Residential purposes or at least partly so. I realize that this is a thorny question but should like also to offer my advice in this connection. By nature and on the basis of my previous knowledge of the factors involved I was severely critical of the Residential idea but contact with actual conditions up here has altered my opinion. We still have reserves inland where it is impossible to operate winter schools owing to housing conditions. Furthermore there are the persistent problems of orphans and families with one or both parents out at the Sanitorium. Besides which there are a significant number of homes in which the moral atmosphere is so bad that removal from the home is the only possible way of giving the children a chance and the Residential school seems to me the most practical means of doing this. For example there is a home here in which the father is little more than a pimp and a bootlegger, the mother a prostitute, both of whom have been forbidden to ever set foot in Winnipeg again. Children in such a home have not a hope in the\nworld of ever becoming useful citizens. Fortunately not many homes are as bad as this one but there are enough of a similar nature to warrant some sort of organized action. I might add that a boy from the above mentioned home was forcibly sent out to school i.e., regardless of his parent's consent as a juvenile delinquent and when he came home on holiday was allowed to remain in this debilitating moral atmosphere as a result of the Agent's prejudice against the Residential school. I am certain that had this situation existed in any white community some action would have been taken. As I have suggested the Residential School offers the only practical method I have yet seen of handling these cases.\n\nI must admit that I have little enthusiasm for the policy of dragooning up a quota of pupils and just wish that these institutions could be operated as social agencies without this pupilage payment arrangement. Furthermore, concerning the four room block I wonder if your Department has ever considered the possibility of a Residential High School at this point. At the present time there is not a single high school in this whole area east of The Pas. In this connection I fail to see why it should not be possible for Dominion and Provincial governments to work together to set up a high school. There are several non-treaty children taking high school outside at great expense to their parents. As for the Treaty children very few of them reach grade 9 and if they do there is not much to encourage them as Correspondents and practically no fellow students are the order of the day. In fact one of the blackest marks against the Day School system is that there just are not any of their graduates, in this district at any rate, who have ever gone beyond Grade 9. Personally, this Day Residential argument appears one of the most futile bits of wasted\nhuman endeavour that I have ever seen. The truth of the matter is that to meet the educational need of the Indian people we need both methods. I do hope that the possibility of a joint Residential High School will be seriously entertained as such an Institution would provide an objective for the superior students all across the north. In view of the better day school facilities which are being provided for the inland reserves it would appear that the necessity and value of such an institution will increase as the years go by.\n\nThe drift of the above is that the Residential school of the future should be of a two-fold nature viz., social redemption and specialization. In addition to High School there might well be courses in mechanics or carpentry training. The economic possibilities of this area seem to be decreasing if changing at all. With a growing population one of the greatest needs is that a minority at least of the people should be qualified to take on some of the mechanical work which is done up here. Every year dozens of carpenters etc. come up here to do work much of which could be done by Indians if they were properly trained. I realize that such work is not congenial to the temperament of many of the Indians but the number of \"Old Faithfuls\" around the Agency and Hospital indicate that the wanderlust of many of them is fading. This touches on one of the central weaknesses of Indian education viz. that there is a very tenuous relation between the present educational process and the economic life of the people. This is not to suggest that the only purpose of education is to line one's pocket but one has only to have scant observation of ordinary society to realize the extent to which enthusiasm for education among \"civilized\" people is related to economic utility. The enlarging of spiritual outlook should be accompanied by increased economic effectiveness. At present such enthusiasm for education as the Indian has\nis largely a matter of infinite faith and idealism. I realize that this will long be a grave problem but do hope that it will be possible as the years go by to infuse the present literary education with more habits and skills which will specifically improve the economic competence of the Indian in his actual environment. In connection with this I would be pleased to know whether there is or are any Summer Schools for Indian teachers, where such aspects of the work could be developed and discussed.\n\nFinally I hope that the loads of advice I have distributed in this letter have not made it appear that I have been endeavouring to inform you as to the nature of your vocation! I have merely written as I have on the presumption that observations on the field will be welcome. Before closing may I commend the energy which your Department has displayed in construction of schools in this Agency. In this commendation I include Mr. Goodman who despite the criticism voiced above was always held in high esteem and whose recent death was very keenly felt.\n\nI realize that you must have a multitude of duties but if you could reply to this letter in the proximate future I would greatly appreciate your course.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nRev. G.C. Johnson,\nUnited Church Missionary,\nNorway House, Man.\nNorway House: Siting and purpose of proposed schools.\n\nThe letter from the Rev. Mr. Johnson exemplifies how the school question in this area is answered according to prejudice, pre-conception, opinion unsupported by a fair proportion of the facts, rather than by an objective study by persons with no obvious or concealed axes to grind.\n\nBy all means let us prepare several copies of a large scale map of the area and send one to Mr. Johnson to indicate the site he suggests and also:\n\n1. All schools at present in a ten-mile radius from Rossville.\n2. Settled areas with denominational statistics.\n3. Isolated homes.\n4. Land routes.\n\nThe sketch above is about two miles to an inch.\n\nOur map service might prepare enlargements of a modern map on a scale of two inches to the mile.\n\nThe departmental staff situation at Norway House is presently unsettled. When a superintendent is confirmed in the agency, we shall be able to get some valuable information from his office.\n\nI discussed school matters with the H.B.C. post manager (who has served elsewhere with enthusiasm as a school trustee and secretary) and he promised to collect data on the problem. He is, however, also a new man in the settlement.\n\nIf we intend to establish at Rossville a school to serve both day pupils and boarders.\n\nP.T.O.\nthere might be little reason to provide the outpost school suggested.\n\nThe two single-room Manitoba schools should not be allowed to influence us to cut up the composite institution already planned.\n\nMy purpose in having several copies of the map made is that, having second Mr. Johnson's addenda, we can later have another copy similarly filled-in by our officials. In that way we may be able to arrive at a fairly high degree of accuracy.\n\nC.A.T. Clark\nJanuary 17, 1949.\n\nReverend G. C.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nOTTAWA, March 7, 1949.\n\nRev. George Dorey, D.D.,\nSecretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nThe United Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nTORONTO 2B, Ontario.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of February 25, 1949, concerning the Norway House Residential School.\n\nAs you are no doubt aware, our Education officials have been giving a great deal of consideration to the educational needs of the Indians of the Norway House Agency. An inspection trip of the area made two years ago revealed that the day schools were in a very poor state of repair. Since then, we have completed two modern and well constructed day schools for children of your denomination at Island Lake and at Cross Lake. At the present time, we have two complete sets of materials for other day schools en route by tractor train to God's Lake Narrows and to Oxford House. Funds have been provided in our 1949-50 Estimates for the construction of these schools next summer.\n\nWith regard to the rebuilding of the Norway House Residential School, I may say that the necessary ground survey for this project was completed last summer by two surveyors who were employed by the Department of Public Works in connection with the proposed building of a hospital by the Indian Health Services Branch. Our Lands and Development Services Branch has been asked to prepare a set of drawings for the rebuilding of this school but, unfortunately, we have not been able to advise them specifically as to the size of the building.\nwhich should be erected. Our inspectors reported that previously a considerable number of children from the immediate vicinity of Norway House attended the residential school when they could well have been attending day schools. It has been suggested that a day school be built across the Bay to provide educational facilities for the children there. It is claimed that this area has a stable population and that if a day school were erected there, few, if any, of the children would be taken to winter camp.\n\nWe appreciate the fact that inland from Norway House there are a number of reserves on which it is very difficult to successfully operate day schools, due to the conditions under which the Indians live. There is also the persistent problem of orphans and families with one or both parents in hospital for treatment for tuberculosis.\n\nThe pupilage at the former Norway House Residential School was 105. The problem now is to decide definitely the pupilage of the proposed new school. We had hoped to arrive at a definite answer following the recent visit of one of our officials, but, unfortunately, weather conditions prevented his landing at certain reserves on which there were Indians belonging to the United Church of Canada. You will appreciate the fact that the building of residential schools is today a very costly undertaking. Therefore, we must be careful in building a school which will suffice for our needs but will not be too large for the Indian population it is intended to serve. Naturally, we wish the children for whom day school facilities are provided to attend such schools and we do not wish them placed in a residential school in order to fill it. I would, therefore, like to hear from you as to the views of your local missionaries, and to receive statements from them as to the number of children of your Church in their various missions who actually require residential school care and education. We could then have this information reviewed by our officials.\nI have noted your comments with regard to the Teslin Residential School. The need of a residential school at this point was brought to the attention of the department some ten years ago and assurances were subsequently given that construction would proceed once materials and labour became readily available. The welfare situation has been aggravated by conditions resulting from the presence of soldiers of the United States army and workers who were employed in the building of the Alaska Highway. Due to the unusually large number of welfare cases in the Teslin area, which require institutional care, the department feels that a residential school is an urgent necessity.\n\nI should like to assure you, however, that the residential school requirements of the United Church of Canada at Norway House are being carefully borne in mind, provision having been made in the 1949-50 Estimates for the construction of the first unit of the new school, namely the classroom block.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJas.

From this article one would gather that the Indian people and their education are interested only in footballs. On behalf of the United church I wish to deny this implication.\n\nThe first issue dealt with was that of residential versus day schools. We are more than happy to see the great extension of day school facilities in which the government is at present engaged. At the same time we are aware of the needs of special areas and mindful of the special capacities of residential schools we protest the policy of closing all residential schools. What the Indians need is both day and residential schools.\n\nI also protest strongly the manner in which I was quoted out of context. Firmly opposed as I am to Rome, I am more than happy to see that principle of equality that I was suggesting to the conference was that the first principle involved in the surrender of the churches' responsibilities in Indian education should be that of equality. At the present time seven Protestant residential schools have been closed for various reasons said, to the best of my knowledge not on Catholic grounds.\n\nIt is the policy of Catholic expansion at the same time that we are being asked to withdraw that same fort and will continue to draw forth my protest.\n\nRev.

Also forwarded is map No.17 completed by Mr. Hughes during his term of office here. The following a report on the situation.\n\n(a) All Dominion and Provincial schools are marked on the map. See map 17.\n\n(b) All homes are of log construction of a fair type of permanent construction. The various families occupy homes around ten months of the year. A list is attached showing religious affiliation.\n\n(c) Road from Agency at Rossville along the east bank of the Jack River. Crossing of the Jack River affected by seasonal freeze-up and spring thaw.\n\n(d) It is rumoured in the district that it is the Department intention to build a four room day school on the Norway House Reserve sometime in the future. Mr Johnson contends that one school should be built up the river to accommodate the families living on the east bank and the vicinity of the Johnstone Island and along the west shore.\n\nJ.

James A. MacKinnon, wrote me on March 9, 1949, to ask our views on certain matters related to the rebuilding of the School.\n\nI must apologize for the considerable delay in answering the letter. I should say that getting replies back from these Northern Reserves is the reason for it.\n\nI am writing to say that after consultation with our missionaries and others in the Manitoba Conference, it is our judgment -\n\n(1) That the Residential School at Norway House is required to meet the needs of the children on the Northern Manitoba Reserves whose parents are members and adherents of our Church.\n\n(2) That this rebuilding should be undertaken immediately as there is a serious loss of education and training because it is not in operation.\n\n(3) That it should provide accommodation for some 125 children. The missionaries believe that, given the co-operation of Department Officials in enforcing attendance, the School will be filled to full capacity.\n\nI shall be glad to have an opportunity of discussing this matter with you at your convenience.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGD:HC\nOttawa, Ontario,\nAugust 24th, 1949.\n\nReverend George Dorsey, D.D.,\nSecretary, Board of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n229 Queen Street West,\nToronto 2B, Ontario.\n\nDear Doctor Dorsey,\n\nIn the absence from Ottawa of the Minister, Mr. Gibson, I acknowledge receipt of your letter of August 23rd in which you expressed the view that accommodation should be provided in a Residential School at Norway House for approximately 125 children.

In the event of fire the children could very easily leave the buildings and we would possibly only lose one or two buildings at the most. Another feature would be that all buildings could be heated by a central heating station.\n\nIf a building of this type were erected the majority of the lumber could be manufactured on the spot from our own mill. By doing this we would save considerable expense and, in addition, furnish employment for the Indians concerned.\n\nIf the Department intends to build next year we should have plenty of time in order to secure funds for the taking out and sawing of the logs required for lumber.\n\n-over-\n\nIndian Affairs.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nUnited Church Mission,\nNorway House, Man.,\nAug. 16, 1949.\n\nColonel Neary,\nSup't of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWithin the last year a certain number of Protestant children have been enrolled in Catholic Residential Schools in this area. I have discovered that some of these children were baptised Catholics before being admitted but am fairly certain that this was not the case in every instance. My first question is, Can a child of Protestant faith be admitted to a Roman Catholic school if the child's parents approve his admission? I would also appreciate information concerning the admission of Milton Queskekapow to the Jack River branch of the Catholic Residential school. I have inquired at the local Indian office and they have no record of his admission. I would appreciate your forwarding me a copy of his admission assuming this is available. He was admitted on Oct. 1, 1948.\n\nI would also appreciate an explicit statement concerning Residential School admissions in general. I am under the impression that no child whose environment is normal and who is within reasonable distance of day schools is to be admitted to Residential Schools. I would appreciate your informing me as to what the policy precisely is. Also I would appreciate your assurance that this policy is being applied impartially regardless of religious affiliation. Last year at the time that we were having great difficulty securing admissions of our own children to our own schools several of our children were \"stolen\" by the Catholic school.\n\nIn passing I should like to make the following comment on the objectives of Indian education into this area. One of the greatest needs of Norway House is that up to possibly 50% of the population should be removed. There just are not enough natural resources to go around. My own feeling is that the Residential school is best designed to fit a person technically, emotionally etc. to make the step of leaving his own community.\n\n........2\nWith population trends what they are here the slightest depression across the country is going to create a gigantic relief situation at Norway House. This is one reason why I am trying to send as many children as possible to Residential school as the day school seems most likely to leave people just where they are. I feel that the government will have to take energetic measures to find an area where some of the population here can be accommodated and also to convince the people that it is for their best welfare that they should move. This would be a long term program and I have mentioned it here to give if possible, justification for my plea that children be admitted to Residential schools from this area. The seriousness of the situation to which I refer is indicated by the large amounts which have been expended locally by the department this year for relief purposes.\n\nWhen you are replying I would be glad to hear of latest developments relative to the day school on the Jack River and also the new Residential school for Norway House.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(sgd;) Gilbert C.

George Dorey, D.D.,\nSecretary, Board of Home Missions,\nThe United Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St., West,\nToronto 2B, Ontario.\n\nNorway House Indian Day School\n\nDear Dr. Dorey:\n\nI have for answer your letter of October 31, and I assure you that I do not know which of our officials, if any, informed Miss Jessup that her services must cease at the end of November. On October 17, 1949, we were advised by the Agency clerk at Norway House that Miss Jessup had advised him that she would be unable to teach beyond December 15. She requested that the Department take steps to obtain a replacement for that date.\n\nMiss Jessup has a First Class Ontario Certificate and has been teaching in Toronto since 1923. Presumably she has been advised that she can not draw superannuation and continue to teach. The crux of this matter would seem to be whether she retired because of age or whether she retired because of sickness. I note from her application form that she was born on October 31, 1896. Therefore, I presume that she retired because of sickness, and I presume that the superannuation officials in Toronto have found out that she is well enough to resume teaching duties elsewhere.\n\nA great deal of the above paragraph is surmise on my part because I do not have any facts other than those presented in the opening paragraph. I hope this helps you in clarifying this situation.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nWANTED - Teacher for Norway House Indian School at Norway House.

Selkirk, Man.\n23rd Novr. 1907\n\nMr. John Semmens\nIndian Agent\nBeren River Agency\n\nDear Sir -\n\nI am enclosing herewith certain accounts with the Indian Department and ask if you will kindly see that they are dealt with as promptly as possible.\n\nRe: The 1st and 2nd items on the list I may say that I did not think at the time to take vouchers - but knowing me as you do - also the men named in the two accounts perhaps a word from you will be sufficient.\n\nThen referring to the last item - that of issuing the \"Institute Supplies\" I may say that in March 1899 Mr. Short (then Indian Agent) asked me if I would issue these supplies at the same time saying that would recommend to the Department that I be paid $15.00 a year for so doing.\n\nBy his letter (enclosed) of Jan. 2nd 1900 it appears that he did so. However upon inquiring at the Office in Winnipeg I find he did not do so promptly. I think I should be paid for the full time as his remuneration is no fault of mine.\nBy the way - What is the present arrangement about raising the supplies. My reason for asking is this - Chas Paul (Councillor) told me that you had said when here treaty time that you were leaving me a letter about it against my return. Well no such letter has turned up and Chief Sinclair as well as the Councillor (as far as I know) seems to be in the dark about it.\n\nJoseph H. Lowe\nIndian Agent's Office,\nWinnipeg\n\nDecember 10th 1901\n\nRef.: Your Letter No.\n\nSir,\n\nHave received the inclosed correspondence. I have great confidence and respect for Mr. Lowes. Am quite sure he would not prefer a claim without being convinced that it is legitimate. I cannot however find any other reference to the matter in the office than Mr. Short's letter contains and that I inclose. My duty in the case is not clear enough to warrant me in issuing a voucher without authority from yourself. Bear with me therefore for referring it to you for direction.\n\nMr. Lowes has been appointed to take charge of and issue the supplies for the Destitute for the current year but up till now no mention of pay has been mentioned on either side. It is my conviction that in all such cases where time is taken up and energy consumed and responsibility involved there should be compensation.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa 30th December, 1901.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 10th instant, I return herewith the accounts which you forwarded from Mr. Lowes, and I have to inform you that if you certify to the same the Department will make payment. You should issue a voucher for the expenditure in connection with the school (Rossville Bay), which should be charged to Vote 7, and a voucher for the issue of the supplies, which latter should be charged to Vote 5.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nRevd J.

I asked for the painting of this building in the Estimates for this year and I hope the work has been allowed, as the building is very shabby both outside and inside.\nOttawa, April 28th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nRelative to that portion of your report for the month of March, last, on the Rossville Indian Day School, relative to the need of painting the building both inside and outside, I have to say that the Department will approve of having this work done during the coming summer holidays.

The Department will expect you to keep the cost of painting this building down to the lowest possible point, having in view the satisfactory performance of the work. The work should be carried out when the school is closed for the summer holidays.\n\nWhen the above work has been completed to your satisfaction, you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the cost of the materials supplied and for the labour employed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The new stove recently furnished for this school was in operation, and the building was warm and comfortable. Two new panes of glass were needed in the windows, and these have been installed. The teacher complained that as there was no lock on the outside door of this school, outsiders were frequently going in, and interfering with things. I therefore purchased a hasp and padlock, and had them put on the door.\n\nI would recommend that a woven wire fence be erected around this school and its small grounds next summer, with two gates; one large one and one small one. This would keep horses and cattle away from the building and greatly improve the appearance of the place. As it is now, the fire wood gets scattered about, and in all probability it is the animals that break the windows.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP. G.

In addition it is noted that you state the cost of the labour would be $50.00. In preparing our estimates for the current fiscal year it was found possible to include an amount of $100.00 only for repairs and improvements at the Rossville School this year. If the Department supplies the material would it be possible to arrange to have the work done by the Indians without cost. If not what work would you suggest being done for the amount that is provided? I regret that it is not possible to authorize an expenditure greater than $100.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.

I have visited this school several times. Like most of the Day Schools in this Agency, it is in a dilapidated and rundown condition.\n\nThe interior is depressing both for the pupils and the teacher.\n\nNew desks are badly needed. The ones in use are ancient, abused and are for the most part, patched up cripples. Also due to the Family Allowance, there are many more pupils than there are desks, although there is room for installation of more desks.\n\nIf authority is granted for the purchase of these desks will you please wire me in care of Inspector Hamilton's office, in order that we may obtain the desks before navigation closes on Lake Winnipeg.\n\nE.

Anderson,\nDistrict Engineer,\nDept. of Public Works, Canada,\nConfederation Life Building,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am turning over to you the following drawings, prepared from my surveys at Rossville, Manitoba.\n\nA tracing showing the location of buildings at Rossville, Manitoba, prepared on a scale of 50 feet to the inch.\n\nIn connection with the position of sewer and water lines, it should be pointed out that certain of these lines, such as the sewer from the old school site to the septic tank and the sewer from the Agency Office could be located closely by evidence on the ground, but most of the other lines had to be placed on the plan from information supplied largely from memory by members of the Agency staff.\n\nA tracing showing the School Site Parcel \"A\" and the Engineers' Lot Parcel \"B\", together with the ties to existing property lines in the area. Please have a Vandyke made of this tracing, as well as two or three blueprints so that I may have a record of the tracing. When you submit this tracing to Ottawa, please inform them that if they wish to make further tracings of this plan, these can be sent to Winnipeg for my signature. In the case of plans for registration in the Land Titles Offices in this Province, the Surveyor is required to furnish two tracings on linen for the Land Titles Office. In the case of Land Surveys in unorganized areas, two tracings must be supplied to the Director of Surveys Office, and of course, in either case, a tracing goes to the party who orders the survey.\n\nSheet 1 shows the elevations and contours on the school site. A plan showing the locations of the school lot and of the soundings taken on the two sides of the point.\n\nSheet 2 shows the profiles plotted from the sounding data, as well as a profile of the existing sewer line from the old School that was destroyed by fire several years ago. It will be observed that a plan is also shown, showing the location of these sewers with soundings to rick along a line six feet offset to the south of the existing sewer.\n\nOn August 9th, I again checked the water levels in the two concrete manholes along the line and also the level in the concrete manhole near the water's edge, as well as the water levels in the septic tank. The water level in the two concrete manholes along the sewer line was standing at practically the same level in both, and its elevation had risen since my previous measurement on August 7th. The water level\n\n(cont'd)\nin the septic tank intake section stood at 102.8, considerably below the water level in the manhole next to the east. I called Mr. Jackson's attention to the fact that the sewer line between this manhole and the septic tank must have some obstruction, and that unless action was soon taken, the manhole would overflow and the sewer would back up further.\n\nI understand the obstruction was located and the broken sewer pipe was repaired after opening it up at the region of the trouble. Further, I was informed that in the septic tank the screen in the dividing wall of the septic tank must have been plugged, thus accounting for the difference of about 1.4 feet in the difference in water level on the two sides of the dividing wall in the septic tank. Moreover, when I examined the septic tank a short piece of 2\" x 4\" lumber was found sticking upright in the bell of the outlet pipe. This obstruction was removed. I recommended to Mr. Jackson and his assistant that the septic tank should be cleaned out; whether this was done or not, I am not able to say.\n\nThe profile shows the approximate sewer elevations from the second most easterly manhole to the septic tank based on the presumption that the grades are straight grades from manhole to manhole and from the first manhole east to the septic tank. The grade line of the sewer was apparently kept up in order to save rock excavation near Station 10. The profile shows that a large part of the sewer has a cover of less than 6 feet. You will note in my records of soundings on the offset line that in several places we encountered frost on August 7th at about 6 feet down, but that we were able to penetrate the frost with the 1/2 inch pointed steel rod. Further, the frost continued to a depth of about 8 feet below the surface. In Winnipeg sewers are given an earth cover of not less than 7.5 feet. In view of the very shallow earth covers over the sewer and the extremely small and intermittent flow from the Principal's Residence, the Engineer's Office and living quarters above the Agency Office, the sewer will be sure to freeze up in all but a very mild winter. Under these circumstances the sewer lines, manholes and septic tank should be protected against frost until such time as the new school is built. Protection could be provided by covering the present sewer line with about two more feet of earth cover, and the manholes and septic tank could be protected by covering them with a foot or more of manure or hay. Since the covering of the sewer with additional earth cover would make a ridge across the Reserve common, perhaps a covering with a foot or more of manure that could be removed in the summertime would be least objectionable, but not a permanent cure.\n\nI also examined the 3\" Anthese Foundry Cast Iron sewer outlet into Little Playgreen Lake. I found this waste pipe to be broken in two places, and regret that my plan shows the location of only one break. However, there are two breaks, caused no doubt by shifting ice. This cast iron pipe simply rests on a support or two on the bottom of the lake bed which is very shallow for some distance out from shore, actually only about 3.5 feet deep, about 90 feet from the shore where the pipe enters the water.\n\n(Cont'd)\nEven if the outlet pipe is repaired, which repairs should be carried out before freeze up, there is no hope that the pipe line will not be soon broken again. Cast iron cannot stand much shifting and as long as the pipe is exposed, as it is to ice movements, breaks are likely to occur. It will be noted from our soundings that the bay bottom in most places had a mud cover of from 1.5 to 3.0 feet in depth with rock bottom showing without cover in only a few places. In view of these conditions, I believe that a trench could be scraped out along the pipe line to a depth of about 1.5 feet and the pipe line could be extended into slightly deeper water by a shallow cribwork sunk about the outlet to prevent it from silting over. A more flexible outlet pipe line could have been used advantageously in the present location. This waste pipe discharges the fluid from the hospital septic tank as well as from the old septic tank by the Mission lot fence, and for that reason it is advisable to put the line into such repair that it can be expected to function fairly satisfactorily.\n\nI have gone into the investigation of this sewer line from the old school and the outlet to the both sewer lines at the suggestion of Mr. Goodman, when he discussed the situation with me at Rossville, and trust that my report and suggestions may be found helpful.\n\nFurther, in the copy of the letter from Mr. R.A. Gibson, Director of Lands and Development Services Branch, Department of Mines and Natural Resources, dated June 28th, 1948, and written to Mr. Robt. Blais, Chief Engineer of your Department, the following paragraph sets out my work:\n\n\"It is hoped that the existing buildings may be tied into some determinate point, borings to determine the nature of the soil, depth to rock, elevations of water table and that spot levels over the area may be made, as well as water levels and soundings of Little Playgreen Lake, bordering the Agency and other data relevant to the development of the Agency.\"\n\nThe soundings to be taken were later reduced considerably, and those taken and shown on Sheet No. 1 were taken only over a comparatively narrow set of ranges adjacent to the present water intake and sewer outlet lines.\n\nPlease be good enough to have a Vandyke made of my drawings and six white prints run off. Two or three of each of these white prints together with a copy of this letter should be sent to the Indian Agent's Secretary at Rossville, so that work of repairing the sewer outlet pipe and of protecting the old school sewer line against severe winter weather may be completed before freeze up.\n\nOne of the other white prints of each of these two sheets would be for my own records.\n\nPlease accept my thanks for your generous co-operation in arranging for desk space and use of facilities in the preparation of the Building Location plan drawn by Prof. W.F. Riddell, and in having your office staff make the several tracings. This assistance has been a very great help.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd) G.H. Herrick D & M.L.S.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Herriot, for Lands and Development Services Branch, Department of Mines & Resources.\n\nThis survey has now been completed and plans prepared by Professor Herriot handed to me. Under separate cover I am forwarding you the following:\n\nOne Tracing of the plan of the Village of Rossville, Man., showing the location of the School site.\n\nOne Tracing of a plan of the School Lot.\n\nOne Tracing (on paper) of contour plan of the school site and soundings for water intake and sewer outlet. (Sheet #1).\n\nOne Tracing (on paper) showing location of the sewers and profiles of River and Lake beds. (Sheet #2).\n\nCopies of the plan of the Village and of Sheets 1 & 2, together with copy of Professor's letter to me of the 23rd ultimo have been mailed to the Rossville Indian Agent at the agent's particular request to Professor Herriot. Herewith is copy of Professor Herriot's letter to me of the 23rd ultimo. This letter was written primarily at the request of the Rossville Indian Agent, since the latter was much concerned over the care of his sewer and water works system during the coming winter.\n\nProfessor Herriot has not yet submitted his accounts for surveys and expenses. Directoy these accounts are received they shall be forwarded to you. Copies of the above mentioned plans have been handed to Professor Herriot, and copies have been filed in this office. With the exception of the Rossville Indian Agent, no other copies have been disposed of.\n\n(sgd) G.B. Anderson\nDistrict Engineer.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nOttawa, October 30, 1948.\n\nRe: Residential School,\nNorway House Agency,\nRossville, Manitoba.\n\nIn compliance with your marginal notation of June 21st on a memorandum dated June 18th last from the Director of Indian Affairs, we requested the Department of Public Works to have their survey party on the above Agency include in their operations the location of an area on which a proposed Residential School might be located, together with such data as soil conditions, certain soundings off shore in Little Playgreen Lake, location of sewers and existing buildings relative to the school development.\n\nWe have now received from Mr. Robert Blais, Chief Engineer of the Department of Public Works, the following plans, of which two copies each are enclosed for the information of Indian Affairs.\n\nPlan of the Village of Rossville and the School Site.\nContour plan of the School Site and soundings for water intake and sewer outlet.\nPlan showing location of sewers and profiles of River and Lake beds.\n\nWe also enclose a copy of a letter from Mr. G.B. Anderson, District Engineer to Mr. Blais with a copy of report from Professor G.H. Herriot, D. & M.L.S.\n\nThe School site as shown on the plans is that proposed by this Division when the development was to consist of six buildings similar in design to those proposed for the Teslin Residential School. Since then the scheme has been considerably modified and a site of the area shown is probably no longer necessary.\n\nNevertheless, with the plans and information now available to us, the design of any future project can be done expeditiously, with unknown factors practically eliminated.\n\nIn his letter covering the submission of plans, Mr. Blais states that when accounts for the investigation are received, they will be passed to us for payment. In this connection when the matter of carrying out this work was discussed with Indian Affairs, by our Chief Architect, it was arranged that since no funds were available to us for work at Norway House, the cost of the investigation would be borne by Indian Affairs.\n\nAccordingly when the accounts reach us, they will be sent to that Branch for payment.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\nFor your information\n\nR.A.

James A. MacKinnon,\nMinister of Mines and Natural Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. MacKinnon:\n\nIt is very kind of you to write about what our Church has done at Muncey. We believe the policy followed is the right one. We are fortunate in having Rev. R.E. Joblin as Principal of the Consolidated School. We are grateful for the cooperation of the officers of your Department.\n\nMay I take this opportunity of drawing your attention to two matters of great importance.\n\n(1) We greatly need the rebuilding of the Norway House Residential School. This was destroyed by fire three years ago. The officers of your Department can furnish you with the facts and with the figures which reveal the need of this School. I am sorry that I must point out that because this school is not in operation some of the Indians who are adherents of our Church are being induced to send their children to schools operated by the Roman Catholic Church. I do not wish to find fault with either the parents of the church but I do want to point out that the lack of a school is prejudicial to the interests of the United Church in the Norway House Agency.\n\n(2) We are somewhat concerned about priorities in building or rebuilding Residential Schools. We had been given to understand by officers of your Department that the policy was that the first projects would be the rebuilding of schools which had been destroyed by fire and that only after these necessary and vital replacements had been cared for would new schools be undertaken.\n\nIt may be that the information I have is incorrect but I am informed that a new school is being erected at Teslin.\nat a cost of $400,000. We would not deny the need of the Indians at this place but we want to assure you that we expected our needs at Norway House to have priority. I must leave the matter of replacements for other Churches to be dealt with by the proper persons in those churches. I am simply pointing out what the United Church expects.\n\nI have given you my frank and honest opinion on these matters. I would much prefer to talk these things over but unfortunately my engagements are such that I cannot hope to be in Ottawa before Easter and I feel that these representations should be made immediately.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGeo. Dorey.\nOTTAWA, March 7, 1949.\n\nRev. George Dorsey, D.D.,\nSecretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nThe United Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nTORONTO 3B, Ontario.\n\nDear Doctor Dorsey:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of February 25, 1949, concerning the Norway House Residential School.\n\nAs you are no doubt aware, our Education officials have been giving a great deal of consideration to the educational needs of the Indians of the Norway House Agency. An inspection trip of the area made two years ago revealed that the day schools were in a very poor state of repair. Since then, we have completed two modern and well constructed day schools for children of your denomination at Island Lake and at Cross Lake. At the present time, we have two complete sets of materials for other day schools en route by tractor train to God's Lake Narrows and to Oxford House. Funds have been provided in our 1948-50 Estimates for the construction of these schools next summer.\n\nWith regard to the rebuilding of the Norway House Residential School, I may say that the necessary ground survey for this project was completed last summer by two surveyors who were employed by the Department of Public Works in connection with the proposed building of a hospital by the Indian Health Services Branch. Our Lands and Development Services Branch has been asked to prepare a set of drawings for the rebuilding of this school but, unfortunately, we have not been able to advise them specifically as to the size of the building...\nwhich should be erected. Our inspectors reported that previously a considerable number of children from the immediate vicinity of Norway House attended the residential school when they could well have been attending day schools. It has been suggested that a day school be built across the Bay to provide educational facilities for the children there. It is claimed that this area has a stable population and that if a day school were erected there, few, if any, of the children would be taken to winter camp.\n\nWe appreciate the fact that inland from Norway House there are a number of reserves on which it is very difficult to successfully operate day schools, due to the conditions under which the Indians live. There is also the persistent problem of orphans and families with one or both parents in hospital for treatment for tuberculosis.\n\nThe pupilage at the former Norway House Residential School was 105. The problem now is to decide definitely the pupilage of the proposed new school. We had hoped to arrive at a definite answer following the recent visit of one of our officials, but, unfortunately, weather conditions prevented his landing at certain reserves on which there were Indians belonging to the United Church of Canada. You will appreciate the fact that the building of residential schools is today a very costly undertaking. Therefore, we must be careful in building a school which will suffice for our needs but will not be too large for the Indian population it is intended to serve. Naturally, we wish the children for whom day school facilities are provided to attend such schools and we do not wish them placed in a residential school in order to fill it. I would, therefore, like to hear from you as to the views of your local missionaries, and to receive statements from them as to the number of children of your Church in their various missions who actually require residential school care and education. We could then have this information reviewed by our officials.\nI have noted your comments with regard to the Teslin Residential School. The need of a residential school at this point was brought to the attention of the department some ten years ago and assurances were subsequently given that construction would proceed once materials and labour became readily available. The welfare situation has been aggravated by conditions resulting from the presence of soldiers of the United States army and workers who were employed in the building of the Alaska Highway. Due to the unusually large number of welfare cases in the Teslin area, which require institutional care, the department feels that a residential school is an urgent necessity.\n\nI should like to assure you, however, that the residential school requirements of the United Church of Canada at Norway House are being carefully borne in mind, provision having been made in the 1949-50 Estimates for the construction of the first unit of the new school, namely the classroom block.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJas. A. MacKinnon.\n| DATE       | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| February   | Tot Water Pail, 3 brooms and 5 lbs Plaster of                           | 5.15   |\n| 9          |                                                                          |        |\n| February   | Paris for use of Rossville U.C.

(RG 10, Volume 6246, file 540-5, part 3)\nUnited Church Mission,\nNorway House, Man.\nMarch 30, 1949.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nAndrew Crate of Norway House brought me this petition and asked me to make a typewritten copy of this material. Aside from this I have had nothing to do with the petition which was produced entirely on the initiative of the Indians. I might add that in my opinion the list is hardly complete inasmuch as many were already away muskrating.\n\nAlthough I had nothing to do with the petition I thoroughly agree with its contents and I do hope that plans for the Residential school are completed and that it will be started this year.\n\nAside from any theoretical considerations concerning which there seems to be considerable difference of opinion I fail to see how any one actually faced with many of the conditions up here could avoid the very practical conclusion that there is still a large segment of the Indian population whose educational needs can only be served in an adequate sense by some form of Residential School.\n\nThere have been a number of specific cases within this Agency where the education and moral welfare of the children concerned has been very definitely retarded and neglected entirely due to the absence of Residential school here and to the policy of either officials or department itself which too frequently has considered this problem (that is as to whether or not a child should go to Residential School or not) in terms of geography rather than of personality and environment. I know that in certain of these cases...\nsevere criticism would have resulted in an ordinary white community had the worst of these cases been allowed to just drift along in such conditions as their homes represented.\n\nFor these reasons I am more than happy to forward this petition to you on behalf of its authors.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nG.C. Johnson - Missionary\nNorway House, Man.,\nMarch 10, 1949.\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nWe the undersigned hereby ask the department's co-operation, by taking steps to rebuild the school which was destroyed by fire a few years ago.\n\nSince the building was destroyed, through no one's neglect, we have realized, since then what benefits the school really had.\n\nA lot of children have been deprived of good environments. Many parents would like to see their children again in such conditions that prevailed a few years ago. We appreciated the co-operation that the principals and staff gave to them.\n\nMany parents have transferred their children to other Residential Schools. Some have even taken steps as to put them into schools under auspices of other denominations. For they realized that the school had great assets to them and their children.\n\nThey realized that the training their children were getting was excellent, both religiously and practically.\n\nMany of the children who were much better off in a Residential School are now in poor homes, where the environment is indeed poor.\n\nWe look forward earnestly to the time, as soon as possible that the department will take steps to rebuild the school, so that our children will have the training that they now lack.\n\nIn support of which we sign our names.\n\nThanking you most kindly we remain,\n\nYours truly,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nWe have undertaken to help the Department of Education by taking steps to rebuild the school which was destroyed by fire a few years ago.\n\nThe building was destroyed through no one's neglect; we have realized, since then what benefits the school really had.\n\nA lot of children have been deprived of good environments.

The petition alludes to \"many,\" \"a lot,\" and \"some\" children and parents.\n\nNow that we know the names of the interested parties we might supply the Rev. Mr. Johnson with typed copies of the names with blank columns in which to enter such information as:\n\n1. Wife or husband of: (a) age.\n2. School(s) attended with number of years at each.\n3. Cash income during 1948, other than Family Allowances.\n4. Floor area of present home.\n5. Distance of home from Agency office.\n6. Months of year when both parents are away.\n7. Reason for absence.\n8. Ages of children under 17 years.\n9. School attendance (days) of each between Sept 1, 1947 - Sept 1, 1948.\n\nIt is interesting to note that no reference is made to the cost of maintaining children at home. I feel that there is a growing economic compulsion. F.R. changes evaporate quickly at Norway House prices.\n\nAs yet there are no answers from the Agent's office or the U.C. Mission concerning the survey of population-clusters. I realize that I am suggesting that the survey develop into an investigation which in the economic field is just as painful as elsewhere.\n\nC.W.T. Clark\n\nIndian Affairs.

Why do you suggest placing the school on the island rather than on the mainland?\n\n2. Would it not be more convenient for the children at the northern end of the Jack River area to attend one of the graded schools in Rossville?\n\n3.

MacKay,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nSeptember 30th,\n1949.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nRe: Hospital Property, Rossville - Norway House\n\nAs you are no doubt aware, the Government has been operating a small hospital at Norway House and I know that it comes under the Department of National Health, but I understand that plans are well under way for the building of a new hospital on a very large scale at another point on this Reserve, near the Hudson's Bay Post. I am writing to enquire whether, when the Department of Health ceases to use the present hospital building, it could not be used for some purposes in connection with the new residential school, which we hope will be built. The building itself is not very good -- I have in mind that it might be used as a recreational centre of some kind. That is about all that it would be useful for.\n\nPerhaps you could tell me whether I should communicate with the Department of National Health or whether this is still in some way tied up to your Department.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6246, file 540-5, part 3)\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\n\nNorway House Residential School.\n\nPlease find hereunder a self-explanatory letter from Dr. Dorey.\n\nAbout a year ago I discussed this matter with Dr. Moore and he advised against using the old hospital building as a part of the proposed new residential school.\n\nYou will note that Dr. Dorey feels the building is not very good and could only be used as a community centre of some kind.\n\nI would suggest that Mr. Pratt might discuss this matter with Dr. Moore.\n\nBernard F.

I know that you have previously recommended that we do not use it as a part of our proposed new residential school and would therefore welcome an opportunity of discussing Dr. Dorey's letter with you.\n\nBernard F.

Dr. Dorey suggested that it be torn down at that time and the material in it used for whatever purpose the Department considers advisable.\n\nIn view of the discussion with Dr. Dorey, I do not think that it is necessary to reply to his letter of September 30th addressed to the Director.\n\nW.J.F.

Dr. Moore and Mr. Pratt discussed with him the disposal of the old hospital at Norway House, when the new hospital is completed.\n\nI understand that it would not be suitable for a community hall and, in fact, I am advised that the best solution would probably be to tear it down and have the material used for whatever purpose the Department considers advisable.\n\nYour recommendation in this regard would be appreciated.\n\nBernard F.

I am also attaching a copy of a letter received from Mr. J. H. Sheane, Clerk in charge.\n\nThe above work was carried out while Mr. Waite was at the Norway House Agency.

You will also note that the labour return form reads \"Labour on Sewage System and Water Line\".\n\nOn the Voucher it is suggested that 50% of the cost be charged to the Medical Vote and 50% to the Vote for Indian Education. There is no mention on the labour return of work being done at either the hospital or the school.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would clarify this recommendation when returning the attached Voucher.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\n| DATE       | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| November 7 | Tot 140 F.B.M. @ $35.00 per M supplied to Rossville U.C.

M. Faithful as teacher of the Shoal Lake Indian Day School as from January first, 1933, to succeed Mr. Francis Daniels, and stating that salary would be paid at the rate of $80 per teaching month, less 10% during the present fiscal year.\n\nThe Auditor general has taken exception to the granting of any increased salary rate over that previously paid and has pointed out that the spirit, if not the letter, of Order in Council of June 14th, 1932, further extended by Order in Council of April 3rd, 1933, has been violated by the Department in agreeing to pay Miss Faithful at the rate of $800 per teaching year, less 10%, as compared to $650 per teaching year, less 10%, paid her predecessor, Mr. Francis Daniels.\n\nThe paragraph in the Order in Council above referred to, which applies in this instance, reads as follows: \"That no increase prior to March 31, 1934, be made in the remuneration of any officer, clerk or employee\".\n\nI regret, therefore, that salary can only be allowed Miss Faithful at the rate of $65 per teaching month, less 10% - this being the same rate as was paid Mr. Daniels, her predecessor. I would request that you inform Miss Faithful accordingly. Cheque in payment of salary due her for the quarter ended March 31st last, at the rate mentioned, will be sent by mail in your care, in the course of the next few days. His Lordship Bishop Burd, Prince Albert, is being informed regarding the salary that can be allowed Miss Faithful.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nS.

Mr. Agent Fischer suggests that Mr. Kennedy, the Teacher at Red Earth, which is ten miles distant from Shoal Lake, be employed to visit Shoal Lake weekly and issue rations to the aged and destitute. It is estimated that the trip would cost about $2.50.\n\nIt seems to me that fortnightly trips would be sufficient, and I am authorizing the Agent to employ Mr. Kennedy to make fortnightly visits to Shoal Lake to see to the issue of rations there.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Commissioner.\nBattleford, Sask.\nJune 28th 1909\n\nSir,\n\nAs Mr. Solomon Butler is assigned the charge of the school at Grand Rapids, and at the close of the current quarter and the school at Shoal Lake in the same agency is vacant, I would ask the Department kindly to sanction the appointment of Solomon Butler to the Shoal Lake School.

His Lordship stated that He will appoint me to any school in His diocese if the Department recommends me. Would you say in your decision to use your influence on my behalf, of course. Please take school would be the best for political purposes but they are not making any change their. But there is a vacancy at Pan Mountain & M. Indian Agent wants me to go there. I would use your influence with the Indian Department on my behalf at once and if possible near to fixing up time in time. But I'll have over 200 miles to travel when I am appointed.\n\nM. Indian Agent Fisher is also writing the Department at Ottawa asking for any appointment at Pan Mountain. Kindly act at once. Also dear sir don't forget your photograph.\n\nYour faithful servant,\n\nW. G. Dunlop\nOttawa, 1st October, 1899.\n\nReferred by Sir Wilfrid Laurier to Mr. Frank Padley.\n\nE.J.C. for the Minister.\nOttawa, October 4, 1909.\n\nRight Rev. Sir,-\n\nIn July, last, the Department received a communication from Ven. Archdeacon MacKay, advising the Department that Mr. Solomon Buller had resigned his position as teacher of the Grand Rapids day school and recommending his appointment to the Shoal Lake school.\n\nThe Department approved this transfer, but it is now in receipt of an application from Mr. W.O. Lundie for the position, forwarded through the Indian Agent, who states that the school at Shoal Lake has not been reopened.\n\nThe Department would be glad to know when Mr. Buller may be expected to take charge of the Shoal Lake school, as it should be reopened as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nRight Rev. J.A. Newnham, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nOttawa, October 4, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nYour letter of the 23rd ult., addressed to the Premier, in which you apply for the position of teacher of the Shoal Lake Indian school, has been transferred to this Department for action.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that in July, last, the Department approved a recommendation of His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan that Mr. Solomon Butler be transferred from Grand Rapids to the Shoal Lake school, and there is, therefore, no vacancy there at present.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nW.C. Lundie, Esq.,\nThe Pas,\nSask.\nVia Etoimami.\nOttawa, October 4, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 25th ult., I beg to say that in July, last, the Department approved the transfer of Mr. Solomon Buller from Grand Rapids to the Sheal Lake school.\n\nHis Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan will be written to and asked when Mr. Buller may be expected to take charge.\n\nYou will be good enough, therefore, to advise Mr. Lundie that his application cannot under the circumstances be considered at present.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFred Fischer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Sask.\n\nSecretary.\nthat this boy was a half-breed and not an Indian the application would have been refused on that ground, and neither Mr. Ferrier nor Mr. Lonsley would have been permitted to take him into the institutions under their management as a grant earner.\n\nThe Elkhorn Industrial School is supported by the Government for the maintenance of Indian children only, and, even if it were under the management of the Church of England, permission would not be given to enrol half-breeds. Non-treaty Indian children are not debarred from admission, but this boy is not a non-treaty Indian, as, when the treaty was made, application was made on his behalf for half-breed scrip, as above stated; a fact of which you were evidently aware.\n\nThe Department has never at any time assumed responsibility for the maintenance of half-breeds proper of the Western provinces, and in this case is only carrying out the policy it has laid down, and it must, therefore, adhere to its decision not to admit this boy to an Indian school.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to yours re, Shoul Lake School,\n1. I regret to say that Thomas Butler at the last refused\nthe appointment. 2. I was at the Pas lately, & I\ncould not find a suitable teacher, so I asked Rev. M.B.\nEdwards to try to find one, & if he succeeded, to notify\nyou. 3. Meanwhile the school is closed except for\nthe fortnightly visit of Mrs. Kennedy, from Red Earth.\n4. Mr. Sandie asked me to appoint him, & I refused.\nYou will remember, or you can look it up & see, that\nhe has been employed as Teacher two or three times,\nat Moose Lake, & at Shoul Lake, & never seems to\nhave satisfied either the Indians or the Inspector.\nHe taught very irregularly, & was suspected of \"cooking\"\nthe Register to make up the # of days & pupils.\nAs for the Ind. Agents recommendation, Mr. Fisher, &\nMr. Pas, I would not value it at one quarter of a Cent.\n(Private & not to be used in a way to open me to a libel suit)\nHe has no right to have such a position. He has no\ninterest in the welfare of the Indians, and I believe that\nif you could prevail on Mr. Halero, Rev. M.B. Edwards, Mr. Bag-\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6247, file 541-3, part 1)\nShaw, or any reputable & reliable resident of the Pas\nto testify what they know, you would find that\nthe Department could not with any decency\ncontinue him in the post. I heard reliable testi-\nmony to his drunkenness, not infrequent, &c.\nAs to Mr. Sandie, of course if you are willing to\nappoint him, after you have studied his record\nI will not stand in the way. In one sense the\nShoal Lake School should be re-opened soon; from\nanother point it need not. The Shoal Lake Indians\nare an obstinate, independent, difficult lot, & have\nnever treated their teacher properly, or cared about\nthe school. Shoal Lake itself is the worst spot for\na Reserve I ever saw so used, a clearing in the bush,\nsurrounded by swamps, & notorious for its mosquitoes.\nIf you could locate them at Red Earth it would be a\ngreat boon to all. I shall be glad to hear from you\n[1] if you appoint Sandie [2] if you wish me to look for a\nteacher at once [3] if you intend to do anything as to\nMr. Fisher. I may add that the Dep't should do all it can\nto protect the Pas Indians now. [1] Fisher drinks [2] your first doctor\n(Leroux or LeRose?) ditto [3] Rasmus brings in liquor every trip on\nthe hand-car, with an Indian crew whom he tempts to drink. [4] The police-\nman (Carp & Mundy) does his very best, but difficulties are too many.\n\nP.S. I enclose part of a letter. On faith [?] J. A. Saskatchewan\nsent me by mistake along with mine, & I thank you for No. 18088/1 of Oct. 4th\n&c., Miss Harleyn & Co. Carrel.\nOttawa, October 15th, 1909.\n\nRight Rev. Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Lordship's letter of the 9th instant, and in reply to that portion which deals with the appointment of a teacher for the Shoal Lake School I beg to say that the Department is not disposed to place Mr. Lundie in charge of this school. I have to request that your Lordship will be good enough to endeavor to obtain the services of a competent teacher at your earliest opportunity; in the mean time the school may remain closed.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Rev.

(RG 10, Volume 6247, file 541-3, part 1)\nOttawa, December 17th, 1909.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nMr. Lundie taught the Pas Mountain, which is known as the Shoal Lake school, for two quarters, but had previously taught at Moose Lake some years ago. The only report we have from the Agent or Inspector as to his work was made by Mr. Agent Fischer who stated that although the attendance was very irregular the progress was satisfactory. This was in May 1908. The school has been closed for over a year, but Mr. Inspector Jackson, in a report dated 15th of November, 1909, states that the Rev. Mr. Edwards informed him that arrangements were being made to send a teacher there.\n\nReferring to the correspondence I find that the Bishop of Saskatchewan has refused to appoint Mr. Lundie. He says \"He has been employed as teacher two or three times at Moose Lake and at Shoal Lake, and never seems to have satisfied either the Indians or the Inspector. He taught very irregularly, and was suspected of 'cooking' the Register to make up the number of days and of pupils.\" He also stated confidently that he had no faith in the Agent's recommendation.\n\nI find there is a statement of a claim for the upsetting of Mr. Lundie's case and the loss of his property made in his own handwriting, which would indicate that he has had only a limited education. (File 119408/1).\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6247, file 541-3, part 1)\nOne day school of the Department would recommend and Rev. W.

I'm Indian Agent Fisher wrote to the Secretary of Indian Affairs the other day he has looked the Bishop of St. John's over and if you will not be kind enough to lend your influence with Indians you know they will appoint me without your assistance. I cannot get the position so please help me and assure you that you will not have any cause to regret helping me.\n\nI have also heard that the Secretary of Indian Affairs has asked His Lordship Bishop Maclean to send a suitable teacher for the Pa. Mountain School which is still vacant. Dr. Sir Wilfrid will you not use your influence on my behalf. I have filled the\nposition for 162 years faithfully\n& honestly & resigned on my own\naccord although I could believe\nmyself but have failed to do so\nI am most anxious to get back\nto my old position, from now\non I shall be in need of employment.\nDo be so kind as to help me, than\nfaithfully served the Church\nyears, each little favor able & have\nbeen asked for a favor or a Lent\nbefore & afterward you should know\nwho I am to.

C. Landie, Esq.,\nPas P. O.,\nVia Hudson Bay Co., Sask.\nIndian Office.\n\nJanuary 26th, 1910.\n\nThis is to certify that Mr. W.C. Lundie has been in the employ of the Indian Department during the years 1906, 1907 and 1908 as school teacher at Moose Lake and Shoal Lake Reserves in this Agency and I consider him a fit and proper person for the office. I may add that to my knowledge Mr. Lundie resigned the position of teacher of the Shoal Lake Indian day school of his own will thinking thereby to benefit his condition, which however has not come up to his expectations and he now wishes to be re-instated.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n357456.\n\nIn reply to your letter dated the 18th, I have taken the liberty of writing you rather a long letter. I am an Englishman from the City of London, I was educated under Professor Henry of King's College, London, since leaving there I have followed the profession of surveyor of Wales, having served in the Pen and Pencil Company, Lord George Hamilton, Colonel Sir William Hewitt, General Stephenson, Lieutenant in different regiments, as well as have travelled to different countries. Finally, I landed here in Canada working in eastern Canada under Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Fulton, meeting the Hon. Mr. Justice of the State of Vermont, from whom I came West in the fall of 1870 until 1872 when I returned to England. I wrote to Mr. Justice Inspector McCall who asked me to go to a teacher to the mountain, then they were all gathered there. From the first I put my sons of Christ in my education to do well. I should be the blessed Master. I held with them people for 6 years, nothing up with the present hardships. My salary for year together was a dollar or two, I was paid $10.12. A bag for house flour, Indian style. Mr. Braden asked me to go to Dollar Lake, I do have been moved from one school to another, always travelling at my own expense and finding my own house to live in.\nInspector McCauley died unexpectedly. Marlett succeeded him, but the fact of my being strongly opposed to his views, Mr. Marlett did not get along very well. But Mr. Marlett himself got another hand and another better. Mr. Indian Agent Boulton has succeeded Mr. Reed. Even then appointed to Moore Lake, where it was very difficult work on account of the great amount of whisky being brought on the reserve by the infamous Hamilton. The immoral habits of the Indians kept me very busy fighting the devil. Mr. Boulton left Mr. Fisher took his place. Also a new Bishop taken the place of another of Mr. Bishop's name Bishop Pinkham. So now all my superiors were all new or me also a new Rural Dean came to see me. I have seen quite a number of changes. About this time I had some trouble with the Indian Chief at Moore Lake about drunk & lazy men, I have made some report of my work to Mr. Indian Agent Fisher & Mr. Fisher came to Moore Lake & investigated the matter & the chief was entirely defeated no other charge could be proved against him (the whole band stood by him & have proved good friends to me, all the time have a teacher they would deal like me to come back again) still Mr. Fisher recommended a change for me. The new Bishop did not like me but removed, but still I was ordered to go to Par Mowat again, so I hitch up my horse & left for\nShort Lake Reserve\n\nI arrived at the Pug two days after here. I had to buy a very large canoe & get fish when I started. The boat was very much loaded but all went well until we were in the 3rd Rapid between the Pug and Short Lake where the stream made a false start & the boatman became very excited. The boat swung against a rock & capsized, sufficient to say that my only daughter was lost. She was only 7 years old, so after she arrived at Short Lake in a very poor condition my wife was taken back & kept her bed all the winter & my children were almost starved. We had no help & we could not get a load at all the H.B.C. Co. was short of supplies & we were forced to survive or die like the poor Indians. I have asked for help & I have little hope that I will receive any. I have asked the Indian Department to remove me from Short Lake & that the government must now come from the Indian Department & He will gladly ap-\n\npoint me to any school in the District. But Pandell spoke & I believe it an individual effort on account of political views. I am a strong supporter of the Indian Government & I have asked them to help me to be reinstated. You have asked me for recommendation. I am sure you can find Mr. Fisher.\nI shall refer you to any of the gentlemen named. I have mentioned in that letter, & I shall forward to you as quickly as possible Mr. Reader's statement. Mr. Boulton, if from the Church or rather the Mission recommendation will also be forwarded as quickly as possible.\n\nHave wrote faithfully for the Indian Department since 1891, also filled that position as Butcher for the Church all these years. I have distributed Medicine in the most careful manner, also. Taken great interest in the Indians. Have the worst clear for the last 3 years. Dear old Commissioner David expressed wish that His Lordship would see his way clear to reappoint me to Morin Lake, but His Lordship says the Indian Department & Co. will pay in fact the whole government are Humbug.\n\nPraying D. Sir that you will do all you can on my behalf. I'll close & shall wait anxiously for your reply & shall pray that Our Heavenly Father will overcome all trouble & that He will guide you to see your way clear to Appointment.\n\nBelieve me to remain D. Sir\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nWalter Charles Lundy\nOttawa, February 3rd, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo renewing your application for the position of teacher of the Shoal Lake Indian School, and enclosing a certificate from Mr. Fred. Fischer, Indian Agent at the Pas, Sask.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the nomination for the position at this and other Church of England Schools rests with the Bishop of Diocese, although the Department reserves the right to make appointments. If it is not possible for you to obtain a recommendation from His Lordship for an appointment to this school the Department is not in a position to consider your request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nW.

I understand also that the Department wishes to engage for the Indian schools teachers who have had some special training for the work. Moreover, as the various denominations are to some extent interested in these schools it would be difficult to appoint you to any position without the recommendation of the authorities of your Church.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW. C. Lundie, Esq.,\nPas P.O.,\nVia Hudson Bay Jet., Sask.\nOttawa, February 16th., 1910.\n\nDear Lemaire,-\n\nI would suggest that you send the enclosed reply to Mr. Lundie.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nE.

You will be good enough to advise when the school is opened. The Department trusts that you will impress upon Mr. Daniels the necessity of his devoting all his energies to effecting an improvement of conditions on this reserve and his retention in the position will depend upon the success with which he meets. Mr. Daniels will be paid at the rate of $300.00 per annum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nVen. Archdeacon J. A. MacKay,\nBattleford, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The teacher states the reason for closing was that he was compelled to go so far for more provisions. You will be good enough to report to the Department what provisions he has reference to.\n\nI may add, for your information, that Mr. Daniels is only being paid for the days he actually taught in the quarter and he should be informed that the Department will expect him to keep this school regularly in operation.\n\nIn all cases in your agency where a school is closed for any length of time during a quarter some explanation should be made either by yourself or the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

The Anglican Missionary was at Shoal Lake last week and he reports that Mr. Daniels would be a satisfactory man for the position.\n\nI would be obliged if the Indian Department would sanction the appointment and advise me as to what salary he is to receive.

Daniels as teacher of Shoal Lake Day School, and wish to state that Mr. Daniels started teaching on January 2nd.\n\nThere is no house at Shoal Lake for a teacher, the late teacher owned his own house. I could arrange to rent or purchase cheaply a small house that would satisfy Mr. Daniels as I understand that there are two empty houses on the Reserve. If the Department authorises me to do so I could arrange for this on my visit to Shoal Lake in about three weeks, in any case I could get information as to probably cost of either rent or purchase. It will be necessary to make provision for the teacher, and I will not go to any expense before I get an answer from the Department.\n\nI am enclosing a requisition for a few supplies required at the above point.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst Deputy & Secretary, Indian Agent,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to report that on November 19th I visited Shoal Lake Day School. The teacher here is Francis Daniels. Present ten boys and ten girls. On the roll were thirteen boys and twelve girls. The average attendance had been very good.\n\nThe children are divided up into five classes, although really, they could all be put in the two classes, as they are not very far advanced in any subject. The elder children can read, spell and do arithmetic fairly well. There is not very much advancement since the last time that I visited this school.\n\nI enclose herewith application for some supplies required at the school.\n\nThe teacher at this school is asking for an increase of salary. I would recommend that the Department pay him the same as paid the teacher at Red Earth, namely $500.00 a year.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Agent Waddy forwards a request for an increase in salary to Francis J. Daniels, teacher of the Shoal Lake Indian Day School, The Pas Agency.\n\nMr. Daniels was appointed teacher of this school on January 2nd, last, at a salary of $450.00 per annum and bonus at the rate of $150.00. He also receives $50.00 per annum for his services as dispenser. He is a returned soldier and, previous to his enlistment, was employed as teacher at the Red Earth Indian Day School, where he taught for three years. He is an Indian and has no professional qualifications. The reports received show that he is doing good work. There is an enrolment of 25 pupils, with an average attendance of 14.\n\nThe Agent recommends that he be granted the same salary as the teacher at the Red Earth School, whose salary was increased from July 1st, last, to $500.00 a year. This teacher, Isiah Badger, is also an Indian and has no professional qualifications. The salaries of the other teachers in The Pas Agency are paid at the rate of $500.00 per annum, and I would recommend that, in the case of Mr. Daniels, he be placed on the same basis in regard to salaries as the other teachers and that an increase of $50.00 be allowed him from the first of October, last. This will make his salary at the rate of $500.00 per annum.\nOttawa, December 4, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo furnishing a report on your visit to the Shoal Lake Indian Day School and recommending that Francis J. Daniels, the teacher, receive an increase in salary.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of an increase of $50.00 per annum in the salary allowed Mr. Daniels. He is at present receiving salary at the rate of $450.00 and, with the increase of the above amount, he will be allowed a salary at the rate of $500.00 per annum from the first of October, last, the beginning of the present quarter. He will also be entitled to the bonus during the period which it is continued to teachers in Indian day schools. You will be good enough to inform Mr. Daniels of the increase in salary allowed him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report that Francis Daniels, School teacher at Shoal Lake Day School has requested me to apply to the Department to allow the closure of the school from the 17th of June to the 17th of August, his excuse is that he has no supplies, and has to come to The Pas to get some grub.\n\nI saw this man last week and inspected his school, and I beg to recommend that this request be allowed. I know that he is very hard up.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, June 25th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant, reporting that Mr. Francis Daniels, teacher of the Shoal Lake Indian Day School, requests to be allowed to close the school from the 17th of June to the 17th of August, as he is out of supplies.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that the Department will approve of the holidays of this school being taken between the above dates. It is expected, however, that Mr. Daniels will reopen the school on the 17th of August.\n\nHis return of attendance for the current quarter should be prepared by him and forwarded through your office at an early date in order that the salary and bonus due him can be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to state that I visited Shoal Lake Day School, on the 15th of June. On the register at this school, there were ten boys and ten girls. There were present at the time of my visit seven boys and seven girls. The average attendance this quarter would be about eleven. During this quarter, there were three deaths amongst the pupils. Three pupils are in the second standard and were fair in reading and in making sentences from words in their lessons. They were very good in arithmetic. In the first standard Senior, there were four pupils, these pupils are as far advanced as the ones in the second standard. I could see very little difference between them. They have been making fair progress since my last visit. The balance of the pupils are smaller children and know their alphabet and can read and write simple words.\n\nThere is no garden at this school, as the chief and Indians did not plow one this Spring. The chief will plow a garden next fall or come off the ration list. I told him that he was a fairly young man to be on the ration list, and if he does not help, he can hunt his own grub, and I have no doubt that there will be a good garden next year.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 2, 1921\n\nSir,\n\nI have to refer you to official letter of June 25th, last, approving of Mr. Frank Daniels closing the Sheal Lake Indian Day School on the 17th of June on the condition that the school would reopen on August 17th.\n\nKindly advise the Department if Mr. Daniels reopened the school on the latter date. If he did not you should state the date on which he resumed duties at this point.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPas., Man.\nSir,\n\nIn reference to letter 128-10-1 of the 2nd inst., I beg to state that up to time of writing I have no news from Shoal Lake Reserve, and cannot say what day Mr Daniels started work, however, his quarterly report will be along in the next three weeks and I will forward it as soon as it is received.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report that I visited the Shoal Lake Day School on the 7th inst.\n\nThere were on the register 9 boys and 9 girls.\n\nAt the time of my visit there were 8 boys and 7 girls present, but the attendance had not been regular, on account of the parents taking the children away on the rat hunt.\n\nMost of the children are in grade 1, there being only 4 in grade two, and 1 on grade three. The younger children were well advanced in the subjects they are taught, but the others were not confident in the subjects which they should know, however, these were the ones who had been absent the most.\n\nThe school was very untidy and I told the teacher he could get the place put in a tidy shape and keep it that way or we would have to give him a change of occupation.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, December 21st, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, reporting on your visit to the Shoal Lake Indian Day School.\n\nRegarding the untidy conditions existing in the school, I beg to say that your action in notifying the teacher that, if he does not take immediate steps to remedy these conditions, it would be necessary to make a change, is approved. On the occasion of your next visit to the school, you should examine and report on the conditions and, if the teacher has not carried out your instructions to tidy up the place, you may notify him that his services are not further required.\n\nI will be pleased to hear from you after your next visit to this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report that on the 19th inst I visited the Shoal Lake day school at Shoal Lake Reserve.\n\nThe teacher here is Mr Francis Daniels, he holds no certificate.\n\nThe number on the register is 13, and there were 11 present at time of my visit, though the average for the quarter will be about 6.\n\nThis school house was very dirty last time I visited it, but I think it is the cleanest at present, at least it is one of the cleanest in the Agency.\n\nThe eight children in Standard one can read, spell, subtract, add and multiply, they can also give a good description in English of the subject of their lessons, and can name in English nearly any local object. Some of them can write a fairly good letter off hand. There was one boy in Standard three who could do fractions very well. The pupils are progressing at this point.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSchool Letter\nDec 27th 1922\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWhen last I wrote here you found the school closed and I away. So I must explain the reason why it was closed.\n\nSeeing that the chief doesn't give me money for the school although I told him that I haven't any, the only thing that I could do then was to close up and to seize the chance & going for a supply of food at Red Earth.\n\nThis being the first time that I've closed school during the quarter (not at least since winter), I had to close 6 times & now it should be closed for good for all the Indians who take in the school. Because here I haven't any medical form. So I want you to try and send me up some by first chance.\n\nWhat has become of my Sept Bonus cheque?\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6247, file 541-3, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES CANADA\n\nArchives publiques du Canada\nI have the honor to enclose report from teacher of Shoal Lake Day School for December 1922 quarter, also a letter he sent in to me.\n\nI visited this school on December 15th last, and found it locked up. Nobody knew where the teacher was located, so I had to leave the Reserve without inspecting the school or register. It might be a good plan to close the school as suggested by the teacher, as the next letter I get will be a request to close it for two months for the rat hunt. To be fair to the teacher the salary should be allowed to end of term if the school is closed.\n\nThis teacher has asked that his power of attorney to Bon Marche Store, The Pas be cancelled.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAast. Deputy & Secretary, Indian Agent,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, January 10, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, enclosing the December quarter return from the teacher of the Shoal Lake Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the salary and bonus due the teacher up to the end of December have been paid in full. Cheques for the same were sent under Power of Attorney to the Hudson's Bay Company, Pas Mountain Post, Sask.\n\nAs the Indians seem to take very little interest in the school, and as they are away part of the time from the Reserve, it is considered that it would be advisable to close the school until such time as a better attendance is assured. You may, therefore, inform the teacher that this school is to be closed from the first of the present month and is to remain closed until further notice. When you are of the opinion that conditions warrant its re-opening you should so inform the Department and arrangements can then be made to have it re-opened.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nSir,\n\nIn reference to letter 128-10-1 of the 10th inst., I have the honor to state that I closed down the Shoal Lake School as per instructions, except that it had been opened until receipt of instructions January 23rd.\n\nI enclose the report of the teacher up to date. I think the Department might favorably consider giving the teacher a months salary in addition to the days he worked. We cut him off from his position without much notice, and he is very poor.\n\nI intend to visit the Shoal Lake Reserve next week, but do not think it will make any difference to the school situation. I understand the people have put in some wood since the school was closed, but they will have to put in two years supply before I recommend the opening of the school again. The wood is situated two hundred yards from the school, so it is no hardship to cut the little needed for the school. We are at present selling four million feet of timber off the reserve, so it can be seen that there is no wood shortage.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nIndian Agent,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, February 7th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo, enclosing the report of the teacher of the Shoal Lake School covering the period the school was open to January 25th, last.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that we will allow the teacher salary and bonus to the end of the present month. Payment for this period is being allowed in lieu of insufficient notice to the teacher to close the school. Cheques for the amount allowed will be sent under Power of Attorney from the teacher in favour of the Hudson's Bay Company.\n\nThis school will not be reopened until the Indians take more interest in the education of their children, and guarantee the regular attendance of a sufficient number to warrant the expense of reopening the school. When conditions warrant the reopening, we would be pleased to have your recommendation to that effect so that the necessary action can then be taken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Daniels has been transferred, on the closing of the Shoal Lake Indian Day School, to take charge, temporarily, of the Red Earth Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of the transfer of Mr. Daniels to the Red Earth Indian Day School until the end of the June quarter, next. It being understood that when the Shoal Lake school re-opens after the summer holidays Mr. Daniels will return and assume duties at that school. He will be allowed salary for the period he teaches the Red Earth school at the same rate as was paid at Shoal Lake, viz: $500.00 per year, supplemented by any bcnus provided by law. We note that he will commence duties at the Red Earth school on or about April 1st, next.\n\nThe Power of Attorney which you enclosed in favour of the Western Trading Store, The Pas, Man., has been noted, and payment of Mr. Daniel's salary for the June quarter will be made to this firm.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Daniels, the teacher who taught this school, has been teaching at Red Earth Day School for June quarter, and if the Shoal Lake Day School is reopened he can go back to that place.\n\nI beg to recommend that the school be reopened and that Mr. Daniels be appointed as the teacher, and that he be paid his salary for the quarter as if the school had not been closed, he has promised to start the school on August 15th next.\n\nMr. Daniels June salary will be paid as teacher of Red Earth School, he will be sending in his returns shortly.\n\nI am, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst.

In this connection I beg to refer you to official letter of March 27th, last, it being understood, when permission was granted for his transfer to Red Earth, that he would return to the Shoal Lake School after the holidays. His salary will be at the rate of $500 per annum, supplemented by any bonus provided by law.\n\nYou will be good enough to inform Mr. Daniels accordingly, and arrange with him to be at Shoal Lake in time to commence duties when the school re-opens after the holidays, on or about September 4th, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

There were present at the time of my visit 9 boys and 6 girls. The average attendance for the December quarter up to the present time is 15.\n\nThe school is kept very tidy and the Indians have supplied lots of wood and there are at least 8 cords of wood piled outside the school.\n\nI examined the various classes and there were 4 boys and 2 girls in the beginners class, who could count and repeat the alphabet and spell simple words. In standard One there were 4 boys and 2 girls who could multiply, subtract, add and divide in arithmetic, and could read quite well from the book one. They could also give English names and descriptions for any articles in use in the school. In Standard two there were 2 girls, who were very good in arithmetic and could also do simple fractions. They were getting along well in writing and spelling etc. There was only one boy in Standard three. He was not much further advanced than the two girls in standard two.

Agency.\n\nDAY SCHOOLS:\n\nAt Cumberland the school was not opened, some repairs were going on. At Pine Bluff I saw the pupils in their exercises. Mr. Paul Sicotte is the man who acts as teacher, this is an R.C. School elementary only. Next was at Shoal Lake. The building is log, is in fair condition whitewashed inside and outside, furniture was all kept in good shape, the teacher is a native son, name Francis J. Daniels, he is bright man, young. He exercised his pupils for my benefit, the classes are elementary, the methods of the teacher are up to date, and he attracts the attention of his pupils and interests them so that they learn readily what he wants to convey. His general questioning of the older pupils indicated that they were quite intelligent.\n\nJ. R. Bunn,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nDecember 9th, 1932.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMr. Francis Daniels, teacher at Shoal Lake, in the Pas Agency, has asked for a change of work after Christmas and has accepted the school run by the Church of England at Chitek Lake in the Carlton Agency. The Indians at that Reserve will not send their children to school unless they have a Cree-speaking teacher, and I think he will make a success of that school. At present 13 children are attending. This leaves a vacancy at Shoal Lake and I beg to nominate for this post Miss Margaret Faithfull, who has done such excellent work at Little Pines Reserve for many years. She found the large school with the higher grades too much for her health and needed a holiday. But now, after a rest, she feels equal to the smaller school with lower grades. I think she will be invaluable at Shoal Lake and she will help in the project of the nursing shelter at that point. I shall be glad to know what salary you will allow her. She will not receive any remuneration from the Church.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW.T. Saskatchewan\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6247, file 541-3, part 1)\nOttawa, December 20, 1932.\n\nRight Rev.

There is a small enrolment at this school, and this is the full amount we can provide towards her salary. The Department is aware of the previous service of Miss Faithfull, which was satisfactory. We hope that she will meet with every success in the work at Shoal Lake.\n\nI should be pleased if Your Lordship will inform Miss Faithfull of her appointment, and arrange with her to take up duties as early as possible in the new year. The Indian Agent at The Pas is being informed of the approval granted for her appointment, and he is being requested to give her any assistance he can in her work at this school.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

M. Faithful, covering March quarter salary at teacher at the Shoal Lake Indian Day School, I beg to point out that in my opinion, the salary if not the letter of Order-in-Council P. C. 44/1932 of June 14th, 1932 (extended by P. C. 51/1933 of April 1st, 1933) has been violated by the Department in agreeing to pay Miss Faithful $800.00 per teaching year as compared to $650.00 paid her predecessor Mr. Francis Daniels.\n\nThe paragraph in the Order-in-Council above referred to which applies in this instance reads as follows:\n\n\"That no increase, prior to March 31st, 1933, be made in the remuneration of any officer, clerk or employee, except on promotion under the conditions prescribed by the next succeeding paragraph.\"\n\nWhile Miss Faithful may not have received an increase in salary, there is undoubtedly an increase proposed in the salary for the position of teacher at the Shoal Lake School.\n\nIt is also our contention that as the authority for the appointment of Day School teachers has been transferred from the Civil Service Commission to the Department, that all new appointments should be approved by the Deputy Superintendent General. The approval in the case of Miss Faithful is only implied from the letter of December 20th, 1932, addressed to the Rt. Rev. W. T. Hallam, D.D., and is not considered sufficient.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, this office does not feel justified in issuing a cheque to Miss Faithful at a rate in excess of $650.00 per school year which was the rate paid her predecessor.\n\nThe application is, therefore, returned herewith.\n\nRepresentative of the Treasury.\n\nOttawa, May 19th, 1933.\nOttawa, May 27, 1933.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nIn December, last, His Lordship Bishop Hallam nominated the services of Miss I. M. Faithful as teacher of the Shoal Lake Indian Day School, to succeed Mr. Francis Daniels, as from January first, 1933. The Department approved of the appointment of Miss Faithful, with salary at the rate of $80 per teaching month, less 10% during the present fiscal year.\n\nI regret to inform Your Lordship that the Auditor General has taken exception to the granting of any increased salary over that previously paid. It is pointed out that the spirit, if not the letter, of an Order in Council, dated June 14, 1932, and further extended by Order in Council of April 3, 1933, has been violated by the Department in agreeing to pay Miss Faithful at the rate mentioned above, as compared to $65 per teaching month paid her predecessor, Mr. Francis Daniels. The paragraph in the Order in Council which applies in this instance reads as follows: \"That no increase prior to March 31, 1934, be made in the remuneration of any officer, clerk or employee\".\n\nI regret, therefore, that salary can only be allowed Miss Faithful at the rate of $65 per teaching month, less 10% during the present fiscal year - this being the same rate as was paid Mr. Francis Daniels, her predecessor.

M. Faithfull, Teacher at the Shoral Lake Indian Day School. In September last I visited Shoral Lake, and Daniels asked if he could be sent another school instead of Shoral Lake. On returning to the Pas, I called at the Indian Office and saw Inspector Hamilton or the Indian Agent Lovell. He spoke of the proposed shelter for the sick at Shoral Lake, and these gentlemen expressed a wish that there could be some white person at Shoral Lake to help the Indians to supervise the shelter. I told them that Mr. Daniels had asked for a change, so that I thought Miss Faithfull might be willing to go to Shoral Lake. They thought that this would be a good plan.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Miss Smithfield received no increase in salary, therefore I respectfully beg to differ from the Auditor General that either the spirit or the letter of the Order in Council has been violated.\n\nThe Order says \"that no increase prior to March 31st 1934 be made in the remuneration of any officer, clerk or employee.\" But Miss Smithfield received no increase in remuneration. She is a fully certified teacher, but Daniels is not, therefore it seems only fair that she should receive the normal salary for such a teacher, even though Mr. Daniels received less. $720 per annum ($800 less 10%) is little enough for a lady teacher in an isolated place where she has to pay expensive freight charges on all her supplies, when she is the only white person in the place.

However, she has not been able to stick to her work. Now her salary is to be reduced to $585 per annum. I do not think it is possible for a white woman to live at Short Lake Academy on that amount, so I do not think it is fair to ask her to do it. I imagine the Auditor General has no conception of the conditions at Short Lake. But Daniels could shoot ducks or catch fish, but a woman has to buy her food, or pay charges from the Pas or Carrot River Station, add considerably to the cost. I sincerely hope that something can be done to stop the reduction in Miss Smith's salary.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW. L. J.

Paul,\nSynod Office,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nBishop of Saskatchewan.\n\nThe Bishop had to leave Prince Albert today for a prolonged absence at the Coast owing to ill health; but I consulted with him, and obtained his approval before communicating with Mrs. Read.\n\nHoping that this will meet with the approval of the Department,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW. E. J. Paul.\nDear Sir,\n\nRe Shoal Lake Indian Day School.\n\nThis will confirm my night lettergram of today's date saying that we have been unable to find a suitable male Teacher for above school. We communicated with those who applied for a school this year, and advertised for a Teacher, but those we thought would be suitable have already signed on for a school for this term.\n\nShoal Lake would not be a very suitable place for a young unmarried lady Teacher.\n\nAccordingly, I communicated with Mrs. Stanley Read of Livelong, who, as Miss Amy Wrigley, was so successful in teaching the Thunderchild Day School. And I have received word today that she is willing to take this position if the Department approves. She applied before for the Thunderchild School, but as there were many unmarried Teachers needing a position at that time, she was not offered the post.\n\nI suggested that Mr. Read, who is a mechanic, might get employment with the Poe Lumber Co. which is working in the neighbourhood of Shoal Lake, and so be near Mrs. Read, without living on the Reserve. Failing this he might stay at Livelong where he and his brother have a garage.\n\nAs far as the work goes, and the welfare of the Indians, I knew of none who I think would do as well as Mrs. Read, and as the only answer to our advertisement was from another married lady, I do not think we are doing any wrong to other teachers in offering her the position.\n\nShe is a First Class Teacher, and you already have her qualifications, as she was in the service of the Department for many years.\n\nI therefore beg to forward her name as the nominee of the\nand dispensing the medicine.\n\nMiss Faithfull's health broke down there. I found her very ill at the nearest neighbour's five miles from Shoal Lake on Sunday Oct. 4th. I had tried to bring in my car via Nipawin 100 miles away, and 60 of those miles over trails which most people would call impassable for a car, hoping to give her an easier journey out than by waggons. When I saw her condition and the condition of the trails, I at once saw it was out of the question for her to attempt such a journey. Yet something had to be done. Fortunately there is a stretch of the Carrot River which is straight and deep. So I sent out a message to the Mac G. Aviation Co., Prince Albert, to send in a plane. In this way Miss Faithfull was safely taken out to civilisation, and is now taking medical treatment in Saskatoon.\n\nBut there is a bill due to the Aviation Co. of $56.00. I have guaranteed this payment, but if the Department could see its way to pay for this necessary air journey, I should be very grateful.\n\nBut, apart from this, would it not be possible to raise the Teacher's salary to, say $75 per teaching month, and have the house made reasonably warm for winter use, with storm doors and windows, and have a well dug.\n\nI should then find it much easier to apply to a fully qualified Teacher to take up the work at Shoal Lake.\n\nI had arranged for Mrs. Read, if she had been appointed, in the first place to go in with me by car; and then when I did not hear from the Department, to come in by the plane which took Miss Faithfull out. It was not till my return to Prince Albert that I received your letter telling of the ruling that under no circumstances could a married lady teacher be appointed.\n\nI should be glad to hear from you, as to what offer the Department would make to Mr. Richford, and whether they would approve of his appointment if I can persuade him to go.\n\nI knew of a young unmarried man who might accept the school, but I do believe a woman like Mrs. Richford, who would have the welfare of the Indians at heart, would be a very great asset on the Reserve. The young girls on the Reserve need a woman to look after them.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW. E. J. Paul.\n\n(Commissary for Bishop & Saskatchewan.)\n\nIndian Affairs.

He has been there six years, so evidently gives satisfaction.\n\nHe has permanent second, and interim first class certificate.\n\nHe has had eleven years teaching experience in Saskatchewan.\n\nHe taught a school at Meadow Lake composed mainly of Cree children.\n\nHe has also had experience of teaching English to non-English speaking children in a Swedish settlement.\n\nHe is 31 years of age, married with one child.\n\nI have heard from two clergyman who know him, and they heartily recommend him both as to character and teaching ability.\n\nNow there is the other side of the proposition, and Mr. Richford has not yet definitely consented to go to Shoal Lake if the appointment is approved.\n\nIt is a case of asking a married man with a child to go to a place 75 miles from a Doctor, 45 miles from a Post Office, with no white neighbours, ten miles from the nearest store, no road except in winter; one and a half miles from a river which this fall became too shallow for navigation by canoe to the Pas.\n\nThe water supply is a creek \u00bd mile from the teacherage.\n\nThe house has one room upstairs and one downstairs, but it is in poor repair, draughty and cold in winter with a home-made door and no storm door, no storm windows and no well.\n\nAnd to the teacher who is willing to put up with all this hardship and inconvenience the Department offers a salary of something under $700 a year for teaching and giving out the rations.\nOttawa, November 5, 1936.\n\nVenerable Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, regarding the services of a teacher for the Shoal Lake Indian Day School. It is noted that you are endeavouring to arrange with Mr. Willis A. Richford, a qualified teacher, to take the position.\n\nIn the event of Mr. Richford accepting the Department would be pleased to approve his appointment. We would be prepared to allow him salary at the rate of $75 a teaching month - this being an increase of $10 per month over the rate previously paid. I shall be pleased to hear from you definitely, at an early date, stating whether Mr. Richford accepts and, if so, the date on which he begins duties.\n\nThe Department is authorizing Mr. Lovell, Indian Agent, The Pas, to have the teacher's residence supplied with a storm door and storm windows and to carry out any other minor repairs that may be necessary to make the building as comfortable as possible. It would, no doubt, be too late in the season to dig a well. This matter could receive consideration next spring.\n\nI regret that it will not be possible, under present regulations, to pay the transportation costs of Miss Faithful, the former teacher, or of her successor, in proceeding to the school. The account which you submitted is herewith returned.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nVen. W. E. J.

Lovell,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\n\nDear Mr. Lovell,\n\nI am writing to you with regard to Miss Faithful, who has been seriously ill in Saskatoon Hospital.\n\nWhen she left Shoal Lake in October, she had enough money to carry her through the winter, and as the Bishop of Saskatoon had offered her a school in the Spring, she thought all would be well. But she had to go to hospital three times during the winter. She was able to pay the bill on the first two occasions, but the bill for the last visit, which was the longest, amounts to just over $80.00 and there are doctors' fees for treatment in addition.\n\nI wrote to Dr. D.K. Balsan, Macmillan Building, Saskatoon about her condition, and he replied that there is no way of telling when she might expect one of the embarrassing and sometimes serious attacks of asthma, and that it would be very unsafe for her to assume a position where medical assistance is not readily available; and under the circumstances it would be very much better for her to be retired.\n\nMiss Faithful herself feels that she is not in a fit state of health to take up work for the present.\n\nNow we come to the question of what happens when a Government employee who is not on a pension fund, breaks down in health, spends all her money on hospital bills, and still needs further treatment, and also something to live on. There are friends who would be pleased to give her hospitality for some time, but at present she has to continue the treatment in Saskatoon.\n\nDo you think the Department of Indian Affairs, would pay the hospital bills?\n\nWhen nominating her successor at Shoal Lake, I told the Department about the necessity of sending her out by airplane, and enclosed the bill. But they evidently thought I ought to pay it, as I sent for the plane. So I paid it, and I am glad I did this, as I think getting her to hospital easily and quickly, saved her life. One night in hospital, during this last attack, they did not think she would pull through the night. The plane cost $56.00. Now there is this $80.00 to be found somewhere.\n\nI should be glad of your advice as to what is the best thing to do, and I should be grateful if you could see your way to urge the Department to help with the hospital bills.\n\nThanking you for whatever help you can give,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Signed) W.J. Paul.\n\nP.S. I think the Department appreciate what Miss Faithful did at Little Pines Reserve, where she helped to build up one of the best Indian Day Schools in the Province. She worked there for many years.\nDear Sir,\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter I have received from the Ven. W.S. Paul, Prince Albert, Sask. in connection with Miss I.M. Faithful, which is self explanatory. Miss Faithful was the day school teacher at Shoal Lake until October, 1936, when she had to leave because of sickness.\n\nI do not know what is the Department's policy in such cases or if it is possible to do anything for Miss Faithful.\n\nI strongly recommend that something be done for Miss Faithful if it is in the Department's power to do so. She was indeed a good and conscientious worker while in this Agency and the Indians of Shoal Lake Band miss her very much.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 9th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, enclosing copy of letter received from Ven. Archdeacon W.H.J. Paul, with reference to Miss I. N. Faithfull, former teacher of the Shoal Lake Indian Day School.\n\nWhile the Department regrets very much that she is financially embarrassed owing to her long illness, at the same time I would point out that, as you are aware, no financial provision is made which would permit us to make an annual payment to teachers who have retired from our service. If Miss Faithfull has taught for at least ten years in Indian day schools, it might be possible to arrange to give her a retiring allowance of two months' salary. However, payment of this would preclude her again being engaged in Indian work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hesey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nS.

Ch File 117561-7\n\nThe School building, a Chapel rented by the Department from the church authorities requires considerable repairs and improvements to make it comfortable for the children attending. These have been repeatedly pointed out but as in the case of the Red Earth School, nothing has been done.\n\nSgd. Fred Fischer,\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, Sept. 8th., 1911.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,-\n\nIt has been reported to the Department that the building used for the school on the Red Earth Reserve is in a very dilapidated condition. The roof leaks and when it rains water drips all over the floor. Mortar is falling off the walls and there is no chimney; the stove pipe simply goes through the roof and is liable to cause the destruction of the building by fire at any time. There is neither porch nor double windows.\n\nAs Your Lordship is aware the Department pays an annual rental of $40.00 for this and also for the Shoal Lake and Moose Lake school buildings. The Shoal Lake building also requires repairs, and it is stated that this matter has been repeatedly brought to the attention of the Church authorities but that no action has been taken. I would ask Your Lordship to see that these buildings are put in such a state of repair that they will be at least habitable, as if this is not done the Department will be forced to discontinue the payment of any further rental.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAss't Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRight Rev. J. A. Newham, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nOttawa, Sept. 5th., 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your report upon the Shoal Lake School for the month of July I beg to say that the Department is communicat-\ning with Bishop Newham along the lines indicated in letter of today's date in regard to the Red Earth School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nFred Fischer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLe Pas, N.W.T.\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform the Department that on our Annuity Payment trip I looked over the Lower Fairford Indian Day School carefully and found that there is no use repairing the school as the logs are very badly decayed. When the school was built it was plastered inside and outside while the logs were green and the result was that they decayed in half the time that they would have had they been dry. If anything is done it will have to be in the way of a new building.\n\nIf the Department entertain the idea of building a Boarding School at this point, there would be no need of a Day School. If not, I might say that this would be an excellent location for an improved Day School. Mr. Colin Sanderson, the present teacher, would not be able to take charge of such a school, but there ought to be no difficulty in getting suitable people to take charge as the school is only four miles from the Railway.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6247, file 541-5, part 1)\nExtract from letter of the Bishop of Saskatchewan, dated September 11, 1911, re Shoal Lake School. File loc 927-5.\n\nThe matter of repairs has not been repeatedly brought to the attention of the church authorities. As a matter of fact the school was closed for a year or two and only lately re-opened. Here also the people are putting up a new building and wish to abandon the old one. I was there last month and went into the matter thoroughly. They are going to set about it at once, I believe. It is a difficult situation but I believe the people are in earnest about it, and I have promised them some financial help. I trust this will satisfy you.\n\nI remain\n\nYours faithfully\n\n(Sgd.) J.A. Saskatchewan.\nExtract from Report of Mr S.J. Jackson, Inspector of Indian Agencies and Reserves, on the Schools in the Lake Manitoba Inspectorate, for the year ended March 31, 1912.\n\nSHOAL LAKE, (Church of England)\n\nThe school building belongs to the Church of England, is built of logs and is in a very bad state of repair. There is a steep roof with no ceiling inside, and it is very cold in the winter. The roof leaks in several spots, and you can see daylight in a number of places. There are three windows, but no double windows or porch for the winter.\n\nThere is no chimney, but the stove pipe runs through the roof. This building in its present condition, is not fit for a school, and the Church of England should be notified to make the class-room habitable, as I understand they are receiving $10.00 a month for the use of the same.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nSgd. S.J. Jackson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nSir,\n\nIn connection with my report on Shoal Lake Day School I would recommend that a new school be built on this reserve. During treaty payments and at our band meeting the subject was brought up by Chief Albert Moore, and enlarged upon by several members of the band. They argued that the present building was unfit for school purposes, and I must uphold this argument. The building is log, and was built by the Church some 20 years ago. The roof is poor and daylight seen in many places. The Indians will get out logs and build the walls free of charge if the Department will finish the building; $800.00 would be ample for this purpose. It would not be necessary to employ a contractor to finish as the Indians will be able to do this.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can.\nOttawa, September 27, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo in reference to the erection of a new school building at Shoal Lake.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that if the Indians are prepared to do all the labour the Department will furnish the material and pay for it upon receipt of vouchers and you may authorize the work to be proceeded with at once. Kindly advise the Department if this is satisfactory and when you authorize the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. MOLERA\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. R. Taylor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nRefering to Department letter No. 117561/5 dated Sept. 5th, 1913, regarding the day School building at Shoal Lake, I beg to say that the Indians are willing to do all the work on the school, but they expect a small wage for their work. They will not expect regular carpenter's wages, but I think $1.50 per day would satisfy them. I think it advisable to pay them this wage as an encouragement to better things.\n\nIn my letter of August 23rd, I stated that the Indians would get out logs and build the walls free of charge to the Department. This they have already done. The work of completing the building cannot be done till summer when the boats go up the river.\n\nKindly let me know at an early date if the Department will give the men working at the building the small wage asked for.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can.\nOttawa, March 3, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo stating that the Indians of Shoal Lake have put up the frame of a log school building, which they intend to finish in the spring as soon as material can be taken in, and asking that the Indians employed in this work should be allowed a wage of $1.50 a day while engaged in doing the necessary carpenter work in this building.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will consent to pay them this rate of wages. You should see that the work is pushed on with reasonable expedition after it is commenced and that it is done in a workmanlike manner. As you have been informed, vouchers for the material should be sent in accompanied by pay lists for the wages and both should be certified by you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst.

These Indians are pretty hard up and it would be some assistance to them, enabling them to earn a little for themselves. Freight per cwt. to Shoal Lake will be $1.75 and to Red Earth $2.00.\n\nI would ask that they be allowed to do this. I also suggested that Red Earth Indians should do likewise, to which they agreed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can.\nOttawa, February 3, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd ultimo, with reference to paying the Indians for freight, lumber and material for the schools on the Shoal Lake and Red Earth Reserves.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that before authorizing this payment the Department will require further explanations from you. On March 3, 1914 you were authorized to employ Indians at the rate of $1.50 per day to do the necessary carpenter work at the Shoal Lake school. The Department has paid the accounts forwarded by you for the lumber for this school. It would seem that the lumber paid for has already been delivered at Shoal Lake, and the Department cannot understand why any further payment for freight should be made.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nW.

Taylor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLe Pas,\nMan.\nSir,\n\nReplying to Department letter No. 117561-5 dated 3rd inst., regarding freighting lumber for schools to Shoal Lake and Red Earth, I beg to say that in writing about this I neglected to explain the reason why this lumber was not taken up last summer. First, the Carrot River was blocked up with the H.B.Railway ties, when water was sufficiently high for navigation. When the ties were cleared out the water had fallen so low that even our treaty launch could hardly get up. The Ross Navigation Co. who handle this freight did not get up the river at all, but sent some of the Indian Department supplies up by canoes. The rest was sent up by team this winter. All freight for the Hudson's Bay Co. was taken up by team this winter as they could not get it up by boat. I mention this to show that the fault was neither the Transportation Company's nor mine. The lumber therefore could not be taken up and is still here in store.\n\nThe Indians asked me for this work which would be the means of helping them along this hard winter. It will cost more, freighting it in winter, but we may be up against the same proposition next summer, as there is very little snow this winter.\n\nI trust therefore that the Department will allow this work to be done by the respective bands.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can.\nOttawa, February 19th, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, explaining why the lumber for the Shoal Lake school was not taken up last summer.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that the Department considers that it would be too expensive to have this lumber freighted this winter and you should, therefore, send it by boat when navigation opens in the spring.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

There is an overflow of the available seats there now and I would recommend that the seats be supplied.\n\nThe school started on August 2nd, last for this term.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nAsst Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 9, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant, in which you requisition for four double desks for the Shoal Lake Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that in your letter of February the 19th, last, you stated that you would ascertain if there were any seats in the old school which was closed at Moose Lake and, if so, you would have them transferred to the Shoal Lake School.\n\nYou should state whether any of the desks at Moose Lake are in good condition and could be transferred to the Shoal Lake School; if not, you should state the present make of desks in use in this school, in order that, if new desks are required, they can be of the same type as those at present in the school. The size of the desks required should be stated and, if it is not possible to give the sizes, the ages of the children for which they are required should be stated. You should also give full shipping directions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. W.

In any case, these old seats would not stand shipment.\n\nThe teacher at Shoal Lake School reports that his desks are made by the C. O. & School Furniture Company, at Preston, Ontario, and the sizes he requires are for children about ten years old. The seats should be shipped by freight in care of myself.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 14, 1920.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nI have to request that you will be good enough to advise the Department whether you have any agencies for the sale of your school desks in the province of Manitoba, and, if not, kindly state the name of your nearest representative. I should also be pleased if you would request that quotations be forwarded, giving the very best prices possible for the supplying of your school desks to the Indian schools in Manitoba.

He states that there is an overflow of children and the present seating accommodation is not sufficient. The desks at present in use at the school are manufactured by The Canadian Office and School Furniture Co., Limited, Preston, Ont., and he asks that a similar type of desk be supplied. The Canadian Office and School Furniture Co. have quoted prices.\n\nThe desks required are known as double entire, size No. 4, and the price quoted by the above firm is $11.05 each, f.o.b. Preston, less a discount of 5%, and freight from Preston, Ont., to The Pas, Manitoba.\n\nI shall be pleased to be informed whether the order for these four desks may be given to the above firm. The total cost would be $44.20, less 5%, and freight added. These desks could, no doubt, be shipped in a knock down condition, which would save shipping space and freight charges, and they could be assembled and put together when they arrive at the school. If ordered, they should be shipped by freight to Mr. Agent Waddy, The Pas.\n\nFunds can be provided from the vote for Indian Education.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The desks will be shipped in a knock down condition, in order to save shipping space and freight charges, and they can be assembled and put together when they arrive at the school.

I may say that the price quoted for these desks is $11.05 each, f.o.b. Preston, less a discount of 5%.\n\nIt is hoped that, when these desks have been set up, they will provide ample seating accommodation for all the Indian children who will attend the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Until now, I have not heard anything back from them. I have also written to the Secretary of State about the situation.\n\nI am writing to you today to ask if there would be any payment in cooking for the children. I have heard that there would be no payment, so I put this before the women of this reserve and they said that they would do the cooking and earn a chance of getting a small allowance to do any work for the winter.\n\nThey cook two women for each day, and they have been doing this right along ever since the 1st of October. November and are looking a bit interested in it, they bring...\nwhatever goods their husbands can supply to them, the children eat potatoes - turnips - carrots - onion soup - meat, mixed with the supplies that the department have sent to them.\n\nCould the department afford to send these four willing working women (Says) a cheque for $20.00 for the winter? Or some of you wish there are 13 of them in all.\n\nHoping that this request be granted,\n\nYour Servant,\n\nJames J. Daniel\n\nShould Lake Sokk\n\nP.S.

Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nOttawa, December 28th, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from Mr. Francis J. Daniels, Teacher of the Shoal Lake Indian Day School, in which he requests that payment be made to the Indian women who assist in the cooking and serving of the mid-day lunch to the pupils of the school. He states that, since the first of October last, he has arranged with two Indian women each day to do this work and suggests that a cheque to the amount of $20.00 be sent him to be divided among these women.\n\nI should be pleased to have a report from you regarding this request and whether you would recommend that any payment for this service be made or not. If so, you should forward a properly certified voucher for the amount which you consider would be a fair remuneration for any work performed by the Indian women. We are informing Mr. Daniels that this matter is being referred to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. W.

Daniels the teacher at the day school at Shoal Lake reserve for a grant as payment to the women helping to cook and serve the luncheons to the pupils at that place I beg to state that Mr. Daniels in his original letter to me asking for supplies for luncheons states \"THE WIFE AND I ARE ONLY TOO EAGER TO DO THE COOKING OVER NIGHT FOR THE NEXT DAYS USE\". These people are always eager to start anything but generally fall down in accomplishment.\n\nWhen I was at Shoal Lake I was very much struck with the nice way in which the luncheons were handled, the women of the W.A. take turns in feeding the children, using the supplies we gave and also a lot of their own grub. I do not like starting a new system and not have it turn out successful, but if the Department is willing to allow the W.A. women at Shoal Lake $20.00 for services rendered, I will not oppose it, and enclose herewith voucher for Mrs. Robert Bear, Shoal Lake & this office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nJAN 10 1927\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is hoped to obtain an early nomination from the church authorities, and you will be advised of the name, salary, etc., of the teacher appointed.\n\nThe Department's attention has been drawn to the condition of the teacher's residence. This house has one room upstairs and one downstairs and is in poor repair; draughty and cold in winter, with a home-made door and no storm door or storm windows.\n\nI would request that you will arrange, as soon as possible, to have a storm door and storm windows made and installed on this building. Further, you may carry out any minor repairs considered necessary in order to make the building as comfortable as possible. No unnecessary expense should be incurred. Please forward itemized accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the work considered necessary by you.\n\nThere is no well at this school. It is considered too late in the season to arrange for digging a well, but you might bring this matter to the attention of the Department early next spring. At that time, you should give full information as to how you would advise the work be carried out and, if possible, the approximate cost.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nS. Lovell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nThe Pas, Man.,\nJune 23rd, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI would like to bring to your attention the condition of the school teacher's residence at Shoal Lake.\n\nIt is a very old log building, is rotten and full of vermin. It is impossible to do anything with it. The teacher Mr. C.E. Wilde is going to get married, I understand, during the holidays and wishes to bring his wife back to Shoal Lake, and he would like to know if there is any possibility of having a house built for him. I do not suppose this is possible, as you have previously stated there are no funds for other articles asked for.\n\nI would suggest the building the Department built for a Hospital and which has never been used be turned into a teacher's residence. It could be fixed up fairly well for $100.00. Could I have authority to do this? I might say that the teacher is at the present time living in the Hospital, as the residence is not fit to live in.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSamuel Lovell\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 29th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 23rd instant, you may expend an amount not exceeding $100 in repairing the building mentioned in your letter in order that it may serve as a residence for the teacher of the Shoal Lake Indian Day School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

(RG 10, Volume 6247, file 541-5, part 2)\nMr. J. Lovell,\nThe Pas Man.\nDear Sir:\n\nIt is with great regret that I am reporting the unfortunate loss. The building which we were using (the hospital) for a classroom was razed to the ground this afternoon at approximately 12:45 p.m. this day November 27th.\n\nThe moving of the classroom was agitated by the band due to the considered unsound condition of the present school building. It has decided that no further steps be taken for repairing the building and the moving of the classroom to another building until your arrival and pending your judgment. Another meeting was held two weeks ago about the school and your arrival unforeseen. It was decided that the band put free labor on the hospital building regarding necessary repairs and the moving of the classroom over. This was done on...\nOn Saturday, November 18th,\nI considered the motive behind\nthis was good and consented to the\nidea but not after awaited your\narrival. I did not write to notify\nyou of the change because we were\nexpecting you any day but when\nit got colder the change was made.\nThe building was certainly covered.\nThe old school building will\nhave to be braced in some way\nor another if it is to be in further\nservice.\n\nThe majority of the readers\nand the library was lost. Even\ndouble desks and the teacher's desk\ncould not be saved also the black-\nboards.\n\nI have enough readers and\nbooks with scribblers and pens\nto carry me through for the year\nbut the desks and blackboards\nwill be missed.\n\nWe will be awaiting your\narrival.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nS. Atkinson\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report received from the Rev. S. Atimoyoo, the teacher at Shoal Lake Indian Day School.\n\nThe building they had been using for a class-room was burned down on November 27th and with it most of the school equipment, including desks, blackboard, books, etc. This building that was burned down was one that was built some years ago to be used as a Hospital building for Indians of the Band who were sick. It was never used much for that purpose. They were using it as a classroom as they considered the old school room was in such a bad condition that it was dangerous and might fall down and injure someone at any time. However, since the \"hospital building\" has burned down, I have had them move back into the old school room, which I have had braced. With this bracing and the cold weather I do not think there is any danger at all until Spring. This building is absolutely done and we must have a new building next year if we are to carry on at all. A classroom has been requisitioned for in the estimates.\n\nIt will however be necessary to get the lumber and material on the ground during the winter if we are to build as soon as the fine weather arrives and we should also cut the logs this winter and move them to the building site. It will be practically impossible to transport either the logs or material after the warm weather comes. The Shoal Lake area is mostly swamps, the river is shallow and transportation during the summer months very difficult and practically impossible most of the time.\n\nI would like you to send me $100.00 accountable cheque in order to pay for the logs and would also request the material be bought as soon as possible so that it can be freighted to the site during the cold weather.\n\nS. Lovell, Indian Agent.\n**REQUISITION FOR CHEQUE**\n\nTO BE USED FOR ADVANCES OR AUTHORIZED PAYMENTS FOR WHICH THERE ARE NO ACCOUNTS\n\nDEPARTMENT: MINES & RESOURCES\nBRANCH: INDIAN AFFAIRS\nDATE: December 28, 1944\n\nAPPLICATION IS HEREBY MADE FOR THE ISSUE OF THE FOLLOWING CHEQUE OR CHEQUES:\n\n| CHEQUE NO. | IN FAVOUR OF | AMOUNT |\n|------------|--------------|--------|\n|            | The Pas Indian Agency Trust Account | $100.00 |\n\nSend cheque to:\nMr. S.

Lovell, Indian Agent, The Pas, Man.\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, with reference to the Shoal Lake Indian Day School. It is noted that the building being used for school purposes was destroyed by fire and that the old school is again being used.\n\nI realize from your letter the present condition of the Shoal Lake School, but at the present time I cannot see my way clear to promise definitely that we will be able to replace it next summer. If you forward a list of the materials that would be required, the matter will receive further consideration. In sending this list you should intimate if the materials can be purchased locally and, if so, the name and address of the person from whom they might be secured. I would also like to have an estimate of the amount required for labour. In the meantime you are being forwarded a cheque for $100 for the purchase of logs but, as stated above, it should be understood that we are not definitely promising a new school next year. This is due to conditions of which you are fully aware.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nIn reply to your letter 128-10-5, dated the 23rd ultimo, in connection with building a new school house at Shoal Lake.\n\nA list of materials required to build the school house was attached to the 1945-46 Estimates, in duplicate.\n\nI cannot express in too strong terms, the condition of this school. It is certainly not fit to live in and further it is so old and rotten that nothing could be done to improve it. The bottom logs are absolutely rotten. It is out of shape and if we tried to jack it up to put in new bottom logs the whole building would collapse. In fact I am afraid it might collapse anyway when the frost gets out of the ground. I have put braces up to prevent this. The Church authorities have inspected the school and are pressing for something to be done.\n\nI am aware of the difficulty of getting new construction, owing to the war. I can see no other way out of this difficulty. We will either have to provide a building or close this Day School.\n\nIn the meantime, in accordance with your instructions I will buy the logs and get them on the ground. The material, as I mentioned in my previous letter must be freighted in during the winter, consequently must be purchased during the next six weeks, otherwise I do not think I could get it in.\n\nS. Lowell,\nIndian Agent.\nEXD.\n\nOttawa, January 10, 1945.\n\nMr. S. Lovell, Indian Agent, The Pas, Manitoba.\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, with further reference to the necessity for erecting a new day school building at Shoal Lake.\n\nI note from your letter that a list of materials required for the erection of the school was attached to the 1945-46 Estimates. I have reviewed the copy of your estimates that we have at the office, but I am unable to locate the list of materials to which you refer. No doubt, you have a copy of this on your file, and it would be appreciated if you would forward it to me.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS AND RESOURCES**\n\n**REQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES**\n\nAugust 16th, 1944\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Indian Department\n\nVOTE: 76 Allotment: 23-492\n\nSHIP TO: Shoal Lake\n\nPurpose for which required: Building new school at Shoal Lake\n\nNOTE: Requisition for non-consumable equipment, state if New Issue or Replacement.\n\n| Quantity | Description                  | Unit Price | TOTAL   |\n|----------|------------------------------|------------|---------|\n| 10       | Lin.

Shoal Lake was shown as being the Band that needed a school the most, next Red Earth, then Nelson House United Church School, then Grand Rapids, then Cedar Lake, and finally Pine Bluff.\n\nShoal Lake and Red Earth prefabricated schools will have to be shipped by winter freight from Carrot River.\n\nCan you please advise?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.A. Bowman,\nA/Indian Agent.\n\ncc: A.G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba\nMarch 8, 1943.\n\nMr. T. A. Bowman, Acting Indian Agent,\nThe Pas, Manitoba.\n\nSheal Lake Indian Day School.\nRed Earth Indian Day School.\n\nIncluded in our 1948-49 estimates are sums for the erection of combined one-room day schools and teachers' residences at the above reserves.\n\nIt is presumed, from your letter of February 26 (file 114-125), that prefabricated buildings are recommended by you for both of these places. I would suggest, therefore, that you advise us as soon as the Nelson House School is erected and ready for occupancy, as to whether you would wish prefabricated buildings also at Sheal Lake and Red Earth.\n\nI would point out that the Nelson House School is without an attached teacher's residence. It is presumed that at Sheal Lake and Red Earth you would want the different plan of building provided. This other plan is for a one-room school with attached teacher's residence. North American Buildings, Limited, are providing one of these for Mr. Olson at Little Grand Rapids. It is suggested that you contact him directly and have his advice you as to the suitability of this plan for your requirements at Sheal Lake and Red Earth.\n\nBernard F.

Original on file 1-1-5.\n\nShoal Lake, Sask., and Red Earth, Sask., schools, both should be shipped direct to Carrot River, Sask., for onward transportation to Shoal Lake Reserve and Red Earth Reserve. These two schools should not be shipped until the winter as they will have to be hauled by caterpillar tractor over frozen swamps and lakes.\n\nIn connection with the above, see letter of June 29th to Assistant Agent Bowman on file 1-1-5.\nExtract from letter from Mr. Ostrander dated June 21st, 1948. Original on file 107-9-1.\n\nI examined the classroom and teacherage at the Red Earth Reserve. The classroom is an old log building and certainly no credit to the Department. The teacherage is very small, difficult to heat, and would not attract any teacher. School attendance is poor, partly because the school is situated at a point which is surrounded by water a great part of the year, and many of the children cannot reach the school for long periods because of the water, and partly because the Indians are trappers and do not seem to be much interested in education.\n\nI did not visit the Shoal Lake Day School as I was informed that it was closed, but Mr. J.R. Bell, in charge of the Sipaskat Rat Project, who resides at Red Earth, informed me that conditions at Shoal Lake are even worse than at Red Earth.\n\nBoth of these points are so situated that the erection of classrooms and teaching quarters at the two places is out of the question at the present time because of the cost.\nJune 28, 1948.\n\nMr. J.P.B.

In view of your comments concerning the Red Earth Reserve and the Shoal Lake Reserve and the possibility of educating these children at the Prince Albert Residential School, I would suggest that you write to Mr. Law at The Pas concerning your findings.\n\nBernard V.

Such articles have been supplied in some instances in the past.\n\nMr. Halkett is an Indian (Single) at present is cooking on a tin heater. His bed consists of a number of poles lashed together with rope.\n\nI do not see any reason why Mr. Halkett could not supply these furnishings himself. I am doubtful if he will do so.\n\nRegarding the water tank, this should be supplied. Water has to be hauled for some distance. The tank is needed for storage purposes in the teachers residence.\n\nThe prices were quoted by a Prince Albert firm. It is assumed these prices would be much the same at Carrot River, nearest railway point to Shoal Lake. There will be delivery freight charges to be added to the purchase price.\n\nE. S.

Frame construction. 35 pupils.  \n\nAccommodation for teacher at the Mission at present. No heating required.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF SITE AND CONDITIONS; SUBMIT PLAN; NORTH POINT;  \n\nNATURE OF SOIL, DRAINAGE REQUIREMENTS AND ANY OTHER PARTICULARS.  \n\nSite\u2014highest point on river, sandy soil\u2014no drainage required.  \n\nWATER SUPPLY: SYSTEM REQUIRED; SOURCE OF WATER, ETC.  \n\nFrom Shoal River, also shallow well on Mission property.\nSir,\n\nRe: 126-11-5\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 10th of January last and enclose herewith report on building data form, Shoal River Reserve.\n\nThe type of school erected at Little Saskatchewan Reserve last year, I consider ideal, and suitable for reserves. I have only a faint idea of the cost. The cost would be greater at an outlying place like Shoal River as freight is expensive. I beg to suggest that the freighting be contracted for. During the early spring a number of boats are tied up at the north end of the lake, awaiting for the ice to disappear and it is usually the middle of June before they make the trip to Winnipegosis. I believe the fishermen would be pleased to get work during this slack season.\n\nI wish to call the department's attention to the resident missionary's statement, that the school is built on Mission lands. He claims that the Mission property covers 42 acres. This land is the only logical place to build a school. It is high, dry and sandy, close to the river.\n\nThere are 22 Indians at school at the present time. During the winter months the attendance is increased by halfbreeds whose parents come in to fish; the attendance last winter totaled 36. I have estimated the pupilage at 35; it is very doubtful if the Indian child population will ever go over these figures.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6247, file 542-5, part 2)\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your recent letter enclosing building data form in connection with the proposed erection of a new day school on the Shoal River Reserve.\n\nI note that you suggest the same type of school as was erected at Little Saskatchewan Reserve. In this connection I may say that reports reaching the Minister's office indicate that some of the local people consider the Little Saskatchewan school too elaborate and too expensive for the district. Under these circumstances the Department does not wish to incur the same criticism in the event of erecting a school at Shoal River.\n\nI note that you suggest erection of the school by contract. This would probably mean that the school would cost as much as the Little Saskatchewan school.\n\nIs there any small saw mill close to the Shoal River school where the necessary lumber could be secured and thus avoid the cost of freighting which you state is quite expensive? In this event it might be possible for the school to be built by day labour in charge of a competent white foreman, employing Indians to do the other work.\n\nYou mention in the last paragraph of your letter that there are only 28 Indian children in the school at the present time and you also refer to the halfbreeds who attend the school during the winter. As you are\n\nJ. Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\naware this Department has no obligation to provide school facilities for halfbreeds. I am not certain from your letter whether in mentioning the pupilage of 35 you refer to Indian children only or to both Indians and halfbreeds. The 1934 census stated that there were 46 children between 7 and 16 years of age on the Shoal River Reserve and 40 children under 7 years of age. If these figures were correct it is quite possible that the Indian school population at the present time would be approximately 35 or even more.\n\nI note that you suggest erection of a school on land owned by the Anglican Church. Present regulations will not permit our approving this recommendation. It would be advisable for you to see the Church authorities and ascertain if they are prepared to convey to us, free of charge, sufficient land as a site for this school.\n\nIn view of the contents of this letter you should reconsider very carefully what procedure should be taken with regard to the erection of a school at Shoal River and forward to me a complete report at your earliest convenience.

I admit the school is very striking, and possibly does not conform to the generally accepted opinion of an Indian Reserve. In building a school at Shoal River, I strongly recommend a full basement and furnace. The basement is excellent if the teacher holds sewing classes or classes in manual training. It is also very useful for serving mid-day meals and can also be used as a play room on very severe days during the winter months. Some saving could be made in making the cloak rooms smaller and dispensing with the teachers' room altogether.\n\nOn the 27th ultimo I forwarded a letter received from one Mr. Glen Burrell of Mafeking, who will be operating a small saw mill approximately 20 miles from the reserve. Mr. Burrell is a fisherman during the fall and winter months, has a large boat for the freighting of the lumber, and is, I believe, a reliable man. A great saving would be made in the purchase of local lumber.\n\nThe Indians of this reserve are backward, although I believe the employment of a white foreman from the outside, and the employment of Indians for labouring would be cheaper.\n\nThere are 22 treaty Indian children attending school at the present time, and there will be an increase of the pupilage next fall term, and if no children are taken into residential school the attendance will approximate 30 next winter. All these will be treaty children.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nmatter regarding the land for the erection of the school is being taken up with the church authorities immediately, and a further report will be forwarded to the Department as soon as this is satisfactorily settled.\n\nThe Shoal River Reserve was visited on the 7th ultimo my report being forwarded as soon as I returned to the office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nMy dear Mr Waite:\n\nWe are very much pleased to learn from your letter of April 5th that the Department contemplates building a new Day School at Shoal River. I agree with you thoroughly that the present site is suitable in every way for the purpose, and the Diocese will gladly convey to the Department free of charge one acre of land, or more if considered necessary.\n\nI am,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBishop of Brandon.\nSir,\n\nRe:126-11-5.\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 29th ultimo, I beg to enclose herewith a letter received this date from the Bishop of Brandon in regard to the day school site, Shoal River Reserve.

Please let me know at once if you are prepared to undertake this. If so, plans of the building will be forwarded to you and arrangements made to purchase the material. The Department will also advise you of the name of the white foreman and Indians can be engaged to assist him.\n\nPlease let me know for what amount Glen Burrel, mentioned in your letter of March 27, would supply the lumber which he states he has on hand. You might also advise how soon he would be able to deliver it.\n\nAn early reply would be appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ.

It is understood, of course, that Indian labour to the fullest extent possible will be used.\n\nI am anxious, therefore, that you should take immediate steps to arrange for the construction of this school. You are authorized to engage Mr. William Poulsen, of Swan River, Manitoba, as foreman carpenter, and to consult Mr. Wm. Morrison, of Mafeking, Manitoba, with respect to any additional white labour that may be required.\n\nI have secured from the Surveys and Engineering Branch a copy of certain plans which may prove helpful to the man in charge of construction. It is just possible, of course, that he may have to depart from the plans in certain particulars to meet local conditions. I feel confident, however, that you will experience little difficulty in establishing a school to meet the needs of the Indian population on the reserve.\n\nThe sum of $4,000 is included in the estimates of this year for the construction of this school. If it is at all possible, I should like to see expenditures kept to this amount. The plans will be sent forward under separate cover.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

In reply to the letter I beg to report that I interviewed Mr. Poulson at Swan River on the 28th and 30th and he is ready to start work constructing the school as soon as the materials are on the job. I proceeded to Mr. Burrell's on the 29th, and had to wait until 7.30 in the evening for Mr. Burrell to return from fishing. He then informed me that he had received no order for lumber from the Department and had recently sold all his lumber to outside firms. He claims to have 125,000 feet of lumber in the bush. This he intends to saw into lumber sometime next month, but this would not be properly seasoned until next mid-summer. To ship in lumber would be a very expensive proposition, as the nearest point would be Swan River and this would mean trucking to the Red Deer River and boat freight from there to Shoal River. I beg to suggest that the building of this school be held over until next year. This would allow the material to be purchased during the coming winter, and freighted on ice to the building site. This would be the cheapest form of freighting. It is my opinion that Burrell, although honest, is not entirely reliable, and any dealings the Department have with him should be in such form that the lumber will be delivered on the job at a specified time. The lumber business, with him, is a side line and unless held to a delivery date the material would be delivered at his convenience. On my return to Swan River I informed Mr. Poulson that the material was not on the job, and\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nHe was advised not to turn down any work until he received definite word that the school would be constructed; he had previously informed me that he had held several contracts in obedience pending word from the Department about the construction of the School at Shoal River. I also interviewed Mr. Morrison at Mafeking, while in the district, and was advised that there are no carpenters in the Mafeking district and I was directed to submit the names of assistant carpenter, bricklayer and painter to him for approval.

Mafeking is the last siding on the line convenient to railroad freight. From that point truck freighting will be necessary to the Red Deer River and from there by boat to Shoal River.\n\nI am also writing Mr. Poulson informing him that the building of the school will be proceeded with this year.

You can not load a boat at Red Deer River and get it out into the lake and the same thing applies to the other way my wharf has been dredged and the road is fair. I can haul it for fifteen dollars a trip from Bowman to my wharf and I can take it from there to Shoal River for one hundred and twenty dollars. I expect to take around four ton a trip with the truck if possible.\n\nYours Truly,\nEllen Burrell.\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\n\nSeptember 22, 1939.\n\nSir,\n\nRe: 126-11-5\n\nI beg to refer to my letter of the 11th instant, and enclose herewith a letter received from Mr. Glen Burrell, this date, in connection with the freighting of materials for the erection of the school, Shoal River Reserve.\n\nSince my letter of the 11th, I have learned that the Red Deer River at the wharf is too shallow for power boats, and the only dredged channel is at Burrell's wharf. This wharf is approximately 26 miles from Mafeking.\n\nOn receipt of Mr. Burrell's letter I telephoned the Monarch Lumber Company and they agree to freight the material by truck from Mafeking to Burrell's dock at the price quoted i.e., $1786.20. This is a much better price than that quoted by Burrell.\n\nI beg to suggest, that if the Monarch Lumber Company's tender is accepted the material be hauled to Burrell's dock and then transported from there by Burrell at his tender of $120.00. The boat will only be able to dock at the mouth of the Shoal River and there will be an additional cost of Indian freighting from the mouth of the Shoal River to the Mission. A distance of approximately one and a half miles.\n\nI beg to attach hereto a sketch showing the route which will give some idea of the freighting problem.\n\nWith further reference to my letter of the 11th, I enclose herewith a letter received recently from one J.D.

The amount of $2000.00 which you have received to cover wages should be returned to the Department at once.\n\nI note from your letter that the material is now being delivered to the Reserve. Please let me know what arrangements you have made to have it properly stored in order that none of it may be stolen.\n\nAt the present time I am not in a position to state whether or not funds will be available in our appropriation for the fiscal year 1940-41 to erect this building. Consequently it may be necessary to store the material for some time and, therefore, I will expect very definite information from you regarding the steps that you have taken to protect the material.\n\nThe Department cannot help but feel that if it had not been for the delay in your office this building would have been completed this year when funds were available. The first letter regarding this building was sent to you on January 10, 1939, and your reply to this letter did not reach the Department until March 27, over three months later. Considerable time was, therefore, lost which, if used, would have permitted the materials to be purchased at a much earlier date than they eventually were.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

In reply I wish to report that all the material is now delivered to the reserve the lumber being piled on the site. The cement is stored in the present day school together with the windows. I found it necessary to rent a house from an Indian for the storing of wall board, paint, bricks and other ready removable materials. The cost of renting the building will be $1.00 per month. The lumber is in view of the teacher during school hours and I don't feel that there is any likelihood of any lumber being stolen. The material at the school and at the Indian house will be under lock, the key will be kept by the school teacher.\n\nIf the work of building is not carried out early in the spring it will be necessary to re-pile all the lumber. This should be done before the heavy spring rains. There is no building, on the reserve, to hold all materials, as all houses, except the one mentioned are occupied.\n\nAs previously mentioned, all the material is on the building site, and there will be no additional cost of hauling.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 16, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 12th instant with reference to storing of the materials purchased for the erection of a new school on the Shoal River Reserve.

In reply I wish to advise that usually the north end of Lake Winnipegosis is not free of ice until around the 20th - 24th of May, and at the present time the ice is not safe to travel. I am in touch with the storekeeper at Pelican Rapids, and he will advise me as soon as the lake is free of ice. The Indians will be returning from trapping as soon as the lake is open and will then be free to do any work on the construction they are able. The Indians of this reserve are not good carpenters.\n\nThe site of the school has been decided upon. It is quite close to the old school. Some clearing of brush will have to be done, possibly one day's work.\n\nI am writing Mr. Poulson by even mail with regard to the work and will see him when I visit the reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPAY TO: James Kematch,\nADDRESS: Shoal River Indian Reserve,\nPELICAN RAPIDS, P.O.,\nVia Mafeking, Manitoba.\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| April 30 | To Rent of house for storing building material for the new Shoal River Indian Day School during the month of April 1940. | 1.00 |\n\nCode: 76\n\nAuthority: Department letter 126-11-5 dated February 16th 1940.\n\nTRIPLICATE FOR FILE\n\nVoucher in attached for Accountant to pay.\n\nONE----------XX/100 Dollars.\n\nTOTAL 1.00\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 506\nR. 0331\n\nAgent\n\nVoucher No.: K 90\n\nDATE: May 14th 1940.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nOffice of the Portage la Prairie Indian Agency,\n\nMay 14th 1940.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos.

I would be pleased to receive an accountable cheque to cover the cost of labour on the building.\n\nI also wish to advise the Department that in my letter of the 2nd ultimo I asked for $150.00 for contingencies, and received only $75.00 of this amount on the 12th idem.

Mr. Poulson made the trip with me and will be returning to the reserve, with the treaty party, on the 16th. It is expected that the building will be finished by the end of July or the first week in August. I beg to make request that an accountable cheque for $500.00, to pay the cost of labour etc., reach me at Portage by Saturday, June 15th, otherwise an indefinite delay in the commencement of construction of the building will result, as labour will have to be paid for. The work of construction will be carried out by Mr. Poulson with the help of Indians. He expects to get along without the hiring of additional white help. His wages will be .80\u00a2 per hour. The Indians will be paid at the rate of .25\u00a2 per hour on carpenter work; the digging of the basement .20\u00a2 per hour. I also interviewed Mr. Leggatt at Swan River. He will be ready to paint as soon as the school of completed and I will arrange to take him up. His charge will be .50\u00a2 per hour and he also will employ Indian help.\n\nThe following additional will have to be purchased, and I would request authority to buy same:\n\n1-roll of hay wire (for holding forms)\n4-3\u00bd\" paint brushes (for Indian use painting)\n1-slush scraper (approximately $12.00)\n\nI would also like to take out the window next to the chimney as this is liable to make cross lighting, and substitute two small ventilating windows high up in the classroom. There would be no additional cost for the small windows, the lumber firm would agree to make a trade. The only cost would be - 2 pairs of 2\"\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nbutts\nbutts and two 6' chains with transome bars.\n\nI also suggest that the old school be torn down and the lumber in the ceiling be used to build two new toilets. The cost would be the carpenters time. Two pairs of 5\" \"T\" hinges and two thumb latches would have to be purchased.\n\nSeven Indians were used for the digging of the basement and in all probability four will be kept on during the greater part of the erection of the building. Three Indians were used for clearing the site of bush, and later a team and two Indians will be hired to pull out stumps in the school yard. The painting will occupy two Indians.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJune 11, 1940.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 8th instant regarding the erection of the school on the Shoal River Reserve a cheque for $1000.00 for labour has already been forwarded to you.

A32279\n\nADDRESS: Labour building new Indian Day School at the Shoal River Reserve.\n\nDATE 1940\n\nSERVICE\n\nJuly 6 To Labour building new Indian day school at the Shoal River Reserve, as per labour sheets attached.\n\nAMOUNT\n\nCode: 76-13-491\n\nCheque A32279 - $1,000.00\nVoucher K 5D1 (attached) - 617.00\n\nBalance to be accounted for.\n\nDepartment letter 126-11-5\nApril 26th 1940.\n\nSix hundred and seventeen---xx/100 Dollars\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 506\n\nVoucher No. K 501\n\nDate: August 3rd 1940.\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\n\nAugust 3, 1940.\n\nI beg to advise that I returned from a visit to the Shoal River School, yesterday and have to report as follows.\n\nThe carpenter work at the school will not be completed until the 20th. of the month, and the painter will be ready to move in at that time. Work sheets are enclosed herewith in an amount of $617.10, and the balance left in Mr. Poulsen's hands was $153.00. The difference is made up by labour sheets incompleted, as there would not be sufficient money to continue paying the Indians for their work and also pay Mr. Poulsen's wages. A further $500.00 is required. This is made up as follows:\n\n- Mr. Poulsen, wages: $300.00\n- Painting, estimated: $150.00\n- Clearing grounds etc.: $50.00\n\n$500.00\n\nThere will also be a few outstanding accounts, pails, posts and additional nails amounting to approximately $9.00. I also had to purchase hinges for cupboards, screen buttons and screws, approximate cost $2.18.\n\nThere was only sufficient grey paint for the outside of the building, no trim. There is no paint for the inside and I am informed that the \"Donnacona\" board should be painted as soon as it is put on the wall. The following quantities of paint are required if the building is to be completed.\n\n- 8-gals. flat wall paint (inside painting) white.\n- 2- \" white paint for outside trim.\n- 3- \" shingle stain (black)\n- 10- lbs powdered glue (sizing for walls)\n- 1- gal. oil.\nAddition shingle stain is asked for as the painter considers there is not enough on hand to cover roofs of building and porches.\n\nThe materials and accountable cheque should reach me as soon as possible as I intend to again visit the reserve on the 20th of the month.\n\nThe materials, if purchased from Ottawa, should be addressed as follows:\n\nMr. Wm. Poulsen,\nC/O Mr. Isaac Bradburry,\nMafeking, Manitoba.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nAPPLICATION IS HEREBY MADE FOR THE ISSUE OF THE FOLLOWING CHEQUE OR CHEQUES:\n\n| CHEQUE No. | IN FAVOUR OF | AMOUNT |\n|------------|--------------|--------|\n|            | Portage la Prairie Indian Agency Trust Account | $500.00 |\n\nSend cheque to:\nMr. J.

(RG 10, Volume 6247, file 542-5, part 2)\nOttawa,\nAugust 6, 1940.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd instant arrangements will be made to forward you an additional cheque for $500.00 in connection with the Shoal River School.\n\nWhen this cheque is issued it will mean that you will have been sent $1500.00 which is the total amount provided in the current year's appropriation for this building. Consequently it must be completed within that amount. It is noted that you still have $153.00 on hand and with the remaining $500.00 you will have a total of $653.00 which, I believe, should be sufficient.\n\nYou may purchase from a firm on the approved list the following articles:\n\n8 Gals. flat wall paint (inside painting) white\n2 \" white paint for outside trim\n3 \" shingle stain (black)\n10 Lbs. powdered glue (sizing for walls)\n1 Gal. oil\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. J. Waite,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nAugust 28, 1940.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 26th instant in which you intimate that the Shoal River Indian Day School has been constructed and that a man is now engaged in the painting of the building.\n\nI note also that the Monarch Lumber Company have delivered the materials necessary for the construction of a teacher's residence at the Waterhen Reserve.\n\nI regret to state that it will not be possible to accept your suggestion and have Mr. Poulsen superintend the construction of this building. The files here indicate that authority was granted by the Minister's office on July 9 to employ Paul Dufault of Skownan, Man., as carpenter-foreman on this job.\n\nIt is highly desirable that this work should be undertaken and completed at an early date. A cheque for $700.00 to cover the cost of labour will reach you in the course of a few days.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. J. Waite,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\n\nR.A.

The building is now ready for the furnace, and I beg to suggest that a pipeless furnace be installed. The roof should also be fitted with eaves-troughs otherwise the basement will be wet after every rain. This work could be done at the time the furnace is installed. It was found that a piece of blackboard was missing. The matter has been taken up with Mr. Glen Burrell and he has arranged the purchase of a new piece from the Monarch Lumber Co. Limited and arrangements have been made to have the piece fitted as soon as it is delivered to the reserve.\n\nThe enclosed snaps, taken before the building was painted, will give some idea of the construction. I wish to say that I consider all work well done. Both the carpenter and painter were high class workmen, reliable and honest and there was no hitch in the work from start to finish. Both men got along very well with the Indians.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 7th instant in which you state that the new Shoal River School is practically completed.

Please let me have this information as soon as possible and your recommendation will then receive further consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J.

The information and cut is enclosed herewith.\n\nA furnace, pipeless, with a heating capacity rating of 25,000 cubic feet would be ample for a building the size of the new Shoal River Day School. In asking for a pipeless furnace for this school, I have in mind the long distance from a tinsmith. A furnace with pipe heat conductors is dangerous as there is always a possibility of the children knocking them down in the course of play, and repair work would be expensive at a point so far from civilization.\n\nThe fire-box of the furnace shown is of ample size, 40 X 19 inches, a wood burner being required. The Gurney Company asked permission to quote a price and this price f.o.b. Mafeking, the nearest railway point to the reserve, is $235.85.\n\nMr. Poulsen informed me that there is a first class furnace man in Swan River who would be quite capable of installing the furnace. I would also be pleased to receive advice in regard to the installation of eavestroughing as this is very necessary if the cement basement is to be protected. The tinsmith could erect the eavestroughing at the time the furnace is installed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba\n\nSept. 24, 1940.\n\nSir,\n\nRe: 126-11-5\n\nWith further reference to Department letter of the 12th instant and also to my letter of today's date, I wish to advise that the following is the eavestroughing required for the Shoal River Day School.\n\n- 100 ft. 4\" eavestroughing\n- 20 \" 3\" conductor pipe\n- 4 ends 4\"\n- 4 conductor elbows 3\"\n- 2 corner mitre's (outside) 4\"\n- 60 sets ferrule and spikes\n\nThe approximate cost of the above would be $15.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nFile No. 126-11-5\n\nSeptember 26, 1940\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Shoal River Indian Day School.\n\nVOTE: 78 Allotment: 12-423\n\nSHIP TO: Mr. J.

Great difficulty has been experienced in opening the doors and there is nobody on the reserve or in the district that is capable of doing the work of refitting.\n\nI beg to suggest that at treaty payments on this reserve I be authorized to take a carpenter up with me so that this work may be done during the payment. The cost of sending a carpenter in would be very expensive as there would be car and boat charges. The cost, if the carpenter came in with the treaty party, would be the cost of actual labour. I would also suggest that Mr. Poulson, who built the school, be allowed to do the work.\n\nThe cement floor in the basement is affected with acid in the soils and sooner or later the floor will have to be refinished with cement. I would like Mr. Poulson's advice in regard to this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 20th instant, you may take a carpenter to Shoal River in order to make the necessary repairs to the school.

The machine asked for on her requisition is a Singer No. 404 Serial 127-3-404 and is of the treadle type. It was suggested this particular machine be bought as it is a heavy make and can stand the strain it will be subjected to.\n\nThe Shoal River Reserve School is very isolated and Mrs. Hicks is anxious to teach her girls sewing. Some of the younger women of the Reserve will also take instructions. The Singer Company representative here advises that the machine should cost the Department approximately $55.00. It will be a good investment.\n\nA.G.

(RG 10, Volume 6247, file 542-5, part 3)\nFebruary 11, 1949.\n\nW. G. Rhind, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Schools,\nSwan River, Manitoba.\n\nShoal River Indian Day School.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReceipt is acknowledged of your letter of January 31 enclosing the report of your inspection of the Shoal River Indian Day School and your expense account in this connection, which has been approved for payment.\n\nThe deficiencies of equipment and the need for certain repairs will be taken up with our local officials.\n\nIt is gratifying to receive your assurance that there is a good spirit in the school and that the children are making progress in their school work. Mrs. Hicks will be requested to increase her attention to the supervision of recreational activities.\n\nThe improvement of Mrs. Hicks' professional techniques presents a more difficult problem. I note that you have shown her as possessing six years' teaching experience and a permanent special permit for Manitoba. On her application for the position to which she was appointed on April 1, 1947, she claimed no actual teaching experience before that date and only an incomplete course of about three years at Kelvin Technical High School, Winnipeg. Doubtless she has received some advice on methods of teaching from her husband, but\nshe should, as you suggest, attend a summer course in Pedagogy if she is eligible for admission.\n\nThe present enrolment of thirty-six is three fewer than in September. Some children of the Roman Catholic faith from this reserve are attending the residential school at Pine Creek. As you make no mention of lack of accommodation for non-treaty children whose attendance it is desired to arrange, I infer that this problem has been satisfactorily solved.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nFebruary 11, 1949.\n\nMr. W. Cowans,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nDauphin, Manitoba.\n\nSheal River Indian Day School.\n\nWe have now received Mr. Rhind's inspection report on the above school and you will find attached copy of a letter to him concerning Mrs. Hicks' professional techniques.\n\nHe comments on the lack of library books at this school and I would ask that you ensure that we receive a library requisition from this school, in accordance with the February 1949 issue of the Bulletin.\n\nMr. Rhind also comments on the pupils' use of an open pail and having only three cups for drinking purposes.\n\nYou are therefore authorized to purchase for this school a small covered drinking receptacle such as can be purchased from Meyers or Christie School Supply catalogue. (If you have not already a catalogue from these school supply companies on hand, I would suggest that you write for them.) Their addresses are as follows:\n\nChristie School Supply Company, P.O. Box 300, Brandon, Man.\n\nMeyer School Supplies, Limited, Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nYou can also make local purchase of three dozen aluminum or plastic cups for use by these children.\nHe also comments on the need for interior decoration in this school. I would suggest that you prepare a requisition for the number of gallons of Kem-Tone or similar interior wall paint so that this work can be carried out either during the Easter or summer holidays by local Indian or other labour. We recommend that the room walls below blackboard level be painted field green and that a very pale green be used on the walls above blackboard level.\n\nThe use of Kem-Tone of course is only recommended where the walls are of wallboard or plaster.\n\nMr. Rhind also comments on the need for repairs in the basement and the fact that no flag was flying. It is presumed that we will hear from you in this regard.\n\nYou might also interview Mrs. Hicks as to the possibility of having her attend a short Summer School this year. Mr. Rhind advises that this is necessary if she is to bring these children along in accordance with the course of study.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F.

Davis, Esq.\nRegional Supervisor, Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nWm. Gowans.\nSuperintendent.\nDauphin Man.\nMarch 22nd, 1949\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nWith further reference to your letter File 543-1-5(E) dated February 11th 1949 I wish to advise you of the following:\n\nA. Mrs. Hicks has been requested to forward requisition for library books as mentioned.\n\nB. Drinking receptacle has been supplied and forwarded.\n\nC. Plastic cups ordered but hard to get.\n\nD. All paint required for the redecorating of this school has been shipped.\n\nE. With regards repairs to the basement of this school, I would advise that the school be moved to the west, or east, some 40 feet and put on a cement foundation without any basement this I believe is the only way in which we can get away from the high water level, which causes the basement to flood.\n\nIt would be possible to have the school moved to the other side of the reserve across the river, this of course would be a hardship on both the children and the teacher as they would have to supply a boat for this purpose, or have a bridge build for them.\n\nThen of course it would be a costly job to have the school moved to the other side of the river, there would be little or no shelter, I therefore feel that the school should not be moved but rather the action taken as mentioned above in (E).\n\nF. The question of Mrs. Hicks taking a short summer course was taken up with her on my last visit to that reserve, Mrs.\nColonel Neary:\n\n1. Trout River Day School:\n   - Basement: For several years this basement has been the cause of complaints of expense for \"bailing,\" \"repair,\" etc. High water seems to recur during the first half of May.\n\n   This school was built in 1941, about 100 yards from the church-owned teacherage which seems to be trouble-free.\n\n   Mr. Howans is experiencing his first spring in the district. Perhaps he should take another longer look when flood conditions recur and determine whether the basement can be drained or sealed. He has convinced himself that the best solution is to move the building off the basement, but that move will entail a different installation for heating.\n\n2. Teacher Training: It might be significant to discover what Mrs. Hicks' plans for this summer and next year are. Is there to be a time limit on the tenure of uncertificated teachers who neglect the opportunities that summer sessions afford?\n\nC.A.V. Clark\nApril 13, 1949.\n\nW. Gowans, Esq.,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nDauphin, Manitoba.\n\nRe: Shoal River Indian Day School\nRef. your 65-10 of March 22\n\nWe are pleased to note the progress made in rectifying the complaints noted by Mr. Rhind in his report on this school. We have noted your recommendation concerning the basement and wish to check the following facts:\n\n(1) This school is about one hundred yards from the church-owned teacherage which seems to have no \"basement difficulty\".\n\n(2) For several years the school basement has been the cause of complaint and of expense for baling, repairs, etc. This high water seems to occur during the first half of May.

B. Co.,\nN-rway House,\nW. Selkirk.\n\nRef. No. 63/G 7th, March 1906.\n\nThe Hon. D. Laird,\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your favour requesting information re Split Lake, Nelson River and Churchill Indians, I have to state that the Split Lake Indians number about 250 and get their living by hunting and fishing during the winter and working in the H. B. Coy's freighting boats during the summer.\n\nRoughly speaking their hunting grounds extend from the N. West to Waskowaga Lake then on to the junction of Little & Ot. O. Rivers, east to Limestone & Fox Rivers then in a line towards wintering lake. The Churchill River Indians number about 400 and get their living same as the Split Lake Band. I cannot define their hunting grounds but would be safe in estimating that they hunt about 60 miles in every direction from Nelson House, which would give you a circle about 120 miles in diameter with N. House as the centre.\n\nHaving heard that the Department to Nelson River to provide a school and a grant towards paying a teacher I beg to make application for the same favour to be extended to Split Lake in case the Indians do not get treaty this year.\n\nI would undertake to teach the school and there is a building which with a small utility could easily be used as a temporary school house. We would also need a grant of books, slates, pencils, ink and lesson charts.\n\n(Sd.) Chas. F. Pax, Anglican Missionary.\n\nP. S. We have had Indian school teaching the children in their own language since December and we have an average 20 and I am quite sure we would have this average all the year. In summer we would have about 60 on the roll.\n\n(Sd.) C.G.F.\nWinnipeg, 26th March, 1907.\n\nSir,\n\nNevertheless, a matter is brought up which might be attended to without delay, viz., the giving of a grant toward the maintenance of a school at Split Lake. The sum of $300.00 as in the case of other schools of the district, would be sufficient for the purpose at present, and if it is too late to place the amount in the Supplementary Estimates, I presume we could draw on the grants of other schools outside of Treaty limits of which we never hear about.\n\nIf the Department takes a favourable view of this suggestion, which I hope it will, I would like to be informed soon, in order that supplies such as school books, other school material and also a small supply of medicines, may be ordered in time to be shipped by the earliest opportunity.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSgd. D. Laird,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, April 4, 1907.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nThe Indian Commissioner has asked for a grant of $200 for the maintenance of a school at Split Lake, outside treaty limits, in the District of Keewatin, and he incloses a copy of a letter addressed to him by the Anglican missionary at that point, which shows that there are about 400 Indians in that portion of the District whose children were without any educational advantages until last December, when a school was started with an average of about 30 pupils.\n\nThe estimates for outside-treaty schools would bear this expenditure, as there are more provided for than are ever in operation, and it might be well to grant this request.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6247, file 543-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nIn reply to that portion of your letter of the 26th ult., in which you recommend that a grant be made for the maintenance of a school at Split Lake, I beg to say that your recommendation is approved, and the Department will allow the usual grant to this school, namely, $300.\n\nYou may also see that the school is supplied with the necessary material in the way of books, etc., as well as a small supply of medicines.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.

It would be a good thing if a teacher could new be appointed, and a school built. The missionary cannot act as school teacher. Will you kindly let me know what the Dept. are prepared to do. The same will apply to York Factory and Churchill if Treaty is made this year, as I understand it may be.\n\nJ. Keewatin.\nOttawa, April 18, 1910.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nReferring to that portion of Your Lordship's letter of the 9th instant in which you ask for the appointment of a school teacher and the erection of a building at Split Lake I beg to say that the Rev.

He is a capable teacher, and should be paid at the rate of $500 a year. Shall be glad to have your sanction for this, as he can come early in May. He has to come from Toronto. Will the Dept pay his travelling expenses?\n\nMr Aldous went in to Lac Seul some time ago, but owing to the early Spring was detained at the Soo Look Out, but in a letter to me a week ago he hoped to get through in a few days.\n\nBelieve me\n\nSincerely yours.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Semmens, who visited these posts during the last summer, will be written to and asked to submit his report at once. In the meantime any suggestions that Your Lordship may have to offer in regard to sites, style of building, method and means of construction, etc., will be gladly received.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

The Department would like to have this report at your earliest convenience.\n\nYou should also make a similar report on the situation at York Factory, keeping these reports separate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. Semmens,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 23rd re schools at Spit Lake and York Factory. I may say that at the latter place there is a good school belonging to the Hudson's Bay Co., but which has been used by the Mission for over twenty years. It would not be necessary to erect another, at least not at present, but they would require supplies etc.\n\nAt Split Lake there is no school, but one could very easily be erected of logs either on the Mission property or at some point suited near by. Mr. Fox our Missionary at this station would be the best judge as to this. This building could be constructed by the Indians, and made very comfortable. It might be necessary to make this large enough to accommodate the teacher under the same roof.\n\nThere should also be a school at Churchill. This could be built near the Mission, but as there is little or no building material to be got at or near C. this would have to be sent out either by the Hudson's Bay vessel, or by some government vessel.\n\nI remain\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6247, file 543-1, part 1)\nOttawa, December 24, 1910.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI beg to call your attention to official letter of April 18th, last, in reference to the erection of a schoolhouse at Split Lake and to state that the Department has had another communication from His Lordship the Bishop of Keewatin in regard to this matter. Kindly forward your report as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. Semmens,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir,\u2014The School situation at Split Lake requires attention at the earliest convenience of the Department. I found that school was being kept in a room of the Missionary's house and the Rev Mr Fox was conducting but was much hampered in his work by lack of proper accommodation.\n\nI had hoped to have a conversation with the Rev gentleman when I made the last summer payments but he was in Ontario on holiday and I was unable to see him.\n\nI regard him as the man who can be trusted to superintend the erection of the much needed building for School purposes.\n\nI have hesitated to make any special recommendation in the case of Split Lake because there are very few houses built in the vicinity of the Fort and Mission and the number of children who could attend in winter would be very few indeed. During the summer the Indians tent on the Hudson's Bay Company's grounds largely and children might attend then but the Missionary takes holidays at that season of the year. So that the early Fall seems to be about the only time when a full attendance might be expected.\n\nAnother feature of the case is presented by the fact that the Reserve has not yet been surveyed and the Indians are uncertain as to what the limits of their Reserve may be. They are hesitating to build until they know where they are safe in building. When this matter is settled but until then it would be difficult to locate the School.\n\nNo special pressure was brought to bear upon me on this subject of School building during the last summer. They mentioned the matter merely and said they expected the Government to keep faith with them on the question but they were in no way impatient.\nIn a matter like this I do not think that we should wait for the people to clamor for educational privileges. We should lead them rather than wait until they crowd us. I therefore recommend that steps be taken to erect a suitable school building forthwith. I would further urge the survey of the Reserve so as to determine the most suitable site. I am averse to placing the School on Mission Property. It must as the Department knows be near to the majority of the people.\n\nThe building when erected must of necessity be a log structure roofed with boards and covered with mica roofing. Freighting to Split Lake is expensive and must therefore be reduced to a minimum. Lumber must be cut on the ground and by hand. This can be done so that only windows nails and roofing material need to be purchased and freighted in.\n\nIn my best judgement the cost of a building at this point will be about $600.00 and I recommend that the contract be given to the Rev Mr Fox who is reliable and capable.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nJohn Summers\nInspector of Indian Agencies\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nCanada\nOttawa, January 9, 1911.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nReferring to that portion of Your Lordship's letter of the 9th ultimo in which you deal with the erection of a school-house at Split Lake I beg to say that the Department does not consider it expedient to proceed with the erection of a building until such time as a survey of the reserve is made. As soon as this work is done it will be possible to deal intelligently with the matter of the location of the school building.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRight Rev. J. Lofthouse, D.D.,\nBishop of Keewatin,\nKenora, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have to thank you for yours of the 9th inst Re Split Lake. I quite understand that the Dept cannot undertake any building until a survey has been made of the Reserve, but I do not think the Indians should be left without school any longer than is really necessary, and I am quite sure they would willingly put up a log building that would do for a school until such time as the Dept could see its way to erect a proper building.\n\nBelieve me Sincerely Yours.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

R. Bunn, Esq.,\nLake Winnipeg Inspectorate,\nWinnipeg.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Indians in Council assembled have asked me to approach the Department through you and beg that something more be done for them from an educational point of view.\n\nIn discussing the matter they pointed out the splendid buildings erected at Norway House, Cross Lake and The Pas, I have, at their request, asked the Department several times for a boarding school, but have been informed that there were no funds for this purpose.\n\nMight I suggest an improved day school and earnestly beg the Department to consider this. It would be an uplifting and very encouraging institution for the Indians, while not breaking up the home life and unfitting the children for life as Indians. We have 185 children of school age, about 100 boys and 85 girls. I can assure you Mr. Bunn the 95% of those would attend an improved day school in the summer, and if the Department saw their way to keep the school open during the winter, 50% could easily be induced to attend during the winter, as the men would leave their families on the Reserve while they went hunting. Then one good warm meal would mean so much to the young Indians who often have to go for days without a good meal.\n\nI have tried a day school but it was not a success. Then I have always impressed the parents with the fact that they must teach their\nChildren to read and write in their own language, this has been done to a certain extent, and most of our Indians can read and write in their own language.\n\nEducation must be a preparation for success in life, and an improved school would be this, under the conditions at Split Lake. The H. B. Ry. will be within 25 miles of Split Lake next summer so that material for school could easily be taken over land in winter and suitable building erected.\n\nBefore the railway came, it would have been a very great expense to the Department, and I can understand the Department hesitating before incurring the expense.\n\nHowever the reserve is now surveyed, and a school site allotted. Then there is a large plot of land given to the church part of which might be used for school site and farming operations so that the site would present no difficulty whatever.\n\nRealizing your kindness and immortality in dealing with everything connected with the welfare of the Indians. I hope you will see your way to consider this request and if possible present our needs to the Department for consideration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd.) C. G. Fox\n\non behalf of the Band.\nDuncan Campbell Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter that I received recently from the Rev C.G. Fox of Split Lake; it has occurred to me that by submitting a verbatim copy of this letter, you would be more fully informed about the matter that this letter refers to.\n\nThere is no doubt, but that I will have this matter up for a talk when I am at Split Lake this summer, and I am of the opinion that it would be a good thing for me to be able to convey to these people what the department may have in mind to do for them in the premises.\n\nI am satisfied that Mr Fox has a good knowledge of what he is stating, and that his summer school would be a very good one, and the winter school also fair.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nEnclosure.\nDear Sir,\n\nRe school at Split Lake\n\nWe are advised that there are quite a number of Indian children at Split Lake, and in addition one family of white children consisting of three or four of school age, and one or two half-breed children. This means that there are five or six children for whose education we are responsible.\n\nWe are told that the R.N.W.M.P. are being removed from Split Lake, and that their removal leaves vacant a good building which might be suitable for school purposes. I shall be glad to know whether you deem it feasible to cooperate with us in carrying on a school at that point, and if so, what terms you would suggest. In this case you could provide the building without additional expense.\n\nIn connection with Moose Lake where we own the building and furniture the number of Indian children is, roughly, fifty percent of the school enrolment; but at Split Lake our scholars will represent twenty-five percent of the enrolment.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Minister.\nOttawa, February 7, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo stating that you are advised that there are quite a number of Indian children at Split Lake and in addition one family of white children consisting of three of school age and one or two half-breed children and that you would be glad to know whether this Department would deem it feasible to cooperate with your department in carrying on a school at that point.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, before considering this matter, the Department would like to be advised as to how much it would be required to contribute towards this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

We should bear twenty-\nfive percent of the expenses of operation, but we would be\nprepared to assume one-third of the cost of operation.\n\nAt Moose Lake we have provided a modern building\nand equipment and the number of children who attend under\nan arrangement with your Department is about equal to the\nnumber of our own, and for this reason the agreement was\nmade to share the expenses of operation on an even basis\nat that point.\n\nWe shall be glad to make all necessary arrangements in\nconnection with the school, and to attend to the operation of it.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Fletcher\nDeputy Minister.\n\nRF-AB\nSir,\n\nWhile at Split Lake strong representations were made by the Indians, requesting that the Department supply a School, and they have guaranteed that from thirty to forty children would take advantage of it, there being seventy children of school age on this Reserve, but on account of the homes being fairly scattered, only about half of them would be able to attend School.\n\nI looked over the old Mounted Police Barracks which is a log building with a frame and rubberoid roof, and it is all in good shape, the only alteration that would be needed would be the interior partitions, as the downstairs is now divided into four rooms, besides this building there are two small storehouses, which would be very useful, as there is no building on this Reserve in which supplies can be stored. I was led to understand by the Manager of Hudson's Bay Co. that all these buildings, as well as the stoves and furniture in the Barracks, could be purchased very reasonable, from the Mtd. Police as they all have been taken away from this country, and have no further use for them. I would put the valuation on these at least $400.00, but think they could be purchased for $150.00 at the outside.\n\nSince my return there has been a missionary appointed to Split Lake, the Rev. W.H.J. Walters, who would be available as teacher.\n\nI would strongly recommend to the Department that steps be taken to establish a school on this Reser\nSir,\n\nReserve\n\nas these Indians are very ambitious, and on the whole are much superior to any of the Indians of any other Reserves, in this Agency.\n\nI have the honor to be.\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario\nAugust 14, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to previous correspondence in regard to the establishment of a school at Split Lake I beg to enclose herewith an extract from a letter from Mr. Agent Macdonald in regard to the building formerly occupied by the Royal North West Mounted Police and which can be used for school purposes.\n\nIn official letter of the 10th of May, 1917, you were informed that the Department would be glad if you would undertake to make the necessary arrangements for securing a teacher and opening the school and that it would pay two-thirds of the expenses of operation.

Mr. J.A. Campbell, M.P., at present Commissioner for Northern Manitoba, has been making some enquiries concerning the situation and I understand he has been up through that part of the country this Summer. I am writing his office for a report and shall write you again as soon as I have any definite information.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. Fletcher  \nDeputy Minister.\nThe Secretary  \nDepartment of Indian Affairs  \nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to your favor of August 14th last, we have been securing further information concerning the situation at Split Lake and, as far as we can learn, there are very few, if any, half-breed children at that point now. According to the Indian Agent, Mr. S.L. Macdonald, there may be four or five. When we took this matter up in 1917 Mr. Alex Flett was living there with some four or five children of school age, but he has since moved away.\n\nThe number of half-breed children in this case does not represent ten per cent of the number of children in the community, but we will be prepared to join with you on a basis of this Department paying 20 percent of the expenses of operation, your Department to provide the building and equipment. I believe it would be advisable for you to make all arrangements in connection with this school since the school population will consist so largely of those under your care, and to render your account to us quarterly for our share of the expense of operation.\n\nTrusting to hear from you in the matter, I am,\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

A. Campbell, M.P., at present commissioner for Northern Manitoba, has been making some inquiries concerning the situation and that you understood that he had been up through that part of the country this summer and would write his officer for a report and advise the Department as soon as you had any definite information.

Deputy and Secretary  \nDepartment of Indian Affairs  \nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to your favor of the 4th instant, I quote the following from a letter received from Mr. J.A. Campbell, M.P., shortly before I wrote you:\n\n\"There is really nothing new to report regarding the situation at Split Lake. Any information which Mr. MacDonald has is along the lines already given you that there are very few, if any, half-breed children there, probably four or five at the most. As I have already mentioned, the matter was taken up in the first place when Alex Plett was living there and he had a somewhat numerous family. There were also, I understand, other half-breed children there at the time, so it seemed in order to provide for their education but before any arrangements were made a number of these moved away, thus leaving very few. There are a large number of Indian children there, probably about seventy, and the English church and the Dominion authorities are now taking steps to establish a school there.\"\n\nYours truly,\n\nDeputy Minister.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn April 1916 Mr. J. P. Burns sent me to you an appeal from the Rev. C. G. Fox in regard to the Indians of Old Lake Man.\n\nFor many years we have desired to see a real good day school at that mission, and there is no denying the great need.\n\nOur present missionary in charge, the Rev. W. H. J. Walter, has on his own account begun a day school at the mission, and carried it on during the past summer, but he has been obliged to use the church as the only feasible building, and has no proper school material.\n\nI should be most grateful if you could put up a school building and establish an improved Day School.

We are\nnot anxious to have the missionary as\nschool teacher, but it is most difficult to\nget any properly qualified teacher in these\nplaces.\n\nSomething should be done at\nonce to make arrangements for the winter\nand a new building erected next summer.\n\nTrusting you will give this matter\nyour careful consideration.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6247, file 543-1, part 1)\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to the application from the Bishop of Keewatin for the establishment of an improved day school at Split Lake I beg to say that a day school was in operation there for three years from November, 1907, until the end of the December quarter, 1910, when the then teacher, the Rev. Mr. Fox, resigned. The school was not a success owing to the very low average attendance.\n\nIn the letter referred to by the Bishop from the Rev. Mr. Fox, which was sent to the Department in April, 1916, Mr. Fox suggested the establishment of an improved day school and pointed out that there were about one hundred children of school age there, the large majority of whom could attend during the summer. This letter was forwarded to the Department by Mr. Bunn, but no action was taken.\n\nThe next we hear of this school was in a communication from Mr. Fletcher, the Deputy Minister of Education for the province of Manitoba, who wrote on the 30th of January, 1917, that he was informed that there are a number of children of school age at Split Lake and also some white and half-breed children, for whose education they would be responsible. He wanted to know whether it would be feasible for this Department to co-operate with his Department in the establishment of a school there and, if so, on what terms.\n\nSeveral letters have passed between this Department and the Deputy Minister of Education for Manitoba and in a letter just received from Mr. Fletcher he quotes from a communication received from Mr. J. A. Campbell, M.P., at present Commissioner for Northern Manitoba, who had been making inquiries concerning the situation at Split Lake. Mr. Campbell states that there are very few, if any, half-breed children there, probably four or five at the most, but that there is a large number of Indian children, about seventy. He also states that the English Church and the Dominion...\nDominion authorities have now taken steps to establish a school there.\n\nThe Department was advised that there was a building formerly used as the Northwest Mounted Police Barracks at Split Lake which might be available for school purposes and application was made to the Comptroller of the Royal Northwest Mounted Police to find out whether the building referred to could be obtained for this purpose and, if so, on what terms. The Department was advised by the Mounted Police Department that the Minister had authorized the use of the building, rent free; provided it is kept in good repair and the necessary alterations made at the expense of this Department. This offer was confirmed by Order in Council dated the 4th of May, 1917.\n\nThe Bishop states that the Rev. Mr. Walter has, on his own account, begun a day school at the mission and carried it on during the past summer and that he is using the church, which is the only available building and that he has no proper school material.\n\nWe have had no returns showing the attendance, but, if there are enough pupils to warrant carrying on a school at this point, the Department would be justified in making use of the police barracks and furnishing the necessary school material and providing a salary for the teacher. When the school was previously in operation $200.00 was all that was allowed.\n\nMr. Agent Macdonald wrote the Department on the 1st of August, last, stating that while he was at Split Lake the Indians requested the Department to furnish them with a school and they guaranteed that from thirty to forty children would take advantage of it. The Agent reports that he looked over the Mounted Police Barracks and that very few alterations would be needed and that he was given to understand by the Manager of the Hudson's Bay Company that the stoves and furniture in the barracks could be purchased very reasonably from the Mounted Police. He has also reported that his return the Rev. Mr. Walters has been appointed to Split Lake, who would be available as a teacher.\n\nIn reply to his letter he was told that this Department is in communication with the Deputy Minister of Education.\nEducation for Manitoba, who had been asked to make the necessary arrangements for securing a suitable teacher and the opening of the school, this Department to pay two-thirds of the expenses.\n\nA requisition for supplies from Mr. Walter was forwarded by Mr. Macdonald and this requisition and a copy of Mr. Macdonald's letter were forwarded to Mr. Fletcher and the Agent was so informed.\n\nFrom a letter just received from Mr. Fletcher it appears that his Department is not particularly anxious to take any action in regard to a school at this point and it rests with this Department to arrange for its maintenance.\n\nI would suggest that Mr. Fletcher be asked to return the requisition which was sent him, so that it can be filled here. Before incurring any expense for alterations to the Mounted Police Barracks and for equipment it might be well to wait for a return showing the attendance. In any event the work could hardly be done this winter.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

We have had considerable correspondence regarding the establishment of a school there with the Deputy Minister of Education for Manitoba. From our more recent letters, however, I take it for granted that it is not the intention of the Province to do anything towards the establishing of a school although there are a few Half-breed children. The day school some few years ago was not a success, and I would like to give further consideration to the matter before incurring any expenditure in the way of building, especially as I understand that there is an unused mounted police barracks which we could convert into a school-house.\n\nI would ask your Lordship to be kind enough to request Rev. Mr. Walter to send in a return showing the attendance, etc., for the time that he has had the school opened. We shall also arrange to send him in some school material. I shall also be prepared to pay a reasonable salary for the work that has been done by Mr. Walter, provided the returns will justify such action.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRt.

Mr. Walter, the Missionary at Split Lake, started a school on his own account at the mission and carried it on during the past summer. It has been decided to give this school a trial and, as it is desired to send Mr. Walter a supply of school material, I have to ask you to be good enough to return to the Department the requisition which was sent you under cover of official letter of the 16th of September, last.\n\nIf it is decided to continue this school, you will be written to in regard to the attendance of half-breed children there.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

There are boys and girls between the ages of 6 and 16. Girls 30. Boys 21.\n\nSchool was held from 9 to 12 for five days a week. I have to do all my chores, wood cutting, cooking, breadmaking, and housework, in addition to other missionary work.\n\nThe school was opened 12 times and then the most of the children left for the hunting grounds with their parents, and we thought it unwise to heat the Church for the sake of about 20 children. The accompanying two photos were taken after some hard life. One or two of the older girls could repeat the\nAlphabet and one could read a word or two in English when I started. Before they left they could nearly all repeat the alphabet, some of them knew their twice times table and most could do the simplest addition and subtraction. All this was of course in English. But I have no teaching plant except & reading cards, large size, and a few books on arithmetic far too advanced for them. Mr MacDonald the Indian Agent at The Pas is acquainted with the conditions here, and I have been in communication with him. I am willing to teach 15 hours a week until you can get a teacher. Personally I think this is sufficient for the Indians here at present. One fact is patent, they must learn English, with the line only 30 miles away. If you can't do anything then I must teach them these cards backwards, but I am determined that their children shall learn to speak English and so be able to meet the new conditions here, caused by the railway passing through.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nW.H.J.

There is an old Mounted Police Barracks on the reserve which is vacant at the present time, and in the meantime, if it could be secured, would answer for a school.\n\nThe barracks is 24x24 with a nine foot ceiling downstairs, and is worth in its present condition about $200.00. It is built of logs and has an upstairs and two good floors. It is divided downstairs into four rooms by board partitions. It has four windows, one of them only a half a one. There would be required two large windows in addition to the ones in, and a small porch over the front door. The partition lumber will make this porch. It requires some plaster on the outside and enough lime to whitewash the inside, and will cost not over $100.00 to make it ready for the seats. This building when repaired should be good for five years, and seats for say 40 pupils and a blackboard 3 x 12 will have to be furnished.\n\nBishop Lofthouse was on the reserve at the time of my visit, and he agreed to Mr Walton, the resident Clergyman, teaching for half a day for five days in the week when the children are at home. This arrangement appears to be the best one possible at the present time, and I would recommend that the Department should arrange to take over and use this building.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, August 21, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant with reference to the establishment of a school on the Split Lake Reserve for the benefit of the Indian children residing there and stating that there is a building available which was formerly used by the Mounted Police as a barracks, which is vacant at the present time and would serve the purpose of a school building.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that by Order in Council of the 4th of May, 1917, this building was secured by this Department from the Royal Northwest Mounted Police for use as a school building.\n\nA request was received from His Lordship the Bishop of Kessatin in November, last, for the establishment of a school at this point. His Lordship stated that the Rev. W. H. Walter, the missionary there, was prepared to undertake the work as teacher and asked to be furnished with a supply of school material. The material asked for was forwarded, and it was decided to give this school a trial. No returns have yet been received and the Department is unable to judge the attendance and the progress which is being made. The Department understands that the school is being conducted by the missionary in the Church.\n\nAs you state the building referred to above will require some slight alterations and the addition of two large windows and a small porch over the front door and the board partitions removed, at a cost not to exceed $100.00, the Department will approve of this work being done. You may, therefore, make the necessary arrangements to have the alterations outlined by you completed as soon as possible, and the expenditure for this work should not exceed your estimate.\n\nWith reference to the purchase of sufficient desks for forty pupils I have to request that you will also purchase twenty double separate desks of suitable sizes and arrange to have them delivered at the school. You can obtain these desks from the E. N. Moyer Co. of Winnipeg, and they should be furnished at the usual price at which they supply their school desks to this Department. You may also purchase from the E. N. Moyer Co. and have forwarded along with the desks a hyloplate blackboard, three feet by twelve feet, with the necessary chalk trough and moulding.\n\nKindly inform the Department as to when the alterations\n\nS. J. Jackson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nStonewall, Man.\nalterations referred to above are completed and also when\nthe desks and blackboards are forwarded.\n\nYou should forward properly certified vouchers,\nin duplicate, for the expenditure incurred in making the\nalterations to the building and for the purchase of the\ndesks and blackboard.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFOR ASST. DEPUTY AND SECRETARY.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have just returned from visiting an Indian mission in the North, and spent some time at Opitik Lake.\n\nAt this mission there is very great need of a good day school, and our missionary, Rev. W. H. J. Walter, is prepared to do all in his power to assist; but there is no school building, school being held at present in the church.\n\nThe Indians are willing to get out logs for a school building and also to do a great part of construction, if the Dep't would assist them in the matter of food during the time they are at work. It would also be necessary for them to have doors, windows and furniture found on site can be used on the mission property which would be most convenient.\n\nI should be deeply grateful if anything could be done in this matter for the need is great.\n\nVery Truly Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6247, file 543-1, part 1)\nOttawa, August 22, 1919.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour, by direction of the Deputy Superintendent General, to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 19th instant in reference to the establishment of a school on the Split Lake Reserve, and requesting that a building be provided for this purpose.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this Department has secured the building formerly used by the Mounted Police as a barracks, which is vacant at the present time, and with some slight alterations will serve the purpose. This building has been secured from the Royal Northwest Mounted Police for use as a school building.\n\nMr. Inspector Jackson, who was on the reserve at the time of your visit, has furnished the Department with a list of the alterations required to be made to this building and he has been granted authority to have these changes made. He states that the work can be completed at an estimated cost of $100.00.\n\nHe has also been instructed to purchase sufficient desks for forty pupils and a hyloplate blackboard and to have them sent to the school.\n\nIt is hoped that, when the alterations are made, the building will be found to meet the requirements, and that there will be a sufficient attendance of Indian children to warrant the Department in continuing the school.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRight Rev. J. Lofthouse, D.D.,\nBishop of Keewatin,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to state that the Indians at Split Lake have asked that a day school be opened at that point. They ask that it be carried on for only four months of the year, in the summer.\n\nThe missionary Mr. Walters states that he is willing to teach a school such as the above, but only for half a day for four or five days a week providing that the Department supplies desks and purchases a building for a school.\n\nThis would work out as follows. The children would be taught for about eighty half days in the summer and have holidays for eight months while away north with their parents on the hunt.\n\nThe building referred to is the old R.N.W.M.P. barracks and if the Department desires to go ahead with this school no doubt the R.N.W.M.P. would be agreeable to sell the property as they do not use it.\n\nI do not feel like recommending that the school be opened on these terms, as I know that all the children would learn in such a short term would be wasted and forgotten before the next year.\n\nThe missionary at present carries on a small class of pupils but receives no compensation for the work, except from the church.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nAsst Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, August 29, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant with reference to the establishment of a school on the Split Lake Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this Department has secured the building formerly used by the Mounted Police as a barracks, which is vacant at the present time and with some slight alterations will serve the purpose of a school building.

He states that the work can be completed at an estimated cost of $100.00. He was also instructed to purchase sufficient desks for forty pupils and a hyloplate blackboard. As there are a large number of children at this point, the Department has decided to give this school a trial.\n\nA supply of school material was sent the Rev. Mr. Walter last fall and His Lordship the Bishop of Keewatin was requested to instruct Mr. Walter to send in returns showing the attendance, etc., when he had the school open, and also that a reasonable salary would be paid for the work that he had performed. No returns have yet been received, and you should instruct the missionary to forward returns for the period which he had this school in operation.\n\nIt is noted that Mr. Walter's duties as missionary will only permit him to teach for half a day during four or five days each week. If his efforts meet with success the question of appointing a teacher will receive consideration.\n\nYou might consult Mr. Inspector Jackson regarding the repairs he has been authorized to make to the building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor Asst.

The missionary is a hustler, and does his best, but as I reported previously he has the misfortune to lose his entire flock of children just as they are beginning to learn something. He is going to have the R.N.W.M.P. building put in shape as directed by the Department, and perhaps will soon be able to have a school run on regular lines. The report enclosed shows the number of children willing to go to school.\n\nI would be obliged if the Department can see their way to allow a grant to Mr. Walters for his work this summer.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nAsst.

Mr. Walters for the period which he taught the summer school at Split Lake.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that he is being allowed salary for the period the school was open at the rate of $200.00 per annum, and a cheque for $125.00, being equal to one quarter's salary, is being sent you under separate cover, which you will be good enough to see that he receives.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The school children themselves were getting on very well, in fact I do not understand how they have learned so much in such a short space of time. The Teacher explains that when the parents are absent in the winter with the children, that he sends letters at every opportunity with little lessons to each family, so that when the children appear in school again they have not forgotten everything they learned previously. The school will run for probably three or four months more before the parents leave for the hunting grounds again.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst.

(His letter was dated Dec. 11th, 1920)\n\nThis school had always been considered a summer one only, but Mr. Inspector Jackson and myself impressed on the teacher the necessity of keeping it open all year if possible, and I am glad he is starting to do this.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nAsst.

Mr. Walters, teacher of the Split Lake Indian Day School, at the rate of $2.50 a day for the number of days he taught this school during the quarters ending June 30th and September 30th, last. In addition he was allowed bonus.\n\nOwing to the fact that the bonus vote for the fiscal year 1923-24 has lapsed, it has, therefore, been decided to pay Mr. Walters for the March quarter at the rate of $3.00 a day and the amount, therefore, due him for the 55 days the school was open is $165.00, a cheque for which amount is being made payable and sent to the Canadian Bank of Commerce, The Pas, Manitoba, for deposit to Mr. Walter's credit.\n\nIn future, he will be allowed salary for the number of days the school is open at the rate of $3.00 a day, without bonus, which arrangement it is hoped will be satisfactory to him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nRussell T.

We have there a church building and a mission house, in full use.\n\nThe Rev. W. H. J. Walter, the missionary in charge of Split Lake now conducts day school, and he will, so far as we know, continue to do so. We fully purpose to continue the Missionary-Teaching services for such portions of the year as the missionary is able to gather the children together for school. The Rev. Mr. Walter is doing splendid work at Split Lake, and he, as well as ourselves, would be much gratified if a suitable school could be built.\n\nWe are not advised as to what has been done by the Department at Split Lake in the way of equipment for the school as Mr. Walter has taken up the work of teaching quite voluntarily in the interests of the Indians. So far as we know, no grant is made by the Department towards the salary of the teacher. We should be glad to know if a grant towards salary could be made, if such is not now done, provided that the missionary is prepared to carry on the school under the regulations of the Department, or in the case of the possible appointment of a separate teacher. We should be obliged if you could advise us as to the relation of the Department to the teaching now being given by the missionary, and we trust it may be considered advisable to erect a suitable school building.\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary-Treasurer,\n& Commissary to the Bishop of Keewatin.\nOttawa, August 5, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, with reference to the missionary and teaching services at Split Lake, northern Manitoba.

Mr. Walter payment for his teaching services at the rate of $3.00 per day. His services have been more or less intermittent. For the past year or two he has taught somewhat more than 100 teaching days a year, principally during the March and September quarters.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

I was informed by Rev. Mr. Walter that the school has an average attendance of 43 in the summer and 16 in the winter. The building is in bad shape and is very badly lighted. It is, as you are doubtless aware a log building built for police purpose and not intended for school purposes. I have long felt that we ought to have a full time teacher here to do full justice to the two sides of the work, educational and missionary. I shall be pleased if a proper school can be provided and I will do my best to secure a qualified teacher.\n\nMost faithfully yours,\n\nA.D. Dewdney\nBishop of Keewatin\n\nIndian Affairs.

He will be prepared to conduct full-time school for the children at Split Lake. He will have one more year to put in College before he is ready for ordination, but as summer is the time that the Indians are on their reserve and most are away during the winter, he will be there for the period when the best work can be done.\n\nI am hoping that the new school for which application has been made and advised by Agent Waddy will be proceeded with as the present building is in bad shape and was never intended for school purposes.\n\nMay I also say that I am appointing Mr.Herbert Cannon who taught school at York Factory the past two years to have charge of our work at Pikwitonei. I would urge that his work as teacher of Indian children be duly recognized by the Dept., as a very necessary provision for children who would otherwise be neglected. I anticipate that work on the H.B.Railway will bring more of the Indians than usual from Split Lake to the line.

Halfway, last summer is being appointed to Split Lake. He will give full time to the work of the school and also have charge of the missionary work. He will return to College next winter and finish his preparation for ordination, and, as he purposes to devote himself to Indian Missionary Work, I am appointing him to this Mission. Last summer, of his own motion, he carried on a day school for the Indians who live at Piikwiton\u00e9z and had an enrolment of 19 pupils. He will start on his work this summer as soon as travelling conditions will permit him to go in, which will be early in May. You will, I presume, make a note of this appointment, and approve of it so far as the educational work is concerned.

Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 17, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 5928-146 of the 12th instant, to the effect that the Split Lake Indian Day School is being conducted in the summer, as in the past. Your action in this connection is approved and two months' holidays should be taken at another time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. W.

He is to be married next week, and as his fiancee holds a permanent professional First Class Certificate for the Province of Saskatchewan, and has had experience in teaching foreign children, and more recently has been on the staff of the N.Battleford Public Schools, I am nominating her as teacher at Split Lake with a similar arrangement to that made at Fort Alexander that her husband should be associated in the work of the school, responsibility for the school work devolving upon her.\n\nKindly let me have a memo accepting the nomination and stating the amount of stipend to be allowed. The maiden name of the teacher is Dorothea Douglas-Fraser. Her married name will be Mrs. Dorothea Dewdney.\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nRussell Ferrier, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 2nd, 1928.\n\nRight Rev. Sir:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 26th ultimo, informing the Department that Mr. Herbert Cannon will terminate his services as teacher of the Split Lake Indian Day School on May 31st, next, and that Rev. A. S. Dewdney and his wife will succeed him. We note that Mrs. Dewdney, who will perform the teaching duties, holds a permanent professional first class certificate for the province of Saskatchewan and has had teaching experience. The Department will approve of the appointment of Mrs. Dewdney as teacher from the 1st of June, next, with salary at the rate of $90 per teaching month for the ten months in the school year. It is noted that her husband will be associated in the work of the school, full responsibility, however, for the classroom work to devolve upon Mrs. Dewdney. It is understood that the school will be conducted during the summer months and that the usual two months' holidays will be taken during the winter months.\n\nWe are informing Mr. Agent Waddy of the approval of the appointment of Mrs. Dewdney as teacher at Split Lake.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Rev.

A. S. Dewdney, who was recently nominated by His Lordship the Bishop of Keewatin to proceed to Split Lake with his wife as teacher, should take up the medical work.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Dewdney will, no doubt, visit you when proceeding to the school, and you should discuss with them the matter of carrying on the field matron's duties and the medical work. As you are aware, Mrs. J. Carter, who was appointed in August, 1925, as field matron, was to carry on the work for one year only, but her services have been retained until the present time. It is doubtful if Mr. Dewdney could be appointed to perform the field matron's duties, but it might be possible to give him the work of dispenser and looking after the medical requirements. After you have discussed this matter with Mr. Dewdney, I shall be pleased to have a report and recommendation as to the services he will perform. I might add that we are not aware of the Rev. Mr. Dewdney's address.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Agent, Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. W.

It will be necessary to obtain the services of a qualified teacher to succeed Mr. Harrison, and I shall be pleased if Your Lordship will make a nomination. The name, qualifications and experience of the teacher whom you obtain should be forwarded for the consideration of the Department.\n\nPermission was granted for this school to continue in operation during the months of July and August and it is presumed that Mr. Harrison will teach until the end of the present month.

In view of the past difficulty in getting satisfactory professional teachers for such isolated districts I consider it best that the missionary should also be teacher.\n\nI shall be glad to learn if this nomination is satisfactory and also the amount of allowance per teaching month.

Between July 1, 1941, and March 31, 1942, there will only be available an amount sufficient to pay six months' salary. I, therefore, presume that this school will not re-open until October 1, 1941, which will bring it in line with other Indian day schools throughout the Dominion. Please let me hear from you in this regard as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. S.

He has for many years been married, but he has no family.

He is also the Church of England clergyman.\n\nThe school is a frame building and is badly in need of paint, both inside and out. The toilets need to be moved and repaired. Mr. Lovell left instructions that this work be carried out at once.\n\nThe roll calls for about 24 pupils. At times the attendance is good but when the Indians are away, which is the greater part of the time, the attendance drops to from 6 to 10. Mr. Cowley stated that if the Department approved he would close school next April and May and teach in July and August when the Indians are all home. I would recommend that Mr. Lovell be notified that this change is approved.\n\nThe exercise books showed very nice writing and neat work. The pupils, however, are so irregular in attendance that progress is slow and the children rarely pass grade two or three.\n\nThe day school seems to offer little hope for the solution of the education problem because to live these people must be out on the trapline.\n\nA number of children from this reserve now attend Elkhorn Residential School. However, I feel these children could best be educated nearer home and not taken too far from their home environment. The question of education for these northern\nIndians is one that deserves careful study.\n\nThere are about 85 children of school age on this reserve and their education is our responsibility. It is a problem that the department must face and indeed must solve; and the boarding school appears the only reasonable solution.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\nOttawa, July 26th, 1945.\n\nMr. A.G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building, Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, reporting on the Split Lake Day School.\n\nIf it is possible for you to arrange for the painting of the interior of the school between now and when the school reopens in September you may do so. It is noted that instructions have been issued for the removal and repair of the toilets.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF F. YULE, M.D.,\nMedical Superintendent, The Pas Agency, dated March 1, 1946.\n\nAt Split Lake we have a good school and good desks with 26 pupils enrolled. There is no overcrowding. If this were the whole story it would be grand, but unfortunately it is not. I have it on good authority that there are approximately 84 children of school age in this Band. There are about 10 going to Elkhorn School, so we have about 36 getting some education. The children not in school are living at scattered points with their parents and in most cases, if not in all, there are too few at any of these points to form a school nucleus. Now I am only interested in getting these children educated (whether Day or Boarding School is immaterial) and I cannot see how this is to be done unless there is a central boarding-school. In this case it should be Split Lake. It is twenty-five miles from the main steel, but it would be a comparatively simple matter to make a tractor winter road and bring in a year's supplies.\nOttawa, April 26, 1946.\n\nMr. S.

We have noted the necessity for a new building at Split Lake, but under the circumstances mentioned above, it will not be possible to take any action this year.\n\nIs there any building that could be rented for a year or two? We might be able to secure an additional teacher this Fall. This would not fully alleviate the situation but it would help. I would appreciate having your comments.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, February 27, 1947.\n\nDear Mr. Bateman:\n\nI have received and carefully read your reports on school inspections at Oxford House and Split Lake. I hope to be writing to you in the near future concerning the new schools we intend building in your inspectorate this year.\n\nBy now the school supplies ordered for Oxford House should have reached there. We arranged for the books to reach Ilford by January first. The Northern Transportation Company was requested to handle them by tractor train from there. The Basic Readers of the Curriculum Foundation Series were being supplied to these schools. Thirty-six desks were ordered from Mayer's in Winnipeg and our records show that these were delivered to Inspector Hamilton in Winnipeg on January 4 and that they too were shipped to Ilford for onward routing by tractor train. It is unfortunate that all these supplies have not yet arrived to alleviate conditions at these schools.\n\nWe are writing to Dr. Dorey of the United Church concerning Mr. Leeson and to Bishop Lofthouse about Reverend Mr. Cosley. You will be receiving notification in the near future of the new teachers' salary scales which we intend taking into effect on the first of September, 1947, and which it is hoped will attract a better class of teacher into our day schools.\n\nI appreciate your frankness in submitting these reports and feel that they will do much to bring about a needed improvement in the education of the Indians of your inspectorate.\n\nB.

The teaching of any children to read and write is a difficult thing - it is particularly so with Indian children.\n\nIn the near future we expect to announce details of our new salary scale for Indian day school teachers.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nRe: Split Lake Indian Day School.\n\nThank you for yours of the 27th ult. enclosing copy of report of the Provincial Inspector of Schools on the Split Lake Indian Day School.\n\nWe have been aware for some time that the children in this school have not made the progress which should be expected. On different occasions when visiting the Mission at Split Lake the people have asked for a teacher who could give his whole time to the work. Indian Agent, Mr. S. Lovell and I have likewise discussed the same point, for while fully appreciating the splendid work that the Rev. G. C. Cowley has done and is doing for the spiritual and social welfare of the Indian people, he has not the qualifications required for successful teaching. Furthermore he has many duties which may and do interfere with school work.\n\nMr. Cowley would welcome relief from school duties, but as in other areas there are difficulties. First of securing qualified teachers, and if such could be found we are faced with the lack of living accommodation. Some few years ago I had correspondence with a qualified and capable lady teacher who was willing to go to Split Lake, but we were unable to place her there on account of there being no residence or other available accommodation. This teacher is not now available, having some three years ago been married to our missionary at Gillam where she is doing most commendable work among Indians and white people as a co-worker with her husband, the Rev. H. S. Hughes-Caley who together are rendering most valuable service in a wide area reaching to Churchill and to the Chipewayan people beyond that point.\n\nThe first problem is to find teachers who are willing to take up such work as at Split Lake and other centres, and the second is suitable accommodation.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6247, file 543-1, part 1)\nOttawa, March 12th, 1947.\n\nMr. Samuel Lovell, Indian Agent,\nThe Pas, Manitoba.\n\nWe recently corresponded with Bishop Lofthouse regarding the possibility of securing a qualified teacher to take charge of the Split Lake School for the academic year 1947-48. I understand that Reverend Mr. Cowley is anxious to be relieved from school duties.\n\nBishop Lofthouse points out that it is difficult to secure qualified teachers, especially in view of the lack of living accommodation. He states that there is no residence or other available accommodation.\n\nDo you know of any building that would be suitable for a school residence and could be rented at Split Lake?\n\nPlease let me have a report regarding the situation at that point.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of March 12, file 128-12-1(WTL) re school residence at Split Lake, I beg to advise that there is no house available for a school teacher on this Reserve, but have no doubt that facilities could be supplied at the Hudson's Bay House or the Missionary to board the teacher on this reservation.\n\nI certainly would appreciate very much anything you can do in this regard.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nS. Lovell\nIndian Agent\n\nP.S. Will include in my estimates for 1948-49, a teachers residence for this reservation.\nOttawa, March 24th, 1947.\n\nDear Bishop Lofthouse:\n\nWe are in receipt of your letter of March 7th regarding the Split Lake School. We wrote to Indian Agent Lovell and he has expressed the opinion that a teacher could secure living accommodation at the Hudson's Bay Company.\n\nWe hope that you will be able to nominate a qualified teacher to take charge of this school on September first.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRight Reverend J. Lofthouse, D.D.,\nBishop of Keewatin,\nBishopstowe,\nKenora, Ontario.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have been requested by the Reverend C.G. Cowley, school teacher, Indian day school, Split Lake, if it would be possible to change the holiday situation on the reserve so that instead of having to take holidays in July and August, he would appreciate it very much if he could be allowed to take May and June.\n\nI discussed this matter with him during my last trip on that reserve and upon investigation I have discovered that most of the children in this school are away with their parents trapping and don't get back on to the reserve until the end of May or the beginning of June, the result is that the school is practically empty and is certainly not doing very much toward the education of the children.\n\nUnder the circumstances I recommend that this change be approved as it would be an advantage to the children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. Lovell\nIndian Agent.\n\nSL/dl\nOttawa, April 26th, 1947.\n\nMr. S. Lovell, Indian Agent,\nThe Pas, Manitoba.\n\nSplit Lake Indian Day School\n\nNormally we would have approved the application which you made in your letter of April 22nd that this school be allowed to close during May and June.\n\nHowever, in view of the fact that the inspector's report upon this school was unsatisfactory, we have been in correspondence with Bishop Lofthouse regarding the possibility of securing a qualified teacher for this school. Our letter of March 12th to you informed you of this fact.\n\nI hope to have an opportunity of discussing this situation with Mr. Hamilton in the near future.\n\nBernard F.

Stansjon,\nSuperintendent,\nNelson River Agency.\n\nc.c. R.S. Davis, Esq.\n\nJHS/AH\nThe photo shows the teacher (Rev. G.C. Cowley) and all the pupils who were present (12) when I visited this school briefly on Dec. 9, 1948.\n\nThe register shows one hundred fourteen names of children, but on the back of the December school report, Mr. Cowley shows that only about thirty children might be expected to attend the local day school.\n\nOn register 114\nEstimated number rarely at Split L 44\nTo be accounted for (about) 70\nWith parents at trapping, etc., 40\nProbably in school neighbourhood 30\n\nThe unusual manner in which the register of this school, and probably other school registers in Manitoba, is being kept, is consequent upon instructions received from the Regional Supervisor's office under date of June 9, 1948, file 200-118, a copy of which might well be requested.\n\nI requested Mr. Cowley to continue the day's teaching activities as planned, but it was obvious that there had been no planning and that for some time past there had been little continuity of effort to attain the usual educational objectives. I saw no evidence of effective teaching of the fundamentals using...\neither English or Cree as a medium of instruction.\n\nMr. Cowley honestly admits that classroom teaching is not his m\u00e9tier, and he would be glad to have the school conducted by a professionally qualified teacher, leaving him to continue his excellent work in the religious and social fields. The evidence of the excellence of his work in these fields appears in many ways.\n\nAs there is no teacherage, accommodation would have to be found for the teacher who should be appointed to begin next September.\n\nThe staff situation in the agency is not likely to be settled for some time, and until we have someone who can report with adequate knowledge of the situation, many questions must remain unanswered.\n\nThere are those claiming familiarity with the area who recommend the establishing of a residential school in or near that area. There is a good deal to be said in favour of this recommendation.\n\nC.A.J. Clark\nMarch 16, 1949.\n\nRight Reverend J. Lofthouse, D.D.,\nBishop of Neumtin,\nBishopstone,\nK e r o n a, Ontario.\n\nSplit Lake Indian Day School.\n\nDear Bishop Lofthouse:\n\nYou will recall my letter of February 27, 1947, concerning the Reverend Mr. Conley, teacher at the Split Lake Day School. I have just received another School Inspector's report, submitted on this school, and it is evident that his work is most unsatisfactory. Our own Educational Survey Officer has also reported on the school and it obvious that there is no effective teaching being carried out at the present time.\n\nThese reports indicate that the Reverend Mr. Conley is prepared to have the school conducted by a professionally qualified teacher, leaving him to continue his excellent work in the religious and social fields.\n\nWe have just completed arrangements to ship in a prefabricated teacherage and hope that it can be erected this summer. We are anxious, naturally, to send in a qualified teacher for next September and would appreciate hearing from you in this regard.\n\nWe hope that Canon Conley will not accept the Department's action as uncomplimentary. It is agreed by everyone concerned that he is doing a most satisfactory job as a missionary and as a welfare worker.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Heary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nCopy sent to Mr. Davis & Mr. Saunton\nExtract from Regional Supervisor Davis' report dated January 4th on the Split Lake Indian Day School.\n\nI only visited the school for a short time, as I was busy visiting the Indians, finding out how many hours a day the school was in operation, and receiving complaints which were numerous. Most of the Indians said it was useless to send their children to school as it only started in the morning around eleven o'clock and closed at twelve; opening again around two or half-past and closing at three o'clock. No effort was made by the Rev. Cowley to teach the children.\n\nWhen I visited the school there were 12 children in the classroom and an additional 40 were around the homes, who were not attending school. Mr. Grafton advised me that Rev. Cowley claimed that he taught the children in Cree; however, as Mr. Grafton can speak the language and has taught Indian children, it was quite evident that the children were not taught Cree, English or anything else. I would recommend that this man's services be dispensed with and a first class teacher engaged.\n\nAs we have not a residence at this point, arrangements should be made to have material sent in before Spring, so we can erect a residence next summer. In the meantime, a teacher could board with the Hudson's Bay Company Post Manager. There is no doubt, that Rev. Cowley has done good Missionary work but the only interest he has had in the school is the salary attached to it.\nColonel Bernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Col. Neary:\n\nRe: Split Lake Indian Day School\nFile 543-1 (E)\n\nI have your letter of the 16th inst., concerning the Rev. G. C. Cowley and the school at Split Lake.\n\nFor several years it has been evident that the teaching at this school has not been satisfactory. I note what you say regarding plans for the future, and that a prefabricated teacherage is being shipped to Split Lake in the hope that it can be erected during the summer.\n\nWe shall make every possible effort to secure a qualified teacher for that school, and trust we may be successful in our quest and be able to nominate such a teacher.\n\nCanon Cowley has given faithful service for many years at Split Lake, although admittedly he is not a teacher, and I am aware that of late years he has found it difficult to do the combined work of missionary and teacher. I appreciate your appreciative reference to his missionary and social work, and I trust such appreciation will be conveyed to him by your Department.

She has been up to the office and I also agree that she would make a capable teacher.\n\nIndians at Split Lake do not speak any English and as Francis is an Indian from Norway House Agency, she would understand their language.\n\nThis opportunity would also greatly assist Francis in purchasing clothing, etcetera for the coming term.\n\nR.

Teachers are required for York Factory, Jack River and Split Lake, and thus far we have no applicants for any of them. We should be pleased to hear from you as to any Anglican applicants, or other suitable teachers.\n\nI may say that on the occasion of my visit to Split Lake from July 22nd to 25th, the teacherage was not erected, although it was expected that the same would be duly constructed by Mr. Bland and Mr. Hadley, the Hudson's Bay manager and free trader respectively.\n\nIt is understood that Mr. Retallack, the Hudson's Bay Company manager at York Factory is being transferred, hence I presume the services of Mrs. Retallack as teacher will not for long be available.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(sgd) J.

Pook, Esq.,\nSecretary Treasurer,\nSynod of Diocese of Rupert's Land,\nTrinity Hall, Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nDear Mr. Pook:\n\nThere is a vacancy for a teacher at Split Lake in Northern Manitoba near Ilford, where the Indian Superintendent is Mr. J.H. Staunton.\n\nThis area is in the Anglican Diocese of Keewatin, and the Indians of the reserve are practically all adherents of the Church of England. Until the end of June the school was conducted by the resident Missionary, Canon G.C. Cowley, who is now giving all his time to Church work.\n\nIt is desirable that the first lay teacher should be a person who is likely to co-operate fully with community leaders. A teacher trained in Manitoba is more likely to have an appreciation of the area and would find it more convenient and cheaper to reach.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

I have not heard further as to whether such furnishings arrived, which same is a matter of importance if a teacher is secured.\n\nThe north is now freezing up, hence some little time must elapse before a teacher could get in to Split Lake. You suggest that we advertise for a teacher for this school. Does \"we\" mean your Department or does it include us? If the latter we should require to know what is to be the salary for a teacher at Split Lake. Qualified teachers are, as you know, still scarce, and few such are willing to go to isolated posts.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.
