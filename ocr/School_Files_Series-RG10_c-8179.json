Milton Gedson has written with reference to the erection of a woodshed at the Maria Indian Day School. When this school was originally built it was understood that space for the storing of fuel was provided in the basement. However, I understand that this space is now being used for vocational training purposes. Under these circumstances a woodshed is probably required. We had some correspondence regarding the matter last year and it was estimated that it would cost $275.00 to erect a suitable woodshed.\n\nThe Department feels that a woodshed could be erected at much less cost than the figure stated above and I should appreciate your giving the matter some thought and advising me the size of the woodshed required and giving an estimate of its cost. I thought that if the material were supplied the woodshed could be erected very cheaply under your direction. When replying you might let me have a list of the materials which you consider would be needed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Lynn - Agent\n\nDear Mr. Lynn:\n\nWith reference to the recommendation of 12 desks for the school I beg to inform you that in the elementary classrooms there are only 34 seats for 37 pupils and new pupils are coming in; in the junior class we have 125 seats for 28 pupils not mentioning 8 rooms for special classes 3 times a week.\n\nPlacing 3 pupils where they should be two (that is on the double seats) is neither hygienic nor proper. How can they write when they have no place to work?\n\nOf course, in the junior classes 9 of the pupils are not expected to come back in September, but will be replaced by others.\n\nIndependent from the number of new pupils 12 of the old two-seat desks are\nare shaky and not removable. When we first came here in Sept. 1841, you kindly did your best to repair them but it lasted no time owing to the fact that holes are so rotten and that bolts are somewhat useless. As I said above they are so shaky that to have the children to use them is a problem.\n\nI felt quite shy to ask the Department for twelve desks\u2014and indeed I should have asked for six simple back seats\u2014as we are actually buying chairs at $5 from the class store to the sewing class, but in time I may see they had to with the less desirable; nevertheless if these are added to the number asked for we shall all be satisfied.\n\nVery respectfully Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The well is about 15 feet deep and on my opinion I do not think it is sufficient, on account of the hill and the quick sand in this place.\n\nI do not take any decision at present, but I believe the best way to have water there, is to dig a well about 25 to 30 feet deep with a diamond drill. In this manner the general level would be reached and the coat of quick sand passed.\n\nThe reasons of the trouble is certainly the quick sand and if we want to have water, we must dig deep enough to be clear of it.\n\nI will continue to study carefully that question before giving a definite recommendation, and in a couple weeks I will send you my report.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nEdgar Arsenault, Farming Instructor,\nRestigouche, N.B.\nRestigouche, August the 3rd, 1942.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan, Chief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 21st of July concerning the cost of labour for the erection of the woodshed at Maria School, I wish to inform you that the work is begun this morning and the job has been accepted for the amount of $75.00 as mentioned in my letter of April the 30th.\n\nThe accounts will be sent to your Department after the work will be completed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nEdgar Arsenault, Farming Instructor,\nRestigouche, N.E.\nRestigouche, August the 3rd, 1942.\n\nMr. R.

Ross made a visit to the school this week and he wanted to pay for those repairs; I thought to tell you about it as I believed that it would not be very convenient to leave the Bishop pay for those necessary repairs.\n\nBelieve me, sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.)

I should add that this is the first intimation we have had that such repairs were needed at the Maria School.

Richard, Indian Agent, Restigouche, Que.\n\nWith reference to the attached account from the J. & D.A. Harquail Co., purchase order No. 15132 was issued on October 28. This purchase order authorized a total expenditure of $112.90. Mr. Arsenault recently forwarded an account amounting to $122.47. This latter account was returned to him in my letter of December 2 and he was advised that it was above the authority given in the purchase order and consequently could not be paid. In addition the firm asked $5.70 for freight charges, whereas their quotation was f.o.b. Maria.\n\nYour voucher No. 72 covers only one item of the original purchase order. In view of the letter written to Mr. Arsenault on December 2, I suggest that you get in touch with him and have a proper account submitted in accordance with the purchase order, copy of which Mr. Arsenault has in his possession.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMaria, December the 18th, 1943.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoye, Supt. of Welfare and Training, Ottawa.\n\nReplying to your letter of December the 2nd, regarding the cost for the Maria Indian School cellar (repairs), I regret to realize that the Department has misunderstood my letter of October the 24th, in which it is said that I secure the approximate cost of the work, and not the accurate cost.\n\nIn your letter of October the 1st you ask me to give an approximate cost and it is what I have done. In order to furnish you further information I have given few details of the work regarding the material required, but this letter was not a purchase order to be sent to the Harquail's Company.\n\nI had taken information for the price of the wood, birch and spruce, but not for the rest of the material; for those items I had quoted the approximate price.\n\nThe Department did not inform me if the work was authorized in reply of my letter of October the 24th, but the 3rd of November, the Harquail's Company asked me informations regarding the nails and other things regarding the repairs of the Maria cellar.\n\nI have not been informed also which arrangement has been done between the Company and the Department concerning the quoted prices and the transportation of the material to the Maria Indian School, and it is why I am unable to give you more informations concerning the matter.\n\nAccording to the informations taken, the cheapest way was by freight and I did know the Department had an arrangement with the Company to send the material f.o.b. Maria.\n\nI wish to point out that owing that we have been obliged to put another floor on the cement, the carpenter has worked 11 days instead of 8 days as indicated in my letter of October the 24th, it was difficult for me to give exactly how many days a carpenter would be able to do the work.\n\nThe repairs are now completed and the accounts will be sent after your reply.\n\nEdgar Arsenault, Farming Instructor\n\nMaria, Quebec.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Harquail was not in accordance with their tender. While you gave an estimate of the cost of the material in your letter of October 24, the Purchasing Branch subsequently wrote the firm mentioned above and obtained a written tender from them. A copy of this quotation was sent to you on November 2. I note from the second paragraph of your letter that the carpenter was employed for 11\u00bd days instead of the 8 days that you thought would be sufficient.

My information is that after the requisition was sent to the Department the only new received was that the lumber was to the Maria station, freight unpaid. Having not received copy of the purchase order Mr Arsenault did not know what price for lumber, what condition the be filled up by the Company. The difference with the quotations of Mr Arsenault and the price of the invoice is not much different after the cost of the freight be taken off.\n\nIt is also at the knowledge of the Department when we ask for prices of articles it is always understood prices might change at any time in this time where the market is not fixed, so the price might be little higher when purchase.\n\nI am writing to Mr Arsenault and the vouchers with invoices be sent to the Department.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 9, 1943.\n\nEXD.\n\nDr. A.

Arsenault, Farming Instructor, Maria, Que., and the J. & D.A. Harquail Co. Limited and submitted to us in a letter dated October 24, 1942. On reference to your purchase order you will note that the total cost of the supplies was stated to be $112.90 f.o.b. Maria. The firm supplied the materials but the total amount is $122.67. From the correspondence that we have had with Mr. Arsenault it is evident that he made a mistake in submitting the prices which were given to you on our requisition of October 26. As the material has now been delivered and used in repairing the cellar at the Maria School, I trust that you will find it possible to issue an amended purchase order so that the account may be paid. I enclose the account in question. The coding is as follows: 318-75-10-691.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMaria Indian Day School, Feb. 21st, 1943.\n\nTo Mr. R.A. Hoye,\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa -\n\nKind Mr. Hoye,\n\nYou probably don't know that no porch is attached to the school door and that 40 inches is the only space between it and the steps which lead to the classroom. The consequence is that the pupils coming in crowd, all snowed up, jam at the door, trying to shake off the snow and being obliged to keep the door opened too long a time, the heat goes out and the cold comes in. Should a side building be attached to that side of the house it would serve both to the pupils entrance and to a kitchen for the Sisters. As it is now in the kitchenette the pump is exactly 20 inches from the cupboard, at the other end just the place for the door to open. Sideways there are 5 feet between the table adjusted to the partition and the sink. The reservoir being only 2 X 4 ft. the janitor has to pump several times a day and then the cook is delayed in her work being unable to take the necessary things in the cupboard - pantry which is but one - the \"pumper\" filling up the space between it and the pump.\n\nAll this is submitted to your kind attention and we shall be grateful and satisfied for anything you grant us remembering how kindly you have treated us so far.\n\nSister M of Mercy, Principal.\nEdgar Arsenault\n| Item Description                  | Quantity | Unit Price | Total Price |\n|----------------------------------|----------|------------|-------------|\n| 15 lbs. 2\" Finishing Nails       |          | .07        | 1.05        |\n| 15 lbs. 3\" Common Nails          |          | .06        | .90         |\n| 2 Gals. white paint              |          | 4.50       | 9.00        |\n| 1 half gal. linseed oil          |          |            | .80         |\n| 1 half gal. turpentine           |          |            | 1.10        |\n| 10 lbs. 2\" Moulding Nails        |          | .07        | .70         |\n|                                  |          |            | **13.55**   |\n\nTERMS: NET CASH\n| Description                                      | Quantity | Unit Price | Total   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|----------|------------|---------|\n| 700 Sft.

Arsenault, Farming Instructor, Maria, Que., and the J. & D.A. Harquail Co. Limited and submitted to us in a letter dated October 24, 1942. On reference to your purchase order you will note that the total cost of the supplies was stated to be $112.90 f.o.b. Maria. The firm supplied the materials but the total amount is $128.47. From the correspondence that we have had with Mr. Arsenault it is evident that he made a mistake in submitting the prices which were given to you on our requisition of October 26. As the material has now been delivered and used in repairing the cellar at the Maria School, I trust that you will find it possible to issue an amended purchase order so that the account may be paid.

The construction for about 60 hens would cost approximately $300.00.\n\nThe Community (Sisters) are willing to pay \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) of the cost or $100.00. The balance for the building and the purchase of 50 pullets, about $25.00 would be paid by your Department.\n\nIt is in few words the plan submitted to me by the Principal of the School.\n\nHowever, the $100.00 would be repaid to your Department, only next year because the Principal of the School says that they have not the means to secure it now.\n\nThe difficulty for the Sisters to get meat and eggs in the neighbourhood of the Maria Reserve is one of the reasons justifying the construction of a fowls' house.\n\nMoreover, for the pupils who will attend next year the Poultry Farming Courses, it would be good thing for them to practice what they learn in class.\n\nIf the Department agrees to this plan, an immediate answer would be very much appreciated.\n\nEdgar Arsenault, Farming Instructor\nMaria, Quebec.\nOttawa,\nMay 22, 1943.\n\nMr. Edgar Arsenault, Farming Instructor, Maria, Que.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 19th instant, it has been decided to approve the erection of a chicken house at the Maria School. It is noted that the cost of this will not exceed $300.00. Please forward a requisition for the material required and also let me know the approximate cost of the labour, so that an accountable cheque may be sent to you. The Department also authorizes you to purchase pullets at a cost not exceeding $25.00.\n\nI note that the Rev. Sisters are prepared to allow an amount of $100.00 toward the cost of the erection of the building and the purchase of pullets. It will not be necessary for them to forward this amount but, instead of doing so, they should start next year to contribute their amount by giving chickens as prizes to the pupils, or give them in some other manner that will be equitable to all parties concerned. Such distributions should, of course, be done under your direction and in following this suggestion it is hoped that it will encourage the Indians of the Maria Reserve to raise chickens.\n\nR.A.

H. Nadeau, of Port Daniel Station, Bon. County, Quebec, and it is now delivered at the Maria School.\n\nThe prices given in my letter for the T & G. Board and the 2 by 4, have been obtained from Chs. H. Nadeau. For the rest, I had given an approximate price.\n\nWould you please inform me if your Department is paying the Provincial and Federal taxes on the purchase of wood....

Richard, Indian Agent, Restigouche, Que.\n\nI am in receipt of your voucher No. 211 covering the cost of lumber purchased for the erection of the chicken house at the Maria Day School. On this voucher you quote authority of official letter of May 22, 1943. This letter was sent to Mr. Arsenault, the Farming Instructor, and he was not authorized to make the purchase of the lumber in that letter. However, he did so and on July 2 he was advised that when submitting the account he should forward a statement quoting prices of other firms in the vicinity. My understanding is that he secured this lumber at a very reasonable cost from Charles H. Nadeau but we require the statement which was requested in official letter of July 2 in order that we may have all the necessary information to submit to the Departmental Purchasing Agent. It would be appreciated if you would secure this and forward it to this office.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMaria, August the 4th, 1943.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Voucher No:211. (Philip Phelan)\n\nYour letter of July the 21st sent to Dr Richard has been forwarded to me for reply.\n\nI enclose herewith a letter received from F.W. Snell of New Richmond, and also the quotation from the Madawaska Company of Carleton.\n\nAt the beginning of July when I have ordered lumber for the erection of the chicken house of Maria Indian Day School, those two firms had no lumber on hand, and Mr Snell has still nothing to sell at the present time according to the letter enclosed.\n\nAt the Madawaska Company, I went up there last week, and what they have on hand now is green lumber only, having begun to saw last week. They had no lumber to sell before this date and it is why I could give their quotation.\n\nOn the letter of Mr Hoey, on May 22nd, it was said that the erection of a chicken house at the Maria Indian School was approved for an amount of about $300.00, and also an amount of $25.00 for the purchase of pullets. So I have understood that I could use this letter as my authority for the accounts.... On this letter Mr Hoey asked me to send a requisition for the material required and also the approximate cost of labour. My answer was forwarded in my letter of June the 16th, re requisition and cost of labour. Would you please inform me if this letter has been received by your Department; I have a copy of this letter in file.\n\nRegarding the prices of other firms in the vicinity, asked, (as you say in your letter sent to the Dr Richard), in the Mr Hoey's letter on July the 2nd, I can not find it, and it is why no quotation or other firms has been sent to the Department.\n\nI have probably misunderstood the first letter received in May 22nd, in which it was said that an accountable cheque was to be sent to me, but I did not receive any amount to cover the expenses, and it is why I have understood that the letter of May the 22nd, was the one I should take as my authority for the accounts.\n\nover please......\nSo, as requested in your letter send to Dr Richard, I enclose the prices of the Madawaska Company, and the letter of Mr. F.W. Snell. Those two firms are in the vicinity of Maria.\n\nHoping that with those informations, the Department will be in position to pay the accounts.\n\nEdgar Arsenault, Farming Instructor,\nMaria, Quebec.\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nI attach account amounting to $169.21, covering the cost of lumber purchased for the erection of a chicken house at the Maria Indian Day School. This Branch was anxious to encourage the raising of chickens on the Maria Reserve and the Sisters in charge of the school were willing to undertake the work under the supervision of the Farming Instructor, Mr. Edgar Arsenault. The latter was written with reference to the erection of the chicken house and without further authority he proceeded to purchase the materials required. This account covers the cost of these materials. When he was requested to explain why he purchased the materials without authority he stated that he had had an opportunity of purchasing the lumber at a very reasonable cost. As proof of this he submits a quotation which he received from the Madawaska Company, Carleton. He also endeavoured to obtain a price from F.W. Snell, but this man was unable to quote. Both these letters are attached.\n\nIn view of all the circumstances I feel that he secured the lumber at a reasonable rate and it would, therefore, be appreciated if you would issue a purchase order so that the account may be paid.

This Branch was anxious to encourage the raising of chickens on the Maria Reserve and the Sisters in charge of the school were willing to undertake the work under the supervision of the Farming Instructor, Mr. Edgar Arsenault. The latter was written with reference to the erection of the chicken house and without further authority he proceeded to purchase the materials required. This account covers the cost of these materials. When he was requested to explain why he purchased the materials without authority he stated that he had had an opportunity of purchasing the lumber at a very reasonable cost. As proof of this he submits a quotation which he received from the Madawaska Company, Carleton. He also endeavoured to obtain a price from F.W. Snell, but this man was unable to quote. Both these letters are attached.\n\nIn view of all the circumstances I feel that he secured the lumber at a reasonable rate and it would, therefore, be appreciated if you would issue a purchase order so that the account may be paid.

The other building is larger and erected just outside of the school grounds close to our fence and is used as storage for the sisters' trunks and also for some old clothing sent for distribution to the Indians.\n\nHowever, and in spite of extra expenditure incurred since the sisters have taken charge, I must admit a noticeable change in the children and the activities of Rev.

We had it repaired once already but it is still broken and pieces are coming apart, so it is very unserviceable for fire.

We are surprised that said map has never been seen in the Maria Indian Day School.\n\nTherefore, we sincerely hope that the Department will grant immediately the said map. We have chosen the cheapest but would have desired a more solid one.\n\nVery respectfully,\n\nSr. M. J. St. Adeline\nSuper.

M. H. Collins\n\nSup.\nOttawa, 14th September, 1945.\n\nMr. E. Arsenault, Indian Agent, Restigouche, Que.\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Sister St. Adeline of the Maria School requesting eleven desks. School desks are made in three sizes, large, medium and small. Please let me know which sizes are required.\n\nWe are forwarding maps of the world which we have in the office. These are paper but they will do for the time being as the map of the world is changing almost daily and there will, no doubt, be a more revised map in the next few years.\n\nYou may purchase an ordinary alarm clock for use in the Domestic Science Room. A School Register is being sent from the Department and an Agricultural Text Book is being ordered from the Government Stationery Office.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMr. Morris' report dated Oct-10-11 on Restigouche Agency\n\nReturning from New Carlisle in the afternoon a short visit was made at the Maria Reserve.\n\nSCHOOL - two-room with teacher's residence attached. The building was in a neat and clean condition.\n\nThe agent was authorized to order a new water tank in the attic that was no longer serviceable. The emergency purchase was necessary because it supplies water to the hot water tank connected to the furnace which would be damaged unless action was taken immediately.\n\nATTENTION - MR. PHILAN. The toilets at the school were in a filthy condition and located too close to the school. Arrangements were made to obtain a small piece of ground - a width of about 20 feet - back of the school lot from Mrs. Louis Levine Martin to locate the toilets a greater distance from the school. Agent Arsenault was instructed to build new seats, move the toilets, and then place the fence back to include the new area. Note, Mrs. Martin is over 90 years of age and receiving a ration costing approximately $10.00 per month. Her ration is to be increased to $12.00 per month for making this small stretch of land available.\nOttawa, 1st November, 1945.\n\nMr. E. Arsenault, Indian Agent, Restigouche, Quebec.\n\nI understand from a report from Mr. Morris that he has authorized you to purchase a hot water tank for the Maria School. As it is evident from his report this tank is needed immediately, I trust you have arranged for this purchase and installation.\n\nI also note from the report that Mr. Morris authorized the moving of toilets to another site. I hope you have arranged for this work.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nThe present is to inform the Department that the 14 desks ordered for the Maria Indian Day School are for children of 6, 7 years of age.

I notice by the plans that there are no doors in the classroom and that these openings are wider than the opening of the door leading to the hallway. This would require framing. I wish, therefore, to have an estimate of the cost of this work including labour and material. I wish also to draw your attention to the fact that this will bring the two doors close to each other, both openings on the inside which should be avoided whenever possible. Would there be any other way in which this nuisance could be avoided or diminished?\n\nAfter receiving this information I will be able to give this matter further consideration.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| Nov. 22 | 10 lbs floor wax for Maria Ind.

We could use a drapery, this would bring a partial remedy to the situation.\n\nThe classroom opening is exactly the same size as the hallway opening. No framing will be required but a 2-inch trimming to stop the door. Door will open inside.

Together we examined the well in order to find a solution to prevent the dampness which is causing mouldiness around the side of the well. We have decided to install a 3\" pipe from the top into the well in order to give ventilation.\n\nAs for the teachers carrying water from the neighbours for the pupils, I am not ready to digest such statement, because I have given authority to the sisters, to the principal to hire a man to carry water and I have suggested to take the junior until the well was fixed, therefore if the sisters carried water they did it on their own and should not register this as a complaint.\n\nI understand that the Dept. gave authority for an expenditure of about $31.90 for installing sinks & sewage at this school. Since this date, every effort has been done to find the necessary material to perform the work, I have been fortunate to find the sink & double tub, but it is impossible to find the 4\" pipe we need for the sewage, nevertheless I have good hope to locate the necessary material to install the sink with hot and cold water, now to the end of the week.\n\nThe new sewage that we have to build will be done only next spring on account of the reasons mentioned above, lack of material. For this fall the sink will be connected to the old sewage. The expense\nfor the cleaning of the well and the ventilator will be charged on the amount of $321.90 already authorized. I presume that all these expenditures may be classified as Re: water system.\n\nI wish to point out that the water was inspected last year by an official of the Health Unit Office New-Carlisle and the test proved that the water was potable. When the sisters complained about the taste of the water, my first thought was that it could be due to the natural taste of water in different district, but on the second complaint I went down the cellar and opened the well in order to find the cause.\n\nWe came to the conclusion that it was due to the mouldiness caused by the dampness. As stated in previous paragraphs steps are being taken to overcome this situation.\n\nHoping these informations will be to your satisfaction.\n\nE. Arseneault\n(E. Arseneault)\nIndian Agent.\n\ncc.\nOttawa, 5 December 1946.\n\nMr. E. Arsenault, Indian Agent,\nRESTIGOUCHE, Quebec.\n\nWe have received your letter of the 28th ultimo with reference to the Maria Day School.\n\nThe Department approves your action in cleaning the well and installing a ventilator. It is also noted that you have connected the sink to the sewage system.\n\nBernard F.

Without having any experience regarding the digging of wells, I think a deepness of about 40 to 50 feet would be sufficient; though it is not an affirmation. Necessary pipes for inside the casing will have to be bought and also a suction pump.\n\nWould you please authorize immediately (if possible) an approximate amount of $300.00 for the job. Mr Arsenault has many wells to dig at present, but he would be ready to come anytime in August.\n\nYour immediate answer would be appreciated.\n\nWork on the sewage is already started.\n\nE. Arsenault, Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Auto Knitter for Maria Ind. School.\n\nReferring to previous correspondence in connection with the above mentioned subject, I wish to inform you that the Auto Knitters & Hosiery Limited of Montreal, would be willing to give the amount of $10.00 for our old knitting machine, deduction on the purchase of a new one at the cost of $80.00 F.O.B. Montreal.\n\nIn a letter received from the company dated August 16th, they state that they have at present an over-production and they can not give more than $10.00 for the old one.\n\nPlease inform as soon as possible what I have to do.\n\nEdgar Arsenault,\nAgent.\nRestigouche, September 15 1947\n\nI wish to point out that I have not yet received any answer to my letter of July 28 asking authority for the digging of a well at the Maria Indian Day School. Your decision would be appreciated.\n\nE. Arseneault, Indian Agent.\nOttawa, September 22nd, 1947.\n\nMr. E. Arsenault, Indian Agent,\nRestigouche, P.Q.\n\nWe have your letter of the 15th instant referring to your previous letter of July 28th regarding the well for the Maria Day School. At the time we received your previous letter we thought that Mr. Doucet might have an opportunity of visiting your school but owing to other duties he will not be able to go to Restigouche for several weeks.\n\nThe cost of drilling a well is uncertain as it is not possible to estimate the depth at which water can be obtained.\n\nIt is noted from your letter that by digging a well, water can be obtained at approximately eighteen feet. We think another well should be dug which will involve a much less expenditure. In this event, you should use cement tile for casing and place the cement tile on the well so as to avoid foreign matter reaching the water. The outside of the tile should be filled in with gravel and sand.\n\nBernard F.

I\nunderstand that already a lot of correspondence has been exchanged\nin this regard, and yet the Superintendent has not received final\nauthority to go ahead with this project.\n\nSuperintendent Arsenault also brought up the question\nof the well at the Maria Day School. I suggested that if he used\n30\" cement pipes he could easily dig a well there with Indian labour\nand have sufficient water to furnish the School. This, I think,\nwould be about the cheapest way, as there does not appear to be\nany well diggers around that part of the country.

The public put up $25,000.00 by the purchase of co-operative shares. When this amount is obtained the Provincial Government will make available $75,000.00 so that each co-operative unit has a capitalization of $100,000.00.\n\nNon-shareholders cannot obtain electrical service unless there is surplus power. Before His Majesty, in right of Canada, under a co-operative scheme may obtain electric service it must be a shareholder and in this instance it will be necessary that the shares in question be purchased. These should be taken out in the name of His Majesty in right of Canada and upon their issue it will be possible for the Maria School to obtain electric service.\n\nIt is therefore suggested that you approve of the attached proposal.\n\nDepartmental Solicitor.\nAugust 11, 1948.\n\nMr. E.

Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nAugust 11, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. Gendron:\n\nRe: Well at Maria School.\n\nShould it be necessary to have another well dug, I would suggest that very careful consideration be given to its position. Some time in the near future, it might be necessary to enlarge the Maria School, in order to provide more accommodation for the teachers.

Neary:\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAttached please find vouchers covering work done at the Maria Indian Day School, this work having been authorized by Mr. A.J. Doucet, Supervisor of Vocational Training, and by Mr. J.E. Gendron, Supervisor of Indian Agencies for Quebec and New Brunswick.\n\nThe work on well, and also covering cement top on man-hole with gravel to prevent breakage was the authorization of Mr. Gendron. Installation of electric pump, changes in lighting of classrooms, together with additional outlets, also doors on classrooms, was authorized by Mr. Doucet, when he last visited the school in November.\n\nThe water system seems to be a success, with plenty of good water, the electric pump is working fine, I therefore do not anticipate any further trouble as regards the water supply.\n\nThe lighting in the classrooms was not strong enough, there was also a lack of lights in other parts of the building, this has now been remedied.\n\nThe doors were a necessity, in that there was no separation between entrance hall and classrooms.\n\nThe porch over the front entrance was also a necessity, as after every storm the entrance was blocked up with snow, and, as this door swings outward there were times when it had to be shoveled out before it could be opened, the addition of the porch has cured this.\nThe work in connection with clogged sewer was undertaken by myself, this being more or less an emergency. I regret to say however that it was not a success, and we will have to have it dug up in the Spring. This apparently was a botch job in the first instance, and from information obtained from one of the men who worked on it, I do not think it will be successful until adjustments are made. I am attaching herewith a sketch which shows point of defect.\n\nI remain, Sir,\n\nYours very truly\n\n(C.R. Hadeau) Supt.\nRestigouche Indian Agency.\n23rd March, 1949.\n\nMr. C.R. Nadeau,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nRestigouche, P.Q.\n\nWe have your letter of the 16th instant enclosing accounts in connection with the improvements to the electrical system and the water supply at the Maria Indian Day School.

The School and the other buildings described in Mr. Beaulieu's estimate are in a very poor condition. The amount shown for labour only seems to be high, however and as stated by Mr. Beaulieu, several windows needs to be reputtied, doors readjusted, doors and window sills repaired etc. Mr. Beaulieu also stated that this job could be done cheaper by using lower grade material, one coat of paint and fast labour, on the other hand, with the material of first class quality two coats and supervised labour, Mr. Beaulieu guarantees his job for 5 to 10 years.\n\nKindly advise if the Dept. is in a position to have this job done this summer. As stated above the buildings needs painting very badly and as these buildings are situated near the Provincial Highway, it is obvious for anyone to notice by their appearance that there is lack of maintenance.\n\n(C.R.Nadeau) Supt.  \nRestigouche Indian Agency.\nAugust 23rd, 1949.\n\nMr. C.R.

Everywhere they give complete satisfaction. They are also known in foreign countries.\n\nThey are solidly constructed from highest grade yellow birch, all joints being tenoned and mortised and strongly bolted. All are finished in natural wood color, highly varnished.\n\nBuilt for heavy as well as for light work they are very popular for domestic weaving. Everything from heavy rugs to light cloth tissues can be woven with the greatest ease on a \"LECLERC\" loom. The peacock's tail shape treadle control centers the pull on the harness and thus simplifies the general operation of the loom.\n\nThe brake that is fixed to the back beam prevents to keep the exact tight on the warp. It consists of a screw bar running from the front to the rear which acts directly on a steel ring placed around the back beam. The ring being tightened on beam, take up the slack when the cloth is advanced and stop the beam to spread out, but permits to wind the cloth at will. It eliminates the necessity of continually going around to the rear to adjust the warp, what happens when there is no brake.\n\nIn setting up the loom the brake is set slack and then tightened as the work progresses.\n\nLooms are shipped assembled except for the two roller supports and pedals which are adjusted ready to be attached to looms. All other accessories are shipped ready to be put into operation.\n\nOUR PRICES ARE LOW BECAUSE YOU BUY DIRECTLY FROM THE MANUFACTURE\n**Requisition for School Material**\n\n**Date**\n\n**For [Indian Day] School [Marina, Brevardshire County Agency]**\n\n**NOTE:** Teachers should secure from the Department of Education of the Province in which the Indian School is located, a list of the text books authorized for use in the white schools.

Ross of Barrie June 3rd.\n\nYou will hereafter find the list of the equipment necessary for such training. Such is the outfit we generally have.\nin our household training schools for a limited number of pupils.\n\nRegarding the kitchen outfit, I would be exceedingly grateful if you could send the money to myself so I could choose the proper articles so as to arrange the present needs.\n\nPrices were taken from catalogs in hand and from inquiries made in Campbellton & Mont. Joli shops.\n\nAs you understand, I would go myself for the purchase as soon as I receive your grant and I will make everything ready for the opening of school.\n\nIf this does not meet your approval kindly let me know and I will be ever ready to meet your will and act accordingly.\n\nI think you know that the first valuable shop here is about three miles from the school and the agent is not quite at hand yet.\nFor that reason and having no funds whatever, I should greatly appreciate a grant of $10.00 or $15.00 dollars, however money, so I could order by mail.\n\nVery devotedly Yours,\n\nSister Mary of Mercy Conne\nIndian Day School\nMaria - Bonaventure County\n\nE. M. R. A. Hoey\nOttawa,\nSeptember 13, 1941.\n\nDear Sister:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th ultimo enclosing requisition for a large amount of supplies for the Maria Indian Day School. While it is true that the Department is desirous of encouraging vocational training at all our schools, and it is evident that you forwarded your requisition with this in mind, I would point out that in the appropriation for the current fiscal year no provision was made for the very heavy expenditure that would be necessary if the articles shown on your requisition were purchased. It is impossible for us to incur expenditures unless the funds have been specifically provided and consequently you will realize that favourable consideration cannot be given to your request at the present time.\n\nThere is a further consideration; namely, that as Sisters are only starting in this school this year I believe that it would be preferable to proceed slowly during the academic year 1941-42 as this will give you an opportunity to study the capabilities of the students and you will be in a better position next year to decide what new courses should be followed during the academic year 1942-43.\n\nIt has been decided to allow an amount of $40.00 for purchase of materials for plain sewing. You may also purchase 6 pairs of small scissors, 3 pairs of medium sized scissors, 3 measuring\n\nSister Mary of Mercy,\nPrincipal,\nMaria Indian Day School,\nMaria, Que.\ntapes, 24 thimbles and 24 sets of knitting needles. This is the only expenditure that we can authorize this year in connection with vocational work but, as mentioned above, it will give you an opportunity of ascertaining the manner in which the pupils will respond to this training. Payment of the expenditure authorized in this letter will be made on receipt from you of a properly certified account in triplicate which will be forwarded to you through the office of Mr. Indian Agent Cyr.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, September 6, 1941.\n\nDr. W.

There is very little space to store wood in the furnace room. When wood has to carried in iced and wet, it is very dirty and heating is not so good.\n\nWhile I was there, an estimate was prepared by a dependable person for the construction of suitable wood shed, back of the school:\n\n- Size - 18'x24' x 8' post wall\n- Roof - shingles\n- Sides - Clapboard-with door and lock\n- Foundation - Concrete, 1' above ground\n- Paint - All outside woodwork\n\nEstimated cost $275.00\n\nJude Thibault\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nQuebec Inspectorate\n17/11/17\n\n[Signature]\n\n20th Annual Indian Day School, Sept. 21st, 1941\n\nMr. R. H. Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare Training.\n\nKind Sir,\n\nYour appreciated letter authorizing the purchase of scissors, thimbles, measuring tapes, and knitting needles finds me grateful. I also thank you for the grant of $40.00 for materials. I must tell you that I felt disappointed at not having a sewing machine, a stove and a few pots and utensils. Basing my promise on the fact that the Department had asked a list of capable of holding a household learning class, I had promised the bigger girls they could follow such course. I will be losing much of my influence over them by deceiving them. So I have decided\nTo get the loan of an old stove and a few pots to give at least a few lessons for a beginning. Next year, I know you will provide a regular outfit and we shall give regular lessons.\n\nI still hope that the sewing machine will be wanted in a near future. We can hardly do without it; hand-sewing is so little practiced now and children soon get disgusted at it.\n\nWith repeated thanks,\n\nI beg to sign,\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nSister Mary of Mercy, Principal\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nOctober 3, 1941\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Maria Indian Day School\n\nVOTE: 76 Allotment: 12-415\n\nSHIP TO: Rev.

I am very pleased that orders have been given to the sisters to train the students girls weaving, sewing and knitting; they are provided with very nice and large room for these purposes. Unfortunately they have no weaver and no sewing machine and I would be very pleased if you could provide them with at least one weaver and one sewing machine as soon as possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. Alpheo Poirier M.P.,\nMember for Bonaventure.\n\nJAP/YB\nOttawa, October 15, 1941.\n\nDear Mr. Poirier:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 10th instant, in which you ask that a sewing machine and a weaving loom be purchased for the Maria Indian Day School.\n\nA requisition has been sent forward to the Purchasing Agent for a sewing machine. This machine should reach the school in the course of a few days. I regret that the funds at our disposal are not sufficient at the moment for us to buy a large loom. We are, however, transferring a small loom to the Maria School from Caughnawaga. We feel sure that this small loom will be suitable to provide elementary instruction in weaving.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ. Alpheo Poirier, Esq., M.

This will not interfere with playing, as there is plenty of ground left for that purpose. From the Highway fence, twenty feet wide and a depth of about seventy feet along the side fence, will, in my opinion be a good start and the expense light. The purchase of a few garden tools is also recommended for next Spring.\n\nRegarding domestic science, in the girls' room, I have recommended a cupboard to be built, with shelves, to lock away all sewing materials, supplies, etc., as no such provision had been made when the building was erected; a table, about ten feet long by three feet wide is needed to cut cloth and to make over any clothing from army supplies which are being sent to the Agency. The Sisters are most anxious to teach the girls how to make over such clothings.\n\nWhile I was there, the Agent received permission to purchase chairs for the girls' room in the basement of the school.\n\nMay I hope that the Department will approve my recommendations above:\n\n- Ploughing of school garden, this Fall\n- Large table for girls' work room (estimated $10.)\n- Cupboard in basement (estimated $15.)\n- Garden tools for pupils' garden\n\nAgent told me that a requisition was sent about two months ago for rubbers for school children, wool for knitting, etc., but to date, none of these supplies had been received.\n\nChief Abraham Martin and a few others, complained that they were not on the fuel wood list; they were told to clear up the old wood lot where I was informed, there remains from 65 to 75 loads of wood which could be cut.\n\nI was also informed that our order for 120 cords of 48\" slabs, would start to be delivered to Indians whose names are on the list recommended by the Inspector and approved by the Department.\n\nJude Thibault,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nQuebec Inspectorate\nOttawa,\nNovember 30, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMr. A.J. Doucet of the Training Division will reach Campbellton, N.B., on the Ocean Limited at 10:30 a.m. Wednesday, November 25.\n\nI should appreciate it if you would meet him and take him to the Maria Reserve where he intends to spend two or three days.\n\nMr. Doucet has recently joined the staff of this Branch and was formerly in charge of a large vocational school in Western Canada. He will be able to discuss curriculum with the teachers of the Maria School and make certain suggestions with regard to the Department's desire to have vocational training receive proper attention.\n\nI feel certain that Mr. Doucet's visit will be conducive of much good at the Maria School and I have no doubt that the teachers will carefully consider his suggestions and make every possible effort to put them into active operation.\n\nFollowing his visit to Maria he will spend two or three days with the teachers of the Restigouche Indian Day School and his work at Restigouche will be along the same lines as at Maria. You should notify the teachers of the Restigouche School accordingly. It will not be necessary for you to advise the teachers of the Maria School as a copy of this letter is being sent to them.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDr. A.

Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare Training,\nOttawa\n\nHonorable Sir:\n\nI am sending a few samples of the children's work, not that I mean that the work is perfect but to show that those dear little ones are willing to profit by the lessons and training they receive.\n\nConsidering that none of them could sew, and that only two knew how to hold knitting needles, you will admit that their application and skill are somewhat remarkable. Mr. Doucet saw the very beginning, I think he will find improvement.\n\nOf course, they have to be guided very closely, but it is only a pleasure to do so when they are willing to learn.\n\nThe dresses and other garments are made out...\nof old units rent by the Department with the addition of a little trimming.\n\nI wish you could have seen what a job it was to rip, wash, iron and press the material before using it. These baths were hardly sufficient to obtain a decent cleanliness; the task was made harder owing to the fact that we had not the equipment for such work; no washing machine, no tub, no pail or iron. We had to borrow all that which were lent only when the owner did not use them of course.\n\nYou know how very much I'm the Maria school this year and you may believe that teachers and pupils are grateful. We have done something also. So many things are needed for a start in order to bring out the work to some success\u2014considering there were only the bare walls when we started the work; we have fitted there some $20.00 of ours. The children being so enthusiastic we thought it a duty to walk in the footsteps of their good will and the moment was propitious to make them understand they ought to do something for themselves and not always depend on the Department. Of course this will be installed little by little.\n\nWe have quite a few pieces made and we are willing to prepare some more would the Department find means to provide us with\na couple of tubs and pails and a set of irons\nas also a few yards of lining, trimming material\n& doz of belt buckles and a few packages of dye.\n\nI don't think money will thereby be ill spent\u2014\n\nIt is surprising to see how children and even\nparents try to imitate at home what is done\nin the sewing class. Some big girls not coming\nto school\u2014have asked to follow the course.\n\nHoping you will not find we are asking too\nmuch and that we are working in the interest\nof the Department and thanking you for past favors\n\nI beg to sign,\n\nYour grateful & respectful servant,\nSister Mary of Mercy Boone.\nCopy sent to Mr. Cyr\n\nOttawa,\nMarch 13, 1942.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 6th instant, it is a source of great satisfaction to the Department to know that the work is progressing so well at the Maria School and that the pupils appear so keenly interested. You may purchase 2 tubs and pails, a set of irons, a few yards of lining, trimming material, half a dozen buckles and a few packages of dye. It is expected that you will purchase these as reasonably as possible. You should obtain the account in triplicate and hand it to Indian Agent Cyr who will attach it to proper voucher forms and forward for payment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

(RG 10, Volume 6092, file 318-11, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nThey have been taught how to make a button-holes, how to mend etc.\n\nAnd to show that these ladies were not useless & bring out the fact of 2 special girls who during vacation went out and made beautiful dresses for their younger sisters, one taking pieces left over of 2 different colours because to build up a third one (of beautiful arrangement) for a baby-sister. Notice that in families women try and make use of small odds as we do at school.\n\nSome young ladies asked to be taught tailoring sewing and knitting and very willingly did I accept them.\n\nThis brings me to the conclusion that we must give wider wings to our work, in the interest of the people here and in the interest of the Department. We make here little dresses quoted $1.25 to $2.75 at Eaton's for $6.65-4. Of course, to carry on the work on a wider scale we would need a little more material and outfits. This\nin the same way with the affection\nof Mr. & Mrs. Smith, our new agent,\nwho has seen the children's wants and\nat once I confidently ask a grant of\n$50.00\n\nA second hand sewing machine would\nalso be a great help. One for $15.00\nwould be insufficient. Time was being\nwasted in buying them time to use the machine.\n\nWould you kindly send the Agent\nsome flannel and other materials so\nyou do for Fort Smith, we could have\nour share at school and therefore under-\nwear etc., with less loss than anything\nwe need or two to distribute to families.\nwhich leaves a quantity of left over cloth\nwhile getting an a long piece pattern\nis quoted to leave only little time.

We feel that it is impossible to overemphasize the value of vocational instruction and practical training in the courses provided by the Department for Indian boys and girls.\n\nIt is my intention to ask the Purchasing Division for a new sewing machine for your school and a certain amount of flannelette will be purchased for you by the Welfare Division. I am anxious that you should do everything humanly possible to encourage the Indians, particularly Indian boys and girls whose parents may be gainfully employed, to make a contribution, no matter how small, to these projects. For example, it might be possible, in some cases, for the Indian parents to purchase the material, on the understanding that the actual task of making dresses or clothing of any kind would be undertaken as part of the school work. In dealing with Indians I have learned from experience that it is comparatively easy to drift into a condition whereby Indians expect not only their education, medical care and relief allowances to be provided free, but also their clothing and even amusements, regardless of the opportunities that may arise from time to time for them to become self-supporting. This policy, in my judgment, invariably leads to the demoralization of the Indian population, just as our relief policy of a few years ago led to the demoralization of the white population. I feel confident, however, that as you gain in experience at the school you will be careful to safeguard against these dangers. It has occurred to me that you might use, very profitably and very effectively, in your vocational courses, a large amount of the\n\nSister Mary of Mercy,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Day School,\nMaria, Que.\n\np.t.o.\ndiscarded military clothing now available for use at our schools.\n\nMay I express the hope that the coming academic year will be also one of real progress and accomplishment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

The price of the can-sealers would also be taken on the amount granted.

Of course they don't pay what it costs, still it's a help and a saving.\n\nWe did not ask anyone from the Department this year and told the children they had to provide for themselves, which a certain number did. Don't you think this is educational in the way you expect?\n\nOf course this is labor work and we have to be patient and bear the people's complaints.

This information was conveyed to her in a letter dated September 26. If an additional amount of $10.00 is urgently needed, you are authorized to spend this amount. In view of the fact that we purchased a sewing machine, however, for this school it was our hope that $40.00 would be sufficient.\n\nWould it be possible to have all requests for supplies, equipment, repairs, etc., in connection with the Maria School sent forward to the Department by you? This is the procedure followed at all other schools in the Dominion. The fact that we are in communication constantly with the Member of Parliament, the Principal of the school and the Indian Agent at Maria is very confusing and invariably leads to a great deal of unnecessary correspondence.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Sister Mary of Lercie, the Principal of the Maria Indian Day School, informed the Department her intention to buy a Can Sealer to demonstrate to the pupils and the Indian ladies the advantage of the \"canning\"; she did not receive any definite answer from your Department if she was authorized to do this purchase.\n\nAfter having taken informations from different Companies, the Principal of the School has located a good Can Sealer (the last one there was on the market) for a moderate cost, and she bought it.\n\nThis fall, many pupils, boys and girls, and many ladies of the Maria Reserve, went to the School at the request of the Principal, and they have shown a great interest by realizing the way it goes and the advantages given by a Can Sealer.\n\nOn my opinion, this purchase is justified and I am assured the Indians could take a great advantage of the demonstrations given to them. It is why, I would ask the Department to pay this account, because if this amount is taken from the $40.00 granted for the Manuel Training (girls) the balance will be not sufficient to cover the expenses for the whole year.\n\nHoping those explanations will be considered and that the Department will accept my demand.

Arsenault, Farming Instructor, Maria, Que.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd instant, regarding the account of Philias Cadorette, payment to the amount of $10.25 has already been made for the spinning wheel.\n\nHowever, Mr. Cadorette requests an additional $1.04 for freight on the wheel. Before we can pay this account we will have to have a receipt from the railway company and we so advised Mr. Cadorette in a letter dated December 4. You should again communicate with him and ask him to obtain from the railway company a receipt for $1.04 which you should forward to this office.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMaria, December the 22nd, 1942.\n\nMr R. A. Hoey, Supt. of Welfare & Training, Ottawa,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 14th of December, I enclose herewith a receipt of $1.04 for transportation of a spinning wheel from St-Hyacinthe to Maria. This has been received from Mr Philias Cadorette the dealer.\n\nEdgar Arsenault, Farming Instructor.\nMaria Indian Day School Feb. 21st 1943\n\nTo Mr. R. A. Hope,\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs Branch\nOttawa\n\nKind Mr. Hope:\n\nI wish to thank you for all you have done for the Maria Indian Day School during the last term. All was appreciated both by teachers and pupils who are doing their very best to correspond to what is done for them.\n\nLately we had a distribution of about 157 pieces of their own made; they were dresses, boots, bonnets, scarfs, stockings, underwear and baby clothes. We have sent 5 or 6 pairs of games to the Military Officer in Quebec as requested by yourself.\nConsidering that the girls of the Junior class are not so in number, you will admit that they are very active.\n\nOut of the unsewed and discarded there are remnants that are unusable unless woven for blankets etc., and there is the need of a house. Nothing is thrown away, everything, even the smallest shavings of material have been saved for the purpose.\n\nA loan has been promised last year. I heard by M. Alp. Bonner M.P., one was coming, but we never got it. I think you will only be too glad to learn that we are wishing to undertake weaving work with our girls and probably some ladies would like it also.\n\nCooking is mentioned at the meeting tomorrow. I have provided a stove but a few pots, pans and tools would be required to give demonstrations of plain and economical cooking.\n\nThe Indians would certainly save much by not buying so many cans of preserved and ready food. Would you grant $20.00 for the purpose?\nwe would try and do with the most necessary articles although I know we can't get much for that amount; prices have been rising considerably.\n\nA small ward-robe would be necessary to keep garments clean and in order as they are made until distribution day. $8.50 or $10 would be about the cost of such.\n\nYou probably don't know that no porch is attached to the school door and that 4 inches is the only space between it and the steps which lead to the classroom. The consequence is that the pupils coming in crowds, all shivered up, jam at the door, trying to shake off the snow and being obliged to keep the doors opened too long a time, the heat goes out and the cold comes in. Should a side building be attached to that side of the house it would serve both to the pupil's entrance and to a kitchen for the sisters. As it is now in the kitchenette the pump is exactly 20 inches from the left-hand, at the other end just the floor for the door to open. Sideways there are 6 feet.\nbetween the table adjusted to the partition and the\ngirne. The reservoir being only 2 x 4 ft., the\nsanitary has to pump several times a day,\nand then the work is delayed in her work\nbeing unable to take the necessary things\nin the cupboard\u2014pantry which is but one\u2014\nthe \"pump\" filling up the space between\nit and the pump.\n\nAll this is submitted to your kind attention\nand we shall be grateful and satisfied for anything\nyou can do, remembering how kindly you have\ntreated us so far.\n\nI have been trespassing on your kindness to\nsend such a long letter. All this was to be explained\nverbally to Mr. Dorset as well as the elaboration\nof a program for the vocational class, but to our\ngreat disappointment, he did not visit us.\n\nWith respectful regards\u2014\n\nI remain,\n\nYour humble servant,\n\nSister M. of Mercy, Prince\n\nEdgar Greenaway\nDear Sister:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, with reference to the Maria Indian Day School. You may expend an amount not exceeding $20.00 in buying the articles required to teach cooking.\n\nYou may also purchase a new cupboard at a cost not exceeding $10.00.\n\nI have noted your suggestion regarding the erection of a porch. Either Mr. Doucet or Inspector Thibault will visit the Maria School within the next few months and at that time the matter can receive further consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nSister Mary of Mercy,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Day School,\nMaria, Que.\nHouse of Commons\nCanada\n\nOTTAWA, ONT.\nMarch 30th, 1943.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe sisters teaching at the school of the Indian Reserve of Maria wrote to you on the 21st of February, and the superior of the school sent me a copy of her letter to you.\n\nI remember, indeed, that a loan has been promised to the sisters but they never got it. I would be very thankful to you if you could provide the sisters with a loan and I must say that that will be in the interest of the pupils of the Indian Reserve.\n\nI would also recommend that a certain amount be granted to them to buy pots, pans, and also a wardrobe.\n\nHoping that you will give your best attention to this request, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. ALPH\u00c9E POIRIER M.P.\n(Bonaventure)\n\nJAB/MFL\nOttawa, April 5, 1943.\n\nDear Mr. Poirier:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 30th ultimo, authority has already been given to the Indian agent to purchase the pots, pans, etc., requested by the teacher in charge of the Maria Indian Day School.\n\nI cannot find any record of having previously promised to supply a loom to this school. As a matter of fact, our information is that there is not sufficient accommodation in the school for a loom. However, one of our inspectors will be visiting Maria in the near future and at that time he will discuss the matter with the Reverend Sisters.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ.

We have found of our two sewing machines, of our spin wheel, and we hope that the knitting machine you promised us will soon come, so we'll start knitting in Dept. for winter wear.\n\n(Sgd.) Secretary of Ministry,\nPrincipal\nMaria, August the 19th, 1943.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Agricultural & Manual Training Courses.\n\nThe present is to ask the Department the authorization to begin my agricultural and Manual Training courses in the month of October. The reasons are the following:\n\nDuring the month of September the majority of the oldest pupils are working at the digging of potatoes. And myself I will be busy to the supervision to put the potato seed in the Department cellar. It is my intention also to obtain the authorization for the erection of a root cellar for the Restigouche Reserve; the crop this year has a very good appearance in both reserves.\n\nDuring the month of September, I have also to prepare the organization of the two fall fairs for Restigouche and Maria, and I ask at present the amount of $50.00 for Restigouche and $40.00 for Maria to cover the expenses and for the distribution of the prizes to the winners in each Reserve.\n\nLast year the fair we have had a Restigouche, has been a very great encouragement for the Indians and they expect to have one again this year.\n\nThe Indians of Maria Reserve asked me to organize a fair this fall in their Reserve, and I am sure they would be very glad of it.\n\nLast year they had only 14 gardens in the Reserve, and this year they have about 25, it is a good result.\n\nAt the end of September, about the 20th, I would like to take my regular holidays, because I have work to do for myself, and specially the hauling of my wood for winter time, and I expect the Department will accept to authorize them.\n\nHoping to receive soon your decision,\n\nEdgar Arsenault, Arm.

Consequently, very often the accounts are not prepared properly and I am obliged to look after it myself when I go down to Maria Reserve. It is one reason of the delay.\n\nI wish to point out that since I have on hand the work for the Family Allowances, I can not do all my office work on time, and at present I have still many letters and reports not answered. As you know, there is no doctor on the reserve, and myself and my wife, we are delivering drugs day and night; owing that I have no constable since few months, there is always some Indians at the Office to complaint against others and we can not do any office work during they talk.\n\nIf the Department requires another voucher for that payment of $24.10 please inform me.\n\nEdgar Arsenault, Agent.\nRequisition for School Material\n\nDate: August 26, 1945\n\nFor: Indian Day School Maria, S.

Ils sont robustes, solides et durables, tr\u00e8s simples \u00e0 manier, et donnent enti\u00e8re satisfaction. Partout ils sont connus, m\u00eame en pays \u00e9tranger.\n\nIls sont fabriqu\u00e9s en bois massif, parfaitement solides. Tous les joints sont faits \u00e0 l'aide de mortier de chaux, qui est une substance naturellement d\u00e9pourvue de toute qualit\u00e9.\n\nConstruits pour le gros ouvrage aussi bien que pour le travail d\u00e9licat, ils sont tr\u00e8s r\u00e9sistants et les travaux les plus difficiles y sont ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s, tels que la catalogue et le plus l\u00e9ger tissu peut \u00eatre tiss\u00e9 avec facilit\u00e9 sur les m\u00e9tiers \"LECLERC\".\n\nLa p\u00e9dale en forme ovale entra\u00eene directement les cadres et a pour effet de r\u00e9partir la r\u00e9sistance plus \u00e9galement sur les p\u00e9dales.\n\nLe frein nous permet de tendre la cha\u00eene de mani\u00e8re pr\u00e9cise et toujours uniforme sur la cha\u00eene. Il se compose d'une tige de fer \u00e0 vis, qui va d'avant \u00e0 l'arri\u00e8re du m\u00e9tier, tapiss\u00e9e par une roue de fer \u00e0 vis, qui tourne autour du tambour arri\u00e8re. Ce cercle de fer \u00e9tant press\u00e9 sur le tambour, il donne \u00e0 l'entra\u00eenement ainsi de trop d\u00e9rouler, tout en permettant de rouler le tissu \u00e0 volont\u00e9, sans avoir \u00e0 retourner \u00e0 l'arri\u00e8re pour r\u00e9gler la cha\u00eene, ce qui arrive lors qu'il n'y a pas de tissu.\n\nPour le montage de la pi\u00e8ce le tissu doit \u00eatre desserr\u00e9 et ensuite serr\u00e9 au besoin pour maintenir les mailles.\n\nLes m\u00e9tiers sont \u00e9quip\u00e9s de deux rouleaux, supportant les supports des rouleaux et les p\u00e9dales, lesquels sont ajust\u00e9s, pr\u00eats \u00e0 \u00eatre fix\u00e9s aux m\u00e9tiers. Tous les autres accessoires sont exp\u00e9di\u00e9s s\u00e9par\u00e9ment.\n\nNOS PRIX SONT BAS PARCE QUE VOUS ACHETEZ DIRECTEMENT DE LA MANUFACTURE.\n\nWeaving Looms and Accessories\n\n\"LECLERC\" weaving looms and accessories are designed for domestic as well as professional work, having been favourably known for their high quality for many years.\n\nHandicraft Guilds, Provincial Government Handicraft Schools and Missionary Women's Institutes all over Canada, as well as Missionary Schools abroad, use our weaving looms, because they are constructed of solid wood, perfectly sound. They are also known in foreign countries.\n\nThey are solidly constructed from highest grade yellow birch, all joints being tenoned and mortised and strongly bolted. All are finished in natural wood color, highly varnished.\n\nSuitable for heavy as well as for light work, the looms are very strong and durable. Everything from heavy rugs to light cloth tissues can be woven with the greatest ease on a \"LECLERC\" loom. The peacock's tail shape treadle connects the pull on the harness and thus lightens the general operation of the loom.\n\nThe brake that we fix to the back beam permits us to control the tension on the warp. It consists of a screw bar running from the front to the rear which acts directly on a steel ring placed around the rear beam. This ring, when tightened on beam, takes up the slack when the cloth is advanced and stops the beam to spread out, but actually allows the cloth to be pulled out without the necessity of continually going around to the rear to adjust the warp, what happens when there is no tension.\n\nIn setting up the loom the brake is set slack and then tightened as the work progresses.\n\nLooms are shipped assembled except for the two roller supports and pedals which are adjusted ready to be attached to looms. All other accessories are shipped ready to be put into operation.\n\nOUR PRICES ARE LOW BECAUSE YOU BUY DIRECTLY FROM THE MANUFACTURE.\nM\u00e9tier \u00e0 Tisser 90\"\n\nCe m\u00e9tier est \u00e0 quatre chevaux, compos\u00e9 de deux groupes de huit poulies chacun, travaillant avec un syst\u00e8me de deux tours de laines, une paire de montants, avec les hanches et les \u00e9paules de chaque c\u00f4t\u00e9, et des lames entre elles au centre et attach\u00e9es aux cadres par des cordes.\n\nCe m\u00e9tier est fait pour \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 en pouces de largeur.\n\nNo. 250 - M\u00e9tier de 90 pouces, sans \u00e9quipement.\nPrice $45.00\n\nNo. 251 - M\u00e9tier de 90 pouces, avec \u00e9quipement complet (y compris laine, fil, etc.)\nPrice $66.00\n\nNo. 252 - M\u00e9tier de 90 pouces, avec le m\u00eame \u00e9quipement que le No. 251, mais avec une cha\u00eene de 30 pouces.\nPrice $67.50\n\n90\" Hand Weaving Loom\n\nThis model has a heddle frame operating on pulleys.

D. McLean, Asst. Deputy and Sec. Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Indians of Manawan wish to have a summer school for their children, and also a mission school for their women. Seeing the good results coming from the school at Wemotaciing and Shawinigan, they envy, if I may say so, the lot of their neighbors. These Indians do appreciate the benefits of instruction that last year 2 or 3 families sent their children at Wemotaciing that their children might attend school, while others left their children with relatives for the same purpose.\n\nThe children at Manawan are more numerous than at Wemotaciing. As is customary with their tribe they wish to learn French.\n\nI hope, Sir, that you will kindly grant their request.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nManiwaki, Que.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I know you well enough, for\nhaving written you often, to hope that this is not your\nfinal answer. Dr. L.M. Cauley of the Dept. of Indian\nAffairs visited Maniwaki in Spring 1925 told the\nIndians that they would have schools if I applied\nfor them. I did not see Dr. Cauley, but he left his ad-\ndress with James Brown, a half breed, and said that\nyou would build over the school.\n\nIt would be a bad thing if the\nIndians lost confidence in the official visitors\nsent by your Department.\n\nYour servant in X\nRev.

Dr. Coulter, who visited Manawan last year, in his report to the Department, makes no reference to the opening of a school at this point.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Why then could you not find those funds today? What would have been possible in the situation above can be done today. Dr. Caulter is in Ottawa, it is easy to know from him what he said to the Manawan Indians last spring on the matter.\n\nPlease Sir, do not find me too troublesome, for I am speaking for the poorest Indians I am in charge of. They have a Reserve of 3 m., their hunting ground is spoiled and robbed by shantymen and white trappers; they are 70 m. from railroad.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sometimes they cannot paddle because creeks, rivers, and lakes are blocked with logs and booms. There are 2 clubs on their hunting grounds. The dams of the Quebec Steam Commission on the Manawan river destroy the beaver during the winter, and the fire-rangers travel on their ground from early spring till late in the fall. No wonder that they are poor and in rags. I consider that another year without school will be a heavy loss for them, for they are in great need to be taught by teachers, field instructors, that they may make a better use of the little they have and take care of it, for they do not know how to mend, patch, knit.\n\nSir, you cannot refuse to establish a school at Manawan; in refusing you will prolong the sufferings of your Indians. It seems to be the duty of the Department to comply with my request.\n\nSir, I know you have many ways to find money to pay the 2 teachers and even to help the construction of the school. If the Department has no funds required...\nfor the purpose, let the thing be done through charity's sake.\n\nPerhaps, Sir, you did not know the needs of the Manawan Indians, for if you had known, you would have granted the school the very first time I wrote, and I may even say you would have offered it yourself.\n\nYour Servant in Christ,\n\nRev. J. B. Guirard O.M.I.,\nManiwaki, Que.\nOttawa, April 30th, 1926.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th instant, in which you again urge that a school be conducted for the benefit of the Indian children residing at Manawan during the coming summer.\n\nThe funds at our disposal are limited and have been assigned to the various purposes for which they were provided by Parliament, and it is, therefore, regretted that we will be unable to comply with your request. Owing to the many demands, it will not be possible to provide funds for the purpose of conducting a school this coming summer. I shall be pleased, however, if you will draw this matter to our attention early in the year of 1927, when consideration will be given to providing the funds required to conduct this school during the summer of that year.\n\nWe have noted your report as to the changed conditions in the hunting grounds of these Indians and the difficulty they have in making a livelihood.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

In your letter dated April 30th, 1926, after telling me that nothing could be done for last summer, you say that you shall be pleased that this matter be drawn to your attention early this year.\n\nI hope I am on time today, and ask you again for two teachers for the Indians' children and women at Manawan, for the months of June, July, August and September.\n\nThese Indians, as you know, are very poor, and consequently ask the Department to build their schools.\n\nLast year they prepared\nLes Missionnaires Oblats\nde Marie Immacul\u00e9e.\n\nManiwaki, Que. 192\n\nThe frames for said schools. They are willing to help in the building of same, but, with the exception of the frames, they expect the Department to provide for the rest of the material required.\n\nAlways Yours in X\n\nRev. J.

Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, requesting that a summer school be continued during the period from June 1st to September 30th, next, for the benefit of the Indian children at Manawon.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, if you can arrange suitable accommodation for the carrying on of the classroom work and also arrange to provide living quarters for the teachers, the Department will approve of the carrying on of a school during the coming summer months. We cannot provide any grant towards the erection of a building in the case where a school is only conducted for a few months each year. If you can, as stated, arrange for the carrying on of the work at Manawon during the summer, the Department will allow salary at the rate of $90 per teaching month for the services of a teacher and $65 per teaching month for the services of an assistant who will perform field matron's duties. We will also provide classroom supplies and a small quantity of drugs. It is expected that, for the salary allowed, fully qualified teachers will be secured.\n\nIf you can arrange for the carrying on of the school this coming summer, I shall be pleased if you will submit the names, qualifications and experience of the teachers whom you recommend be appointed. Please also state what arrangements you have made for a suitable building for classroom purposes and also for boarding accommodation for the teachers.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

I thank you very much for it and for the favors already received.\n\nHowever, this sentence of your letter surprises and grieves me: \"We cannot provide any grant toward the erection of a building in the case where a school is only conducted for a few months each year.\"\n\nThis seems to be an argument for us, for our schools costing less than the others, they should have their share, at least, when it is nearly impossible to do otherwise.\n\nI have already built three schools and repaired a house for a fourth school at Obegowan and Wayqua, taking without asking the Department.\n\nIndian Affairs.

As you have in the past arranged for the services of the teachers for these schools, I would request that you inform the Department, as soon as possible, the names, qualifications, etc., of the teacher and assistant teacher whom you nominate at each of the above named summer Indian day schools.\n\nIn this connection I may say that Miss Marcienne Alie, Hull, Que., who was teacher at the Weymontaching School last summer, called at the Department yesterday, with a list of classroom supplies and drugs required. However, we have no information as to whether she is one of the teachers you would recommend be appointed for the coming summer. In considering the appointment of teachers, I would refer you to official letter dated March 8th, last, regarding the request of Mr. J. A. Crete, M. P., for the re-engagement of Miss Germaine Cote as teacher at Obedjiwan.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Jos. Guinard, O.M.I.,\nManiwaki,\nQue.\nMr. A.F.

Assistant\n\nAt Obedjiwan:\nMiss Laura Dionne.................. Teacher  \nMiss Juliette Larrance............. Assistant\n\nI believe you will have no objection to the approbation of their re-appointment for they are the same teachers as I had engaged last summer except for Miss Boisvenue as Miss Bertha Bruy\u00e8re cannot teach this summer.\nMiss Boisvenue has a diploma and also experience in teaching. She possesses both French and English as well as being a dressmaker. I am sure she will replace advantageously Miss Bruy\u00e8re.\n\nYours sincerely in M.I.,\n[Signature]\nFather Jos.E.Guinard O.M.I.\nOttawa, May 5, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, nominating teachers for the Indian Summer Schools at Manouan, Weymontaching and Obedjiwan for the coming summer months, to begin duties on June first, next.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of their appointment, as follows:\n\nManouan:\nMiss Ursule Bordeleau, Teacher.\nMiss Oliva Richard, Assistant.\n\nWeymontaching:\nMiss Marcienne Allie, Teacher.\nMiss Therese Boivinme, Assistant.\n\nObedjiwan:\nMiss Laura Dionne, Teacher.\nMiss Juliette Lafrance, Assistant.\n\nSalary at the rate of $90 per teaching month will be allowed to the teacher in charge and $65 per teaching month to the assistant teacher.\n\nI would request that you inform the above teachers of their appointment and arrange with them to commence duties on or about June first, next. The schools should remain in operation until the end of September of this year.\n\nThe teacher at each school should prepare the usual return, on the form for that purpose, showing attendance, days taught, etc., and state thereon the post office address. The returns should be forwarded to the Department at the end of each month, in order that payment of the salary due can be made. The assistant teacher also should prepare a brief statement, showing the work performed each month. On the first returns forwarded, the teachers should state definitely the date on which they began duties, and, when submitting the final returns at the end of September, they should state, also, the date on which the schools were closed.\n\nIt is hoped that the teachers will meet with success in the work during the coming summer and that there will be a regular attendance of the Indian children of school age.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

They say:\n\n1\u00b0 That will help us to get away earlier to our hunting grounds, so that we will be able to hunt bears and also to buy and keep the whole harvest from coming on our land.\n\n2\u00b0 Early in spring, fish is more numerous around the school.\n\n3\u00b0 Our children will pick up berries earlier in fall.\n\nTo these motives, I will add: at the end of the summer all Indians are anxious to go back in the bush and always some families do not wait the closing of the classes.\n\nIf you give your approbation to their request, I will let it known as soon as possible, for the time is short.\n\nT.

Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, addressed to Mr. Sutherland of this Department, regarding the appointment of teachers for the Indian summer schools at Manousan, Weymontaching and Obedjiwan.\n\nIt is noted that you have re-engaged the same teachers as were employed at these schools last summer, and the Department will approve of their re-engagement, as follows:\n\nManousan:\nMiss Ursule Bordelais ... Teacher,\nMiss Philomene Drolet ... Asst. Teacher & Matron.\n\nWeymontaching:\nMiss Beatrice Foy ... Teacher,\nMiss Wilhelmine ... Asst. Teacher & Matron.\n\nObedjiwan:\nMiss Germaine Cote ... Teacher,\nMiss Juliette Lafrance ... Asst. Teacher & Matron.\n\nSalary at the rate of $90 per teaching month will be allowed to the teacher in charge and $65 per month to the assistant teacher and matron, less 10 percent, in each case, during the summer months of 1935.\n\nThe teacher at each school should prepare the usual returns showing attendance, days' taught, etc., stating thereon their post office addresses, and forward same to the Department at the end of each month, in order that payment of salary due can be made. The assistant teacher and matron should also prepare a brief statement showing the work performed each month. On the first returns forwarded, the teachers should state definitely the date on which they began duties, and when submitting the final returns they should also state the date upon which the school closed. These summer schools should reopen on the first of June, next, and remain in operation until the end of September, following. I would request that you advise the teachers accordingly and arrange with them to commence duties on or about the date mentioned.\n\nIt is hoped that there will be a regular attendance of the Indian children and that the teachers will meet with success in the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

It is understood that the Department's grant for this purpose will not exceed $720 and that there will be no teaching services this summer.\n\nYou should arrange to have receipted accounts, in duplicate, properly certified by yourself, presented to the Department in the fall. You will then be reimbursed to the amount of our grant. The Department would prefer receipts for materials rather than for labour or freighting. If, however, the materials do not cost $720, you should prepare a statement of the other expenses. It is hoped that the Indians will provide labour and that the buildings will be in readiness for the conduct of the school for the summer of 1928.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev.

E. Meilleur, and a Teacher named Miss. Savard living now at Sanmaur, Que., positively nothing along these lines or others could be charged or paid for by the Department unless covered by an authority in advance from the Department. Under certain circumstances I informed them we might consider under \"emergency\" replacement of a broken glass, a broken padlock, or replacement of a stove pipe, but such replacements would have to be submitted together with letter of explanations, any other material required etc., must be submitted 1 year ahead of time for approval. In the future these persons should have no excuses to offer along that line.\n\nI also communicated with Hudson's Bay Company to obtain a statement from their Manager at Manouan, who apparently assumed the task to put the bills through for payment.

As soon corrected copies are received, passed to your office, I had in mind to request payment be delayed for at least 3 months, this I believe should be an effective way to obtain better co-operation.\n\nFor your information, since assuming duty, I have made a special effort to stop all payments made by suppliers to 3rd parties on our account, for it was evident at the time this practice had become a common one, also without referring to the Department.\n\nYou may rest assured your request will receive very closest attention, as far as I know at present no one can offer an acceptable excuse in similar cases.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHerve Lariviere,\nIndian Agent.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**PAY TO:** Butten's Bay Company  \nSt. Lawrence District  \n100 McGill Street  \nMontreal, Que.\n\n**ADDRESS:**\n\n---\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| 1941 | Sept. 26, 1941 - Invoice attached to Re-Indian School Material | $46.07 |\n\n---\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\n---\n\nFORM No. I.A. 506\n\nAgent\n\nFebruary 11, 1941\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs.

Lariviere - Indian Agent.\nTo The Indian Affairs Branch, Dept. of M. & R., Ottawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Iancuan Indian Reserve\n\nWhen visiting this Reserve recently, the Indians drew attention to the fact that Rev. Ed. Meilleur had placed stakes north of teachers' house and that he claimed the ground as the property of the Mission; further this year there is a notice placed by Rev. Ed. Meilleur on the teachers' house stating that it is the property of the Mission.\n\nI understand that the school teachers' house and the school buildings on any of these Reserves were put up at the expense of the Department, particularly at Iancuan the Mission done considerable repairs on the teachers' house, which may be their grounds to claim.\n\nWhen at Weymontachie similar notices were put up by Rev. Ed. Meilleur, indicating that certain buildings are property of the Mission.\n\nI feel the ownership of any buildings on these Reserves should be settled, particularly buildings not owned by Indians, also limits of lands if any under location tickets.\n\nAt Iancuan there is a notice put up, allowing trespass on Reserve, between sun-rise and sun-set signed by ORDER, this notice if not issued by order of the Department, I feel it should be removed please advise.\n\n[Signature]\n\nN. Lemire - Indian Agent\nEX'D.\n\nThere is no record of a grant or lease of R.C.

This lumber we can store properly under cover at Manowan.\n\nAbove will cost about $1,200.00\n\n3.- Material required, mainly windows, door, roofing paper, etc., gather and ship what we can before freeze up, make up balance and ship in winter.\n\nAbove will cost about $1,200.00\n\nThis would leave little material for 1949 and the labor to complete the building.\n\nH.

If you prefer that this matter be handled\nin this way, I will expect to hear from you and will\nthen send you the money.\n\nUnfortunately, I have absolutely no authority\nto permit you to buy the lumber, windows, doors, etc.,\nby local purchase. As you know, all such requisitions\nmust be submitted to the Departmental Purchasing Agent\nand he alone can give authority for local purchase.\n\nI would, therefore, recommend that you send\nin immediately requisitions covering the building materials\nrequired and that these requisitions also include the\nnames of two or three firms whom you know are interested in\nthe supplying of these items.\n\nBernard F.

Education: Mr. B.F. Neary\n\nI must refer you to our Vouchers # 732 - $559.88 & # 733 - $560.31 in favor Abitibi Lumber Ltd., La Sarre, Que., this firm billed both lots in same car, our instructions were to bill as follows:\n\n\"Bill car from La Sarre to Oskelaneo\"\n\"on car lot rate. From Oskelaneo on\nCasey, to be re-billed on C.L. if\nacceptable, otherwise way-freight (L.C.L.)\nmarking lumber end loading: 1 end for Obedjiwan\nand the other end for Manawan.\n\nWhat they did, they loaded and marked as requested but billed as two different shipments entirely, refer to our Voucher No. 795 - $96.00 in favor of Canadian National Railways, Oskelaneo River, Que. which means we paid for both shipments, minimum car lot from La Sarre to Oskelaneo and from La Sarre to Casey, all told $196.00, there is I think margin for a claim on the C.N.R., for improper billing of a shipment.\n\nYou have in Ottawa all the documents necessary to file claim, refer to Vouchers listed here and our number 1067 - $100.00 settlement of freight on Casey.\n\nH. Lariviere - Supt. Indian Agency.\nJanuary 26th, 1949.\n\nTo The Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nAtt'n Mr. B. F. Neary, Supt. Education.\n\nFurther to our conversation when in Ottawa last, since I have prepared slowly to cover completion of Obedjiwan, Manowan and Mistassini schools.\n\nMr. Magnus Edwardson, who has been doing work for us on nursing stations and schools, is prepared to go in with others and do all this work this summer.\n\nConsidering, it is absolutely impossible to make arrangements for crews of men, their transportation, also supplies, at the last minutes; and to do these three jobs this summer it means rushing in immediately after break up and if possible before, that is last trips. I would appreciate authority to make arrangements to do this work on account season 1949-50.\n\nAs regard Waswanipi, it is only a matter of a man going in for about a month to complete details. Here, there is a plan underway to do some Indian houses, in any event some improvements. I estimate completion of the school will be possible probably through these other men, which means savings on transportation, etc.\n\nRequisitions for supplies are being prepared now and I hope to be able to submit by early February for spring delivery if you have funds available on present fiscal year, or for early summer delivery as a charge to 1949-50 appropriations. Our summer program is developing to a new high, that is very heavy, and if we experience too many delays we won't be able to carry it out. Our medical service alone calls for 6 to 7 nurses in the field. Here as you know everything has to be worked out in full details to put it over. This with other things we have only 3 or 4 months to do it. Needless to say we must be prepared in advance and everything must be timed well ahead.\n\n(Sgd) H.

We have looked into the matter already and will endeavour to do all of these buildings in 4\", which will allow a complete job, for permanent finish, interior and exterior.\n\nMr. Bondeau, Agency assistant, is going to supervise this work and other progress work.\n\nI anticipate men from Obedji an will be able to move to Manowan before end of this month.\n\nI spoke of this change from log to sawed timber to Mr. Doucet particularly and Mr. Gendron, with equipment on the Reserve we can do it to good advantage.\n\nAs regard 4\" timber, Mr. Gendron suggested 3\", since we have found out through the Colonization Department of Quebec, they are doing \"settlers jobs\" with 4\" for they found it much better all around.\n\nH.

It is assumed that this action conforms with the availability of local resources and with recognized conservation principles.\n\nBernard F.

Lariviere,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nAmos, P.Q.\n\nRe: New School at Manawan, P.Q.\n\nWith reference to your communication of the 9th instant and our reply of the 19th instant, I wish to add these further comments.\n\nOn Mr. Doucet's and Mr. Gendron's return, the matter of the kind of lumber to be used was discussed. From this discussion it is felt that a four-inch construction would be a great deal of waste. We would prefer that if at all possible, you should adopt the frame method of construction, i.e., 2 x 4's and sheeting. This will ensure you air space and will allow for insulation.\n\nYour comments on this would be appreciated.\n\nBernard F.

Neary, Esq., Supt. Education\nYour No. 319-5 (E3) August 10th, 1949\n\nYours came to hand, it is noted the Educational Survey Committee Members were satisfied with log construction in remote areas, the question of windows as discussed with them on the ground, since was adjusted. These jobs were first worked out on basis, our first conversation a few years ago, funds available, etc., cost and transportation.\n\nAs reg'rd Manowan, changes on equipment etc., transportation will be taken advantage of, this Reserve being more advanced, extra costs involved won't be much.\n\nAllow to take advantage of this letter to report on:\n\nMistassini: This job will be completed early September, with extra windows, visited Mistassini about 10 days ago. Job very satisfactory.\n\nObedjiwan: This job completed a few days ago men being moved to Manowan Reserve, Obedjiwan has the full size windows, set-up, is exceptionally nice, location etc., water supply should stand up to best we have on our reserves, pump in residence, lack of material prevented us, running water into school. Indians clearing ground for fire protection, play yard and beach.\n\nAttention: Mr. Doucet - teachers got real good work done by the boys, with tools, and the older girls made some very nice garments, clothing briefly being improved very much on this reserve, through our teachers.\n\nAt Mistassini, and Obedjiwan, certain minor details will be completed in 1950, could not hold crew waiting.\n\n..........................\nThrough the number of delays experienced in spring, etc., I doubt we will be able to complete before freeze up; however we will endeavour to stay in there until freeze up.\n\nH.

This is now completed, so all equipment will be well stored. The sawmill is being also covered for operations during bad weather and protection.\n\nI understand the Indians caused certain difficulties. They all wanted to stick close to Mill when in operations and so on. They more or less disputed the slabs. Very likely the spectators if asked to work, with time will disappear for immediate they all give a hand.\n\nIndians, the few employed, are being trained to do various jobs. We hope next Spring our local \"crew\" will be of real use.\n\n(Sgd.) H. Lariviere\nSupt. Indian Agency.\nOttawa, October 8, 1949.\n\nH.

In this way your Housing Appropriation, against which the original cost of producing the lumber is charged, is credited and the Education Division Appropriation is debited by the same amount.\n\nI am enclosing a sample copy showing how a voucher should be prepared covering a transaction of the nature mentioned above.\n\nWhen a voucher covering lumber sawed for the Education Division or for any other Division in the Service is submitted, a letter should be forwarded to the Welfare Division enclosing a copy of the same for purposes of record.\n\nH.

School - To complete exterior - interior covered.\n2. Residence - To complete exterior - interior covered - temporary - fully protected.\n3. Storage - Walls up.\n\nOwing to the fact it was possible to change type of construction from logs to sawed timber, not possible to make a frame standard job, it was done in 4 x 4\", except storage, rough lumber. At this time I do not know yet, what is our total cost against these buildings, however we are clearing now all charges and we hope by late December to establish our cost, order material to complete, so it will leave us if possible only labor for season 1950/51, and small sundry items.\n\nThis job, to complete requires, installing water system, my views on it are, regular well, with pressure tank unit and motor, to supply residence and school, sewerage is an easy matter to take care at Manowan. As regard finishing floors, I feel a permanent job should be made, we could use Asphalt Floor Tile, this would save painting and allow long life, easy upkeep and overcome the flooring covering problem, annual painting, exterior a finish with Insul Brick 2\" would be very suitable and as cheap as lumber overcome the painting end of it, interior Wallboard or equal painted (walls and ceilings) I would appreciate hearing from you.\n\nAs regard proposed new class room, as discussed with the Educational Committee, same size as present school (new) we provided site, we could do this job with greater ease in 1950, here a full size basement, to take care of woodwork training, etc.,...........\n\nIndian Affairs.

We provided in our appropriation an amount of $6,500.00. The balance in the appropriation, namely $64.00, is not sufficient to meet the following Vouchers which you have recently forwarded:\n\nVoucher #1054 - $319.78\n#1064 - $475.64\n\nTotal - $795.42\n\nIt is understood that you have now submitted Vouchers for all the expenditures that will be incurred for the construction of this school during the current fiscal year.\n\nWe will have to arrange a transfer of funds from some other project, and this will involve two or three weeks time, and therefore, Vouchers #1054 and #1064 cannot be paid until the transfer is effected.\n\nAs shown above, the total expenditures on this building to date are $7,231.42 ($6,436.00 plus $795.42). We have also received your requisition of December 1st requesting additional material at an estimated cost of $530.56, to which will be added the cost of shipping.\nThe situation at the present time, therefore, is as follows:\n\nExpenditures, fiscal year 1949-50 - $7,231.42\nAdditional material - $530.56\nShipping charges on materials (estimated) - $300.00\n\nTotal - $8,061.98\n\nWe would like you to advise us of the additional amount that will be required for wages to complete the building. We would also like to know if any additional materials will be required.\n\nIn view of the expenditures already incurred, and the additional amount that will be necessary, it would appear that the cost of this building will be in the neighbourhood of $10,000.00. As stated in the case of the Mistassini School, we feel that the expenditure has been very high, and we would appreciate having an explanation of the whole matter.\n\nPP/ST\n\nBernard F.

I have requested the parties to make specific complaints in a proper manner and I would investigate into their correctness\u2014but this has not been done.\n\nWhen visiting the School I found nothing in the Teacher's conduct deserving censure. It is true the children are not making much progress in learning but they cannot be expected to learn very rapidly, when the tuition is in English of which they understand not a word.\n\nUnless the teacher is conversant with the language of the scholars, the latter's progress will naturally be very slow.

And think, also, that, incontrovertibly, self-education is in effects and practically the most enduring and best method of acquiring an education. In proof of this we have who are the originators and inspirers of the world-famous \"Encyclopedia Britannica\"? They were the brothers Adam and Charles Black (who had been stonemasons in or near Edinburgh). And who were the originators, etc., etc., etc., of the renowned \"Chambers' Encyclopaedia\"? They were the brothers William and Robert Chambers, the sons of a poor weaver in or near Peebles, Scotland. And Adam Black became afterwards not only an M.P., but also Lord Provost of Edinburgh, as did Robert Chambers also, subsequently. And moreover the writer himself could have escaped the ignominy and ordeal, etc., etc., etc., lung around him by hypocrites, official corruption and magisterial voracity and ferocity but for his having been self-educated. Therefore, to all, but especially to the young of both sexes, we say sympathizingly with you, go, self-educate yourselves, as did the brothers Black and the brothers Chambers, and Mr. D. Maclean, M.P., Mr. McKenzie, M.P., Robt. Bell, M.P., Elihu Burritt and the distinguished astronomer of Lick Observatory (in the U.S.) and many others (of our own time). Onward, then, and onward, dear friends! Indolence and ignorance are mean and mischievous, whereas work and industry are meritorious, honorable and frequently remunerative in useful and beneficent money. Onward, for you may never before now have had, and you may never again have a person competent and willing, like the writer hereof, to guide you to self-educate yourself without any loss of time or wages because of any loss of time from work in factories elsewhere.\n\n14th, \"Liddell's Classical Dictionary,\" (English translation) very useful.\n\nN.B.\u2014Any one or each of the 14 publications above defined, and any of many other valuable works can be obtained from\n\nJOHN MACAULEY,\nPublisher's Agent, etc.,\n\"Knowledge is Power.\" Almonte, Ont., Canada.\n\nKNOWLEDGE IS POWER\n\n.....Power to do Any Earthly Thing\n\nREADER, do you desire to become a self-educated personage (lady or gentleman) of distinction and recognized ability, possessed of knowledge and power to perform any earthly thing?\n\nTo your own conscience pray answer the foregoing question. But ere answering, please remember that all good teachers and professors in schools and colleges procure their knowledge and power from the bookstores; do not be mindful of this important truth, too, that most of the books now in the bookstores, &c., &c., are only expensive sources of amusement or of waste of valuable time, and hence a few of the really good and useful books may be mentioned here (by a self-educated person for your benefit). They are:\n\n1st. \"Webster's Great International Dictionary.\" Entirely new, abreast of the times, a great educator. The successor of the \"Unabridged.\"\n\nTen years were spent revising, 100 editors employed, and over $500,000 expended.\n\nEvery one should own this Dictionary. It answers all questions concerning the history, spelling, pronunciation, and meaning of words.\n\nLibrary in itself. It also gives the facts often wanted concerning famous persons, ancient and modern; noted fictitious persons and places, the countries, cities, and towns, and natural features of the globe; translation of foreign quotations, words, phrases, proverbs; etc., etc., etc.\n\nThis work is invaluable in the household, and to the teacher, student, parent, friend, and self-Educator.\n\nThe Globe, Toronto, says: This new dictionary is the best book of its kind in the English language. For every family, the members of which have mastered the art of reading, its purchase will prove a profitable investment.\nThe Times, Hamilton, says: It may well be pronounced the best working dictionary and the cheapest book in the world, and should be in every school and family in Canada.\n\nThis being the best Dictionary of our English language, every person should have it, and now, especially, that its price is reduced. His Worship Mayor Raines, of Almonte, has a copy of it whereof he paid $12, but it can now be purchased at from $5.75, $5, $6 and up to $10. The price being dependent on the style, etc., of binding and \"get up\" of the book.\n\nAnd \"The American Domestic Cyclopedia.\" Every housekeeper and young lady should have it, because it instructs how to do everything pertaining to housekeeping, etc., etc., etc., $2.50.\n\n3rd. \"Park's Chemical Catechism,\" defining the household uses, etc., of numerous chemicals. $1.50.\n\n4th. \"Ure's Dictionary of Arts, Manufactures, and Mines,\" very useful to everyone, etc., $5, very useful to all men.\n\n5th. \"Open Letter,\" being a new, amended and enlarged edition of Macauley's open letters to the Hon. O. Mowat (now Sir O. Mowat), Attorney General, Ontario. Every sane, honest man in Canada should carefully read this little book; because, 1st, it (and) edition of it will contain what the 1st edition did not contain viz., the epistolary correspondence with the Imperial Government of Great Britain and Ireland, on the subject of the depravity and corruption of the magistrates of Ontario, etc.; because, 2nd, no man knows who may be made a migratory or travelling stranger fall into the trap or fangs of some magisterial robber, aided and assisted by his hyena-like satellite (constable), and in such an emergency the revelations of this book would assist him to extricate himself more economically, promptly and satisfactorily than he could do if he had not read it; and, 3rd, every sane, honest man should read it, and thereby see how and the culpable why of the corrupt and voracious magistrate's action. One of the serious logical facts revealed by this book, is that there is probably not one day throughout the whole year that some voracious magistrate in Ontario, Quebec, etc., is not successfully and sinfully practicing fraud and false pretence, and thereby extorting from honest men (strangers generally) their money and transferring it to his own pocket for his own use and behoof solely, and doing so all unknown to the people generally, and in the existing or present odious state of things, this doctrine will complete them free from any legal punishment of any kind. Hence, manifestly, every man's duty is to assist in having the law reformed and purified in Canada, and that he may do so, rightly, he should firstly read this open letter.\n\nN.B.\u2014This useful and interesting book can be procured only by subscription. Price, 50 cents.\n\n6th. \"Youman's Dictionary of Every Day Wants.\" It instructs how to do whole thousands of things: whereby to make and to save money. Formerly only of use in the U.S. and in England are making and saving money by its instruction. Why should not Canadians also have it? Former price, $5.00; price now only $3.50. It was originally issued in England.\n\n7th. \"Enquire Within upon Everything.\" This is a supertatively useful book. Price, $1.75.\n\n8th. \"Martha Washington's Cook Book.\" The best in use anywhere. Price, 75 cents.\n\n9th. \"The Complete Mechanic,\" in every department of mechanical industry\u2014machinery, engineering, etc., etc., etc., 8vo, well bound, $2.75.\n\n10th. \"Dr. Dickinson's Reliable Receipt Book,\" very useful. Price, $2.75 and $3.00.\n\n11th. \"Cox's Cyclop\u00e6dia of Practical Receipts,\" directing how to make a vast variety of valuable preparations in all branches of industry, etc. Price, about $2.75 and $3.00.\n\n12th. The new American edition of the world-famed \"Encyclopaedia Britannica,\" in about 20 volumes, at about $1.00 each, will cost only one third of the price of the Scotch and English editions of it. Nay, and this price can be made in monthly payments, (of $1.00) too. Great privilege.\n\n13th. The new American edition of \"Chambers' Encyclopaedia,\" meritorious, peerless of its kind, and as a treasury of knowledge, priceless in value. In about 30 volumes, at only 50 cents per volume. Not half the price of the editions of it issued in England and Scotland. Gentle reader, please think over this offer; thus only 50 cents a month for 30 months will supply to any lady or\nTo The Superintendent General\nIndian Affairs, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nRespected Sir,\n\nWill you kindly allow me to state that I being here on business have learned with regret that whereas Mr. James MacAuley of this place has been regularly employed teacher of said school for the Indian children of this vicinity from about the 1st September 1893 till the end of September 1894 when he resigned at the request or suggestion of Mr. James Martin, Indian agent here. (Mr. MacAuley) thus, an indubitable and legal right to the full amount of $50.00 (Fifty dollars) of arrears of salary; And Sir I am obliged to state furthermore mentioned that the said Mr. James MacAuley really did write, about the end of August last, to the deputy superintendent general, Indian Affairs, Ottawa, Ont., applying for information of why this amount (Fifty dollars) of arrears of salary has been allowed to remain unpaid by your department of Indian Affairs to him. And moreover that the said Mr. MacAuley has not received any reply from the gentleman just alluded to.\n\nManifestly the (Mr. MacAuley) due July $250.00 of payment for his first scholastic year\u2014this he was entitled to $300.00. And hence the balance of $50.00 over him. Plus balance the above named Mr. Martin, as fully promised to Mr. MacAuley would be paid to him at a subsequent period. And it has never been paid. Now sir, I have no desire to abuse legal proceedings in this case, and therefore would I request you to favor me with your intention of what you intend to do. I hereby oblige.\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

There is quite an Indian settlement south of the Village along the Gatineau Road, the children of which have no opportunity to attend school.\n\nThe question of moving the present school to more central locality has been proposed, but it has been shown that there is not site on the Reserve where a school could be placed to accommodate all the children. The north eastern settlers could more easily reach the Gatineau Road than any other locality.\n\nThe undersigned is of opinion that if an additional amount of say $150 per annum could be provided, it would be possible to carry on two schools.

Miss O'Connors has had charge of this school for nearly five years, and at the time of her engagement it was understood that her salary would be increased if she gave satisfaction. No increase has, however, been made owing to the fact that it had never been applied for.

This is chiefly due to the mid-day meal furnished by the Department and also to the sewing. The most of the irregularity was unavoidable, one family having had the whooping cough all winter, and a few of the larger pupils were kept at home to work. The pupils who have not attended school at all during the year are children who have just attained the age of six years and it is expected that they will begin shortly.\n\nMargaret McCaffrey,\nTeacher.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of February 12th last, I beg to state that the provisions furnished for mid-day meal for pupils attending the Maniwaki School on Maniwaki Indian Reserve is exhausted.\n\nThe teacher has applied to me for a further supply she finds the attendance falling off since the mid-day meal has ceased.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nW.J. McCaffrey\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\nOttawa, May 27, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th instant, and in reply I beg to say that you are hereby authorized to purchase a small quantity of provisions to continue the mid-day meal at the Maniwaki Indian school to the end of the current term. In future the Department, before renewing authority for this purpose, will require to be furnished with a detailed report from the teacher showing the number of meals served, etc.,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nW. J. McCaffrey, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManiwaki, Que.\nSir:\n\nMy duties at the Maniwaki Indian School were increased last year. I am now preparing a mid-day meal and teaching piano during in addition to my ordinary duties as teacher. I think that the work I now do in this school entitles me to at least $400 per annum. As my present salary is only $350 I therefore make application for an increase of $50 yearly.\n\nI trust you will give this matter your kind attention and hoping to receive a favorable reply,\n\nI am\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\nMargaret McCaffrey.\nOTTAWA, JULY 8, 1910\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, and in reply I beg to say that in view of the satisfactory work being performed by you as teacher of the Maniwaki Indian school it has been decided to increase your salary to $400.00 per annum for next year.\n\nIn this connection I have to call your attention to the fact that the reports asked for in regard to the teaching of sewing and the giving of the mid-day meal have not been received. The Department will be glad to have from you a report on these and also on any other features that may be of interest in connection with your work generally.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMiss Margaret McCaffrey,\nTeacher,\nManiwaki, Que.\nManiwaki, Que.\nJuly 26th, 1910.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nSir:\n\nThe following is a report of the mid-day meal furnished to the pupils of the Maniwaki Indian School.\n\nThe first order of ten dollars supplied 500 meals, the second of three dollars supplied 191 meals.\n\nSince the Department has introduced the serving of a mid-day meal at school I have had the occasion to observe that the pupils apply themselves more vigorously to their studies and that the general health of the pupils is much better than heretofore and there has also been an improvement in the attendance.\n\nI find that the strong food, as beans etc., is much better for the Indian children but during the last of the year we were obliged to purchase bread and butter to avoid making a fire in the school during the warm weather.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nMargaret McCaffrey,\nTeacher.\nSir:\n\nI hereby make application to the Department for a further supply of provisions to continue the mid-day meal in the Maniwaki Indian School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nMargaret McCaffrey,\nTeacher.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 30th., 1910.\n\nIndian:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th. instant, and in reply I beg to say that you are hereby authorized to purchase provisions to the extent of a sum not exceeding $10.00 with which to continue the mid-day meal at the Nomivaki Indian School during the Fall term.

During the first months of this term the attendance was very good, but owing to the illness of the greater number of the pupils with Measles and Grippe it has decreased considerably this last month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMargaret McCaffrey,\nTeacher.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 9, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nThe teacher of the Maniwaki school has applied for another grant with which to purchase provisions for the mid-day meal and you are hereby authorized to expend a sum not exceeding $10.00 for this purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Her sister is replacing her for the time being. Would there be any possibility of getting a transfer from\nCongo Bridge School to Manitouke School? It would be more convenient for me as I would be closer to home, and I would not have the inconvenience of crossing the river Spry and Foul.\n\nI like my present school very well.

About the end of August she underwent an operation which prevented her from returning to duty on September first, and, with your concurrence, we allowed her sister, Miss Mae McGuire, to take her place for the month of September. At the end of that time it was reported that Miss Carmel McGuire was not yet able to resume duties, and her sister was allowed to remain in charge of the school. Recently Miss Carmel McGuire has submitted her resignation, and, at the present time, Miss Mae McGuire is still in charge of the school. She does not possess high qualifications as a teacher, but, as you will remember, we thought that she was taking her sister's place for only one month.\n\nThe new Maniwaki School will probably be ready for occupation by the end of the year, and I would recommend that, on January first, Miss Freda White be appointed teacher of this school. For the past two years Miss White has been in charge of the Congo Bridge School and satisfactory reports have been received regarding her work. Salary at this school is at the rate of $80 a teaching month.\n\nTo succeed Miss White at Congo Bridge School, I would recommend Miss Rita Somers. She has a second class Ontario professional certificate and has had six year's experience. The salary at this school is at the rate of $70 a teaching month.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

To my estimation Miss Bernatchez is a good teacher, she has around 17 years of experience.\n\nThe fact that Miss Bernatchez was let go at such a late date, that she was not able to get another school, certainly would affect her to a certain extent. In order to settle this matter, the Government are in need of girls for the Civil Service and I am quite positive, that she is in a position to fulfill any jobs which may be assigned to her.

I took the opportunity to tell the pupils present, to tell their parents that unless they attend school regularly, the monthly allowance check will be cut down every month a child of school age is not attending school regularly.\n\nThis building is in great need of painting inside and outside, specially the outside which, in my mind will begin to deteriorate, as you can hardly tell that it has been painted.\n\nJude Thibault,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nManiwaki, July the 12, 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: School teacher Congo Bridge Indian Day School.\n\nIn regard to the Maniwaki Indian Day School, Miss Brenna has not definitely decided whether or not she will go back to teach at the Maniwaki Indian Day School, but she is supposed to give me an answer sometime this month.\n\nJ.E.

Miss Marie Brennan has had one year's experience of teaching school, and says she can supply any further recommendations etc. required.\n\n3o.- Miss GERALDINE HAGAN, Maniwaki, Que., about 20 years of age. She has completed her tenth year at Maniwaki Convent, and as yet has no experience in teaching. She says that if accepted she shall strive to prove satisfactory to all concerned.\n\nWould you please tell me if your Department requires a diploma in school teaching.- If so, what kind.\n\nThe way I see it:\n\nTwo out of three have experience in school teaching: Miss Bernatchez and Miss Marie Brennan.- There is no doubt that Miss Bernatchez has more experience and also has a diploma in school teaching.- Both are fine persons.\n\nHowever, if the diploma in school teaching is not required by your Department, and provided Miss Marie Brennan can supply satisfactory recommendations as to her ability in school teaching, I would recommend Miss Brennan for the\nfollowing reasons:\n\n1.- I am told that her sister Helen has given satisfaction and Marie Brennan has worked with her sister at home.\n\n2.- The Brennan family is a large family and not very rich.

War Savings Certificates will be dated the fifteenth of the month in which payment is completed. For example, whenever in any one month your Total Saving Deposits are sufficient to buy your War Savings Certificate, that Certificate will bear the date of the 15th of that month.\n\nRegistration. Each War Savings Certificate is registered at the Bank of Canada, Ottawa. Registration will be made by serial number only. A War Savings Certificate is not transferable and cannot be redeemed other than by its registered owner. Provision has been made for redemption in case of the death of a holder.\n\nCare should be taken to state clearly the name and address in which each deposit Certificate is registered. Spell out the first or Christian name in full, as well as the surname, and give proper prefix (Mr., Mrs., or Miss).\n\nFor example: Correct \u2014 BROWN, MR.

That is to say, you may purchase $500 worth this year, and up to a like amount in each succeeding year.\n\nIncome Tax. Due to the difficulties of calculation, the small amounts involved and the limit on individual holdings, holders will not be required to report the difference between the purchase price and the redemption value of War Savings Certificates as income in making returns under the Income War Tax Act.\n\nRedemption. War Savings Certificates cannot be called for redemption by the Government prior to their date of maturity. The holder, however, has the option six months after issue date of redeeming the certificates for cash, and after the first year will also be paid interest to the date of redemption in accordance with the current redemption values shown on each certificate.

There is there at the moment 56 Indians going to School and 6 white pupils. It is a fact that something would have to be done and out of these whites there are four partly Indian kids and two purely white. There is no doubt that it would be quite hard to send away the Indian blood Indians considered to be white. We could though advise the white pupils (2) that they would have to go to the Village School. This to my knowledge would not relieve the situation as 60 children is yet too big a class for one teacher, especially when she has to teach all of the grades. I consider that if they were all in the same grade, that class would not be too numerous, providing it would be in the lower grades.\n\nThe fact that this School is overcrowded and no place to move, dirties the class-room a lot more and although the Janitor, who at the moment is the Chief, has been warned to keep the School clean, it is far from being clean and the Teacher has too much work to look after everything. I am not blaming the Teacher so much as the lack of organization in this School. In the first place the water has to be drawn for nearly 10 acres and that is the most important thing in a School. The washing facilities are therefore very limited and the laziness to the Janitor makes it worst. There is also the question of the\nsalary of a Janitor at this School. Last year for part of the year the Janitor was getting $10.00 a month, the Department increased it during the year to $15.00 a month. I claim that this is still too low. The Department should pay a Janitor enough to make it interesting for him, and if he does not do the work properly, we could easily get another one. The way it is there, at that price, we cannot get a Janitor that will do the work, leaving this extra work to the Teacher.\n\nIn summing up the whole situation it is very easy to see that is something is not done about this school, the Department cannot expect very much success and they are spending good money for hardly any results.\n\nGongo Bridge Indian Day School: This School is sufficiently big enough for the attendance but I am in doubt whether or not the Teacher there shall make a success of it. The School is far from being as tidy as it was, and to my estimation the Teacher is a little lacking in neatness. As far as the teaching abilities of the teacher, I cannot say very much, but this shall be judged by the success she will attain later on.\n\nJ.E. Gendron,\nIndian Agent,\nManiwaki, Quebec.\nOttawa, 4th October, 1945.\n\nMr. J.E. Gendron, Indian Agent, Maniwaki, Quebec.\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo with reference to the Maniwaki Day School. As I wrote to you recently regarding the teacher at the Congo Bridge School, the teacher at this school is also just starting and consequently will probably require considerable advice and assistance for a few months until she is able to control the situation.\n\nIn view of the crowded condition of the school, the Department does not see any reason for allowing children to attend who are not recognized Indians. By following this regulation the attendance would be reduced to 50.\n\nRegarding the Janitor allowance of $15.00 a month, it is not possible under present regulations for us to pay a larger amount. If we did we would have to have the situation classified by the Civil Service Commission and an appointment made by them. I cannot see any reason why the older children could not do some of the cleaning in the classroom and thereby release the Janitor for other duties. I feel there should be full co-operation among the teacher, the pupils and the Janitor.\n\nIf the latter will not carry out instructions given to him by the teacher and yourself, you should endeavour to obtain someone else.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nManiwaki, June 26th., 1946.\n\nCopy of a resolution passed by the River Desert Band at a Special Meeting of the Band held June 22nd 1946.\n\n1. It is unanimously resolved by the members of the Band present, fully represented, that owing to the fact that a girl cannot handle the children at the Maniwaki Indian Day School, owing to their number, that the Department of Indian Affairs be petitioned to hire a School Master for the Maniwaki Indian Day School for the coming School year 1946-47.\n\nADOPTED\n\nCertified to be a true copy.\n\nJ.E. Gendron,\nIndian Agent,\nManiwaki, Que.\nManiwaki, June the 27, 1946.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nHerein please find copy of a resolution passed at a special meeting of the Band called for these purposes.\n\nThis resolution speaks for itself and I really believe there is a lot of truth in it. There is quite a few children going to that School and I do not believe a girl can handle these children. It would be better to my opinion to have a man teacher at that School, preferably a married man, who could occupy the living quarters in the back and would look after the School in a better way that it has been looked after. This teacher could also receive the Janitors salary and have more authority with those children than a girl would have. There is no doubt that the present teacher is doing all in her power to control these children, but they are a hard bunch to handle. This question is very important and a married couple at that School with the woman to help along with the Homemaker's club would certainly be a great help to these Indians.\n\nIf this question has to be discussed previously to hiring a man teacher, I will be at your disposal anytime you wish.\n\nJ.E. Gendron, I.A.\nOttawa, July 15, 1946.\n\nMr. J. E. Gendron, Indian Agent,\nManiwaki, P.Q.\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, enclosing a Resolution passed by the River Desert Band, suggesting the appointment of a male teacher at the Maniwaki Indian Day School.\n\nAs you are probably aware, teachers are very difficult to secure. At the present time the Department is not aware of any male teacher who could be employed at this school. However, it is possible that you know a qualified male teacher, and, if so, you should let me know his name, qualifications and experience.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nExtract from letter of Leon J. Raymond, M.P. (Wright) dated May 28, 1946.\n\nOriginal on 13018-38\n\nRe: Schools\n\nImprovements in this connection are urgent and necessary.\n\na) Bitobig - a new school should be built there.\nb) Congeway School should be enlarged.\nc) School on the Public Road should have two teachers instead of one.\n\nI am submitting these remarks for your attention and hope action will soon be taken.\n\nThanking you, I remain,\n\nLeon J. Raymond, M.P. (Wright)\nOttawa, July 18, 1946.\n\nMr. J.E. Gendron, Indian Agent, Maniwaki, P.Q.\n\nThe following suggestions have been made for the improvement of the educational services at the Maniwaki Agency:\n\n(a) Bitobig - A new school should be built there.\n(b) Congo Bridge School should be enlarged.\n(c) School on the Public Road should have two teachers instead of one.\n\nPlease let me have your report on each of the above.\n\nEX'D.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nManiwaki, July the 24, 1946.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of July the 18, 1946, concerning certain suggestions that have been made to the Department of Indian Affairs, concerning improvement of the educational services of the Maniwaki Agency:\n\n(a) Bitobig - A new school should be built there. It is a fact that something should be done for the children living on the Bitobig road in regard to education. Nevertheless it is hard to decide whether or not a new School should be built on that road or another arrangement organized to take those children to the Maniwaki Indian Day School, if it is to be enlarged. The difficulty in all of those Schools on this Indian Reserve is that the teachers cannot get living accommodations on the Reserve and they have to walk from Maniwaki Village to the School, which would give them approximately six miles. The same situation develops at the Congo Bridge Indian Day School and it is why we are now asking to have living quarters for the Teacher built at that School. Personally I have always been of the opinion that a main School as much as possible should be built for the Reserve, where almost all of the children could attend, by taking them to School with a Busk or an organization of some kind. By having one School for all the children of the Reserve, you could have three teachers who would divide amongst them the children of the nine grades we have on the Reserve. Another fact is that by having one School you could have a principal who would look after\nthis main School and also supervise the other teachers under him. I have absolutely no confidence in those small Country Schools where generally a young girl has to teach from the first to the ninth grade and where there is hardly any supervision over her.\n\nNaturally the Department has the final say in these decisions and if you judge that no main school should be built to take all of the children of this Reserve and small schools would be better, I am of the opinion that you need one on the Bitobig road, as there is at least 22 children on that road who do not go to School because they are living too far away.\n\n(b) Congo Bridge School should be enlarged. My same argument as for the previous school mentioned in this letter is my opinion, nevertheless I do not believe you shall obtain any success whatever with those small schools here and there. Again if you decide that this is not the Department's opinion it would almost be necessary to build living quarters for the Teacher at that School as there is no living accommodations on the Reserve, around that School and the teacher has to walk from 5 to 6 miles to go and teach every morning.\n\n(c) School on the Public Road should have two teachers instead of one. At that School at the moment there is too many pupils attending for one teacher and as there is no other place in the building for another class I do not see any other way if you want to have another teacher there, is to enlarge the school. Naturally my previous suggestion should be studied very carefully and I am of the opinion that instead of spending money on another class for this School, would be to build big enough to have three classes, which would take care of all the children on the Indian Reserve and have living accommodations at least for the Principal of that School. As this school is situated\nabout one mile from the Maniwaki Village the other teachers could easily live in the Village and go to their work every morning. At the moment there is no one living there, the Teacher lives in Maniwaki and this year this school has been broken in three times and I was there this morning and discovered that it still has been broken in since the holidays and six windows are completely broken, that would need to be repaired immediately. One thing that should be done at that School immediately is get an Artesian well dug immediately. There is no water at that School and it has to be drawn about 10 acres. We have in Maniwaki a contractor who digs wells and I am sure he would be glad to dig one for the Department at that School so a pump could be installed and later on also install electric lights and a pressure pump who would give you sufficient water for drinking, for the residence and for all of the toilets that could easily be installed in the cellar, after a cesspool has been built outside the building. You will find that in my estimates of this year I included these works for this particular School but nothing was included for building a new class at that particular School. I would suggest a survey of the situation be made by one of the Department's employees and a report be made to the Department in regard to the suggestions I have made in this letter.\n\nI may add in closing that since I have been Indian Agent of this Reserve, no ameliorations has been noticed in regard to education. It is the most important factor and the only one that the Department will succeed in making anything out of those Indians on this Reserve. If nothing is done in this regard, the Indians instead of improving their situation, are going backward.\n\nJ.E. Gendron, I.A.\nOttawa, August 1, 1946.\n\nMr. J.E. Gendron, Indian Agent, Maniwaki, Quebec.\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant, with reference to the educational services at the Maniwaki Agency. We hope to have a new official appointed in the near future whose duties will be to make a personal study of the educational requirements in the various agencies in Canada.\n\nIn view of the situation outlined in your letter I will arrange to have the new official visit you as soon as conditions permit.\n\nBernard N. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMr. J. GRENDON, Indian Agent. Complaint of re: B.E. & Theft of Indian Day School.\n\n1. The writer while on patrol at Maniwaki, P.Q., per. P.C. 3646, accompanied by Cst. Duns, received a complaint from Mr. Joe GRENDON regarding a B.E. & Theft of the above noted school.\n\n2. Mr. GRENDON informed the writer that during the early part of the summer school holidays six of the school windows had been broken and the school entered. Upon commencement of school, the Teacher Miss Marie BRENNAN reported the theft of a silver tray, 6 dinner plates, 1 cup, and 6 water glasses. The tray was silver in appearance only, and not handles, there was an engraved design in the center. The plates and cup belonged to a set, and had a green floral design of dark green around the edges. Miss BRENNAN stated that she could easily identify the stolen articles, if recovered.\n\n3. Numerous persons, both school children and adults were questioned regarding this theft, but nothing of value was learned that would assist in bringing this case to a successful conclusion. Several houses were entered during the course of the above patrol, but none of the above articles were noted by members of the patrol. Neither the Indian Agent nor the School Teacher had any suspects in mind nor any suggestions to make.\n\n4. Further enquiries will be made when next in Maniwaki and a further report will be submitted to comply with the undermentioned Diary Date.\n\nS.U.I. *\nD.D. 19-11-46.\n\nThe Commissioner,\n\nFORWARDED for your information and that of the Department concerned.\n\nIt will be observed that despite investigation in this regard no information was obtained that would assist in establishing the identity of the person or persons responsible for this offence. However, our enquiries are continuing, as will be noted, and another report will be submitted in due course.\n\nSTILL UNDER INVESTIGATION.\n\nD.D. 22-11-46.\n\nOTTAWA,\n16-9-46.\n\n(P.W.

P.C. 3646, from the 23rd. to 26th. inst. the undermentioned enquiries were made, regarding the above.\n\n2. Mrs. Lloyd BUDGE, Pres. of the Womens Sewing Circle, was interviewed and she stated that she and the other members of the Sewing Circle met twice a month at the above school but she nor members of her circle had any idea as who might be responsible for the above breaking and theft. Mrs. Budge was asked if she knew or would know the stolen dishes if she saw them and she stated that she was of the opinion she would recognize them, but to date she had not seen any of the stolen dishes.\n\n3. From numerous enquiries it was learned that one Ovila DENOMME had resided directly opposite the school for about a week, just before the school was reopened after the holidays. DENOMME is not a local man, and is of a rather unsavory character, therefore in the writers opinion, as the subject was just married, he might have been able to put the articles stolen from the school to good use in his home. A patrol was made to Grand Remous, P.Q., in and endeavour to locate DENOMME; Henri TAILLON subject's father-in-law was contacted and informed the patrol that the subject and his wife had left for Troisr Depot were they were employed by the C.I.P. Company.\n\n4. Upon return to Maniwaki, the above information was checked and found to be correct. An endeavour will be made to contact DENOMME during the next patrol, as it is believed that DENOMME will by that time have returned to Grand Remous.\n\n5. Miss BRENNAN was again interviewed, as well as some of the school children but nothing new was learned pertaining to the above case.

He stated that it was the consensus of opinion amongst the Indians, that this offence had been committed by some of the younger Indian lads, who undoubtedly destroyed the loot or cashed it in the bush.\n\nSome of the older Indians were questioned regarding this opinion, and when questioned as to what grounds this opinion was based upon stated that they believed that this was a retaliation or revenge for having been convicted on a previous charge of breaking into this school. The lads responsible for the previous trouble at the school were not on the Reservation at the time the patrol was in the vicinity these men will be interviewed at the first opportunity, and their homes searched in an endeavour to locate the missing kitchen ware taken from the school.\n\nNo one in authority at the school have any idea as to when the school was broken into, other than that it took place sometime during the school holidays (two months) and have no information, nor suggestions that would assist with the enquiry, however it is hoped that information of value can be secured when in the Maniwaki Distr. on the next patrol.\n\nFORWARDED for your information and that of the Department concerned.\n\nSTILL UNDER INVESTIGATION\n\nD.D. 3-2-47.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Some enquiries were made in the vicinity of the school in question.

The writer was informed by Nicola JOKKO (Indian) that while staying at the home of Mrs. Xavier COMANDO on the Reservation she had informed him that the authorities suspected her children in connection with the above theft from the Indian Day School. She denied that her children had ever stolen anything from the school, and went on to state that she had a good idea as to who was responsible for the theft.\n\n2. Mrs. X. COMANDO lives a considerable distance back on the Reservation, and she was not contacted by the writer at this time owing to the roads being blocked to motor transport. The only road open on the Reserve at this time of the year is the Highway which skirts the edge of the reservation.\n\n3.

Williams), Insp.,\nI/c O.I.B.\nWith reference to the above subject, the following enquiries have been made.\n\n1. With reference to Para. 3. of my report in this connection dated 30-4-47, Mrs. X. COMMANDO was interviewed while on a recent patrol but she could give no information that would be of any value. This woman lives a considerable distance back on the Reservation and had been referring to another reported theft at the Conway Road School which file has been concluded some time ago. Both Mrs. COMMANDO and her husband maintained that they knew nothing regarding the above theft.\n\n2. Mrs. Anthony LEE the new school teacher at the Indian Day school was interviewed but she could throw no light on this enquiry, stating that she had only heard rumours of this theft and none of the facts.\n\n3. Most of those people contacted in this matter previously were again interviewed, but had either forgotten their offer to help, or had been unsuccessful and unable to pick up any information. Enquiries will however be continued and a further report submitted to comply with the under-mentioned Diary Date.\n\nFORWARDED for your information and that of the Department concerned. Copies of memorandum of even date directed to the N.C.O. i/c Ottawa Town Station attached.

The teacher is very devoted and is quite successful. Good housekeeping should be taught and would strongly recommend that hot soups and drinks be given regularly to those pupils having lunch at school. This would be prepared by the older girls under the teacher's supervision and direction. This would be one efficient means of training for those girls.\n\nA Junior Homemaker's Club should also be organized and the teacher should give such an organization much attention. Competitions in handicraft should be encouraged.\n\nA small open air skating rink could be provided at a very low cost. Upkeep of which would be done exclusively by the pupils.\n\nIf this school was under the direction of a religious order such as the Grey Nuns, I am sure would be a step forward in the right direction. This possibility should be kept in mind and taken advantage of at first opportunity.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nCLOSED FILE\n\nFILE NUMBER 320-1 VOLUME 2\n\nSUBJECT MANIWAKI\nDAY SCHOOL\nGENERAL\n\nCORRESPONDENCE FROM JUNE 1932\nTO July 1948\n\nNO FURTHER CORRESPONDENCE\nTO BE PLACED ON THIS FILE\n\nNOTE: For subsequent correspondence relevant to the subject matter of this closed file see\nFILE 320-1 VOLUME 3\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6607, file 320-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume 6094)\n\nFile 320-3, part 1\nManiwaki Agency - Maniwaki Day School -\nTeacher's Salaries. 1913 - 1936, 1944 -\n1945.\n\nFile 320-5, part 1\nManiwaki Agency - Maniwaki School - Esta-\nblishment - Building Maintenance - Supplies\n- Accounts (Plans). 1921 - 1936.\n\nFile 320-5, part 2\nManiwaki Agency - Maniwaki School - Building\nMaintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1903 -\n1914.\n\nFile 320-5, part 3\nManiwaki Agency - Maniwaki School - Building\nMaintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1936 -\n1948.\n\nFile 320-5, part 4\nManiwaki Agency - Maniwaki School - Building\nMaintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1948 -\n1949.\nNo. 18-2-3\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nManiwaki Day School\n\nSalary Payments\n| Name of Teacher | Name of School | Annual Grant or Salary | Amount Due | Address to which Cheque is to be sent |\n|-----------------|----------------|------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Miss Margaret Maffey | Marinosaki | $400.00 | $100.00 |                                      |\n\nNo. of School days in quarter: 65\nNo. days School was open: 64\nNo. holidays:\nGrant asked for:\n\nRemarks:\n\nCERTIFIED CORRECT\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct.\n\nNOTE.\u2014The number of school days in the quarter and the number of days for which payment is asked should be stated; payment will only be made for days school was open and authorized holidays.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The reason for the delay is due to the fact that the Department has not yet received the June quarter return of the Maniwaki Indian Day School. I am, however, arranging to forward you a cheque for $116.00, being the balance due you, but, as soon as you return to the school on the first of September, you should forward through the office of Mr. Agent Gauthier a return for the quarter ended June 30th, last.\n\nI might, also, point out that no return was received for the quarter ended March 31st, last. This should also be prepared and forwarded and, in future, the Department cannot make payment of the quarterly salary unless the return is received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

As Miss Carmel McGuire was unable to resume duties at the end of September, Miss Mae McGuire has continued in charge of the school until the end of December. She is, therefore, entitled to pay for four months, viz., September $60 - October $80 - November $80 and December $80, or $320. Miss Carmel McGuire, the regular teacher, has not been allowed any salary since the end of September.\n\nIn view of the above, the following entry should appear on the December paylist in connection with this school:\n\n320 - Maniwaki - Mae McGuire - Maniwaki, Que. - $800 - $320.\nOttawa, November 27, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWhen the Maniwaki Indian Day School reopens after the Christmas holidays, viz., January 7th, 1936, the Department desires Miss Freda White placed in charge of this school. As you know, Miss White is the present teacher of the Congo Bridge School. Her salary at Maniwaki will be at the rate of $80 a teaching month.\n\nPlease inform Miss Mae McGuire that her services as teacher of the Maniwaki Indian Day School will not be required after the school closes for the Christmas holidays.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

Miss White's salary will be at the rate of $80 a teaching month and, as she began duties at the Maniwaki School on January 1st, 1936, the following entry should appear on the January pay list:\u2014\n\n320 - Maniwaki - Freda White - Maniwaki, Que. - $800 - $80.00\nOttawa, July 10, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Maniwaki Indian Day School, No. 320.\n\nPlease note the Department has received and accepted the resignation of Miss Helen D.

Gauthier\nINDIAN AGENT\n\nSIR:\n\nI recommend that Maniwaki School of Maniwaki Reserve be supplied with 20 Toots bros.\n\nMy reason for making this recommendation is:\n\nTo be sent to Miss Elizabeth M. Cooper\n\nNote to Mr. Gauthier:\n\nTo send poor.\n\nTravelling Nurse\nEXTRACT from Report of Mr. Inspector Maltais, dated March 11th, 1931, on his inspection of the MANIWAKI INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on File 18-2-6.\n\nThe walls of the classroom are badly cracked in some places. They will need repairs in the near future.\n\nIt is evident that the kind of stove used in the classroom takes too much space, being placed in the middle of the classroom. With the new kind of stove which can be placed in the corner of the classroom, it would give more room for the pupils. At present, one-third of the classroom cannot be used on account of that stove.\n\nAt least five desks ought to be replaced. They are not only in bad shape, but might be a danger for the pupils.\n\nSome of the school desks are not proportionate to the age of the pupils; something could be done along that line.\nOttawa, March 26, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Provincial School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Maniwaki Indian Day School, states that the walls of the classroom are badly cracked in some places, requiring repairs in the near future. He also states that the stove in use in the classroom takes up too much space and that, if a new stove, of a type which can be placed in a corner of the room, was installed, it would give more space for the pupils. He further states that at least five desks ought to be replaced.\n\nYou might furnish your opinion regarding the repairs required to the walls of the classroom and state whether you would recommend that a new stove be installed. You should give an estimate of the cost of carrying out any recommendations made by you.\n\nRegarding the new desks, please state whether those at present in use are single or double, and, if you have the information, the name of the manufacturer. This may be stamped on the metal part of the desks. The size and the number of each size of new desks required should be stated.\n\nWhen we have the information asked for, consideration will be given as to whether the equipment mentioned can be provided and the work of repairing the classroom carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nE. S. Gauthier, Esq.,\nIndian Agent\nMANIWAKI, P. Q.\nOttawa, March 12th, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nAs instructed I visited the Maniwaki reserve in connection with certain complaints made to the Department by Mrs. James Brascoupe, a white woman married overseas to an Indian soldier, and the leader of a faction known as the \"Rebels\" and who are opposed to everything and everyone connected with the Department.\n\nThe interior of the school is in very bad state of repair. The plaster is cracked and while perhaps not dangerous, is most unsightly and neglected looking. If funds are available this summer, I would recommend that the walls and ceiling of both the classroom and entrance porch be plastered or beaverboarded and painted. The outside of the building is in fair condition. I could not see the condition of the roof as it was covered with snow. This should be determined before anything is done to the interior.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThos. McGookin.\nInspector.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nJune 24, 1931.\n\nMemorandum: Mr. Carrier.\n\nWhile at Maniwaki last week I was asked by Indian Agent Gauthier to make an inspection of the day school building, where some repairs were to be authorized. The above mentioned building is 17 x 25 feet - one story, consisting of an entirely wooden structure. The repairs which I consider necessary are as follows:\n\n1. Covering of the plaster walls with a layer of beaver board.\n2. Painting of the wooden ceiling and dado.\n3. Erection of three wooden steps at the entrance which are entirely demolished.\n4. Putting of a layer of earth around the foundation to prevent cold coming through the classroom floors.\n5. Repairing of the chimney which is partly demolished.\n\nWith reference to the desks in the building there are -\n\n6 desks No 2, 29\" high.\n1 desk No 3, 27\" high.\n6 desks No 4, 26\" high.\n\nThese desks have no manufacturers' names on them. Three of them are broken and should be repaired.\n\nIf the present stove, which is installed in the centre of the classroom be moved or replaced by a new one installed in one of the corners of the classroom there would be room for six additional desks.\n\nThe total cost of the above mentioned work exclusive of the desks and stove would be about $125.00.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS.\n\nIndian Affairs.

S. Gauthier, Esq., Indian Agent, Maniwaki, P.Q., 5 No. 5 single school desks. These should be shipped in a knocked down condition, and should be supplied at the lowest price charged this Department.\n\nPlease forward your account, in duplicate, covering the cost of the desks F.O.B. Maniwaki, sales tax included, to Mr. Gauthier, who is being informed of the order placed with you, and requested, upon receipt of the desks, if in good condition, to certify the account and send it to the Department, when payment will be made.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.

Oliver & Sons Ltd.,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 6, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Chene, of this Department, who recently made an inspection of the Maniwaki Indian Day School building, recommends that the following repairs be carried out during the present summer holidays:\n\n1. Covering of the plaster walls with a layer of beaver board.\n2. Painting of the wooden ceiling and dado.\n3. Erection of three wooden steps at the entrance, which are entirely demolished.\n4. Putting of a layer of earth around the foundation to prevent cold coming through the classroom floors.\n5. Repairing of the chimney which is partly demolished.\n\nI have to request that you will arrange to have the work mentioned above carried out at an early date. You should purchase all material required and arrange for the labour in having the work done. Indian labour should be employed as far as possible, under the charge of a competent foreman. The Department will expect you to see that the above work is satisfactorily completed and at as low a price as possible. After this work has been completed, you should furnish accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of all material and time sheets, in duplicate, for the labour employed.\n\nF.G. Gauthier, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManiwaki, P.Q.\nMr. Chene states that if the present stove, which is installed in the centre of the classroom, were removed or replaced by a new stove, installed in one of the corners of the classroom, there would be room for six additional desks. I shall be pleased to hear as to whether you can arrange to have the present stove removed or whether it would be necessary to purchase a new stove. If a new stove is required, you should state the approximate cost of same.\n\nRelative to the extra desks, I have to say that we are today placing an order with J. Oliver & Sons Limited here to forward, addressed to you, 5 No. 5 single desks. These desks are to accommodate pupils of from 6 to 9 years. When they arrive, you should arrange to have them assembled and set up in the classroom. The account covering the cost F.O.B. Maniwaki, sales tax included, will also be sent you, and after the desks are received, you should certify the account in the usual manner and send it to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Twenty-six pupils were present. Number on roll is Thirty. The teacher states that she has quite often as high as 36 in attendance. In my opinion the school is too small. The class room is 17x23, poorly ventilated. The pupils are crowded too close together in double seats. Only five new single seats.\n\nAdditional blackboard space is needed. The blackboards in use are badly worn and scratched and should be replaced. The following would meet the needs:\n\n- 2 pieces for side walls, length - 8'6\"\n- 2 pieces to replace old ones, length - 6'6\"\n\nThe closets are in very bad state of repair, dirty and unsuitable. Only one closet is in use for all pupils. The other one is closed by stove-ends piled against the door. The location is not good. I would recommend that two new closets be built and placed at the rear boundary of the school lot. The present ones are past repairing.\n\n[Signature]\n\nINSPECTOR.\nOttawa, December 4, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector McGookin, who recently visited the Maniwaki Indian Day School, draws attention to the need of additional blackboard space and also recommends that two new closets be built.\n\nAn order is being sent to the Government Stationery Office to forward addressed to you two pieces asbestosolate blackboard for the side walls and two pieces to replace old ones at present in use. You should arrange to accept delivery when this material arrives and have it installed in the classroom.\n\nRegarding the erection of two new closets, I have to request that you will inform the Department as soon as possible of the approximate cost of the material and labour required in erecting these buildings. It is not intended that an expensive type be erected, but, if authorized, a good substantial job should be completed. Mr. McGookin states that the location of the present toilets is not good and that new toilets should be placed at the rear boundary of the school lot. When we have full information as to the cost involved in the erection of new closets, you will be further advised as to whether they can be authorized at the present time or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nE. S. Gauthier, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManiwaki, P.Q.\nNanawaki, December 14th, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nIn conformity with your letter of the 4th instant No. IR-2-5, concerning the erection of toilets at the Nanawaki and Congo Bridge Schools, I am enclosing herewith a sketch showing front and side view for your approval.\n\nThe front wall to be 3\" x 7\", the depth 5\"6\", the material to be used will be tongue and groove lumber for roof and floor, with clap board planked on both sides for walls, all studdings also to be planked, the roof will be of heavy composition paper, and one coat of paint outside.\n\nThe approximate cost will be between $58.00 to $60.00 for each toilet.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 17, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, regarding the erection of toilets at the Maniwaki and Congo Bridge Indian Day Schools. The sketch of the proposed building which you enclosed was also received.\n\nAs you were informed while at the Department yesterday, the Department will approve of you arranging to have a toilet of the type shown on the sketch erected at each of the above schools. You should see that the toilets are erected on suitable and convenient sites and that a satisfactory job is completed. A good, strong lock, with key, should be placed on each door, and the keys should be kept in charge of the teachers, who should see that the toilets are locked after the regular school hours. The cost of each closet should not exceed your estimate of approximately $60.\n\nAfter the work has been finished to your satisfaction, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost in the erection of the toilet for each school separately.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

The classroom is in need of at least one mirror and two combs for use of the pupils. The toothbrushes which have been in use are worn out and past further usefulness, and the supply of tooth powder is exhausted. In order that the children may have some amusement during recess periods the two balls should be supplied, also a playground bat.\n\nThe teacher's living quarters is in need of the articles asked for. The window shades are worn out and the two down stair windows are in need of new curtain material. A new water pail, diaper, stove lifter, 6 water glasses, and two lamp chimneys should be supplied as there are not any of these articles on hand that are of any further use.\n\nThe approx. cost of the above articles, with the exception of the two balls, bat, toothbrushes and tooth powder which the Department usually supply direct from Ottawa, would not exceed $11.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 22, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 17th instant, I beg to say that you may purchase the following articles for use at the Kaboni Day School:\n\n1.

[Redacted], amounting to $372 in favour of W.B. Browning for [Redacted].\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 18-2-4 dated March 18th 1938.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nOttawa, April 16, 1935.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nRe: Maniwaki Indian Day School\n\nInspector McGookin visited this school on April 11th and reports that there are 38 children on the roll. There is seating accommodation in the school for 32 pupils and there were 31 pupils present on the day of his visit. The teacher told him that there are seven more children who wish to attend after the Easter holidays.\n\nMr. McGookin states that the room is crowded at present, and, consequently, there is no room for additional desks.\n\nWhen funds are available, Mr. McGookin recommends the erection of a new combined school and teacher's residence.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Chene,\n\nMr. Buskard telephoned me this morning to say that some people from Maniwaki were at the minister's office and complained about the condition of the school building and the roads and bridges on the reserve.\n\nIt was suggested that you be sent to investigate the matter and report but Mr. Buskard would like to see you before you go.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Chene,\n\nMr. Buskard telephoned me this morning to say that some people from Maniwaki were at the Minister's office and complained about the condition of the school building and the roads and bridges on the reserve.\n\nIt was suggested that you be sent to investigate the matter and report but Mr. Buskard would like to see you before you go.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nSCHOOL.\n\nThe School building in question is the Maniwaki School, located on the Hull Maniwaki Provincial Highway (Route No II). This building consists of an entirely wooden structure, 17 x 25 feet, one story.\n\nI found it to be in a very poor condition, and much too small to accommodate the pupils attending it, as mentioned in Inspector McGeekin's report of December 1, 1931.\n\nI was advised while at the school that at least 12 pupils were refused admission last year on account of the existing crowded conditions.\n\nThe woodshed, located near the school, offers an ugly sight, and is partly demolished. The whole building should be either reconstructed or repaired.\n\nThe School lot also is in a very bad condition. Large boulders are scattered all over and protrude above the ground. The ground itself is full of holes and large depressions making it dangerous as a playground for children.\n\nIn view of the above mentioned facts and on account of this school being located in full view of one important provincial highway, I would recommend that a new building of the required dimensions to accommodate about 50 pupils be erected and provided with Department standard equipment for a school of this type. I estimate that the cost of such a building would be between $4,000 and $7,500 under ordinary conditions.\n\nIt is possible that some of the materials from the present building could be used in the construction of a new school, and in the building of the woodshed.\n\nThe question of erecting a combined day school and teacher's residence is well worth considering on account of the distance between the school and the town of Maniwaki, in case the teacher should be compelled to live in the town.\n\nDepartmental Engineer.\nROADS.\n\nThe roads on the Maniwaki Reserve are generally in a fairly good condition, with the exception of the Desert Road. The construction of this road was started last year when an amount of $1,000 was expended from band funds for the improvement of this road which was an old wagon road with a very narrow driveway, without any form of grading or drainage. The Desert road is about 9 miles long, entirely within the boundary of the reserve. It is mostly used for the transportation of pulpwood purchased from the Maniwaki Indians. It was the intention to gradually improve it in order that it might be used throughout the year for the above mentioned purpose by expending a certain amount annually either from band funds or Parliamentary appropriation.\n\nThere is no special item in this year's Estimates for road work of any kind on the Maniwaki Reserve, and in order that the portion of the road which was partly improved last year might be kept in a state of repair, I would suggest that $500 be taken from the amount of $2,000 provided for the bridge, referred to under the heading \"Bridges\" to pay for this maintenance work and the construction of an additional piece of road if possible. This would give employment to a number of Indians for a time, which would be appreciated owing to their needy condition.\n\nThe work, if authorized, would be performed under the supervision of Indian Agent Gauthier, with the assistance of an Indian foreman, as has been done in the past.\n\nShould it not be possible to complete the bridge in question with the remaining balance of $1,500, which I believe is quite sufficient, the necessary additional funds could be provided in next year's Estimates.\n\nI might add that it is probable that the Indians will consent, before the end of the season, to expend some of their band funds for the completion of a section of this road, as was done last year.\nBRIDGES.\n\nThe bridges on the Maniwaki Reserve are in good passable condition.\n\nThere is however a new bridge required over a Creek or Gully on the Gatineau Road on lot 25 or 26, for which an amount of $2,000 has been provided in this year's Estimates.\n\nThis new bridge will consist entirely of a timber structure and the work should be carried out by day labour, most of which should be performed by white carpenters under the supervision of a white foreman. Indians, of course, would be employed for unskilled labour such as the construction of the approaches, or as helpers to the carpenters.\n\nAs funds are available, and weather conditions favourable, I would recommend that this work be authorized and that I be advised of the name of the foreman to be employed, also the names of white carpenters.\n\nI presume that Indian Agent Gauthier is already in possession of a list of dealers from whom the necessary materials may be secured.\n\nI might add that an estimate of the cost of this bridge was submitted for your consideration in 1934, which amounted to approximately $1,500.00.\nOttawa,\nJuly 16, 1935.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Williams,\n\nAs per the request from the office of the Honourable the Superintendent General I made a visit to Maniwaki, Que. to investigate some complaints which were lately made by residents of Maniwaki regarding the condition of the school building, the roads and bridges on the Maniwaki Reserve.\n\nIn this connection I beg to furnish you with the following reports with reference to the above mentioned matters.\n\nI might say that this investigation was made in accordance with instructions given me by Mr. Baskard before my departure for Maniwaki.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDepartmental Engineer.\nJuly 16th, 1928.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Buskard -\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Chene's report following his visit to Maniaski.

The Indians are about equally divided between the United Church and Roman Catholic Church denominations. There have been protests received from the Church officials of both these denominations against a combined school for the Catholic and Protestant children. In discussing the matter with Dr. McGill, it was considered that, in view of further protests that would likely arise in the erection of this school, the building should not be proceeded with at the present time.\n\nShould the building on the White Bear's Reserve not be proceeded with, the amount provided could be utilized in the erection of the school building on the Maniwaki Reserve.\n\nI would suggest that this is a matter for the Minister's decision as to whether he prefers that the amount required - approximately $5,000 - be utilized in the erection of a school building on the Maniwaki Reserve, to provide accommodation for approximately 40 children, rather than proceeding with the work of erecting a school on the White Bear's Reserve.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Buskard,\n\nReferring to the second paragraph of your memorandum of the 17th instant, regarding the erection of a new school building on the Maniwaki Reserve, I have to say that there were no funds specially provided in the Appropriation for Indian Education for the current fiscal year.\n\nThere is, however, an item to the amount of $8,000 for the erection of a two-roomed school building on the White Bear's Reserve, No. 70, Moose Mountain Agency, Sask.

Gauthier, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManiwaki, Que.\nReferring to my memorandum of the 16th of July dealing with the advisability of erecting a new school to replace the present one located on the Provincial Highway on the Maniwaki Reserve, I beg to bring to your attention the fact that the estimated cost of $5,000 given in this memorandum was for a one-room day school building, such as ordinarily erected by the Department for the accommodation of from 40 to 50 pupils.\n\nAs you are aware the instructions from the Minister's office on memorandum of July 18th, turned out hereunder, are for the erection of a combined day school and teacher's residence, which will materially increase the cost. I might also add that the excavation for this building will have to be made entirely in solid rock, (granite) and this will also add to the cost. I am however of the opinion that an amount of $6,500 will be sufficient to build this school and teacher's residence, and with your approval I shall ask the Schools Branch to raise an encumbrance requisition for this amount.\n\nThe work on this building started this morning, and will give quite a number of local Indians, who are experienced miners, employment. The job will be rushed in order that it may be completed before the winter sets in.\n\nDepartmental Engineer.\nSeptember 18, 1935.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWill you please furnish this Department with a few copies of the Government Employees Compensation Act for the Province of Quebec, also copies of any supplements, etc., in both English and French.\n\nKindly mark this for the information of the Departmental Engineer.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.

He reported that the building was in a poor condition, too small to accommodate the pupils attending it, and recommended that a new school be provided.\n\nAs no funds had been especially provided for the erection of this school, it was decided to use the funds that had been included in the Estimates for the erection of a two room school building on the White Bear's Indian Reserve No 70, Moose Mountain Agency, Sask., which was postponed until a later date.\n\nPlans were accordingly prepared and the work commenced by day labour on September 15th, under the supervision of Mr. Edmond Dupras, of Gracefield, Que. Owing to an accident which occurred shortly after the work started Mr. Dupras was incapacitated, and Mr. Henri Leduc was employed as foreman, and the work has since then been carried out under his supervision.\n\nThe estimated cost of the work was $6,500.00 and to date the building is partly sheeted in and is now being shingled.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOctober 26, 1935.\n\nMemorandum: Doctor McGill.\n\nIn accordance with telephone request from your office I beg to furnish you with the following information as to the number of men employed on the erection of the new Maniwaki Indian School and Teacher's Residence, at Maniwaki, Que.\n\nThere are 15 men employed at present, the foreman, two carpenters, one bricklayer, and nine labourers.\n\nThey are being paid as follows:\n\nForeman - 65 cents per hour.\nCarpenters - 50 cents per hour.\nBricklayers - 70 cents per hour.\nLabourers - 30 cents per hour.\n\nThe above mentioned wages are in accordance with the Schedule of Labour supplied by the Department of Labour.\n\nM.W.\n\nOffice of the Departmental Engineer.\nOctober 29, 1935.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to advise that the Treasury Branch are today being asked to send you a cheque for $1,000 in connection with the construction of the new combined day school and teacher's residence on the Maniwaki Reserve, Que.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nE. S. Gauthier, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManiwaki, Que.\nOctober 31, 1935.\n\nMemorandum: Doctor McGill.\n\nRe: New combined Day School and Teacher's Residence at Maniwaki, Que.\n\nAs per instructions I made yesterday another inspection of the above mentioned building, and beg to give you the following information.\n\nThe ground around the building has been cleared of trees and brush, which were considered a nuisance and a danger, these being taken away where it is expected that they will be cut into fuel wood.\n\nThe concrete foundation of the building is entirely completed as well as the framing, including the stained shingle roof, with the exception of the porches and verandahs.\n\nThe exterior of the building is now ready to receive the clapboard sheeting and cornices.\n\nPart of the inside board sheeting is also completed ready to receive the gyprock sheeting, and the window frames are ready for adjustment in place.\n\nThe brick chimney is completed.\n\nA drain made of 4 inch tile has been laid from the basement as far as a gully located quite a distance from the building to ensure the drainage of the basement and which can be used for the disposal of sewage should a bathroom be installed in the teacher's residence, which installation is now being recommended in a separate memorandum to the Schools Branch.\n\nThe basement floor is ready to receive the cement finishing coat.\n\nThe above mentioned work, with the exception of the clearing and levelling, was mostly performed by white labour in a thoroughly satisfactory manner.\nThe work has progressed in a surprisingly quick manner, considering the difficulties which were encountered in the excavation for the basement, which was done in solid granite, requiring much labour and time, and consequently heavy additional and unforeseen expenses.\n\nThe work up to the present has cost approximately $2,900 for labour, and $2,200 for materials already supplied but not paid for, which means that a total expenditure of $5,100 has been made to date.\n\nI estimate that under the same arrangements the work could be completed for approximately $3,500.\n\nI beg to advise that the difference between the estimated cost of $6,500 and that now estimated is due to the fact that part of the school lot had to be cleared, and levelled, a drain had to be constructed to ensure the drainage of the basement, etc., and the extra excavation which had to be done in solid granite.\n\nIt is understood that Indian Agent Gauthier, who had charge of the purchasing of the materials up to the present time, will send all accounts, pay-lists, etc. to the Department within the course of a day or so.\n\nDepartmental Engineer.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOctober 31, 1955.\n\nMemorandum: Doctor McGill.\n\nIt would be advisable that arrangements be made at the earliest possible date for the removal of the old school at Maniwaki some distance away from the new building.\n\nI understand that the Indians would like to secure this school to be used as a Council House.\n\nAs you know they would be unable to attend to such work and I doubt if removal could be successfully made on account of the dilapidated condition of the wooden sills, etc.\n\nIn any event I presume that the expenditure would have to be charged to the funds of the band. I would therefore suggest that prices be obtained for the removal of the building to a site across the highway, and that the matter be submitted to the Indian Council for their decision as to whether they would be prepared to bear the expenditure.\n\nOtherwise, I would recommend that the Indians be allowed to demolish it and rebuild it under the direction of a competent foreman.\n\nDepartmental Engineer.\nI understand that an artesian well is authorized to provide safe drinking water for the above mentioned building. Will you please advise if provision should be made at the present time for the installation of a small bathroom adjoining the bedroom on the first floor of the building, at a cost of about $175.00.\n\nAs mentioned in a separate report to the Deputy Minister as to the progress of the work, a four inch drain has been laid from the basement of the building to a gully some distance from the school which could be advantageously used for the disposal of sewage from the bathroom and kitchen.\n\nIf this is to be authorized, I would like to be advised as soon as possible.\n\nBefore the excavation work was commenced for the basement of the building the land around the site was cleared of large trees and brush, which were useless and considered a nuisance and a danger, the work being done by the Indians exclusively. Quite a number of large trees were cut down, trimmed and piled on the school property. I would suggest as a measure of economy that they be cut into suitable lengths for fuel for the new school. This work could be done by the Indians, who are anxious to earn money. I would not advise giving the wood to the Indians as it would create trouble among them.\n\nDepartmental Engineer.\nNovember 4, 1935\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nRe: New Combined Day School and Teacher's Residence,\nManiwaki, Que.\n\nIn accordance with instructions from your office a price was obtained from Mr. Wilfrid Lepine of Maniwaki for the completion of the above mentioned building, which offer I now beg to enclose herewith for your consideration, and which amounts to $4,329.48.\n\nAlthough Mr. Lepine's offer stipulates that his price covers the entire completion of the building now in course of erection it is supplemented by a list giving a summary description of the nature of the work to be performed, as well as other conditions to which his offer is subject.\n\nI am also attaching hereto a memorandum from our Departmental Engineer as to the progress of the work up to date, which gives an approximate estimate of the cost of the work remaining to be done to complete the building in question on condition that the work is carried out under the same arrangements as those first adopted, that is by day labour.\n\nThis memorandum also gives, in the penultimate paragraph, the reasons for the difference between the original estimated cost of the building, namely $6,500.00, and the present estimate of $8,600.00, which increase I believe could not be avoided under the circumstances.\n\nWill you please advise me if Mr. Lepine's offer is to be accepted.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nREQUISITION FOR CHEQUE\nTO BE USED FOR ADVANCES OR AUTHORIZED PAYMENTS FOR WHICH THERE ARE NO ACCOUNTS\n\nDEPARTMENT: Indian Affairs\nBRANCH: Engineer's\nDATE: October 29, 1935\n\nAPPLICATION IS HEREBY MADE FOR THE ISSUE OF THE FOLLOWING CHEQUE OR CHEQUES:\n\nCHEQUE No.: \nIN FAVOUR OF:\nE.

This well was dug down to a depth of 15 feet by the Indians, there being a good supply of water the year round. I would suggest that a well be bored to a depth of 25 feet, at a cost of about $100.00 including the pump, etc. I believe that the chances of getting a good supply of water are favourable.\n\nI might add that the Contractor started the work last Thursday.

In view of this new situation I would ask that you please advise the names of local contractors who may be invited to submit prices for the removal of the old school with the understanding that the total expenditure involved, that is the removal of the building and its repairing, be charged to interest band funds which now amount to $4,500.00.

The type we supply is the single school desk. We are aware that there were a number of double desks in the old school and also a number of single ones, which, no doubt, have been transferred to the new school.\n\nI have to request that you will advise the Department the size and the number of each size of single school desks that will be required. You should state, also, whether any front and rear seats for the single desks are necessary. I am enclosing a page from a catalogue, showing the seating plan of a classroom. In stating the number of desks required, you should take into consideration the number of rows that can be placed in the room and the number of desks in each row. It is considered the double desks should be in the centre, with the single ones on each side. I would request that you give consideration to the seating plan enclosed and state definitely the number of new single desks, fronts and rear seats that are needed to provide seating accommodation for the children who will attend the school. When full information is received, the order for the supplying of the desks will be placed here.\n\nFor your further information, I would say that single school desks are manufactured in the following sizes:\n\n| No. | Size |\n|-----|------|\n| 1   | pupils 16 to 18 years |\n| 2   | 12\" x 15\" |\n| 3   | 10\" x 12\" |\n| 4   | 8\" x 10\" |\n| 5   | 5\" x 8\" |\n\nIt might be advisable to discuss the matter of the desks with the teacher.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

M. Gendron, of Maniwaki and Mr. Wilfrid Lepine also of Maniwaki for the removing of the building above referred to to the new site, as suggested in your letter of the 19th of December, in accordance with a specification outlining briefly the work to be done, that is the manner in which the building is to be moved, and its erection of new wooden sills, etc. If you think it necessary you might ask these contractors to accompany their tender with an accepted cheque as a guarantee that the work will be completed to your satisfaction. It should be mentioned in your specification that if the building is damaged during the process of removal that the contractor shall put it in the same condition as it was at his own expense. Duplicate copies of the specification should be sent here as soon as they are prepared for the records of the Department. In your specification provision should also be made that Indian labour is to be given the preference whenever possible, and the time given the contractor for removal should also be mentioned.\n\nIt might be advisable that you ask these two contractors to submit a separate tender for the removing of the office and small storehouse, which is now at the site of the new school, to some more convenient spot at the rear of the school lot, as understood with the Departmental Engineer when he last made an inspection of the new school building. It will be necessary, of course, for you to prepare a separate specification to cover this work giving a description of the new location of this building.\n\nE. S.

B. M., Ceiling material Moulded Square 675 ft B' M., Cornice Strips 600 Lineal ft. as to the cost of labour I cannot determine the estimate.\n\n3\u00b0 I think this job could be made in two different ways, by removing the window and door casings and putting them back into place over the Ten-Test, or laying the Ten-Test close to the window and door casings and cover the seam with a narrow strip of wood (or Ten-Test if made) against the casing and over the edge of the Ten-Test.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nT.

You may, therefore, do the work that is absolutely necessary at both schools, but the total cost must not exceed the amount mentioned above.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

MacInnes, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI visited the Maniwaki Indian day School today and found that the following requirements were needed:\n\n1.- Repairing of the water tank. Water was left in this tank during the Christmas holidays and busted it. It might be possible to repair this water tank or drinking fountain but I am not very sure of it. If it could not be repaired a new one would have to be furnished.\n\n2.- At least four window screens for the school and one for the house should be furnished.\n\n3.- The hot water boiler for clothes is also busted and should be repaired.\n\n4.- One more empty barrel should be furnished for water or at least the one that is there should be painted and recleaned to be able to use it.\n\nI also noticed that the toilets were in a very bad condition and were very dirty. The floors of the school were washed only twice since the month of November 1936. I understand that it is quite hard to keep the floors clean in the Spring with a bunch of children, but I really believe washing the floors...\nonce a month would not be too often.\n\nWould you therefore let me know if these requirements are necessary and if so I will have them done as soon as I get permission.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMay 10, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 5th instant regarding certain requirements at the Maniwaki Indian day school I would point out for your future guidance that when submitting requests such as those contained in your letter you should give an estimate of the expenditure that will be necessary. I presume that it will not be costly to repair the water tank, purchase 4 new screens, a clothes boiler and 1 water barrel. You may, therefore, secure these.\n\nYou may arrange to have the toilets cleaned and forward an account for the work.\n\nI note your remarks that the floors have not been washed since November, 1938. In this regard I may say that Abraham McDougall, the caretaker, is allowed an amount of $100.00 a year which is a much larger sum than is allowed at other Indian day schools throughout Canada. At the time of his appointment it was distinctly understood that he would carry out any duties required by the teacher. Either the teacher or yourself should instruct McDougall regarding the times at which the floors should be washed and if he does not carry out your instructions you should advise the Department and nominate some person else to do the janitor work at this school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

Now I tried to get this wood on the Reserve and gave the Janitor Chief McDougall order to buy one cord from any Indian. He reported two days later that there was no dry wood on the Reserve to be gotten, so I bought one cord in the village.\n\nThe second item $6.00 is for screens put on the Maniwaki Indian Day School, you may refer to letter No. 18-2-5, dated 10/5/39.\n\nThe third and last item is for lumber to repair the Congo Bridge Day School veranda, as ordered by Mr. Jude Thibault on his last inspection trip here.

Nodon for $2.50 for money overpaid him on one alarm clock furnished for the Maniwaki Indian Day School.\n\nI have checked Mr. Nodon's account with him and find that instead of being overpaid he has still an account of $2.50 against the Department.\n\nOn December the 16th, I sent you Voucher No. 182, in favour of Mr. Nodon to the amount of $2.50 for one alarm clock furnished to the Maniwaki Indian Day School.\n\nOn the same date I sent you Voucher No. 163, in favour of Mr. Nodon to the amount of $5.00 for one pair of glasses for Mrs. Jos Forbes, Barri\u00e8re Band.\n\nThe total of these two Vouchers were $7.50 and Mr. Nodon has really received only $5.00 thus making a balance of $2.50 still owed him. If as your letter says there has been an error in the\nVouchers, I will gladly correct it, but I am at a loss to understand how it is that a voucher could have been made for $2.50 when the account for Mrs. Jos Forbes was for $5.00, therefore the voucher and the account did not correspond and you would have noticed it immediately.\n\nFrankly I do not know what is the proper way to fix it up and I will await your letter letting me know what to do in this case.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 12th, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOverpayment - $2.50\n\nJ.C.

He there told me not to do any repairs on those toilets before I heard from the Department that he would take it up with the Department, that is Mr. Phelan, on his return.

I took the opportunity to tell the pupils present, to tell their parents that unless they attend school regularly, the monthly allowance check will be cut down every month a child of school age is not attending school regularly.\n\nThis building is in great need of painting inside and outside, specially the outside which, in my mind will begin to deteriorate, as you can hardly tell that it has been painted.\n\nXX XX XX\n\nJude Thibault,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, May 25, 1945.\n\nInspection report - Maniwaki Indian Agency\n\nA visit was made to the above agency on May 15 & 16th.\n\nSCHOOLS\n\nI also visited the Congo Bridge school, in charge of Miss Kla Brazeau. The attendance is much better here, and the Indians in this section appear to understand better, the value of the Family Allowance, and apparently intend to take advantage of it. This school is in need of seats for six more children, and I recommend that same be supplied before the reopening of the school next September.\n\n// This building also need painting inside and outside.\n\nJude Thibault,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, May 30, 1945.\n\nMr. J.

Please let me know which size is needed.\nYou should also let me have an estimate of the expend-\niture required to do the painting.\n\nManiwaki:\n\"This building is in great need of painting,\ninside and outside, particularly the latter.\"\n\nPlease let me have an estimate of the\nexpenditure required.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nManiwaki, July the 12, 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nReferring to your letter of May the 30, 1945 concerning the painting of the Maniwaki Indian Day School and the Congo Bridge Indian Day School, I wish to inform you that I finally succeeded in getting a painter to go and visit these schools to make an estimate of the painting jobs.\n\nThe Congo Bridge Indian Day School would cost for painting the Inside and Outside, excepting the floor, which would need a new floor the sum of $165.00.\n\nThe Maniwaki Indian Day School would cost for painting the Inside and Outside, excepting the floor which would need sanding before oiling or varnishing as they are hardwood floors, the sum of $460.00. Moreover, this latter school would certainly need some repairs in the verandas before the painting job is done. I would estimate the veranda repairs at $40.00.\n\nRegarding desks for the Congo Bridge Indian Day School the teacher tells me the medium size would be needed. The small size are too small for the children attending.\n\nJ.E. Gendron, I.A.\nOttawa, July 20, 1945.\n\nMr. J. E. Gendron, Indian Agent,\nManiwaki, Que.\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, with reference to painting the Maniwaki and Congo Bridge Schools. Owing to present conditions, we believe that only one school should be painted this year and I am inclined to feel that the Maniwaki School should be chosen.\n\nIt is noted that you have secured a quotation of $460.00 from a painter. I presume this covers both material and labour and would also mean the painting of both the interior and the exterior, with the exception of the floor, which would be sanded and then oiled or varnished. Please let me have a written tender from the painter from whom you secured the estimate. When submitting the tender, it would be appreciated if he would state the number of square feet of painting which is required. As soon as we receive the tender, it will be referred to the Director for his approval.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nManiwaki 31/7/45\n\nMonsieur,\n\nJe vous envoie un d\u00e9tail du travail et le prix pour peindre sur l'\u00e9cole Indienne de Maniwaki :\n\nToutes surfaces d\u00e9j\u00e0 peintes - repaire \u00e0 deux couches (int\u00e9rieur & ext\u00e9rieur)\nC'est soit la diminution de 2 pes pr\u00e8s 1900 pi\u00e9ces qui co\u00fbte 460.00\n\nPour les couvertures qui sont gard\u00e9es et grandement ternies deux couches\nC'est 125.00\n\nLe Plancher d'une salle \u00e9rig\u00e9e, plancher bois franc - ou 5.00\nLe plancher des classes, bois franc\nVoile au-dessus - 10.00\n\nAlbert Archambault\nManiwaki\nManiwaki, July the 26, 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nReferring to your letter of July the 20, 1945, concerning a tender for the painting of the Maniwaki Indian Day School, I wish to include you herein this tender by Mr. Albert Archambault, painter of Maniwaki, P.Q.\n\nYou will remark that he is satisfied to paint all of this School both outside and inside same as it had been painted the first time for the sum of $460.00. It is estimated at about 4900 ft. square.\n\nI had also asked this contractor to put a price on the painting of the shingle roof and you will see that he included this on his tender for the sum of $125.00. This roof needs to be painted very badly and I recommend it should be done. There is also the floor of the living room, as this floor is not worn it would be better to varnish it and it would cost $5.00. As far as the floor of the class room not included in the tender it should be oiled and he is satisfied to do it for $10. He claims it is too badly scratched for varnishing. The kitchen floor was painted when this school was built and it is included in his tender of $465.00\n\nThe whole tender would be as follow:\n- $460.00 for painting all wood work that has been painted before both outside and inside.\n- $5.00 for varnishing the living room in the residential part.\n$10.00 for oiling the Class room floor.\n\nAll tenders made cover both material and labour and covered with two coats of paint.\n\nJ.E.
