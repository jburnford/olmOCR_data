MAVEETY\nPRINCE ALBERT N.W.T.,\nFRIDAY, DECEMBER 31, 1866.\n\nTHE OLD YEAR.\nThe old year goes away like a shadow, and there are many hopes will be realized with the east. It enters into the abyss of the dead, taking with it all our dreams and hopes for a considerable time. The world has come into its own, and we, as people, have peace with itself and Wigner. And yet, notwithstanding these prophecies, people's attention. Some great men, however, in all ages have been looked upon as fools who will live in history for all time to come. But with the years we come and with them there are new hopes and dreams. All we have to do is to believe what we see here, a blessing. Time turns its wheel without the notice and the pride of the people around us.\n\nMUNICIPAL ELECTIONS.\nIf we are not fortunate enough to secure a good Council for the ensuing year the people of Prince Albert will be to blame, as they have always been accustomed to select a sufficient good majority out of which to select five good men. We will see how the election will turn out in their favor, and that the municipal interests will be allowed to be in the hands of those who are in the know.\n\nTwo weeks ago the ballot, so that there was no possibility of it being altered by the electors. We called attention some weeks ago to the fact that by the amendment made to the Municipal Act (1864) has been left to Municipal Councils to decide whether or not they have paid their taxes shall affect them at Municipal elections, but we do not know whether they go in force immediately. At all events, it will be necessary to take action now, and those who have not paid their taxes ought to appeal in the matter of the ballot now coming up. There are, we understand, about 125 names on the voters' list, of which about 60 names are registered property. The poll will open at nine o'clock Monday next, in the Council Chamber, and close at 3 p.m.\n\nHALFBREEDS SLANDERED.\nHon. William Laurier, the leader of the French Liberals, and a man who boasted that he would have done had he been on the banks of the Saskatchewan when the rebellion broke out, made a speech yesterday afternoon before the Delegates of the various provinces, where he attacked the halfbreeds and the causes that led to it. After referring to the history of the halfbreeds, he said that they showed unwavering loyalty to British institutions since they became British subjects, he had been asked why he refused to show the same courage as if he had his rifle on his shoulder, and rolled from off his silvery tongue a ringing, contemptuous slander against the M\u00e9tis.\n\n\"You may say that the wretched halfbreeds are not fit to be compared to the heroes of British history. If you say so, so do I.\"\n\nWe have reason to print some hard things about the halfbreeds, but it is known to be false, that the Roman Catholic party has been the most slander against them than belongs to Mr. Laurier. We do not know how far they would go to defend the halfbreeds would compare with the \"heroes of British history,\" but we know that, but for the Roman Catholic party, the halfbreeds like Laurier would have not have broken their record as a possible, Christian and patriotic people. They are doing just what ought to be done, and they are doing it.\n\nONTARIO ELECTIONS.\nThe interesting question involved in Mr. Mowat being sustained by an increased majority. To those who are convinced that Mr. Mowat is the Premier of Ontario, and the somewhat similar course pursued by the Mold of Prince Albert, may be justified. Since Mr. Mowat obtained power he has endeavored to strengthen his hands by every possible means. He has been very persistent in his efforts to get the Imperial government to recognize the Municipal Councils that would give him power over the liberties of the people. He has been persistent in his efforts to point out the Inspectorate, and by that means has been able to control over the Imperial elections. He has been doing everything and anything to make Oliver Mowat and his colleagues life rulers of this province. In view of the evidence of change of policy on the part of the Mold of Prince Albert, and the support of local opinion to a radical Federationist, we feel justified in predicting that the Liberal candidates into office will be very few indeed. But as it is impossible for Mr. Mowat to complete as possible, the Mold took to doing the Separate School system on Ontario. The Separate School system on Ontario is a device to drive the Roman Catholics and driving the Roman Catholics away from the schools, as it has been the case in the past.\n\nTo add to his prestige came the sudden change of policy on the part of the Mold. He became a supporter of local opinion to a radical Federationist, which will enable him to drive those who were opposed to prohibition and the licensed saloonists into the ranks of the anti-prohibitionists whom they loved the latter more, but because they loved prohibition less. But as it is impossible for Mr. Mowat to complete as possible, the Mold took to doing the Separate School system on Ontario. The Separate School system on Ontario is a device to drive the Roman Catholics away from the schools, as it has been the case in the past.\n\nCOMMUNICATIONS.\nHE RISES TO EXPLAIN.\nFor the Editor of the Times.\nSir,\u2014Mr. J. F. Coley, of Clarke's Crossing, who passed through here a few days ago on his way to Prince Albert, spoke to me a half hour ago, and has been circulating falsehoods in relation to me that are more nearly than the pack of cards that he used to throw at me. These statements of Mr. Clarke are made with a view to injure me with the electors of the district in gratitude for his petty political services. I do justice to and find for the information of the public who do not know the motives that prompted the remarks, I state that Mr. Clarke has been here and at other places he has said that I can only take one vote in the election. I believe that it is not in my best interest to say anything less than a dozen votes, as it is easy for me to get Mr. Mowat's version. I submit a few extracts from the speeches made by Mr. Clarke at the meeting the evening before, the 20th inst., and also for your publication, if it does not trespass too greatly upon your limited and valuable space.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nN. B. Stewart, Dec. 29, 1866.\n\nA meeting of the electors of this district was held in the schoolhouse this morning, for the purpose of considering the question of nominating a candidate to the House of Commons. After some discussion, Mr. Peter Stobart, President, as proposed by Mr. Peter Latham; Mr. Molloy was nominated by Mr. Tracey, seconded by Mr. Stewart, and Mr. Molloy, taken by ballot Mr. Molloy was declared by the chairman to be the choice of the meeting. Mr. Tracey then moved that this nomination be made unanimous, which was carried. The following gentlemen were nominated for the position: Messrs. Tracey, McMillan, Molloy, Latham, and Stewart.\n\n(Signed) J. N. Guthrie, Chairman.\n\nF. W. Kain, Sec.\n\nI did not attend that meeting to secure a nomination as stated publicly there, but to urge the electors to use their votes for one man when the time came, and in this I was generously aided by Mr. Tracey, and the movement of my nomination unanimous was most cheerfully received and enthusiastically carried.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nB.

CATHERINE'S.\n\nA very enjoyable evening was held at St. Catherine's on Christmas Eve, the occasion being an entertainment provided by Miss McGregor for her pupils in the parish. The children were all present\u2014some in body and behaved with great decorum\u2014the very youngest being, like Tiny Tim, \"as poor as a gold.\" There was a large attendance of parents, who filled the church being quite filled, even after temporary seats had been placed from time to time. One Carol greeted us, and the utmost good humor prevailed throughout.\n\nAdded by numerous friends to the district and in Prince Albert, Miss McGregor had been successful in providing a Christmas tree loaded with gifts from abroad to be seen every day in the Northwest. Mr. Inskster acted as Father Christmas and, with his wife, Mrs. Inskster, soon stripped the tree of its load, and the delighted eyes of the youngsters as they opened their presents were a joy to study. The articles for distribution have been selected with care and judgment and are sure to give much satisfaction, receiving some notice at once useful and ornamental along with a Christmas card and a gift. The children were most enthusiastic about the gifts, and the parents, too, were pleased with the selection made.\n\nEAST END SCHOOL ANNUAL EXAMINATION.\n\nThe Christmas examination of the pupils attending the school was held in the schoolroom on Friday, December 21st. The examiners were Messrs. McLeod, Robert Robertson, and Mr. McKenzie. The teacher conducted the examination in a most satisfactory manner, and received great praise from all present for the marked improvement shown by the pupils.

Each child was given a certificate acknowledging the satisfactory manner in which he had answered the questions.\n\nHIGH SCHOOL EXAMINATION.\n\nThe Christmas examination of the Prince Albert High School took place on Friday, December 21st, in the presence of quite a number of parents of the pupils and others interested in the welfare of the school. The following classes were examined in Reading, Arithmetic, Algebra, Latin, French, English Grammar, Geography, Voice Music, and Drawing; the correctness of the answers given, in most instances, bearing witness to the thoroughness of the instruction received. After the conclusion of the examination by Bain, who occupied the chair, the students were dismissed on the understanding that those who had failed in any subject would be allowed to remain by the influence of the parents. After Christmas cards were distributed, the school was closed until January 1st. It was announced that the class would reopen on Monday, December 31st, 1886.\n\nST. LAURENT.\n\n(Special to The Prince.)\n\nMr. R. J. Molloy addressed a meeting of the electors here this afternoon.
