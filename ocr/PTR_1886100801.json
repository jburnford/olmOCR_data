Mr. Sutherland stated that with English capital and aid given by the Canadian Government, forty million dollars of the work will be completed this year, and that assurance has been given by English capitalists that if local funds fail to meet the requirements of this extent funds will be forthcoming to complete the entire line. With this object in view Mr. Sutherland will again visit England, and the building materials for sixty miles have already been shipped from Liverpool. The work is being fully arranged for.

Society.\n\nThird Annual Exhibition.\n\nThe Third Annual Exhibition of the Lorne Agricultural Society was opened on Thursday the 30th of September. The weather, though a little cold, was not adverse to the proceedings. A large number of people were in from the surrounding country and Carrot River district. The members present showed a great interest they took in the proceedings by visiting the exhibition building and examining the exhibits.\n\nThe exhibition was a great improvement on last year, nearly twice the number of entries having been received. The fair grounds opposite the vacant site immediately opposite the Town offices, and containing five acres, were laid out tastefully by Mr. Craig, and arranged along the Hard & Baker estate. The first flat of the building was set apart for grain, vegetables, and other fruits, and vegetables, and the second flat for dairy products, fancy work, etc. It is to be regretted that the number of entries was not as large as was expected, which was owing to the fact that the harvest had been very disappointing, and the further fact that the quantity of grain required to be exhibited to compete for the prizes was so large as to prove the samples on hand, of wheat especially, were good. The first prize for Red Fife Wheat was awarded to Capt. Craig, and the second to Capt. Craig, for White Russian; the first prize was awarded to H. Miller, for Red Ruby, the second prize for white oats, and Capt. Craig second, the latter also taking first prize for oats. Capt. Craig was also awarded a special prize for the production of grain consisting of 2 bushels of wheat, 200 lbs. of oats, and 50 lbs. of peas. To Mr. Miller, a special prize was also awarded to A.
