B. Maurault, M.D. Agent,\nPierreville, P.Q.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to the request concerning our refrigerator. It is now a year we cannot make use of it.\n\nMen of experience have come to see what could be done to it and it has been found that it would cost not less than one hundred dollars ($100.) and even more to repair it and yet without any guarantee.\n\nA request for a new one has been made to the Department by our General Bursar in Ottawa. The Department has promised to inform you about the matter, but we have had no news yet.\n\nYou would greatly oblige us if you would be so kind as to renew the request for same.\n\nYours much obliged,\n\n[Signature]\nSuperior.\nPoville,\nApril 732.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nPlease find attached a letter received from Mr. Macdonald concerning the resignation of Mr. Smith's heading which has been out of commission for at least a year now. Ripe is now almost impossible as this mark of refrigerator has been out of the market for quite a few years so it is impossible to find any more. Owing to these complications I think it would be more practical to buy a new machine and to forget.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This would involve an expenditure for which no funds have been provided.\n\nHave you considered the possibility of purchasing an ordinary icebox at a cost not exceeding $20.00 to $25.00? The Department would be prepared to allow this on the understanding that the Rev. Sister would pay for the ice that would be required.\n\nWith regard to your letter of the 10th instant the Department will allow an amount of $4.00 for removing the storm windows and replacing them with the screen windows.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDr. B.

On dit que cela ne co\u00fbterait pas plus de cinq piastres.\n4.- Une vingtaine de piastres sont requises pour les grands m\u00e9nages.\n\nEsp\u00e9rant que vous vous int\u00e9resserez \u00e0 ces demandes, comme d'ailleurs vous le faites si bien, je me souscris,\n\nMonsieur l'Agent,\n\nVotre tr\u00e8s humble en N.-S.,\n\n[Signature]\nPierrefitte\nJune 25th\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYou will please find attached a letter received from Mr. Baker, Superior of St. Joseph's Academy, telling of certain urgent repairs to be made at the school.\n\nWill you please authorize these small repairs and others?\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

School.\n\nThere appears to be a growing tendency on your part to allow expenditures at this school to increase. You should be fully aware of present conditions and the difficulty that the Department is experiencing in obtaining the necessary funds for the operation of schools. It is difficult to understand why it was necessary to employ a man from September 20. However, as you have committed the Department to this expenditure you may resubmit the voucher for his wages from that date.\n\nI wish to point out that your letter requesting authority to employ the furnace man was dated October 27 and consequently the man had been working for over a month before you applied for the necessary authority. In future unless you apply for authority before incurring expenditures the Department will be unable to consider their payment and you will be personally responsible.\n\nWe allow $40.00 a year for a janitor at this school. In spite of that fact you have been submitting accounts for various other services which should be performed by the janitor. Already we have expended an amount of $65.00 for removing screens and storm windows, cleaning class rooms and housecleaning. It should be definitely understood by all parties concerned that we do not intend to expend any more money for these services during the current academic year. This work will have to be done by the janitor for the amount which he is paid.\n\nDr. B. Maurault,\nIndian Agent,\nPierreville, Que.\nIt should be understood also that the furnace man's salary will not be paid after May 1, 1941, and if possible his services should be discontinued before that date. The Department will rely on you to make an endeavour to economize in this regard.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

This work is done by children and I'd hate to involve them in the task of removing up and down a ladder two stories high with storm windows for the first rain, it might be impossible for them to do the work and so, if the Department can't authorize this advance in the spring and again for the fall, these windows and storm doors will have to stay there the year around.\n\nAs to the balance of the $65.00 which you stated would you please fill me here three $25.00 more?\n\nYours Truly,\n\nBenj.

If your department feels that they should not be taxed, we would ask you to kindly get in touch with the Provincial Government, who, in turn will advise us of the exemption.\n\nYours truly,\n\nTHE SHAWINIGAN WATER & POWER CO.,\nCommercial & Distribution Dept.,\nper/ Z.

School for the period June 1, 1941, to June 1, 1942.\n\nThis voucher is issued in favour of Arthur Tremblay. For the year ended June 1, 1941, you submitted for the same service a voucher in favour of L. Cloutier. The voucher for the year ended June 1, 1940, was issued in favour of Arthur Tremblay, while the voucher for the year ended June 1, 1939, was issued in favour of L. Cloutier.\n\nWhy is it that the voucher for this service is issued in favour of a different person each year? Is the water plant owned by either of these individuals or by someone else? It would appear that this confusion could be avoided if accounts were rendered in favour of the actual owner rather than the individual. I am, therefore, returning the account in order that you may explain fully why it is issued in favour of Arthur Tremblay.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDr. B. Maurault,\nIndian Agent,\nPierreville, Que.\n\nR.A.

An inspector of houses is absolutely needed.\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to advise that the hot water tank at Mr. Thomas's residence is in a very bad condition; it has been repaired at different times and leaks again.

Very likely another will occur if care is not taken at once. We suggest that an officer should come for inspection and to make an estimate of the cost, as it is impossible for us to do so.\n\nHoping you will do your best to obtain from the Dept. a prompt and favourable answer,\n\nWe remain, gratefully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nSuperior.\nDear Sir,\n\nPlease find attached a letter received from Sr. Superior of St. Joseph's Academy, describing the state in which this house is actually in.\n\nI have visited the house when the water was dripping in two or three different places and the furnace room and the sisters were bailing the water out from one part of the cellar into the drain pipe, quite a job.\n\nThe pump slide should also be attended to.\n\nWill you please attend to this matter at once.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This job will cost between $175. or $180. at the least.\n\nIt is very important that this work be done without delay; as later on, I do not know if I would be able to get men to do it, and it is quite impossible to face another winter with the roof in this condition.\n\nPlease give an immediate attention to this matter, and I'll be\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Descoteaux.\nRe: Repairs at St. Joseph's Academy\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMr. Chas Ed. Robertson who had made the estimates, last summer, has just sent me the attached letter, explaining why the cost of the repairs doubles the amount of the estimates.\n\nI never knew before Robertson presented the accounts that there was so much difference between the estimates and the cost of the repairs. But as far as I can see, any of what the letter tells me, I do not believe there was anything done that was not absolutely necessary.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nOct 26/43\nOttawa,\nNovember 2, 1943.\n\nDr. B. Maurault, Indian Agent, Pierreville, Que.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 1st instant, you may re-submit the accounts of Mr. Descoteaux in connection with the repairs to the St. Francis R.C. School.\n\nAs pointed out in my letter of the 1st ultimo, it is difficult for the Department to understand why you allowed the expenditure to exceed the authorization to such a large extent. Such action not only makes it difficult for the Department to control the vote but it also makes us hesitate when future expenditures that may be quite necessary are requested at your agency.\n\nR.A.

Maurault, Agent,\nPierreville, P.Q.\n\nDear Agent:\n\nWhen Mr. Doucet visited the schools last April he noticed that three rooms should be repaired this year. Moreover the exterior of the building has been greatly damaged by usage and especially by the mobility of the ground. These repairs should have been done a long time ago and it is, I believe, in the interests of the Department to have them done as soon as possible.\n\nLast year we asked to have the porch repaired and nothing was done.\n\nIt would require about $50 for the general cleaning of the classrooms, the corridors and the hall.\n\nI beg of you, dear Agent, to make these several requests at your earliest possible convenience.\n\nHoping that these gentlemen will understand the necessity to take care of the upkeep of their building, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.) Sister M. Josephine,\nSuperior.\nPemville, June 1864\n\nDear Sir,\n\nPlease find attached a letter just received from Sister Josephine of St. Joseph's Academy.\n\nYours truly,\nBenj. Burrell, Agent\nOttawa,\nJune 22, 1944.\n\nDr. B. Maurault, Indian Agent, Pierreville, Que.\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, enclosing letter from Sister Josephine with reference to additional repairs required at the St. Francis R.C. School. You might arrange to have Mr. Descoteaux give you an estimate on the cost of fixing the porch and also repairing the three rooms about which Sister Josephine speaks. Separate tenders should be submitted for each of these. As soon as we have this information the request will receive further consideration, but if any heavy expenditure is involved it is doubtful if we will be able to consider it.\n\nI also note the request for $50 for general cleaning of the whole building. The Department considers this amount excessive, as in past years only $25 has been requested for the same purpose. However, it may be more difficult to have this work done at the present time, due to shortage of labour, and an amount of $35 will be allowed for the purpose this year.\n\nR.A.

Are we to understand that these were Indian children who had been attending the St. Francis R.C. School? If so, it should have been possible to have one of the teachers do this work. The examinations were apparently held on June 21 and 22 and we paid the teachers' salaries for the full month of June. In any case authority should have been requested before incurring an expenditure which we are required to pay.

Macdonald about the repair that should be done in the kitchen of the St. Francis School. He says he is willing to do the work for the price mentioned in your letter, but he wants to know if the work shall be done by day labor or by contract. Shall he produce his bill in a block $75.00 or shall he put in detail?\n\nYesterday I went to the St. Francis school and the sisters showed me the water closet bowl which leaks. I think it is the joint between the sewer pipe and the bowl that is defective. Upstairs there is a sink whose drain pipe is leaking too. The sisters would be very pleased if those things were repaired because the floor is always wet around the W.C. bowl and they can't use the upstairs sink. The sisters have a knitting machine which is defective. They told me this machine was sent away for repairing but\nit is not in much better shape than before, so they cannot use it for the girls normal training.\n\nI cannot find the letters you refer me to; the one of July 28 and July 31. They are not in the file. I searched all over the papers I have here, & call no warrant about them and always\u2014nothing.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nM.

The Department will depend on you to make certain that Mr. Descoteaux carries out all the work that he has promised to do for the amount quoted. You may also arrange for repairing the water closet bowl and the sink.\n\nWith reference to the knitting machine, is it possible to have this repaired?

This regards service rendered to St-Francis school.\n\nThis invoice of $19.41 has, for the first time, been sent to me on the 8th of March 1945. I wonder why they sent so late. I discuss the matter with the Company's collector and finally Mr. Z. Courchesne, the Sorel office manager came yesterday to settle the matter with me. I still doubt we owe them that amount.\n\nBy the record book I find no place for that amount of $19.41. On the 5th of January I sent to Ottawa a bill of $17.36, which, in my opinion, covers the service period ending the 22 of December 1944.\n\nI am sending you a copy of the record book.\n\n| Paid by Dr. Maurault | Amount | Date sent to Ottawa |\n|----------------------|--------|---------------------|\n| July & August        | $22.10 | August 23, 1944     |\n| Paid by me           | $5.02  | October 26, 1944    |\n| September & October  | $17.36 | January 5, 1945     |\n| November & December  | $17.36 | March 12, 1945      |\n| January & February   | $17.32 | May 17, 1945        |\n| March & April (to be paid) | $15.76 |\n\nWill you please tell me if the amount of $17.36 covers the service period ending the 22 of December, 1944.

Instead of using scrubbing once in a while.\n\nHope that my request will be favourably\nconsidered.\n\nI remain, respectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nSr. M. Renee, P.C.\nPrincipal\n\nSr. S. Maclean, Super\nPierreville June 20, 1945.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have received the attached letter from the Sisters of St-Francis R.C. School regarding repairs. Last week I went to the school to estimate what was needed. The repairs requested are justified.\n\nMaterials:\nPaint........... 2 gal. at $4.25 ............ $9.50\n\" ............. 3 \" \" $3.90 ............ $11.70\nVarnish........ 3 \" \" $5.25 ............ $15.75\nwages .......... 140 hours at $0.40 ....... $56.00\n\nThis is a Rough estimate. When the work will be done the price may be a little more or a little less, but I think I am pretty close to what is needed.\n\nFor the chimney the mortar disaggregates some places at the upper end, but this is not very urgent.\n\nI think the office roof may be repaired with roofing plastic. This is urgent.\n\nThe floor of the veranda is good and needs paint. The roof of that veranda is not in good order. It seems to leak in the whole length and I am afraid the wood is damaged at some places. This ought to be examined by a man of the trade.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDr. Michel Tetreault,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 25, 1945.\n\nDr. Michel L\u00e9tourneau, Indian Agent,\nPierreville, Que.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 20th instant, the Department approves an expenditure of $36.95 for paint and varnish to make repairs at the St. Francis R.C. Indian Day School. It is noted also that there will be an expenditure of $56.00 for labour and this amount is approved.\n\nI note that the roof of the school office can be repaired with roofing plastic. I presume this will not be expensive and you may arrange to have the necessary work done.\n\nPlease obtain a quotation and submit it to this office, in connection with the repairs required to the verandah. The quotation should show exactly what work is required.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, June 30, 1945.\n\nDr. Michel Tetreault, Indian Agent,\nPierreville, Que.\n\nThe Department finds it necessary to return voucher No. 335, covering the cost of electric service for the St. Francis R.C. School. It is simply impossible for us to check this account, as we cannot decide what rate is being charged.\n\nPlease request the Company to give us detailed information as to the manner in which they arrive at the total amount charged in their account for electric service.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEncl.\nMonsieur Sr M.

School. This man states the wood work and metal are good. The trouble is that, the metal is nailed in places with nails having lead washers and it is where the roof leaks. With a little plastic on these nails the trouble will be over.\n\nRegarding the office roof, it is much more serious than I thought first. The office is covered with galvanized iron, which, for repairing purpose, was coated with pitch. This pitch shells here and there and metal sheets are cut in many places especially on the ribs.\n\nThe tinsmith says new roof ought to be done.\n\nHere is his estimates:\nLabour for one man to remove old iron..........................8.75\n600 pounds of galvanized iron at $9.00 per sq. ft..............54.00\ntin, acid, gazoline, nails, elastic gum.........................3.00\nTinsmith's wages.............................................30.00\n\nThe tinsmith suggests that the roof of the whole building should be painted. That roof was painted once, the paint shells in some places, but we see no rust spots. So I think we can wait at least until next year. May be the conditions will be better at that time, laborers being more available.\n\nAbout galvanized iron sheets the tinsmith told me a permit is needed to buy them. Can the Department secure that permit?\n\nYours truly,\n\nDr. Michel Tetreault,\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, July 19, 1945.\n\nDr. Michel Tetreault, Indian Agent,\nPierreville, Que.\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, in which you state that you can easily repair the roof over the verandah of the St. Francis R.C.

Formerly we only paid $25.00 a year and we did not appear to have given any authority for increasing the cost of the services. You should, therefore, submit a new voucher for $25.00.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nPierreville, January 31st, 1946.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan, Chief, Training Division.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of January 24th instant, with regard to the amount requested for the water services at the St-Francis R.C. Day school.\n\nI have seen Mr. Art. Tramblay, the manager of the water-works and he states that the price for supplying with water this school is $50.00 a year since 1930.\n\nIn the record book, during the administration of Dr. Maurault, I see voucher No. 103, dated January 14, 1943, covering the cost of water services at the above named school. The amount is $50.00. Of course I don't know if this amount has been paid or not.\n\nI return my voucher with the invoice because Mr. Tramblay says he is sure the price is $50.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDr. Michel L\u00e9tourneau,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 5, 1946.\n\nDr. Michael Tetreault,\nIndian Agent,\nPierreville, Que.\n\nI regret that it is necessary to again return\nthe account for the water service at the St. Francis R.C.\nSchool.

A. J. Boucet, Supervisor,\nTraining Division,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nCher monsieur,\n\n\u00c0 mon retour de la conf\u00e9rence de Qu\u00e9bec, je me suis occup\u00e9 du toit du couvent d'Edanak.\n\nD'abord j'ai eu la visite de deux hommes de la compagnie Guy Laval de Nicolet. Je suis all\u00e9 avec eux \u00e0 Ottawa. Ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 sur le point examiner la situation et ont \u00e9t\u00e9 voir dans le grenier. Ils n'ont fait le report cinqui\u00e8me, ni ces hommes ont trouv\u00e9 la compagnie n'a pas voulu soumissionner. Cette compagnie s'occupe de toitures, mais sa sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9 est surtout les syst\u00e8mes de chauffage.\n\nIl ne fait pas de chaleur en autre homme. M. Edmond Beyer de Terrebonne m'a donn\u00e9 sa soumission (elle est incluse). Sa sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9 est de peinturer les \u00e9chelles et les volets des \u00e9glises. Il me semble que sa soumission est un peu floue.\n\nEnfin j'ai fait voir mon ferblantier de St-Fran\u00e7ois-du-Lac, Marcel Beyer. Pour lui des vis toutes telles que sup\u00e9rieures \u00e0 Guy Laval, qui ne veut pas cher. Il propose une couverture neuve et il a soumis l'offre pour 10 livres de t\u00f4le (1000 pieds carr\u00e9s) au prix de $10.00 par couvre. Il dit qu'il faut payer le prix de la couverture, c'est-\u00e0-dire la partie \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la rivi\u00e8re et celle au sud de l'\u00e9glise. Ces deux parties feraient nous payer lors de la commission du couvent le couvert en neuf. Je crois que la soumission de M. Beyer est beaucoup plus vant\u00e9e que celle de M. Beyer. Il ne demande pas beaucoup plus cher et il nous fait un toit neuf. J'ai plus de\nconfiance \u00e0 une couverture neuve ou de la peinture sur une visille t\u00f4le.\n\nEt le moment le soit de co\u00fbte aux meilleurs de ces deux parties ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9es, l'un tard, l'autre les conditions seront meilleures, nous pourrons couvrir le reste si le besoin s'en fait sentir.\n\nLe service est pas le t\u00f4le en stock, mais il serait bon de pouvoir \u00eatre en fin de compte. Il ne dit, il est trouv\u00e9 trop cher que des nouvelles durant l'hiver, si on lui accorde le temps, il nous dit il voit aussi t\u00f4t un possible afin de lui permettre de nous aider pour couvrir cet automne. C'est urgent; le temps est emm\u00e9nag\u00e9 dans la chapelle et dans une chambre.\n\nLa cl\u00f4ture qui entoure le coude du couvent est en tr\u00e8s mauvais \u00e9tat. Quand j'ai fait mes estimations, j'ai fix\u00e9 le prix de cette cl\u00f4ture \u00e0 785,00. Ce qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e0 meilleur compte, elle n'y a certainement encore pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e0 l'ann\u00e9e, elle est donc en mauvais \u00e9tat. Elle est bas\u00e9e sur la t\u00eate des arbres. La broche est tomb\u00e9e, elle est d\u00e9truite. Il y a un bout pr\u00e8s du couvent qui est compl\u00e8tement terre. C'est tr\u00e8s disgracieux.\n\nJ'inclus une lettre de la soeur sup\u00e9rieure me demandant certaines r\u00e9parations.\n\nPour la galerie de m\u00eame que pour le fond de la chapelle et de la chambre il faut tenir compte que le toit de la maison soit rep\u00e9r\u00e9 avant. Les murs de la salle \u00e0 manger, de l'escalier, du corridor et ceux des chambres sont les m\u00eames ici et l\u00e0. Il faudrait r\u00e9parer ces fissures et peindre les murs et le fonds.\n\n10 lbs de Cold patching cement.............. 1.90\n10 gallons de peinture....................... 31.0\n10 gallons de peinture....................... 10.0\n10 gallons de peinture....................... 38.00\n10 gallons de peinture....................... 10.00\nTotal........................................... $184.00\nLe plancher de l'\u00e9cole mesure une superficie de 10 verges carr\u00e9es. Pour le couvrir de rev\u00eatement, il faudrait 4 verges de longueur \u00e0 verger de largeur. Je dis encore que si elle veut voir du rev\u00eatement en plus de 4 verges de largeur, elle doit de 2 \u00e0 3 verges pour plus. Ce plancher doit co\u00fbter au moins 100,00.\n\nQuant au toit de la cuisine, je peux me faire une id\u00e9e de ce qu'elle a fait faire un \u00e9lectricien pour le r\u00e9parer et de combien cela peut \u00eatre co\u00fbteux, mais je ne peux pas dire \u00e0 quel prix. Il faut faire des estimations correctes, mais elles doivent \u00eatre faites par un professionnel, car les travaux de r\u00e9paration de toiture sont co\u00fbteux et n\u00e9cessitent des comp\u00e9tences sp\u00e9cifiques. Si elle souhaite \u00e9conomiser sur le co\u00fbt total de cette r\u00e9paration, elle pourrait envisager de faire appel \u00e0 une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 locale ou \u00e0 une entreprise de travaux publics qui peut offrir des prix plus bas.\n\nJe peux vous aider \u00e0 trouver des conseils avis\u00e9s et des informations utiles.\n\nJe reste,\n\nVotre d\u00e9vou\u00e9,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMichel Petreault\nAgent.\nOttawa, September 12, 1947.\n\nDr. Michel Tetreault, Indian Agent,\nPierreville, Que.\n\nRepairs to St. Francis R.C.

Lately he called and advised me that stock had begun to come in but very slowly. He called me again today and says that what is available presently is aluminum sheets, but it is more expensive. Instead of $210.00 the contract with aluminum would be $257.00.\n\nIf aluminum is approved I think he will begin the job in a few days.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDr. Michel Tetreault,\nIndian Agent.\nJune 10, 1948.\n\nDr. Michel Tetreault, Indian Agent,\nPierreville, P.Q.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 5th instant, the Department approves an expenditure of $257.00 for repairing the St. Francis Day School.

The iron sheets being not available the contract was changed for aluminium.\n\nHe has laid the 10 squares of aluminum, but he should have figured 20 squares instead of 10, because only half of what was intended to cover is covered. The work done is well done.\n\nI have been informed that a sum of $1200.00 had been provided to cover repairs to this school. I believe we should finish the work while aluminum is still available. 10 more squares will be necessary.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDr. Michel Tetreault,\nIndian Agent.\nAugust 12, 1948.\n\nDr. Michel Tetreault,\nIndian Agent,\nPierreville, P.Q.\n\nWith reference to the repairs to the roof of the St. Francis R.C. School, we are returning your voucher No. 112.\n\nPlease prepare a new voucher to which you should attach a written quotation from Marcel Crevier to provide the roofing and labour in connection with its installation, for an amount of $257.00.\n\nIn reviewing your letter of the 31st ultimo it is difficult for us to decide why the contractor made such a mistake in figuring the quantity of material required. Last fall you requested $210.00 and we approved this expenditure in official letter of September 16th, 1947. In your letter of June 5th you stated that the price had increased to $257.00 and we authorized this expenditure.\n\nNow you state that the amount mentioned only covers half the roof, although both your letters intimated that the amount previously authorized would be sufficient to cover the whole roof.\n\nMr. Doucet hopes to be in your vicinity some time within the next month and will inspect the school and decide what further work, if any, is necessary.\n\nBernard F.

Paint:\n   Attached are measures of the surfaces to be painted at the school. These are given in square feet and for one coat. As two coats are necessary they should be multiplied by 2. About labour I estimate that approximately 300 hours (at $0.75 or $0.50 per hour) will be necessary to perform the work. It may be safer to add about $20.00 extra for it always happen some unexpected expenses in that kind of work.\n\nWith best regards,\n\nAtt.

Then Mr. Doucet came this was discussed. He approved most every item. The roof was excepted. I decided to wait for the roof. It is no more leaking.\n\nMr. Doucet said he had a meeting in Ottawa and that he would see that it would be put through. May be this has been overlooked, for I did not have any news about that.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSr Michel Petreault,\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir,\n\nOn last visit of Mr. Boucet at Lacerville Indian Reserve, it was suggested to improve the supply of water at the above named school, to use a well dug by the missionary last year and approximately 125 feet distant from the school. The missionary is willing to let the sisters have the well provided they install a hand pump for his use.\n\nIt was decided to enlarge this well, to cement it, lay a trench and install an electric pump in the school cellar. Mr. Boucet asked me to look for the prices and estimates of these different items and submit a report. That is what I did except for the report. The reason is that forgetting anything, I needed it was impossible to assure in the short time. The water was analyzed by the Provincial Laboratory and was declared \"safe\" (Report enclosed). It is believed that this water is contaminated by the soil travelling up and down to fetch water used by the defective covering of the wells. This may be the reason of the contamination of this water.\n\nIn the meantime the priest has installed an electric pump in the cellar of his house. He drove a pipe with a joint attached to the lower end right into the ground of the cellar and he reached water about 18 feet in depth. I was watching this very closely, after it had worked 3 or 4 weeks satisfactorily I urged the priest to have the other installed. He did so and I have just received the report yesterday. The report is declared \"good\" by the samples taken from the tap. The others samples come from a pump installed next to the electric pump and to be used in case the electric version stops; this happen sometimes. This pump is new and has not been used except to assure if it was functioning good. It may happen the same found by analysis were in the pump before its installation and the fact that the pump has not been used enough to wash them out.\nI would suggest this kind of installation instead than use the wells close the school, which I intended to use in the first place. Here we have no site or place, no trench to dig, much less rise to buy and much less labour today. Of course I cannot guarantee to kill strike water today. This is rather speculative. But it is a good risk to take, I believe. We can use a hand pump first, have the water analysed and if all five satisfaction, install the electric pump. To drive a line about 12 feet in depth will cost about one man day. I have one hand pump I could lend for that and I think we could borrow a stat.\n\nThere has been developments regarding the Inuvik Waterworks lately. For many years there has been much interest between Mr. Cleary, owner of Inuvik Waterworks, and the Municipality of Inuvik concerning the water supply to the population. For the last few years Inuvik has been searching for water in the ground. A last test they have succeeded, according to the advice of the experts they have three plots where three additional wells could be installed with an output of one million gallons per day and the other two 75,000 each. This is very interesting for the need of Inuvik and Canada is 10,000 to 150,000 daily.\n\nI had an interview with the Mayor about this. They are planning agreements with the farms to have the water in the village outside of the village. They are planning a refer due and it is question to buy additional land to add repair or rebuild this waterworks. The water was analysed at \"Leduc\" and the council seems to be a mood to speed up things, but it will take many months before we have that water at our taps.\n\nEnclosed are different kind of systems and suggestions for installation. I think there are enough explanations and illustrations to make it clear.\n\nMr. John Lemieux sells the Macgillivray system, he has enclosed a sketch. Mr. Lemieux is doing his business by the county, and he has in addition to our scheme, the water in the wells is for the district and not the continuous operation of the plant. I am in favour of the idea for in a month or two we will have all the population have water there and I wonder if the wells will be sufficient.\n\nNote: Mr. Lemieux sells Macgillivray pump, but recommend the Johnson pump-dam installation as for Lemieux.\nDear Mr. Smith:\n\nI am writing to you in connection with the Southern Pump Company.

Philo Oct 8th\nOctober 18th, 1949.\n\nMaurice Boisvert, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Boisvert:\n\nThis is with reference to your letter of August 13th and our conversation of October 14th with regard to the water supply at Odanak.\n\nThis matter is somewhat complicated. It was hoped to secure a water supply for the school from the well dug by the missionary last year, but unfortunately analysis showed that the water from this well was contaminated and unsafe. Subsequently, it seems the missionary installed an electric pump in the cellar of his house with which he used an artesian well securing water at a depth of about fifteen feet, which on analysis was declared good.\n\nIt has been suggested by the Indian Agent that a similar plan might be followed at the school. The whole matter will be investigated by our Supervisor of Vocational Training, Mr. A. J. Doucet, who will be at Odanak at a very early date.\n\nAs you are aware, this whole question of bad water in the vicinity of Odanak and Pierreville is an extremely important one and as I mentioned to you several members of our staff have become ill, in one case seriously. What solution there could be for the whole difficulty both for the Indians and other members of the community is difficult to say.\n\nOn the immediate question of the school water supply, however, you will be advised further as soon as a report has been received from Mr. Doucet.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\nOctober 20th, 1949.\n\nDr. Michel Tetreault,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nPierreville, P.Q.\n\nRe: St. Francis R.C. Indian Day School. Your File (23)\n\nWith reference to your letter of September 24th and official reply of October 4th regarding the water system at the above school, it is regretted that Mr. Doucet has been unable to visit the school sooner.\n\nHowever, it has been definitely settled today that he will be in Pierreville on Monday, October 24th. In the meantime, it would be appreciated if you would locate a man who is able to test for water by points.\n\nMr. Doucet could give him instructions regarding the manner in which to proceed, and when Mr. Doucet is returning from the Lorette Agency 2 or 3 days later, he will again visit your Agency. He will then be in a position to decide what further action should be taken with regard to securing water.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\n\nIndian Affairs.

Day School. Mr Cloutier owner of the Pierreville waterworks, pretends we are behind with the payment of this service. I have searched in the records here and I am afraid he is right. Could you please tell me to which date the water has been paid.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDr Michel Tetreault,\nIndian Agent.\nOctober 26th, 1949.\n\nDr. Michel Tetreault,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nPierreville, P.Q.\n\nRe: St. Francis R.C. Indian Day School. Your File (23)\n\nWe have your letter of the 14th instant with reference to the payment for the water used at the above school.\n\nOn February 20th, 1948, you issued Voucher No. 31 for an amount of $50.00 in favour of Ludger Cloutier. This Voucher read as follows: \"For waterworks service at St. Francis Day School from June 1st 1947 to June 1st 1948\".\n\nOn April 23rd, 1949, you issued Voucher No. 65 for $50.00 in favour of Ludger Cloutier. This Voucher read as follows: \"Water service at St. Francis Day School from December 1947 to December 1948\".\n\nBoth of these Vouchers have been paid, but you will note that there was an overlapping in charges. Voucher No. 65 included the period January to June 1948, which had already been paid by Voucher No. 31. Consequently, in paying Voucher No. 65, we actually paid to June 1st, 1949.\n\nYou will, therefore, note that our books show that we actually owe Mr. Cloutier from June 1st, 1949.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nPP/ST\nChief, Education Division\nEstimation des travaux de peinture \u00e0 faire au couvent le 26 juin d'octobre\n\nRefectoire 1 journ\u00e9e \u00e0 deux hommes 2\nPassage de l'office \u00e0 la porte d'entr\u00e9e 1 journ\u00e9e \u00e0 deux hommes 2\nLe Parloir 4 journ\u00e9es \u00e0 deux hommes 8\nLa classe m\u00e9dicale 3 journ\u00e9es \u00e0 deux hommes 6\nLe corridor entre les \u00e9l\u00e8ves 1 journ\u00e9e \u00e0 deux hommes 2\n2 chambres \u00e0 couloir dans le haut 4 journ\u00e9es \u00e0 deux hommes 8\nLa chambre des dortoirs \u00e0 la salle 1 journ\u00e9e \u00e0 deux hommes 2\nLa salle de bain 1 journ\u00e9e \u00e0 deux hommes 2\nLa grande salle 15 journ\u00e9es \u00e0 deux hommes 30\n\nTotal 58 journ\u00e9es de 10 hrs 290\n\nRecommand\u00e9 $150 for labour for complete decoration, but that the auditorium be left for repainting, as well as the outside work.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Doucet\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nCher monsieur,\n\nJe viens vous donner des nouvelles de notre puits du couvent d'Odanak.\n\nLundi matin le Docteur Faucher a pris des \u00e9chantillons de l'eau de ce puits pour fin d'analyse. Il ne s'attend pas \u00e0 ce que le r\u00e9sultat soit favorable. Il dit que la chose principale est d'avoir de l'eau dans ce genre de puits. Et voici comment on proc\u00e8de. On finit le puits, ensuite on le d\u00e9sinfecte avec du chlorure de Chaux, on vide le puits 3 ou 4 fois et on prend ensuite des \u00e9chantillons d'\u00e9chantillons et en a beaucoup de chance que l'eau soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9e bonne. Il ne voit pas pourquoi l'eau ne serait pas bonne \u00e0 la profondeur o\u00f9 nous la prenons.\n\nApr\u00e8s votre t\u00e9l\u00e9phone de l'autre jour il a plu et comme le trou que nous avons creus\u00e9 mena\u00e7ait de d\u00e9bouler j'ai demand\u00e9 aux hommes de descendre les tuyaux de b\u00e9ton aussi bas que possible. Ils ont travaill\u00e9 environ une journ\u00e9e.\n\nLe deuxi\u00e8me tuyau en partant d'en bas est \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s au niveau de l'eau. Ils ont mis deux tuyaux par dessus, ainsi qu'il se produit un d\u00e9boulis on ne perdra pas l'ouvrage qui est fait. Les tuyaux sont couverts avec des planches pour emp\u00eacher la terre de tomber dedans.\n\nLe puits a 18 ou 19 pieds de profondeur. Il y a 3 pieds et 10 pouce d'eau dedans, la premi\u00e8re feuille de tuyau se remplit en 1/2 heure. Maintenant si on doit continuer les travaux il va falloir se h\u00e2ter parce la gel\u00e9e ne doit pas \u00eatre loin. Il a neige hier et aujourd'hui. Il est vrai qu'il ne fait pas tr\u00e8s froid encore mais la temp\u00e9rature peut changer beaucoup du soir au matin \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque de l'ann\u00e9e.\n\nVotre d\u00e9voue\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Bourbonni\u00e8re\n\nJLB/mbp\nAquamatic Operation\n\nDouble pipe Aquamatics combine two pumping principles \u2014 a vertical motor-driven centrifugal pump located at the well surface and a hydraulic jet located below the water level in the well. The only moving pump part is the impeller, located above ground in the pump. The hydraulic jet, operating in conjunction with the centrifugal pump, delivers water from the well to the pump, which in turn delivers the water under pressure to the storage tank. A small percentage of the water removed from the well is returned under pressure by the centrifugal pump to the hydraulic jet, thereby enabling it to raise more water from the well. The entire operation is a smooth, automatic, continuous flow. Per dollar invested, Aquamatics give you superior lift per horsepower and deliver more gallons per hour for a given set of conditions.\n\nHOW TO SELECT YOUR DOUBLE PIPE AQUAMATIC\n\nFind gallons per hour (GPH) needed from water requirements chart (Page 1). Measure pumping level at your well \u2014 that is, number of feet from pump head to water while pumping. Under \"pumping level\" column, choose the next deeper column. Example: If your pumping level is 65, use \"70\" column. Reading down in \"70\" column, choose GPH you need.\n\nRead across in your GPH column to get minimum inside diameter of well and the catalog order number.\n\nEQUIPMENT FURNISHED: Pump complete with motor (60 cycle, single phase, 115/230 volt), pressure control valve, air volume control, pressure switch, air volume control, pressure gauge, jet assembly, foot valve, slip coupling and fittings to connect pump to air volume control.\n**EASIER INSTALLATION\u2014WIDER CHOICE OF SITES**\n\nFlexibility of installation possible only in Aquamatics is guaranteed by the exclusive design of the pump head.\n\nTwo pipe outlets in the head sidewall are provided for offset installations, permitting straightforward connection of drive and discharge pipes without reducing sizes or capacities. This feature makes installation much easier by eliminating the need of awkward elbows and costly special construction\u2014modestly commonly needed for offset applications with conventional pump designs.\n\nBottom outlets provided for Aquamatic over the well installations are simply plugged when the pump is off the well; side connections are available when the unit is installed. This pump head design, plus Aquamatic streamlined styling and exceptionally tough construction, are features that give you the widest possible choice of location sites.\n\nAquamatic tanks can be placed in home, basement, or barn to protect them from unexpected freezing spells, and to make them easy of access during all kinds of weather. Or they can be as easily placed in a well pit or pump houses. Whatever the site problems of your locality, Aquamatic flexibility will make the solution easier\u2014at lower cost.\n\n---\n\n**THUMBNAIL ESSAY ON AQUAMATICS**\n\nMilk production up 15%...

However, 1\u00bd HP models can be used in a 5 inch well when the installation is offset.\n\nNOTE: All systems normally furnished with single phase motors; however, 3-phase motors can be supplied on special order on systems of 1-hp and larger.\nAquamatic Operation\n\nThe same principle of operation is employed in this pump as in the double pipe jet. Instead of a second pipe being used as a drive pipe, the area between the well casing and the single pipe performs that function. A well packer is attached to and located directly below the jet assembly to seal off system pressure from well water.\n\nIdeal for\n\nThese Establishments: Farms; ranches; dairies; rural business firms; auto courts; apartment houses; resorts; country clubs, dude ranches and estates.\n\nAnd These Applications: All domestic water supply usages; laundries; water heaters; water softeners; automatic washers, dish washers and waste disposals; livestock, garden, and yard watering; duck ponds; ornamental ponds and fountains; sanitation and fire protection on farms, ranches, dairies, and rural business firms.\n\nHOW TO SELECT YOUR SINGLE PIPE AQUAMATIC\n\nFind gallons per hour needed (GPH) from water requirement chart. (Page 8)\n\nMeasure pumping level of your well\u2014that is, number of feet from centerline of discharge connection to water while pumping. Under \"pumping level\" column, choose the appropriate column. Example: If your pumping level is 65, use \"70\" column.\n\nReading down in \"70\" column, choose the GPH you need.\n\nIn \"well pipe size\" column, find the figure that corresponds to inside diameter of your well.\n\nRead down in your well diameter column and across in your GPH column. Where these columns intersect is the catalog order number of the Aquamatic to meet your requirements.\n\nEQUIPMENT FURNISHED: Pump complete with motor (60 cycle, single phase, 115/230 volt), pressure control valve, automatic pressure switch, air volume control, pressure gauge, well adapter for well pipe, jet assembly, well packer, flexible hose, and necessary fittings to connect pump to well adapter and air volume control.\nTHE JOHNSTON PUMP RECORD\n\nAquamatic users benefit by the more than three decades that Johnston Pumps of all types have earned remarkable service records throughout the world in nearly every conceivable application of sub-surface water pumping. The irrigation of millions of acres...the servicing of thousands of industries...hundreds of municipal water systems...and mines\u2014that is the kind of experience that gives Johnston submersible pumping equipment the background of authority.\n\nCompiled with this impressive practical record is the unsurpassed tradition of the John- ton policy from the first. It has been a fact-and-figure progressiveness, based on precision manufacturing methods, skilled engineering, and constant research\u2014all for the purpose of steadily advancing performance standards and of passing these benefits on to the user.\n\nThe balanced service found pre-eminently in Aquamatic Systems resulted from this same combination of unsurpassed research and practical experience. Hydraulic data from many sources were sifted to ascertain the more effective designs. Johnston engineers then turned their skill upon forming these improvements, extended to each unit, with special attention to related performance. Consequently, the Aquamatic Systems provide you with the most significant economies and outstanding dependability. These margins of superiority in service are the natural outgrowth of Johnston methods and are characteristic of the Johnston record.\n\nTHUMBNAIL ESSAY ON AQUAMATICS\n\nIn the kitchen...pounds of water every day for dishes, scrubbing, cleaning, etc. When you want it.\n\nOutside domestic requirements...hundreds of gallons of water for irrigation, sprinkling, added washing jobs, etc. Where you want it.\n\nLivestock needs...correct amounts of water for cattle, chickens, pets, and other stock. How you want it.\n\nSELECTION TABLE\u2014JOHNSTON AQUAMATIC SINGLE-PIPE SYSTEMS\n\n| PUMPING LEVEL \u2014 FEET TO WATER WHILE PUMPING | WATER PUMPING CAPACITY \u2014 U.S. GALLONS PER HOUR |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 140 150 | 400 310 230 210 150 110 420 480 320 240 190 570 475 350 280 230 210 150 680 580 460 400 360 240 180 780 685 545 475 445 380 350 230 230 880 720 575 540 465 400 375 250 252 1000 900 850 700 500 550 480 400 320 260 1410 1300 1040 860 825 750 600 480 450 400 350 300 1900 1700 1550 1325 1160 1125 925 825 750 725 625 550 500 450 2500 2300 2000 1700 1550 1450 1300 1150 1060 975 850 825 750 675 550 3300 3000 2500 2200 2125 2000 1800 1500 1400 1275 1200 1100 980 890 790 710 |\n\n| Model Pump | Size of Discharge Pipe Required | Power Switch Rating | Pumping Min.

You needn't wait any longer for the extra income from the time-saving convenience made possible by Aquamatics. You need only to live near available electric power and have a suitable source of water \u2014 well, lake, or stream.\n\nMany thousands of farmers, agricultural colleges, and power companies have proven over and over again that every phase of farm production becomes more profitable with automatic running water. For example, on Mr. Haggard's 346-acre Michigan farm using 2,500 gallons of water a day, saved enough in labor costs alone to pay for equipment and installation in just a year with $196 in profit to spare! Add this new income from increased production, and the question becomes not \"How can I afford an Aquamatic System?\" \u2014 but \"How can I afford to be without one?\" The average pumping cost for 750 gallons, supplying a family of five on a farm with 10 cows, 100 hogs, and 1,000 chickens, is less than two cents a day.\n\nYour Johnston Dealer can secure credit through qualified institutions, banks, and government agencies. While terms may vary slightly from time to time and in various localities, finance charges are low, and in most cases up to three years credit may be extended to qualified borrowers, either in equal monthly or seasonal payments, secured by a note. Credit procedure is quick and simple; payments begin only after the Aquamatic is installed and working to pay for itself.\n\nWhatever the problem in connection with your pumping equipment \u2014 selection of an original installation; improvement or enlargement of an established system; installation questions; assistance in arranging credit \u2014 ask your nearest Johnston Dealer.

The figures are average, may vary with seasonal and individual requirements. You alone are in a position to know. Approximate the number of outlets needed, then figure the gallons per day possible for all these outlets during the peak hour. The most gallons used in any one hour will determine gallons needed and size unit required. Allow plenty of well to allow some extra for future needs. See your Johnston Aquamatic Co.

A typical double pipe over-the-well installation. Pumping level for all installations is determined by measuring from centerline of discharge pipe to lowest point the water in the well will recede while pumping. Jet submergence should be not less than 10 feet below the lowest anticipated pumping level at the driest season of the year. Should pumping level be within a few feet of well bottom, the jet should be set as far below the water surface as is possible, leaving not less than one foot between the foot valve and the well bottom.\n\nJOHNSTON AQUAMATIC CO.\nMANSFIELD, OHIO\n\nBulletin 2014\nSM-649\n\nIndian Affairs.

Eliminates danger of freezing and bursting pipes. Puts an end to the chore of turning off valves and draining pipes before winter. Ideal for homes, farms, filling stations, tourist courts, trailer parks, golf courses, factories, cottages.\n\nIn Strataflo the valve is lifted vertically (not turned), avoiding the turning action of conventional valves that causes excess wear and tear on the valve seat. When the valve is closed, water in the riser pipe is drained out a small hole in the valve chamber below frost line.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS AND LIST PRICES\n\n| Catalog Number | Length From Lower Inlet to Hose Outlet | Inlet (Std.) | Outlet (Hose) | Approx Ship.

Quand il y a un besoin d'eau, qu'elle soit froide ou chaude, elles sont con\u00e7ues pour \u00eatre utilis\u00e9es sur les fermettes, h\u00f4tels de camp, manufactures, mines, etc. Elles sont \u00e9quip\u00e9es de toutes les caract\u00e9ristiques de la Pompe McDougall \"Bulldozer\" auto-lubrifiante de haute capacit\u00e9 pour le travail \u00e0 faire. Tous les engrenages sont en acier inoxydable, cylindres doubles en cuivre, si\u00e8ge de soupape en acier inoxydable.\n\nLes soupapes de succion et de d\u00e9charge facilement accessibles sans d\u00e9ranger les lignes de succion.\n\npour puits dont la distance verticale de la pompe au niveau de l'eau ne d\u00e9passe pas 22 pieds.\n\nLes pompes McDougall sont le r\u00e9sultat de longues ann\u00e9es d'exp\u00e9rience.

Dans le pompage de puits tr\u00e8s profonds, la vitesse mod\u00e9r\u00e9e prolonge la dur\u00e9e de l'appareil et favorise \u00e9galement le service de pompes en tr\u00e8s grands volumes. La course de 6 pi (mod\u00e8le 497) est appropri\u00e9e pour les fermes et les maisons portuaires.

Day School water system\nOdanak P.Q.\n\nOn last visit of Mr. Doucet at Pierreville Indian Reserve it was question, to improve the supply of water at the above named school, to use a wells dug by the missionary last year and approximately 125 feet distant from the school. The missionary is willing to let the sisters have the wells provided we install a hand pump for his use.\n\nIt was decided to enlarge this wells, to cement it, dig a trench and install an electric pump in the school cellar. Mr. Doucet asked me to look for the prices and estimates of these different items and submit a report. That is what I did except for the report. The reason is that before starting anything I guessed it was preferable to assure if the water was good. The water was analyzed by the Provincial Laboratory and was declared \"Unsafe\" (Report enclosed). It is believed that this water is contaminated by the pail travelling up and down to fetch water and by the defective covering of the wells. This may be the reason of the contamination of this water.\n\nIn the meantime the priest had installed an electric pump in the cellar of his house. He drove a pipe with a point attached to its lower end right into the ground of the cellar and he reached water about 15 feet in depth. I was watching this very closely. After it had worked 2 or 3 weeks satisfactorily I asked to the priest to have the water analyzed. He did so and I have just received the report yesterday. The report is declared \"Good\" by the samples taken from the tap. The other samples come from a pump installed next to the electric pump and to be used in case the electric service stop; this happen sometimes. This pump is new and has not been used except to assure if it was functioning good. It may happen the germs found by analysis were in the pump before its installation and that the pump has not been used enough to wash them out.\n\nI would suggest this kind of installation instead than use the wells close the school which we intended to use in the first place. Here we have no wells to enlarge, no trench to dig, much less pipe to buy and much less labour to pay. Of course\nI cannot guarantee we will strike water surely. This is rather capricious. But it is a good risk to take, I believe. We can use a hand pump first, have the water analyzed and if all give satisfaction, install the electric pump. To drive a pipe about 15 feet in depth will cost about one man day. I have one hand pump I could lend for that and I think we could borrow a point.\n\nThere happen new developments regarding the Pierreville water works lately. For many years there has been much quarrel between Ludger Cloutier, owner of Pierreville waterworks, and the Municipality of Pierreville concerning the water supplied to the population. For the last years Pierreville has been searching for water in the ground and last week they have succeeded. According to the sayings of the engineer they have three spots where three artesian wells could be installed with a capacity of one 50,000 gallons per day and the other two 75,000 each. This is very interesting for the need of Pierreville and Odanak is 110,000 to 120,000 daily.\n\nI had an interview with the Major about this. They are planning agreements with the farmers where the water is (The water is a mile outside of the village). They are preparing a referendum and it is question to buy Cloutier's interests and repair or rebuild this waterworks. The water was analyzed and declared \"Good\". The council seems to be a mood to speed up things, but it will take many months before we have that water at our taps.\n\nEnclosed are different kind of systems and suggestions with estimates. I think there are enough explanations and illustrations to make it clear.\n\n1o--John Meunier sells the McDougall system, he has enclosed a sketch. All what is drawn in blue is furnished by the company, and what is in red is at our expense. The pump on the wells is for the priest's use and the fontaine Hydrant on the right corner is suggested for the use of the village accommodation. I am not in favour of the item for in a month or two we will have all the population take water there and I wonder if the wells will be sufficient.\n\n2o--J.L. Bourbonniere sells McDougall pump, but recommend the Johnson pump--same installation as for Meunier\n\n3o--Shooner & Cie sells the Southern pump\n4o--Rene Mondou sells the same pump Southern like Shooner at same price. Mr. Mondou installs the pumps of all these firms. Mr. Mondou gave me a price for the whole business if we use a point. He will furnish:\n\n1 Southern pump with a 120 tallons tank\nPipe required, 3 points (he says 3 points are more effective than one), electric installation and place the point or points. The whole will cost approximately $250.00 if he strikes water at the first time. If he has to look for water the price will vary.\n\nAll these pumps submitted here can work as well with points or in the wells outside.\n\nI hope all these details will be useful to you.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd) Dr. Michel Tetreault\nIndian Agent.\nMr. Vincent,\n\nMr. Doucet is about on business for 2 or 3 days.\n\nBefore leaving he discussed with Mr. Girard our new clause 2001-3/49 re finances of province for 58 reserves etc.\n\nMr. Doucet asked Mr. Vincent for the enclored\n\nP.C.\n\nDec 19/49\n## SCHEDULE OF QUOTATIONS\n\nReceived by\n\nTelephone [_____] Letter [_____] Tender [_____]\n\nReq.

She has not sent in her resignation however and I understand that she wishes to remain on till the end of the school year, June 30th, next.\n\nAn application for the position of teacher of this school has been made by a Miss Charlebois, who has had previous experience. She refers to Mr. T. P. Foran, K.C., of Hull and Mr. Chene of this Department for reference as to her qualifications. I have called Mr. Foran up on the phone and he told me that Miss Charlebois was a highly educated woman of excellent character and that she had been employed as stenographer in his office and in the Superior Court in Hull and he assured me that we would be very fortunate in obtaining her services. Mr. Chene also spoke very highly of her.\n\nHer application was made for the St. Isidore Road School and, if Mrs. Grow, nee Gallagher, were out of the way, I would recommend her appointment. When I visited\nvisited the school last November I reported that the conditions there were not satisfactory and that I considered that it would be to the advantage of the pupils if another teacher were secured. The only question is how long Mrs. Grow should be allowed to remain.\n\nMiss Charlebois would, from the inquiries I have made, be an acquisition to our teaching staff as she is a middle aged woman of experience. I would suggest that she be offered either the St. Regis Island or the Cornwall Island schools, the latter of which will be vacant on the 31st of March, next, temporarily and be given charge of the St. Isidore Road School as soon as Mrs. Grow is disposed of.

The Department wishes you to do this work and Mr. Agent Brosseau has been so informed. I have, therefore, to request that you will go to the St. Isidore Road School on the 31st of this month and receive the keys of the school-house and teacher's residence from Mrs. Grow and take over all the furnishings mentioned in the list enclosed herewith, in duplicate. You will be good enough to see that these supplies are in good order and report any shortages that you may find. Please see that the buildings are properly locked and the goods carefully secured.

Miss Charlebois, who applied for the position, states that she will not be able to take it at present, as she is engaged in the Senate for the session. There are two other applicants, both Indians, Peter Williams, who was assistant teacher in the Boys' School in the village, and Mrs. Juliette Smith Twoaxe, niece of Martin Twoaxe, constable on the reserve.\n\nAs the school should be re-opened immediately after the Easter holidays, I would recommend that one of these applicants be engaged for the balance of the school year. This will give the Department time to secure the services of a qualified teacher for this school. Please direct me which of the two should be selected.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Jacobs\nBox 33 Caughnawaga\nJnl.\nOTTAWA, June 5, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nIt has been brought to the attention of the Department that the services of Mrs. Lena Y. Jacobs, Teacher of the St. Isidore Road School on the Caughnawaga Reserve, are not very satisfactory. The Inspector states that she has no professional qualifications, and besides she is a young wife with children and her family require her attention at home.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will state whether you consider that her services should be continued, and also if she resigned whether it would entail any hardship on her. You should state whether her husband has a suitable home, and what occupation he is engaged in, and whether he is able to support her.\n\nWe are anxious to make the work at this school more successful and to that end the services of a qualified teacher should be obtained. You will kindly state as soon as possible your views as to whether Mrs. Jacobs should be retained as teacher for another year or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ. M. Brosseau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, P.Q.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 5th instant with reference to Miss Anna Jacobs, teacher of St. Isidore Road school, I beg to say that Mr. Gilman reports come with this view: Miss Jacobs is a young mother and all her time is occupied at home for her young children. Her husband is now working in the construction of new buildings at bridge. I can't say if he owns a house, but I know that during the summer holidays he occupies a house in the village. It seems to me you may dismiss this teacher without my recommendation because I have never been consulted when the Department retained her services. However, I may say that I have no objection to such a dismissal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell F. Ferrier, Esq., M.T. Brossard\nIndian Agent\n\nOttawa\nOTTAWA, June 13th, 1922.\n\nMadam,\n\nIt has been brought to the attention of the Department that the services being performed by you as teacher of the St. Isidore Road Indian Day School on the Caughnawaga Reserve are not satisfactory, owing to the fact that as a young married woman considerable of your time is occupied in taking care of your children; also that you have not the necessary professional qualifications to give the desired instruction to the children. We are anxious to make the work at this school more successful. We understand that your husband is earning good wages and is able to give yourself and family the necessary support.\n\nIn view of the above, the Department feels that it would be in the best interest of the work at this school to discontinue your services at the end of the present school year, viz: June 30th, and Mr. Agent Brossard is being informed accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMrs. Lena Y. Jacobs,\nBox 106, Caughnawaga,\nQue.\nOTTAWA, June 13th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, regarding the services of Mrs. Lena Y. Jacobs, teacher of the St. Isidore Road School on the Caughnawaga Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that in view of the reports received from the Inspector and yourself, it has been decided to discontinue Mrs. Jacob's services from the end of the present school year, ending June 30th next.\n\nWe are informing Mrs. Jacobs accordingly, and a copy of our communication to her is enclosed herewith for your information.\n\nWe will endeavour to obtain the services of another teacher to begin duties when the school re-opens after the summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Miss Descoteaux has a Model Diploma for the Province of Quebec, and also a Third Class Certificate for the Province of Saskatchewan, and has excellent testimonials.

She was also requested to hand you a requisition for any school material required, or any supplies that may be needed for the teacher's living quarters. She will, upon arrival at Caughnawaga, visit with the Sisters at the teachers' residence.\n\nIt is hoped that you will give Miss Descoteaux every assistance, and that she will meet with success in her work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

This bonus will be at the rate of $15.00 per month during that time.\n\nOur Agent, Mr. J. M.

Any supplies required for the schoolroom or for the living quarters will be furnished upon a requisition being prepared by you and handed to Mr. Agent Brosseau, who will bring same to the attention of the Department.\n\nWe hope that you will meet with every success in your work at this school.\n\nMiss Juliette Descoteaux,\nPlaisance, Labelle Co.,\nQue.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

In reply I beg to state that you may inform Miss Descoteaux her resignation, to take effect immediately, is accepted.\n\nThe Department is taking steps to secure a successor without delay, and I hope to be able to give you information regarding a new teacher not later than Thursday the 2nd. If, however, Miss Descoteaux moves out before the new teacher arrives, you will please make arrangements to safeguard the residence and school equipment. The doors and windows should be securely locked or fastened.\n\nThe following equipment has been lately supplied by the Department and should be checked by you before the old teacher moves out:- 28 small articles for kitchen and dining room, 1 bread box, 1 five gallon coal oil can, 3 lamp chimneys, 1 water pail, 1 linoleum rug, 1 toilet set, 25 yards muslin, 4 curtain poles, 1 coal scuttle, 1 sanitary closet and a clock. In addition, there is the schoolroom and residence furniture and other articles remaining over from last academic year. The articles from Goodwin's Limited will also be found in the residence and these should be carefully stored. I believe you have the original of Goodwin's account - this Department has a copy.\n\nThe retiring Teacher, Miss Descoteaux, should make out a return showing the number of days school was open and the number of children in attendance each day. You should secure a forwarding address from her, so that a cheque in full payment of her services can be issued.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. M. Brosseau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, P. Q.\nOttawa, Oct. 31, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that, upon the recommendation of Sister Mary Gabriel, of Caughnawaga, the Department wishes to suggest the name of Miss Annie V. Jacobs for the position of teacher for the St. Isidore Road Indian Day School.\n\nWill you ascertain if Miss Jacobs is available and if she is willing to accept this school at a salary of $500 per annum plus any bonus provided by law. If you are successful in securing her services, install her immediately in the residence and she will then be responsible for the equipment that has been supplied. I am of the opinion that Miss Jacobs should have one of her relatives or friends live with her, as this school is somewhat remote from the village.\n\nWhen you have checked the articles in the teacher's residence after Miss Desrochers has departed, you should forward to the Department the account of Goodwin's Limited. The equipment which we were not willing to supply and which was listed under cover of official communication No. 5-6-8 of the 25th instant (see second column) should be parcelled and delivered to Sister Mary Gabriel for use at the teacher's residence in the village.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

J.

She explained to me she was relying on a position at Montreal that she missed. As she seems very competent in teaching, I prefer to give her services now that the residence has full equipment. I understand this young lady is very weary being alone in the bush, far off the other stores. Before retaining the services of Miss Annie V. Jacobs, I will wait for your last instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.J. McLean, Esq.\nM.M. B. Agent\n\nIndian Affairs.

After fully considering this matter, the Department has decided that she may continue in the position teacher until January 1st, for the articles in the account for Goodwin's, limited, purchased by her, which are not furnished Indian schools, to the amount of $56.40, as per list enclosed in official letter of the 15th ultimo. She can either pay this amount direct to Goodwin's or it can be deducted from her salary. If you choose to deduct this amount from her salary, you should have accounts forwarded to you promptly for the balance of Goodwin's account to the amount of $60.39 which we will pay. However, if Miss Desrochers prefers that we deduct the amount which she is to pay from her salary, you should, in that case, return the account from Goodwin's, properly certified by you, for the full amount.\n\nThis is the only condition on of which we will allow Miss Desrochers to remain as teacher and, if she will not agree to this, she should give us notice immediately, and you may then arrange for the appointment of Miss Annie V. Jacobs at the salary mentioned in official letter of the 15th ultimo.\n\nYou will be good enough to let me know at once whether Miss Desrochers wishes to pay the amount of $56.40 direct to Goodwin's, limited, or whether she prefers that we deduct the amount from her salary here, or, in the event of her not accepting these conditions, whether you have notified her that her services are to terminate at once, and if you have arranged for the appointment of Miss Jacobs to succeed her.\n\nIf Miss Desrochers remains as teacher, you should inform her that in future no accounts of any nature will be\n\nJ.

D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\nSir.\u2014 \n\nI beg to inform you that on the 15th instant I have visited the St-Isidore Road School of the Caughnawaga Reserve. I have arrived in the school house at 10 o'clock A.M., they were eight pupils and the teacher seated around the furnace who was almost out of fire. It was freezing in the class-room. I have first noticed that the double windows were not yet in place. I have at once notified an Indian neighbor to the school house to have them fixed in the next day. There is plenty of wood and coal for the use of the school and the teacher's residence. The teacher invited me to go at her residence where it was warm and comfortable so that my notes could be easily taken. She started to talk and talked during about an hour of herself needs. I have noticed that she care much more of her comfort that that of her pupils at school. As she informed me that she intended to visit your Department during the Christmas Holidays I have advised her to make her requisition and complaint to whom it may concern at that time. I have represented her that it is almost impossible for your Department to provide her with everything and that she should contend of what is absolutely necessary. As she asked for prizes at Christmas I have suggested to have this postponed until next June. Two maps, a P.M. sphere and Province of Quebec are almost all torn-out. The Blackboard 3 x 1 feet need repair. The fire-extinguisher has been taken out to Lachine by the village school caretaker, and is still there. I have asked him to have it replaced. The school floor is very dirty. The teacher produced an account amounting $25.00 for her caretaking during the past four months ending December 31st. stating that my predecessor had authorized it. She asked for another blackboard, I have noticed that the present\nomes are sufficient. She also require a poker and five gallons of coal oil.\n\nI believe that this state of affairs at the St-Ir\u00e9nore Road School should have to be changed before the beginning of the next school year. I beg to suggest that the Sisters in charge of the Caughnawaga Village Schools must have the control of the teaching and supervision of the two country schools. I mean to say that a laical teacher shall be engaged by the Sisters with your approval and that they should attend to the maintenance of these schools. This system has already given splendid results into the Caughnawaga Village Schools and I am confident that it should be uniform for the whole Reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Indian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Dec. 27, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, with reference to the Lt. Leidore Road Indian Day School. I have examined your communication carefully and I am of the opinion that your suggestion that the Sister of the Village schools assume a control over the Country Schools is well worthy of the Department's attention.\n\nThere are, however, one or two needs that will have to be attended to without delay. Miss Descoteaux called at the Department today, and I am convinced that she should be supplied with a poker, coal scuttle, water pail and boiler. These articles should be purchased by you, after securing competitive prices if possible, and delivered to the school after the teacher has returned from her holiday. Two maps requested by her are being ordered through the Government Stationery Office.\n\nMiss Descoteaux has reported that Mrs. Kate Osborne took some blankets and other belongings, for the purpose of washing them, and has not yet returned them to her. You might instruct Constable Jocks in this connection and see that the articles missing are returned at the time the teacher commences duties in January.\n\nConcerning certain minor repairs needed to the school room and residence, I may have another communication for you in the near future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

All recommendations in connection with this school shall in future be directed either to the Agent or to the Department by yourself and not by Miss Lescoteaux, the Teacher. She is being informed that in every way she is responsible to you for the conduct of the St. Isidore Road School.\n\nI would be pleased if you will make arrangements to visit this school once a week for the time being, at least. You will be allowed $1.50 per trip for livery. You will direct the classroom activities and will arrange for any repairs, cleaning, etc., that may be necessary. If the Village Janitor, Mr. Latour, is unable to oversee the work at the St. Isidore Road School during the winter season, you will please arrange for the services of another competent man and agree to pay him at a fair rate per day. Will you also engage some person living close to the school to scrub the classroom once a week and arrange for the lighting of the furnace fire on Monday morning only. For these Janitor services the Department is prepared to allow the sum of $5.00 per month to whomever you secure. The Department will rely upon you to incur no unnecessary expense.\n\nRequisitions for classroom supplies will be filled only after your O.T. has been received. Miss Lescoteaux has been engaged to teach until the end of the present academic year and, unless her services are entirely unsatisfactory, I would be pleased if you would give her every assistance possible.

In reply I would say that I shall accept this until the end of the present Academic Year, and do all in my power to assist the teacher in her work in every way.\n\nI shall make my first visit on January 10th with a workman selected by the Agent, and we will go over every detail of the work to be done. I really do not see the necessity of scrubbing the floor once a week; here, in the village, the schools are scrubbed four times a year and I consider this quite sufficient providing the classrooms are well swept.\n\nI have a man in view who would take charge of the fire on Monday morning and or that matter every morning, but the teacher is so fussy that I cannot assure you he will keep this up very long. After my first visit, I will be in a position to give a detailed Report to the Department of conditions there.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nAttention of Mr. L.D.

It is considered that if the floor is well swept it would only be necessary to have it scrubbed at more or less frequent intervals.\n\nWe shall be pleased to have your report on conditions after you have made your first visit of inspection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nSister Mary Gabriel,\nPrincipal, Caughnawaga Indian Schools,\nCaughnawaga, P.Q.\nMy dear Sir,\n\nOn Tuesday, Jan. 9th, I visited Miss Descoteau's school and spent the afternoon investigating the pros and cons of her unique situation. She had sixteen pupils present, and they appeared to be well disciplined. I could not examine the class as there were too many other details to which I had to give my attention.\n\nI discussed the question of a janitor with her, but she seemed quite unwilling to have any of the neighbors around do the work. I therefore selected a large school boy and asked him if he would help the teacher bring in coal and especially sift the ashes. Since the furnaces have been lighted, these are thrown outside the building and are carried all around the place. It serves as an amusement for the pupils to jump up and down the pile. The boy promised to help and I put him on trial for a week.\n\nOn Monday, the 8th, I sent a workman out there to see what would be needed and it will certainly require three or four days' labor to get the school in condition to avoid having all the fuel in store before the middle of February. Wind panes broken, doors off hinges slamming with the wind, etc., etc., the pipe leading from the sink was frozen and burst, the pump out of order, etc., etc. I had the broken pipe removed and we fixed another here with piping we had on hand and which will be put in place to-morrow. It would have cost a small fortune to get a plumber from Montreal out there.\n\nAfter a careful investigation I think that the following articles should be supplied:\n\n- 1 door mat (straw or cocoa, for the school)\n- 1 thermometer\n- 2 roller towel fixtures (they are hanging on nails)\n- 1 dozen roller towels or towelling to make them\n- 2 drinking cups\n- 6 spring roller blinds for the class room windows\n\nKate Lebongne refuses to give up the blankets because she claims the teacher owes her money and she will hold on to them until she is paid.\n\nThe comforter belongs to the Department and it has been repaired but the man is also holding on to it until he is paid. In the meantime the teacher claims she is freezing. I shall send her out a few of our blankets until these minor matters are adjusted.\nIn your communication of Jan. 2, No.5-6-1, you state that the Department will allow the sum of $5.00 per month for janitor services at St. Isidore Road School. If I understand correctly Miss Descoteau draws $50.00 per year for janitor services which she performs herself. Is this amount in order to a surplus or is it included in her salary? I promised to pay the boy I selected to help the teacher but did not specify how much. I would like to know if it is to come out of Miss Descoteau's allowance or out of a surplus the Department allows.\n\nI have induced Miss Descoteau to have her laundry done here in the village as she is not fitted up for the purpose. Melting snow to wash is not very pleasant work at this season.\n\nThe floor of the classroom is not very neat looking but the trouble is that last fall it was oiled before it was washed and it is now next to impossible to clean it. It will require a few years of washing to get the oil off, and have the school floor as neat as those of our village schools. I shall see to the washing of the roller towels and the school as this is the only safe way to get things done right.\n\nI found Miss Descoteau's residence a real little gem of cleanliness, order and comfort, but in view of the quantity of coal used there I strongly insisted that one fire was quite enough to keep her house warm, and suggested her using the living room as a kitchen etc. for the cold weather.\n\nI have every hope that once we get things organized there and the most essential work done there will be little room left for complaints.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nAttention of Mr. L.M. McLean,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, January 18th, 1923.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th instant, furnishing a report on your visit to the St. Isidore Road Indian Day School on the Caughnawaga Reserve. The various suggestions made by you have been noted.\n\nWe are communicating with Mr. Agent Letourneau, and requesting him to purchase the articles mentioned by you. We are also informing him that a labourer may be engaged for about 4 days to make any repairs required, and we will also allow $5 per month for janitor's services. Cheques in payment will be sent either to Miss Desrochers, the teacher, or to yourself, if you wish to handle the matter. The sum of $50 is being allowed per year for janitor's services at this school. This amount was formerly paid to the teacher who always attended to these duties. When the cheques arrive, payment should be made to the boy who does the work.\n\nIt is considered that the blankets and comforters which are being kept by the Indians should be returned to the teacher, and you may use the services of the constable for this purpose, if necessary.\n\nI beg to thank you for the trouble you have taken to have things organized and for the arrangements you have made for the carrying on of the work at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

(RG 10, Volume 6105, file 329-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPoor Copy\nMy dear Sir,\n\nI visited the St. Isidore Road School on Friday the 26th instant and found nine pupils in attendance. The teacher seems much happier now than before she took over her duties. She was supplied her with oil, dust bins, books, pencils, etc., from here, and now that the most urgent repairs have been made she seems more contented although there are a few things troubling her which are beyond my power to settle, and I told her I would refer the matter to the Department for adjustment.\n\nAs well as I could understand she was engaged for $55.00 per month or $550.00 per year, and she claims that the quarter ending December 31st was not paid in full. She received, I think, $105.00 instead of $165.00. It seems there was some difficulty over purchases she made at Goodwin's Limited, and the Department refused to pay for some of the articles which were considered either unnecessary or too expensive. This charge came amounted to $6.00 and some odd cents. Admitting that the Department did deduct the amount, there still remains a balance due her.\n\nIf it would be possible for me to have the list of these articles I would go over them and check them up; otherwise I will not know what belongs to her and what is the property of the Department. I intended going there and making an inspection once the weather becomes warmer. She tells me that all the articles she purchased were necessary except two flower pots or vases, and considers it quite unfair that she should be requested to pay for them. Of course, I am not in a position to judge of the action taken by the Department but I would suggest that whatever is there now be taken over and I shall see that every thing is moved and stored away during the coming winter, so that the teacher taking charge next year may not have to go to any further expense. If there are things not needed there, we can well utilize them here.\n\nI explained to Miss DesCheneux that her task was much lighter and her work much easier than the teachers here who have classes of thirty-five and forty pupils while she spends her days with a dozen or so, but she does not understand this, although I must admit she has been quite docile and has followed out my directions faithfully.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6105, file 329-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI think you might better send me the check for janitor's services, etc. I will get the boy out of that and give the balance to the teacher or go to the supplies, etc. You understand that a boy will not wait for the end of the quarter to get his little allowance, so I will give him his pay next week to keep him doing his duty. So far everything has been very satisfactory, and I want to keep him in condition to continue the work until the end of the school year if possible.\n\nTrusting that you will give me all necessary information, and I will follow your directions implicitly.\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nAttention of Mr. L.D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nWe have had the satisfaction of hearing from Mr. Smith through the Indian Agent.\nOTTAWA, January 30th, 1925.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th instant, furnishing the Department with a report on your visit to the St. Isidore Road School. We note that conditions are now fairly satisfactory, and that the teacher's residence is comfortable and well furnished.\n\nI enclose herewith a list of the goods supplied for the use of the teacher's residence. This list includes the articles obtained by the teacher which were considered excessive; the cost of which were deducted from her salary. I am sure you will see that we were quite generous in the list of articles we had on hand for the teacher. Our objection against the teacher's taking any personal property, was when she leaves, the school she may take them with her. We discussed this matter with Miss Desrochers when she was in the Department, and she fully understands our position in the matter. We note that you will take an inventory of the articles on hand, and that you will see that everything is marked and stored away during the summer holidays, in order that the teacher taking charge next year may not have to be furnished with any extra supplies.\n\nRegarding salary, Miss Desrochers began duties September 9th, and was paid one month's salary - $99.00 - for the month of September. For the quarter ending December 31st, she was paid at the quarterly rate for the year, viz: $177.00, from which a deduction was made for the goods purchased by her from Government stores, which were delivered successive, to the amount of $6.00. A cheque for the balance due, to the amount of $171.00 was sent her. For the current quarter, she will be paid at the quarterly rate, and at the end of the June quarter, if she remains until that time, her salary will be adjusted, and she will receive her full yearly salary. She is not paid monthly, but quarterly.\n\nRegarding payment of the $6 per month for janitor services, we say that we will forward the cheque to you, and request that you make the Agent for the amount due, which may be sent in monthly or quarterly, as desired. We note that you will pay the boy who does the work at the end of each week. We hope that the arrangements you have made for the caretaking will prove satisfactory to yourself and the teacher.\n\nSister Mary Gabriel,\nSupervising Principal,\nCaughnawaga Indian Schools,\nCAUGHNAWAGA, P.Q.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The oversight of this school, no doubt, adds greatly to your many duties, but I can assure you that your kind attention is greatly appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. B. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nMy dear Sir,\n\nOn the occasion of my last visit to the St. Isidore Road School, I gave to the teacher the explanations contained in your letter of January 30th, No. 5-5-1. She understood that the full payment of salary would be made at the end of the school year, but still regrets the fact that she should be obliged to pay for things she will not require once she leaves the school.\n\nOf course, I agree with you that the articles were altogether too expensive, and in fact, that you have been most liberal towards this school. It seems that she had made a mistake in purchasing such articles and that all there was left to do now was to abide by the consequences.\n\nI paid the boy Jenifer for January and obtained receipts from him and from the teacher for services. I will send these in about March or at the close of the quarter.\n\nThe spring rollers were put on the windows, and I forwarded the bill through Mr. Detourneau.\n\nOn February 14th, I examined the class; there were eleven (11) pupils present. I consider Miss Les-Coteaux a good teacher. The pupils who attend the school regularly have learned, some very backward but that is to be expected. Her English accent is not up to the standard, yet she makes up in other ways. She speaks English to the children and obliges them to speak to her in English. This fact has caused much of the prejudice previously entertained to die out. I brought her all the helps and aids we have here to assist her and she seemed greatly pleased. I trust that with the coming of milder weather more pupils will attend this school.\n\nHere in the village the classrooms are filled and yet many are out on account of illness in the families or among the children. If all were in I would not know where to put them.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nAttention of Mr. L.E. McLean.\n\nIndian Affairs.

We are pleased to learn that the teacher is giving satisfaction, and that the work is progressing favourably and you have succeeded in adjusting conditions tending to the comfort of the teacher and the welfare of the school. We look forward to progress being made by Miss Descoteaux under your supervision and advice.\n\nWe note that you are attending to the paying of the boy janitor, and that vouchers in the usual manner will be forwarded covering the outlay made by you at the close of the quarter. These vouchers, with receipts attached, should be forwarded to the office of the Indian Agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nSister Mary Gabriel,\nSupervising Principal,\nCaughnawaga Schools,\nCaughnawaga, P.Q.\nMy dear Sir,\n\nUpon the occasion of one of my recent visits to St. Isidore Road School, the teacher, Miss Desjardins, asked me if the Department would consider her application for another year's service as teacher there. I told her that I knew nothing of the Department's intentions in regard to her, but judging from the difficulties you have experienced with her I did not wish to give her any encouragement.\n\nI consider Miss Desjardins a fairly good teacher, she has good discipline and manages the children well, but the first objection I would put forth is that she lives alone in that desolate place and will not, under any consideration, take any body in to live with her. I think this very imprudent and ought not to be allowed.\n\nSecondly, she has no idea of the condition existing and makes demands that are absolutely ridiculous, such for instance as for the installation of a telephone in her residence. The next demand might be for a radio or a Ford. In view of these facts I fear she would always be a source of worry to the Department.\n\nI do not know if you have any one in view for this position, but if you expect me to look after some one, I would need to be notified some six months ahead in order to make a judicious selection as I would certainly not wish to place an inexperienced person there.\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nAttention of Mr. L.R. McLennan.\nOttawa, March 29th, 1923.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th instant, regarding the application of Miss Descoteaux, teacher of the St. Isidore Road School on the Caughnawaga Reserve, that her services be retained for the next school year.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, owing to the difficulty experienced and the many and frequent demands made by Miss Descoteaux, the Department considers that it would only lead to further difficulties if her services were retained. You may, therefore, inform her that her services will not be required after the end of the present school year, viz: June 30th, next.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will nominate, in due time, a suitable teacher to take charge of this school when it re-opens after the summer holidays, on or about September 1st, 1923. It might be advisable to consult Mr. Gilman, the Public School Inspector, with a view to obtaining a qualified teacher. It will be sufficient if the nomination is made by you in June or July, next. The name, qualifications and experience of the teacher nominated should be forwarded for the consideration of the Department.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will give Miss Descoteaux the necessary notice that her services will not be required for the next school year. Before leaving at the end of June, she should prepare her quarterly returns, and state the address to which she desires her salary and bonus cheques sent at that time.\n\nThanking you for any trouble you may take in obtaining another teacher, I am,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSister Mary Gabriel,\nSupervising Principal,\nCaughnawaga Schools,\nCaughnawaga,\nP.Q.\n\nJ.

As a teacher in said locality, I need not state any details. I simply wish you would give your request a second thought.\n\nSir, if you could only realize my ambition, you might consider me when it is for the welfare of so many concerned why all local schools be a complete failure?\n\nI am looking forward to receive a reply.\n\nYours Truly,\nLena J.

Jacobs,\nBox 106, Caughnawaga,\nQue.\nRev. and dear Sister:\n\nI have been struggling with my thoughts since yesterday, but my mind has finally reached a decision, and I give my request a kind consideration.\n\nI beg of you, dear Superior, to nominate me as teacher in the St. Odile Road School. A full year has elapsed since my demission, unable to forget my former school and pupils, so pardon me stating, but the parents will certainly welcome my return.\n\nProbably you were informed that I was dismissed through report of someone whose identity I am not aware, the report being that I was married, which prevented me from performing my duties properly. Oh dear Superior, if you could only realize the extent of this false accusation! I was so anxious in my work not only in the school room, but for general welfare of the locality. It took me almost a full term!\nTo organize that school and to bring to surface any ambition to them from the minds of parents and children, as a result I obtained a fair average and children came readily to school, my reward was simply my dismissal.\n\nAt present I am in perfect health and my children can never interfere in my work.\n\nKindly reply and give me a ray of hope, wishing you every success.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\nLena Jacobs\nKangshawega\nQue.\n\nP.O. Box 156\n\nM.B. Copy which I forgot to enclose in my letter yesterday.\n\nSr. Mary Gabriel\nMy dear Sir,\n\nI am enclosing a letter received from Mrs Jacobs, former teacher at the St. Isidore Road School. I am not in need of a teacher to know where Jacobs was dismissed by the Department, and consequently refer her application to you for evaluation.\n\nI have given considerable time to finding a qualified teacher for this school, but all efforts have as yet been unsuccessful. No one outside the Reserve is willing to go there and live the life of isolation for such small salaries. I realize that the compensation is quite sufficient for the number of pupils attending, (I never found more than ten pupils present at any time), but in Montreal and all around here qualified teachers get between $600.00 and $900.00 per annum. You understand that none of these will go to the wilds of Caughnawaga and live there for $350.00. We must take someone from the Reserve, and because she would be qualified and longing to take charge there, and since the old ones are married, I have now in view a girl of about twenty-six, Margaret Reid, who has been acting as Assistant teacher in our schools here for the last eight years. She has no diploma, but her experience is worth a great deal. I will receive a definite answer from her this week. I have another lady with a Quebec Diploma, who would willingly take the school, but she is recently given birth to a child and, of course, I hesitate to consider her although she assures me she will have somebody with her to care for the child. This young woman is a Graduate of our schools, and taught here for a few years with marked success.\n\nI would like to know if you sincerely object to married women being in charge providing she is perfectly satisfied and has somebody to care for the child during school hours. I have most confidence in this young woman as she is very ambitious and knows just how to handle the children. Her husband, who works on bridges etc., would be free during the winter to help her out with the work of heating, etc.\n\nA word of explanation would be greatly appreciated.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Russell T.

Since then I received a definite reply from Margaret Revis, presently Assistant Teacher in our Village School, and she will accept to teach at the St. Isidore Road School for the salary presently paid Miss Desjardins.\n\nI think I explained that Miss Revis has eight years experience here, and is devoted, painstaking and hard working. She is the best available here and I have confidence that the Department will be satisfied with her work. Of course, she will need guidance and direction, but she is simple, still twenty-eight or twenty-nine years old, and will not be unduly influenced by local desires. She has an unmarried sister who will live with her during the winter and look after her interests.\n\nShould the Department be satisfied to accept Miss Revis, you will be good enough to inform me to that effect.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Russell R.

In reply I beg to state that the Department will approve of her appointment to the St. Isidore Road Indian Day School at a salary of $650 per year plus whatever bonus is allowed by law. It is understood that Miss Regis will arrange for her sister to live with her in the residence and that her activities will be supervised by the principal of the Caughnawaga Village Schools.

Their parents were\nprejudiced against the teacher and made her task\nunbearable. I visited the school often and gave her\nevery assistance possible. As Mr. Jocks is seldom home,\nI played the part of truant-officer and went to see the\nparents who live at the far end of the Reserve. Nothing\ncould convince them of their false judgments, and as\nthey were determined to hold their own opinion and\ncontinue to make trouble I was forced to report the case\nto the Agent who settled them with a fine. Now peace\nreigns in the school and the teacher can control her\npupils and command respect.\nOttawa, January 10, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department wishes to extend the privilege of teaching French at the Bush, St. Isidore and Protestant Indian Day Schools on the Caughnawaga Reserve. You should inform the three teachers concerned that, if they consider such action advisable, instruction in the French language may be given one hour per school day to the pupils from Standard Four on. It must be clearly understood, however, that English is the language of general instruction in the classroom.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nL.

I note, with regret, that considerable time has been lost because of sickness on the reserve; but I trust that interruptions from now on will be comparatively few.\n\nYou refer to the extension of the privilege of teaching French to the St. Isidore and Bush Schools. Please note that this addition to the instruction is not obligatory but is left to the discretion of the teacher. In the case of the St. Isidore Road School, I note you believe the teaching of French is impractical. Therefore, it is not necessary to add it to the course of studies at the present time.\n\nI regret there are no funds for the purpose of increasing the salaries of Miss Snow and Miss Phillips.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

ISIDORE ROAD SCHOOL\nDATED 1/28/23\nORIGINAL ON FILE NO. 5-6-1\n\nAs well as I could understand she was engaged for $55.00 per month or $550.00 per year, and she claims that the quarter ending December 31st was not paid in full. She received, I think, $197.00 instead of $165.00. It seems there was some difficulty over purchases she made at Goodwin's Limited, and the Department refused to pay for some of the articles which were considered either unnecessary or too expensive. This, she says, amounted to $36.50 and some odd cents. Admitting that the Department did deduct the amount there still remains a balance due her.\nOTTAWA, January 30th, 1925.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th instant, furnishing the Department with a report on your visit to the St. Isidore Road School. We note that conditions are now fairly satisfactory, and that the teacher's residence is comfortable and well furnished.\n\nI enclose herewith a list of the goods supplied for the use of the teacher's residence. This list includes the articles obtained by the teacher which were considered excessive; the cost of which were deducted from her salary. I am sure you will see that we were quite generous in the list of articles supplied and paid for. The articles charged against the teacher's salary are her personal property, and when she leaves school she will certainly take them with her. We discussed this matter with Miss Desrochers when she was in the Department, and she fully understood our position in the matter. We note that you will take an inventory of the articles on hand, and that you will see that everything is marked and stored away during the summer holidays, in order that the teacher taking charge next year may not have to be furnished with any extra supplies.\n\nRegarding salary, Miss Desrochers began duties September 5th, and was paid one month's salary - $24.00 - for the month of September. For the quarter ending December 31st, 1924, she was paid at the quarterly rate for the year, viz: $17.50, from which a deduction was made for the goods purchased by her from Godwin's Limited, which were considered excessive, to the amount of $6.00. A cheque for the balance due, to the amount of $11.50, was sent her. For the current quarter, she will be paid at the quarterly rate, and at the end of the June quarter, if she remains until that time, her salary will be adjusted, and she will receive her full yearly salary. She is not paid monthly, but quarterly.\n\nRegarding payment of the $5 per month for janitor services, a boy to say that we will forward the cheques to you, upon receipt of a voucher from the Agent for the amount due, which may be sent in monthly or quarterly, as desired. We note that you will pay the boy who does the work at the end of each week. We hope that the arrangements you have made for the caretaking will prove satisfactory to yourself and the teacher.\n\nWe -\n\nSister Mary Gabriel,\nSupervising Principal,\nCaughnawaga Indian Schools,\nCAUGHNAWAGA, P.Q.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6105, file 329-3, part 1)\nWe are glad to note that the comforter and blankets have been returned.\n\nI am sure that under your guidance and advice matters at this school will go forward favourably. The oversight of this school is not easy, and greatly to your many duties, but I can assure you that your kind attention is greatly appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

They charged me November and December salary. I took your letter of December 15th to Madame Gibson, the pay mistress, and she indignantly denied she had any such thing. I walked out, and after that gave some distance, she sent some one to call me back. We entered the Post Office and they she gave me the two cheques. She claimed she thought they belonged to another man. She says she received a pension from the Government, her son died at the war.\n\nIt would greatly simplify matters for me if my Post Office Account were put on the honour list so that the members could be visible to Madame Gibson.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nMiss Mary Stacey\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I attach letter authorizing this transfer.\n\nAs Miss Bush is an Indian, teaching on her home reserve, she is not liable to deduction for income tax. As she has been in our employ to June 30, 1945, at the Caughnawaga R.C.

They may last for a few weeks more that is to the utmost, but when the winter season opens they will have to be replaced. There is no doubt that the coke is the cause of the prompt deterioration of the furnaces and stoves of the schools of Caughnawaga.\n\nThe approximate cost of the furnaces is $20.00 each and that of the kitchen stove is $50.00. I beg you to kindly authorize me to purchase these three stoves for a sum of $90.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) Lorenzo Letourneau.\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 24, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, requesting that new furnaces be supplied for the St. Isidore Road and Bush Schools on the Gaughnawaga Reserve, also a kitchen stove for the teacher's residence at St. Isidore Road, and giving an estimate of the cost.\n\nIn reply I have to say that you may arrange for the purchase, from a firm on the list to receive consideration, of two furnaces - one for the Bush School and one for the St. Isidore Road School. The cost should not, if possible, exceed your estimate of $20 each. Please forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase and installation of the furnaces for each of the schools separately.\n\nThe Department is not prepared to supply a new kitchen stove for the teacher's residence at the St. Isidore Road School. If any minor repairs are required to the old stove at present in use, you may have same carried out, keeping all costs as low as possible. It is considered that the present stove should be satisfactory for the needs of the teacher during the coming winter.\n\nYou should instruct the caretakers at both schools that they are to see that proper care is taken in the handling of the furnaces and in the use of the coke. If proper care is taken in the use of coke, there should be no danger of any damage to the furnaces.\n\nPlease arrange to have the new furnaces installed in the above named schools as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nL.

Fortunately was the man who could build brick walls high enough to break the force of winter's wind or within the shade of tall trees to give some measure of protection from summer's glaring sun.\n\nToday, however, home insulation has become an exact science. John Manville, for over 37 years the leader in the field of industrial insulation, has developed a method of insulating which has completely changed old standards of living comfort. Your home, regardless of its age, whether it be brick, frame, plaster, stucco, clapboard or shingled, can be made a far more comfortable place than you ever dreamed possible.\n\nBut\u2014and this is important\u2014it is only through the scientific selection of the correct insulating material that these results can be obtained. To insure your receiving all the benefits that go with a properly insulated home, John-Manville recommends work only to qualified insulating engineers. These men located in all parts of Canada employ the special trouble-free blowing process by which John-Manville Rock Wool Insulation is installed. They have successfully insulated thousands of homes throughout Canada. John-Manville heartily endorses their ability to insulate your home in the most efficient manner known to modern science.\n\nWHAT PRICE COMFORT?\n\nYou spend your life seeking bodily comfort for yourself and for your family, because you know that better health will result. Actually, you are seldom conscious of being comfortably. You instantly realize when you are uncomfortable. Whether you are at work, play, eat and sleep, your comfort and comfort to a large degree is governed by temperature. When you feel cold, you seek warmth. When you are hot, you seek coolness.\n\nMost people think that they live in comfortable houses, but actually this is far from true. In spite of the most modern heating systems, there are usually cold, drafty, hard-to-heat rooms in which the summer the heat of the sun beat the jalousies so that they remain extremely uncomfortable long after sundown.\n\nThe purpose of insulating a house is to help prevent summer heat from penetrating through walls and roofs, and to help prevent interior heat in winter from escaping to the cool air outside. When this is scientifically done, homes are comfortable the year 'round and become healthier and more pleasant places in which to live.\n**Why Your Home Should Be Insulated**\n\n**WHAT IS HOME INSULATION?**\nHome insulation is an effective barrier to the passage of heat from the home in winter and into the home in summer. Heat travels in one direction only\u2014from warm areas to colder areas. In winter, when you turn on your furnace, the heat from your furnace leaks out of your house through the roof and walls; in summer, a reverse action takes place. Radiant heat from the sun penetrates through the roof and walls into your house.\n\n**PROVIDES GREATER COMFORT**\nCold and heat have more to do with physical comfort than any other single factor. Uniform temperature in a home is the desire of every family. Without adequate home insulation it is practically impossible to maintain uniform temperature in the comfort zone during cold weather and hot heat in summer. With adequate home insulation it is quite easy to keep every room in the house at a more even temperature throughout the coldest spells in winter and up to 15\u00b0 cooler in the sweltering heat of summer time.\n\n**HEATING THE GREAT OUTDOORS IS EXPENSIVE**\nSnow melts on the roof of Mr. Brown\u2019s house when expensive heat leaks out. Snow never melts on the roof of Mr. Smith\u2019s house because Johns-Manville Rock Wool keeps heat in\u2014and this amazing material is just as effective in keeping the heat out in summer as it is in preventing the wasteful escape of heat in winter.\n\n**REDUCES FUEL COSTS**\nIt is reasonable to suppose that, if the heat you generate in your furnace is retained in your home instead of being allowed to escape through the roof and walls, you will not have to generate as much heat to keep your home comfortable. This is actually the case. The experience of home owners who have insulated with Johns-Manville Rock Wool proves that you save up to 30% on your fuel. Proper home insulation will pay for itself in a very few seasons.\n\n**PROMOTES BETTER HEALTH**\nUniform temperature and the elimination of draughts in a home are very important contributing factors to the health of the whole family. Many of the common colds, which too often develop into more serious illness, can be traced to draughts and careless heating. Draughts and cold air are caused by the current of warm air moving to the colder areas and the cold air being forced to the warm areas. Proper insulation brings about a more even temperature upstairs and downstairs, thereby preventing draughts.\n\n**STOP THE PENETRATION OF HEAT AND COLD**\nEvery home, regardless of the type of wall construction, has a certain amount of heat loss through the walls. There is only a thin layer of air and plaster between the exposed surfaces of the walls and the outside air in winter and hot in summer. A blanket of Johns-Manville Rock Wool, properly installed by experienced Johns-Manville installation experts, provides an effective barrier against heat loss in winter and heat penetration in the summer.\n\n**SUMMER HEAT IS HARD ON NERVES AND HEALTH**\nYour house, regardless of how well insulated, offers little resistance to the passage of heat. Other than insulation it is properly installed, Johns-Manville Rock Wool lowers room temperatures in summer as much as 15 degrees and makes a noticeable difference in bedrooms, living rooms, kitchens, and dining rooms.\nCLEAR AND COLDER\nSays the weather man\nSNUG AND WARMER\nSays Johns-Manville\n\nComfort is only part of the story. Johns-Manville Home Insulation not only provides comfort but pays for itself. You're paying for it right now even if you don't have it. Paying for it in the extra fuel you consume to keep your house comfortable during the winter months. It's like a steady refund on your fuel bill. Whether you heat your house with coal, gas or oil, you can save money by using Johns-Manville Rock Wool. The Dominion Government at Ottawa has estimated that if all the residential buildings in Montreal, Toronto, Hamilton and other large cities were insulated, the annual saving in fuel bills of at least $8 million would result.\n\nThe benefits of proper room temperatures are particularly important to elderly people. Johns-Manville Rock Wool Insulation helps keep them comfortable and healthy.\n\nYou can save money on decorative costs too. Those dark streaks that appear on ceilings can be eliminated. In winter without insulation the plaster is cold and condensation forms on the house surfaces. This causes moisture to deposit its load on the plaster surfaces. As it comes in contact with the cold plaster surfaces it deposits its load and moisture on the plaster surfaces. This causes the dark streaks. One way of this trouble can be eliminated by placing a thick blanket of Johns-Manville Rock Wool Insulation between the plaster surfaces and the walls. This will keep the plaster surfaces warm and free from condensation.\n\nFAIR AND WARMER\nUP TO 15\u00b0 COOLER\nSays Johns-Manville\n\nYou can save money on decorative costs too. Those dark streaks that appear on ceilings can be eliminated. In winter without insulation the plaster is cold and condensation forms on the house surfaces. This causes moisture to deposit its load on the plaster surfaces. As it comes in contact with the cold plaster surfaces it deposits its load and moisture on the plaster surfaces. This causes the dark streaks. One way of this trouble can be eliminated by placing a thick blanket of Johns-Manville Rock Wool Insulation between the plaster surfaces and the walls. This will keep the plaster surfaces warm and free from condensation.\n\nIt's easier to start the day cheerfully with meals served in a comfortably heated comfort. True comfort that pays for itself will be appreciated by the whole family.\nHERE IS WHY MORE CANADIAN HOMES ARE INSULATED WITH JOHNS-MANVILLE ROCK WOOL THAN ANY OTHER KIND\n\nWHAT IS ROCK WOOL\n\nRock Wool is actually made from stone. Selected rock is melted at an extremely high temperature and then subjected to a jet of hot steam which \"blows\" it into soft, fibrous particles forming millions trapped air cells in each cubic inch of Rock Wool. These particles combine to form a lofty, woolly material.\n\nINSULATION QUALITIES\n\nThe outstanding insulating value of Johns-Manville Rock Wool is due to the fact that the millions of tiny trapped air cells contained in each cubic inch of the wool are so small that they cannot be seen even under a microscope. The Bureau of Standards at Ottawa has established the efficiency of Rock Wool Insulation.\n\nFIREPROOF\n\nJohns-Manville Rock Wool is a mineral. It absolutely will not burn. Properly applied it mitigates the danger of fire in a house, because it fills the hollow places in a house that act as veritable flues in an uninsulated house.\n\nPERMANENT\n\nJohns-Manville Rock Wool Home Insulation will provide efficient insulation as long as your home stands. It is as permanent as the original rock from which it comes.\n\nLIGHT WEIGHT\n\nThe lightweight fibers of Johns-Manville Rock Wool are extremely light and resilient and can be applied over any ceiling with perfect safety.\n\nCLEAN\n\nThere is no vegetable content in Johns-Manville Rock Wool. Insects will not infest it and rodents will not nest in it. It is water resisting and will not rot or corrode.\n\nFor more than 87 years Johns-Manville has manufactured materials for the control of heat and cold in residences, industrial and marine metal buildings. Johns-Manville Rock Wool for home insulation has been developed through the use of a degree of perfection that makes it the recognized leader in its field.\n\nAn aerial view of the Canadian Johns-Manville factory at Asbestos, Quebec, where Johns-Manville Rock Wool is manufactured.\n\nJohns-Manville completes the job. The same scientific perfection that is used in every step of the Rock Wool manufacturing process is used in the installation of Rock Wool. The men who install Johns-Manville Rock Wool installation are highly trained and skilled. The blowing process they employ does a thorough job and your assurance of receiving all the benefits of home insulation.\nLET THE EXPERIENCE OF THESE HOME OWNERS BE A GUIDE TO YOU\n\n\"The John-Macville Rock Wool Home Insulation which was installed in my home has done a great deal to make the whole house more livable. It is now much easier to keep the rooms in our home at a comfortable temperature than before the insulation was installed.\" \u2014 J. L. DAUGHERTY, Vancouver, B.C.\n\n\"The insulation in my home is all you said it would be and more. All the rooms in our home are now easy to heat and cool. In fact, the entire house is now much warmer than last winter before the insulation was installed.\" \u2014 H. L. BURGESS, Vancouver, B.C.\n\n\"This year is just to start how much added comfort and economy we have realized from the John-Macville Rock Wool Insulation. During the winter months we found it impossible how cold it is to come in from the snow and feel the warmth of our living room very well sustained.\" \u2014 C. E. JOHNSON, Montreal, P.Q.\n\n\"Comfort completely satisfactory and benefits and savings derived have been up to expectations.\" \u2014 D. C. HENRY, Toronto, Ont.\n\n\"Estimating the amount of fuel we used before the house was insulated compared with the amount we are using now, I am convinced that the installation of the John-Macville Rock Wool Insulation was a good investment. I do not hesitate to recommend it to anyone as there is no question but what the comfort and economy will be greatly increased in the home.\" \u2014 G. C. HEWETT, Vancouver, B.C.\n\n\"My family and I are more than satisfied with the results obtained by the installation of John-Macville Rock Wool Insulation in Winter and quite a bit easier on the coal bill.\" \u2014 R. THOMPSON, Toronto, Ont.\n\n\"I wish by this unobtrusive note to express our entire satisfaction with the performance of your rock wool insulation job. We have found the difference in the temperature between ground and upper floors, and also the difference in the temperature between the third floor and the second floor, to be quite pronounced.\" \u2014 R. K. McGREGOR, M.S., Montreal, P.Q.\n\n\"I am a firm believer that insulation pays. It pays not only in reduced heating costs but also in added comfort. The installation of rock wool in the subfloor, a draft in the basement, and the wall cavities has paid off handsomely.\" \u2014 J. HIGGINS, Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\n\"Prior to your insulating the house, we had difficulty in keeping the bedrooms cool during the summer. Installation of your Rock Wool has been made, the third floor is now cool enough to sleep comfortably in, while the second floor is warmer than the ground floor. I have also found the installation of rock wool in the attic to be excellent for heating purposes.\" \u2014 HARVEY MARTIN, Montreal, P.Q.\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6106, File 529-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nYOUR NEIGHBORS KNOW\u2014\n\nHere's what they say!\n\n\"We find that the installation has converted the top floor of our house from a useless, cold, very impractically quartered room into a room with a marked saving in fuel cost.\" \u2014 J.G.M.\n\n\"The insulation is very satisfactory and probably the best fuel saving in excess of 20% that I have ever heard of. We have been very pleased with the work done and would recommend it to anyone who has not had the opportunity to try it out. We have found that the house is much warmer than before and we have saved quite a bit of money on our heating bills.\" \u2014 A.F.W.\n\n\"We have recently installed the insulation in our home, realizing the benefits during the extremely cold winter. Since we installed the insulation, our fuel bills have considerably lessened this winter.\" \u2014 C.H.A.\n\n\"I can without any hesitation state that the substantial saving in my fuel bill is due to a very fine installation job on my house by a very competent crew.\" \u2014 C.H.A.\n\nThe comfort and economies that are attained through the installation of Johns-Manville Rock Wool Insulation are not confined to homes alone. Any type of building can be insulated. Guests, employees, tenants, partners, customers, etc., appreciate the comfort of insulated top floors in every type of commercial building. Owners appreciate the substantial savings and long-time satisfaction of Johns-Manville Rock Wool in offering Comfort That Pays for Itself. The proof is overwhelming.

The price quoted is a net figure, and we have deducted our usual 20% discount from the standard selling price for Government. Net selling price is: $480.00.\n\nWill you please sign white and blue copies of contract at the lower left hand corner, retaining the yellow copy for your records, or return the two copies to us with your official order.\n\nThis work could be done a week or 10 days after we have received your order.\n\nWe would suggest that you contact Mr. S.G.

However water should be supplied in the residence. This could be done by digging a ditch, below freezing level, from the well serving the School building to the residence a distance of about 50 feet and to supply the building with a hand pump and a sink. Please send your authorization.\n\nRelative to the School building it would appear that the lack of insulation makes it most uncomfortable during the winter months. So much so that the children had to be sent away on many occasions during the past winters.\n\nThe most practical way to deal with this problem is believed to have the building insulated with Rock Wool, and in this connection you will find herewith an estimate from the Canadian Johns-Manville for this work, which was sent after their representative was requested to inspect the building. If this work is not done it is doubted if the children will be able to be received regularly or if the teacher will be able to teach at all during the cold winter days.

It was hand drilled and a pipe of 1\u00bd inches sunk at a depth of 25 feet.\n\nAs water is badly needed I would suggest that an artesian well be drilled as soon as possible which would supply the two buildings. It is estimated that a good supply of water could be found at a depth of not more than 40 feet. The price of $4.50 per foot, including the six inches pipe.\n\n(Frs.

The last item on the contractor's list is the culminating point.\n\nThe repairs marked in red on the list enclosed are recommended being necessary. The balance should be disregarded.\n\n(Ps.

Vouchers 120, 121 and 906 are being returned, due to the fact that they are not sufficiently itemized to meet the requirements of the Treasury Branch.\n\nIn the case of labour, the accounts submitted by Jolicoeur and Freres should show the number of hours of work employed and the rate per hour.\n\nIt is regretted that the amount authorized for repairs has been exceeded. It is possible that when the new school is completed at Caughnawaga, we can make arrangements for driving the children to that school in a similar manner as the children who formerly attended the Country School.

It is not possible for one teacher to four or five grades with efficiency.\n\nAt present the routes covered by the taxi taking the Country children to the Village Schools are costing the Department an average of $92.00 per teaching month. Of course the St.Isidore road School area is not covered. If it is decided that the children from that School will attend the Village Schools, it will mean that an approximate $50.00 per month will have to be added to the cost of transportation.\n\nMay I suggest that the acquisition of a school bus considered which could be operated by the man to be appointed as Engineer at the new School. By doing so our cost of transportation could be lowered and we would get better satisfaction than we have at present. Relative to the appointment to be made at the School, this matter was discussed with Mr.Doucet, who is aware that we have on this Reserve a man very well qualified for this work. Please bring this matter to his attention.\n\n(Frs.Brisebois)\nSupt.,Indian Agency.\n16th May, 1949.\n\nMr. F. Brisebois,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nCaughnawage, P.Q.\n\nWe have your letter of the 12th instant suggesting that the St. Isidore Road School be closed at the end of the current academic year, and that the children be transported to the new school in the Caughnawage Village.\n\nThe Department considers that your suggestion is a good one, but we are not prepared to purchase a bus to transport the pupils. However, you should make enquiries and ascertain if there is any bus firm prepared to submit a tender for the transporting of the pupils. I understand that Mr. Doucet will discuss this matter with you when he visits your agency.\n\nPhilip Helen,\nPP/ST Chief, Education Division\nSt. Isidore Road Indian Day School\n\nExtract from Teacher's Report for fiscal year ending March 31, 1949.\n\n1.

Brisebois,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nCaughnawaga, P.Q.\n\nRe: St. Isidore Road Indian Day School\n\n(1) Property:\n\nOur files here indicate that we mailed to Mr. Taggart on January 16th, 1948, the various files dealing with the purchase of this property and which is located on Reserve Lot 502. I presume that Mr. Taggart verified our ownership of this plot. We have two quit claims on file:\n\n(a) Between Joseph Deer and His Majesty, dated 17th July, 1911, for a parcel of Lot 508.\n(b) Between Thomas Monique and His Majesty, dated 17th July, 1911, for a parcel of Lot 502.\n\nBoth quit claims gave us title forever.\n\n(2) Buildings:\n\nThis will confirm the instructions given you to have all school equipment and furniture and teacherage equipment and furniture moved from both these buildings at the end of the academic year. You can make arrangements to store these in the Kateri School. If necessary, we can arrange to ship the desks to Mr. Lariviere for some of his seasonal schools.\n\nThe teacherage furniture can be used in either the present or future U.C. teacherages as required.\nIt has been suggested that we could rent both these buildings to an Indian family or families for a period of one year rather than sell immediately. This will enable us to definitely settle whether our proposed bus routes will work satisfactorily. I would like your reaction to this proposal, as it is different from that made to you by me on my recent visit.\n\nBernard F.

Damages have been made lately at the St-Isidore Road School and Residence, many window panes broken after having torn down the shutters installed to protect them.\n\nMay I suggest that these properties be advertised for sale on the Reserve while we still be able to obtain something for them. Please take this into consideration.\n\n(Frs. Brisebois)\nSupt., Indian Agency.\nMemorandum:\n\nSUPERINTENDENT OF RESERVES & TRUSTS\n\nPlease find herewith a self-explanatory letter from Mr. Brierebois concerning two abandoned schools on the Caughnawaga Reserve. With the completion of our new school and the renovation of the other at Caughnawaga, we no longer require either of these schools nor the property on which they are situated.\n\nI would appreciate your advice as to how these can be best sold to Indians of this reserve.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n28 November, 1949.\n\nMemorandum to:\n\nF.J.G. Cunningham, Esq.,\nDepartmental Solicitor.\n\nRe: St. Isidore Road Indian Day School,\nCaughnawaga Indian Reserve.\n\nI would refer to your memorandum of January 4, 1949, written in reply to our memorandum of December 6, 1948, re the estate of John Phillips and the Caughnawaga Bush Indian Day School.\n\nIn your said memorandum you gave an opinion to the effect that the Quit Claim Deed dated May 8, 1906, between John Phillips and His Majesty, King Edward the Seventh, as represented by the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, is void and, therefore, the bush school and the lot on which it is located belonged to John Phillips' Estate. It is my understanding in that particular case, it was said that when John Phillips released the property, he did so for so long as the land was used for school purposes and, therefore, was only paid the sum of $1.00 for the property.\n\nWe now have a somewhat similar situation regarding the St. Isidore Road Indian Day School which is located on parts of Reserve Lots 502 and 503. In this case the Indian owners of Lots 502 and 503 released forever their interest in the portions of the lots taken for the school lot and each received compensation at the rate of $50.00 per acre from the land taken from each of their holdings. Quit Claim Deeds were executed on July 17, 1911, between the two owners and His Majesty, King George the Fifth, as represented by the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nThe St. Isidore Road School is no longer used and the Education Division wish to dispose of it to an Indian or Indians. There was never any indication that the original owners of Lots 502 and 508 released the land for the school only for so long as it was used for school purposes as was intimated in the bush road school case. We contend that the owners knowingly released forever their possessory interest in the lands taken for the school lot and now that the lands and buildings are no longer required by the Education Division, they would automatically revert to Band ownership and can be sold or otherwise disposed of by the Band.\n\nI should be very pleased to receive your comments in this matter.\n\nD.

Allen,\nSuperintendent,\nReserves and Trusts.\nJanuary 31st, 1950.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nSUPERINTENDENT,\nRESERVES & TRUSTS DIVISION\n\nOn November 15th, 1949, Colonel Neary forwarded you a memorandum with reference to two abandoned schools on the Caughnawaga Reserve. Later you forwarded to us a copy of your memorandum of November 28th to the Departmental Solicitor.\n\nWe have not heard anything further from you since that time, and it would be appreciated if you would let us hear from you.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nJanuary 31st, 1950.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nSUPERINTENDENT,\nRESERVES & TRUSTS DIVISION\n\nOn November 15th, 1949, Colonel Neary forwarded you a memorandum with reference to two abandoned schools on the Caughnawaga Reserve. Later you forwarded to us a copy of your memorandum of November 28th to the Departmental Solicitor.\n\nWe have not heard anything further from you since that time, and it would be appreciated if you would let us hear from you.\n\nPP/ST\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nMEMORANDUM TO FILE:\n\nRe: St. Isidore Road Indian Day School\n\nThe above noted school is located on part of Reserve Lots 502 and 503, Caughnawaga Indian Reserve, and as it is no longer required for school purposes, and the Education Division has been considering the disposition of the school building, we have been asked to define the status of the school lands.\n\nUnder date of July 17th, 1911, Joseph Deer, the recognized owner of Lot 503 and Thomas Monique, the recognized owner of Lot 502, transferred to His Majesty by quit claim deeds the portions of the lots required for school purposes, and received compensation for such areas in the amount of $50.00 per acre.\n\nOn the question of status of the lands, on being referred to our legal advisers, they have replied that His Majesty the King has no right to hold land on an Indian Reserve for school purposes unless the land was taken for that purpose under Section II of the Indian Act, and as the requisite Order in Council was not secured under Section II in this case, that the transfers made in 1911 were void and the lands transferred would, now that the school has been closed, be available for use by the aforementioned transferors or their heirs.\nA rather similar case on the same Reserve involving the Caughnawaga Bush School was recently considered, and a similar opinion given, but in our view, the circumstances were entirely different. In the case of the Bush School, the Indian transferred the property to His Majesty for the sum of $1,000, \"for so long as the land was used for school purposes\", and we agree that under such circumstances when the land ceased to be used for school purposes, the Indian transferor or his heirs would be entirely free to use the property again.\n\nIn the case of the St. Isidore Road School, however, the transfers were not limited for so long as required for school purposes, and the $50.00 per acre paid on the transfer represented the full value of the land so that it appears quite evident that the Indians in question thought they were disposing of all their interest in the lands. While our legal advisers are correct in stating that His Majesty cannot in his own name accept transfers on an Indian Reserve, nevertheless, it is quite clear that the Indians intended to give up all rights to the property and were paid in full for such rights.\n\nWe would not be so concerned with this matter were it not for the fact that the Department has in mind selling the school buildings to an Indian for a residence, and if the legal opinion first mentioned is to be accepted, our position would be that the school building actually belongs to the Indian or Indians owning the lands, for the building is of course a fixture. In short, the original transferors or their heirs would now have title to a building worth several thousand dollars, whereas they originally thought they had disposed of all interest in the property.\nIt is not considered that this would be a desirable situation, and it is therefore recommended that in this instance, we ignore the advice given us by our legal advisers and consider that the transfers made to His Majesty in 1911 be accepted as transfers to the Crown in trust for the Caughnawaga Band. The result of such recommendation would be to permit the Band Council and the Department to work in conjunction as regards a sale of the school building and the land on which it is situated, to some Indian needing a home on the Reserve.\n\nL.

Neary, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Education\n\nReference is made to your memorandum of January 31st with reference to the St. Isidore Road, Indian Day School, and your attention is drawn to Mr. Cunningham's opinion of December 22nd, and to my memorandum to file dated January 17th.\n\nThere is no question but that the St. Isidore School must be considered as a fixture on the school land comprising parts of Reserve lots 502 and 503, and as such, on the closing of the school, title to the school passes to the owner of the land.\n\nAs my memorandum to file sets out, we consider that in the present case, the Caughnawaga Band are the owners of the school land, and that therefore it is within the jurisdiction of the Band Council to decide what disposition should be made of the school and the lands therewith.\n\nWe have in mind suggesting to the Band Council that the school either be used as a home for a needy family or families, or in the alternative sold to some Indian, and if our views as to ownership are acceptable to you, I should be very pleased to have you return your file 329-9 in order that the disposition of the school land and school may be taken up with Superintendent Prisebois.\n\nD.

This should receive consideration by you at an early date. The school should be centrally located and the site should be high and dry and easily drained. Water also should be available and sufficient land to provide the necessary play grounds and also school gardens.\n\nWhen you have had an opportunity to look into this matter you will be good enough to report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nL.

In reply I beg to say that you should make enquiries and ascertain the owners of these two lots Nos. 595 and 443 and obtain from each a price for a portion of the lots not less than 1 acre in extent.\n\nWith reference to the water supply it will be necessary if Lot 595 is chosen to sink a well, but this the Department would be prepared to do.

It was impossible for me to arrange for a reasonable price with the owners of lots Nos. 505 or 443, but I recorded another piece of land partly situated on a strip of lot No. 502 on the west side of St. Isidore road, and partly on No. 508; this site is an elevation centrally situated, and I was told that a good water spring is near by, and the two owners are asking $50.00 net for one acre, but the line between them is not very definite, and before your Department accepts this site I wish that an Officer comes to Caughnawaga and takes a look at it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nAgent-Agent\nOttawa, March 7, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to your letter of January 5th last, in which you state that you had chosen a site for the proposed new school on the Caughnawaga reserve, which for convenience we may call the St. Isidore School.\n\nIt is noted that this site embraces a portion of each of two lots, viz.- Nos. 502 and 508 and that you state that it will be necessary to have the location surveyed.\n\nI may say that the plans for this school building are under way and the Department hopes to proceed with the construction early in the summer. In due time a surveyor will be sent to lay out the lot, but in the meantime I would ask you to obtain in writing any agreement from the interested parties agreeing to sell for the sum mentioned a piece of land not less than one acre in extent.

I presume that Mr. Taggart verified our ownership of this plot. We have two quit Claims on file:\n\n(a) Between Joseph Deer and His Majesty, dated 17th July, 1911, for a parcel of Lot 506.\n(b) Between Thomas Monique and His Majesty, dated 17th July, 1911, for a parcel of Lot 502.\n\nBoth Quit Claims gave us title forever.\n\n(2) Buildings:\n\nThis will confirm the instructions given you to have all school equipment and furniture and teacherage equipment and furniture moved from both these buildings at the end of the academic year. You can make arrangements to store these in the Kateri School. If necessary, we can arrange to ship the desks to Mr. Leriviere for some of his seasonal schools.\n\nThe teacherage furniture can be used in either the present or future U.C. teacherages as required.\nIt has been suggested that we could rent both these buildings to an Indian family or families for a period of one year rather than sell immediately. This will enable us to definitely settle whether our proposed bus routes will work satisfactorily. I would like your reaction to this proposal, as it is different from that made to you by me on my recent visit.\n\nBernard B.

She has also, at that time, inquired into the ownership of Lot 502 particularly to the portion taken up by the school and the owner of the balance of it.\n\nIn dealing with this matter we have come across on our files a sketch of the location of the school and have asked our survey branch to prepare a plan of it for us. We think that this would be of great use to you and are therefore forwarding a plan showing the site of the school on Lots 502 and 508. A copy is attached for your file.\n\nD.J.

Cunningham, Esq.,\nDepartmental Solicitor.\n\nRe: St. Isidore Road Indian Day School,\nCaughnawaga Indian Reserve.\n\nI would refer to your memorandum of January 4, 1949, written in reply to our memorandum of December 6, 1948, re the estate of John Phillips and the Caughnawaga Bush Indian Day School.\n\nIn your said memorandum you gave an opinion to the effect that the Quit Claim Deed dated May 8, 1905, between John Phillips and His Majesty, King Edward the Seventh, as represented by the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, is void and, therefore, the bush school and the lot on which it is located belonged to John Phillips' Estate. It is my understanding in that particular case, it was said that when John Phillips released the property, he did so for so long as the land was used for school purposes and, therefore, was only paid the sum of $1.00 for the property.\n\nWe now have a somewhat similar situation regarding the St. Isidore Road Indian Day School which is located on parts of Reserve Lots 502 and 503. In this case the Indian owners of Lots 502 and 503 released forever their interest in the portions of the lots taken for the school lot and each received compensation at the rate of $50.00 per acre from the land taken from each of their holdings. Quit Claim Deeds were executed on July 17, 1911, between the two owners and His Majesty, King George the Fifth, as represented by the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nThe St. Isidore Road School is no longer used and the Education Division wish to dispose of it to an Indian or Indians. There was never any indication that the original owners of Lots 502 and 508 released the land for the school only for so long as it was used for school purposes as was intimated in the bush road school case. We contend that the owners knowingly released forever their possessory interest in the lands taken for the school lot and now that the lands and buildings are no longer required by the Education Division, they would automatically revert to Band ownership and can be sold or otherwise disposed of by the Band.\n\nI should be very pleased to receive your comments in this matter.\n\nD.

In the case of the Bush School, the Indian transferred the property to His Majesty for the sum of $1.00, \"for so long as the land was used for school purposes\", and we agree that under such circumstances when the land ceased to be used for school purposes, the Indian transferor or his heirs would be entirely free to use the property again.\n\nIn the case of the St. Isidore Road School, however, the transfers were not limited for so long as required for school purposes, and the $50.00 per acre paid on the transfer represented the full value of the land so that it appears quite evident that the Indians in question thought they were disposing of all their interest in the lands. While our legal advisers are correct in stating that His Majesty cannot in his own name accept transfers on an Indian Reserve, nevertheless, it is quite clear that the Indians intended to give up all rights to the property and were paid in full for such rights.\n\nWe would not be so concerned with this matter were it not for the fact that the Department has in mind selling the school buildings to an Indian for a residence, and if the legal opinion first mentioned is to be accepted, our position would be that the school building actually belongs to the Indian or Indians owning the lands, for the building is of course a fixture. In short, the original transferors or their heirs would now have title to a building worth several thousand dollars, whereas they originally thought they had disposed of all interest in the property.\nIt is not considered that this would be a desirable situation, and it is therefore recommended that in this instance, we ignore the advice given us by our legal advisers and consider that the transfers made to His Majesty in 1911 be accepted as transfers to the Crown in trust for the Caughnawaga Band. The result of such recommendation would be to permit the Band Council and the Department to work in conjunction as regards a sale of the school building and the land on which it is situated, to some Indian needing a home on the Reserve.\n\nL. Brown,\nReserves and Trusts.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nB. F. Neary, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Education\n\nReference is made to your memorandum of January 31st with reference to the St. Isidore Road, Indian Day School, and your attention is drawn to Mr. Cunningham's opinion of December 22nd, and to my memorandum to file dated January 17th.\n\nThere is no question but that the St. Isidore School must be considered as a fixture on the school land comprising parts of Reserve Lots 502 and 508; and as such, on the closing of the school, title to the school passes to the owner of the land.\n\nAs my memorandum to file sets out, we consider that in the present case, the Caughnawaga Band are the owners of the school land, and that therefore it is within the jurisdiction of the Band Council to decide what disposition should be made of the school and the lands therewith.\n\nWe have in mind suggesting to the Band Council that the school either be used as a home for a needy family or families, or in the alternative sold to some Indian, and if our views as to ownership are acceptable to you, I should be very pleased to have you return your file 329-9 in order that the disposition of the school land and school may be taken up with Superintendent Brisebois.\n\nD.

It may be feasible to sell the building and the land to some Indian who needs a home, or possibly the building construction is such that it could be divided into two homes. On the other hand, there may be needy Indians who require housing and cannot pay for it, and the Council may wish to retain ownership and simply permit an Indian family or families to reside in the building during the pleasure of the Council.\n\nWe are simply offering various suggestions, and will be pleased to learn what use the Council considers should be made of the school building at this time.\n\nJ.

It is a physical impossibility for these children to attend school at the Indian Village of St. Regis during the fall and spring months, on account of the ice forming in the channel. And during the winter months it is practically impossible for them to attend with any degree of regularity, on account of the distance, and the hardship and danger of winter travelling.\n\nTo sell the school-house on St. Regis Island now, simply means that these young children would be absolutely shut out from any\nopportunity of acquiring an education, or improving their condition, and would be the direct means of causing them to grow up in the grossest ignorance. I have always understood that the policy of all Governments was to endeavor to educate these people, with the view of making them useful citizens. To sell their school-house, or to permit of its being sold, is not calculated to bring about that result.\n\nMr. Thompson spoke candidly and emphatically on the subject, and he tells me that the people on St. Regis island, particularly those with children, are most indignant at this proposed attempt to absolutely shut them out from giving their children the education which they so much need.\n\nMr. Thompson also says that he thinks a competent teacher can be obtained readily on Cornwall Island; one who is familiar with the English and Indian languages.\n\nYours respectfully,\nOttawa, May 14, 1907.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant stating that the Indians of St. Regis Island object to the sale being made of the old school building there, and in reply I beg to say that no resolution has as yet been received from the Indian council recommending the sale of this building.\n\nShould one be received, the protest of the Indians you represent will receive consideration.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nJohn A.

Furthermore, we are anxious that our children should be educated. After we have spent so much money to have the school erected, it does not look well to shut down our school, and we do not think without first doing the work for which it was erected, having agreed to send our children.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

They had a school on the island up to years ago, when it was closed on the supposition that the children could attend the school in St. Regis village.\n\nThe correspondence on file shows that the children on the island are growing up in ignorance, as they have apparently made no effort to send them to the village school. There is a body of water separating the island from the mainland and they claim that it is unsafe to send them across in boats in summer or let them travel on the ice in winter.\n\nThis matter was before you five years ago, when you were not favourable to the reopening of the school.\n\nMr. Chisholm, Barrister, of Cornwall, wrote the Department about a year ago on this subject and Mr. Inspector Ramaian, who looked into it, said that, unless there were some means taken for compulsory attendance, he would not favour the establishment of\nof any more schools on the reserve.\n\nIf the school is to be reopened at any time, provision would have to be made for a teacher's salary. They have a school building on the island, which would need very little outlay to make it serviceable.\n\nI think further information should be before the Department before finally dealing with this question, but very little satisfaction can be obtained from our Agent.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nI think the Village of St. Regis is a point where some attention should be given to the improvement of its day school facilities. The schools were amalgamated because it was found that the Indians could not afford the large educational expenses which were charged to them and owing to the fact that the interests of the Indians were not being served by such a large number of schools. I think that we should have a model Day School on the St. Regis Reserve and should undertake to improve the attendance by giving a mid-day meal to children who have to come from a distance, or to all the children if it were possible to have the villagers contribute in supplies or in some other way toward the cost. The attendance should be made compulsory. The present building is not a good one, and we should take steps to provide a new one, either from Indian funds or from appropriations. I think there is an excellent teacher at St. Regis who would likely fall in with our wishes to improve the property and the usefulness of the school. St. Regis is near enough to Ottawa to be under the constant supervision of the Department and I think we should endeavor to awaken a greater interest in the minds of these Indians in education.\n\nAccountant.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nMemorandum for Mr. [illegible]\n\nI do not deal with the question of a second school.\n\nOttawa, 190\nOttawa, 1st April, 1908.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Horan Pike of St. Regis called at the Department today and submitted on behalf of certain St. Regis Indians, the following matters for Department's consideration:\n\n(1) The need of re-opening the school on St. Regis Island; that there are about 30 children on the island that would attend school.\n\n(2) Requests that Location Ticket be issued to Louis Thompson for Colquhoun Island, in accordance with the resolution of council passed by the band on 4th February 1908.\n\n(3) Asks opinion as to which of the three wills made by the late (Chief) Joseph Thompson of St. Regis, is legal.\nOttawa, Ist April, 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your verbal enquiry today at the Department, with reference to the proposed re-opening of the St. Regis Island school, I beg to say that the matter will be looked into, and should the necessity of the case warrant the re-opening of the school, steps will be taken to do so not until after the summer vacation.\n\nAs regards the Will of the late Joseph Thompson I beg to say that the last Will, if regular, made by the testator should be accepted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLoran Pike, Esq.\nSt. Regis, Que.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6106, file 330-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPoor copy\nMemorandum.\n\nDeputy Cust. General of Indian Affairs.\n\nI beg to report that, while at St Regis on the 7th instant, I paid a visit to the St Regis island for the purpose of looking into the question of re-opening the school on the island.\n\nThe St Regis island is about 3 miles long, with a good road running through the middle or the whole length of it. There are 25 families living thereon, and their farms and houses certainly look far superior to any that I have seen on the reserve, excepting those on Cornwall island. I enclose herewith a snap-shot taken of Michel Francis' house and barns, as a sample, showing the kind of houses that can be seen on this island.\n\nThe school is situated just about the middle of the island, on Chief John Thompson's land (see sketch enclosed). The site is beautiful. It stands some 100 yards from the road, in a grove of maple trees, on a high land, overlooking the southern channel of the St Lawrence.\n\nAs the school house at present stands in the pasture land, it will be necessary to enclose it with a fence and to provide an independent access from the road to the school, as at present and in former times, the children had to go through private yards to reach it. To meet the needs of the case, Chief Thompson offered to set apart a piece of land 60 paces long and 25 paces wide as the school grounds, surrounding the present site, as well as a road-way immediately in front of the school.\nschool, across his cleared land, to the main road. If the Department decides to re-open the school, the Chief's offer should be accepted and that he be requested to execute a written conveyance of same.\n\nThe school house, which is a frame one, 18x24, was built in the spring of 1835. (See map-shot enclosed.) The outbuildings consist of a store-house, in good condition, and two single closets, both in urgent need of repairs and change of location. To make the school building comfortable and presentable for school purposes, the roof will have to be re-shingled, the walls, both inside and outside, will have to be re-painted, new chimney built and the foundations slightly repaired. The estimated cost of these repairs would not exceed $75.00. I may say that the building has been continuously used by different Indians as a dwelling.\n\nThe following school furniture are still on hand;\u2014\n14 double desks, a little varnish or paint would improve their appearances; a teacher's desk; a box stove with pipes; and a stock of second-hand school books.\n\nThere is no well on the school premises. Drinking water would have to be got from Chief Thompson's well.\n\nThe problem of accommodation for the teacher on the island would be a live issue. A native teacher would, of course, have no difficulty to offer in this connection; but a white teacher would certainly have and would either become Indianized and remain content to board with any of the Indians, or have the upper story of the school house fitted for his quarters, or find a more congenial boarding house among the white farmers on the mainland on the Ontario side, the last alternative would be the most satisfactory solution of the situation.\n\nIn\nIn view of the fact that all the Indians on the island are anxious to have the school re-opened, and as there are 36 children under 15 years of age, 23 of whom are of the school age, (see list enclosed) and as none of this number, but three, have attended school for the past 12 years, since 1896, when the school was closed, I beg to recommend that some action be taken immediately to provide facilities whereby the children will be given every opportunity to receive some education. Such condition of affairs, where boys have grown into young manhood without even seeing the inside of a school house, should not be allowed any longer to continue. After the summer holidays, the school should be re-opened, with a competent teacher in charge, and the regulations for compulsory attendance at school should, if found necessary, be put in force and a truant officer appointed to see that the same are complied with. The better element of the island, headed by Chief John Thompson, is decidedly in favour of the application of the compulsory school laws.\n\nThe scheme of sending the children to the St. Regis village school is not looked upon with any degree of favour by the parents for the following reasons; the danger and inconvenience in crossing the river in boats, where the channel is fully half a mile wide and the current is both strong and treacherous; the parents have not the time, and some perhaps, have not the inclination to convey their children to and fro twice a day in this manner; the moral atmosphere and influence of the village children, it is stated, is anything but wholesome. The reasonableness of the objection to crossing the river in boats is obvious. No parent, unless unnatural, would allow his child to cross such a river in small boat and feel contented as to the safety of the child.\nI beg to suggest that the children be sent, as an experiment for the balance of the present school term, to the village school on Smallman's steamer which plies between Dundee and Cornwall. An arrangement might be made with Mr. Smallman to call at the wharf on St Regis island for the children on his way up in the morning and again on his return trip in the afternoon. According to the time table, the boat calls daily at St Regis at 9 A.M. and 3 P.M., this would give the children ample time at school. Before such an arrangement can be carried out, however, the old wharf on the island would have to be repaired which would, according to the estimate given me by Chief Thompson, cost about $50.00. The need for a serviceable wharf on the island, in any case, is urgent for the use and convenience of the residents. It is situated on Mitchel Francis' farm not far from the present island school house.\n\nA temporary landing might also be built on Yellow island, some point opposite to the St Regis island wharf, for the same steamer to call for the children of that island, who number in all 19 of school age, and transport them to the village, to enable them also to attend school. Although the crossing between Yellow island and the St. Regis village is not so dangerous, excepting on windy days, as compared with the crossing to St Regis island, one of the Indians might be engaged to ferry the children daily to school. The children on this island, in former years, used to attend the Chenail school when it was in operation, but since it was closed, none of them have ever attended any school.\n\nIf the scheme of taking the children of the islands to the village school proves popular with the Indians and satisfactory to the Department, a larger school will have to be built, as the present one is not capable of accommodating more\nmore than 35 pupils. There is now before the Department the question of building a new council house in the village, plans might, therefore, be prepared for a building that would serve the purposes of a council hall and school.\n\nAs I was not able to visit the Chenail section of the reserve, I am not in position to offer any report as to the school facilities there. I was told, however, that there were about 40 children that could attend school but have not done so since the Chenail school was closed in 1896. I may say that some of these children live more than five miles from the village and in order to reach it, they would have to cross the St. Regis river.\n\nChas. A.

David,\n\nSome days ago, we received a letter from Mr. Brother Catherine, stating that the five years of the children's term was not yet, until the end of September, the agreement was that their case should be heard at the end of that time. If you desire to take them before that date, I will be obliged to have the matter expedited. To take them home. With regard to the children, they are now obedient & well mannered, so have tried to advance them in studies.\nbut found it difficult to have them retain anything they are willing but not bright. They are too weak about the idea of being called on to teach. Some cannot be further in a position of that kind, and others might be able to teach very small children although this will only be known when she would be put to the task. With regard to their graduating here, as stated in the letter from her written home, there was no talk of them doing so as we do not teach the higher branches but the plainest branches which necessitate the pupils taking a course outside in order to\nGraduate. You are proficient in housework & sewing, but we could not say that you are competent enough to take a position as teacher. Perhaps if you get a few more years of study, you might acquire some knowledge of the work. We will be sorry to lose the children for they have become dear to us & an extreme good.

Mother Superior where my two days stays are, and you will find out your self what to do and their plans let me know.\n\nTruly Yours,\n\nChief Joe Davis.\nOttawa, September 1, 1906.\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th inst., enclosing one from the Rev. Mother Superior of the West Philadelphia Industrial School regarding the attainments of your two daughters, for whom you wish to obtain positions as teachers of Indian schools; and in reply I beg to say that, in view of this letter, the Department would not be justified in appointing either of them at present, even if there was a vacancy.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nChief Louis David,\nSt. Regis,\nQue.\nOttawa, September 1, 1908.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nSome of the St. Regis Indians, Chief Thompson among the number, accompanied by William Reep, called at the Department on Friday in regard to the reopening of the school on St. Regis island. They claim that it would be impossible for the children to attend the St. Regis school, as they would have to cross a portion of the St. Lawrence river which is dangerous for children in small boats.\n\nThe school was closed some twelve years ago on the supposition that they could attend the village school. Since then they have had no educational advantages and as there are about twenty-five children of school age it is a pity that they should be allowed to grow up in ignorance. They have a building on the island which could be put in fair repair for about $55 and Chief Thompson offered to do the necessary work for this amount.\n\nMr. Reep has applied for the position of teacher and as none of the children have attended any school he would be able to give the necessary instruction, should the Department have sufficient reliance in his steadiness to appoint him. He would be willing to take his dismissal at any time if he failed to give satisfaction. It would be\na difficult to obtain a white teacher to live on the island, where he or she would be obliged to reside. One with some knowledge of the Indian language would be better adapted to the work.\n\nIt is for the Department to say whether the school will be reopened, the necessary repairs made and Mr. Roep given a chance or the services of someone else obtained.\n\nMartin Benson\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDeputy Superintendent General,\n\nIf another School is to be opened in St. Regis, the Department will have to provide for the full expenditure. As the amount required to place the school building in repair is not large, I think the work might be done. Mr. Benson does not say who made the estimate, but the building has been closed for so long that I think very likely it would take more than $55.00 to put it in a good state of repair for the winter. I have no information as to Mr. Reep's qualifications as a teacher but I don't think they would be high. He speaks Indian and English well; in fact, he is a first rate interpreter. I have always understood he was not very reliable and inclined to be intemperate. If we are to open a School and make a success of it we should have a competent Teacher and a person in whom we have every reason to have confidence.\n\nAccountant.\nOttawa, September 4, 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department contemplates reopening the Indian school on St. Regis Island, Que., and with that object in view is having the building repaired.\n\nIt will be willing to pay a salary of $300.00 per annum for a qualified and competent teacher and would be pleased if you could name a suitable person as soon as possible so that the school can be reopened at an early date.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\n\nA.

Miss Katie Roundpoint of Cornwall Island and Miss Nolan of St. Regis Village each receive a salary of $350.00. Miss Nolan has a certificate, but Miss Roundpoint has none.\n\nMiss Gallagher, who was recently appointed to St. Regis Island and who receives only $300.00, asks that she be paid at the rate of $350.00. Miss Gallagher has not been there long enough to judge of her teaching ability, but she is the holder of a certificate, has had experience and is most enthusiastic in her work. In so far as board and lodging are concerned she is in the worst position of the four. Mrs. Back, teacher of the Chenail school, and Miss Nolan live in the village and Miss Roundpoint resides at home, but Miss Gallagher is forced to life an comparatively isolated life on the island. For this reason I would submit for your consideration the placing of her salary at $350.00 per annum.\n\nMrs. Back is not a qualified teacher, but the inspector speaks highly of her and I am of opinion that the work she is performing is of as high an order as that of any of the other teachers. Mrs. Back receives only $300.00 and I think she too should have an increase of $50.00. This would put the four of them on the same terms.\n\nA.F.

If you do not find it convenient to visit the island yourself you should, if you think circumstances justify it, authorize somebody else to make inquiries. It might be well for you to notify the teacher, Miss Elizabeth E. Gallagher, to meet you, if convenient, in the village.

I have also been late a few times for the same reason.\n\nWhen I was engaged to take charge of this school, I had in mind of boarding with a relative who lives near by but I was very much disappointed later on to find...\nthe place not suitable, but I stayed on all last fall, part of the winter and a few weeks during spring.\n\nI did not have to pay very much for my board at my aunt's and if I had gone elsewhere I should have paid great rent. My purpose in working at home was to save my earnings as much as possible.\n\nMy salary so you know is three hundred per year.\n\nI shall hereafter reside on the Island during school days as requested by the department.\n\nBesides this I wish to tell also I am getting nicely with the work and enjoy it very much.

She is now paid at the rate of $450.00 per annum and has been in the service of the Department since the 14th of March, 1912, having formerly taught for three years on the Mississauga Reserve.\n\nMr. Agent Taillon was asked for a report on Miss McGoey's application and he has replied stating that \"during the short time she has been with us her services have been very satisfactory; she seems to have a very keen interest in her work and the children under her care. The Indians generally and more especially on St. Regis Island seem to hold her in very high esteem. Judging from the work already performed, I consider her a capable and very efficient teacher and have no hesitation in recommending an increase, as I think good teachers among the Indians need and should be encouraged\".\n\nMiss McGoey called hereon her way back to St. Regis.\nRegis Island after the Christmas holidays and told me that, while she is interested in her work, she finds the conditions on the Island harder than she expected, as she is almost entirely cut off from association with whites, it being a difficult matter to get off the Island and when she does so she has to pay the Indians every time they take her across, even when she is going to church. The boarding accommodation is very primitive and she has to spend a good deal for necessaries in the shape of food that the Indians do not furnish.\n\nI think the Department would be quite justified in increasing her salary to $500.00 a year.\n\nMr. Public School Inspector Gilman, who visited the St. Regis Island school, shortly after Miss McGoey took charge, reports that she is successful in her work.\nOttawa, January 20, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th ultimo in further reference to the question of increasing the salary of Miss McCahey, teacher of the St. Regis Island School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that in view of the good work being performed by Miss McCahey the Department has decided to grant her an increase of $50.00, which will bring her salary up to $500.00 per annum.

She got up and went and made her sit down and the teacher took her sticks and whipped the girl on her legs and arms so almost broke her finger. She whipped her until the girl fainted and then the teacher went and got some water and put some in her mouth and in her shirt, when the girl got up she made her read. She couldn't read and the teacher took her coat and told the children to go home and the teacher ran on her way to St Regis. As we lived far from a doctor and I hardly had any money.\nI was unable to see the doctor but neighbors have seen the big blue marks on her arm and leg and the swollen finger she has. She should go to school until she is better. I was unable to see the agent he is sick in bed. This is all.\n\nMrs John C Thompson\n\nP.S.

I explained to them that any teacher who could not work and live in harmony with the others on the reserve had a disturbing influence which would interfere with success in the classrooms. Miss E. Prudhomme, of Chetlain, handed in her resignation to take effect as soon as she could be relieved. I definitely placed Miss Macduffy in charge of the girls, both as far as their classroom activity was concerned and in their residence. I laid down the rule that the village residence was to be used by the Chetlain and Chenail teachers from Saturday until Sunday only and that they upon those occasions were to meet a fair share of the cost and to assist in the work. I arranged for the installation of Miss Carmel Dunnigen, the new teacher at St. Regis Island, who is to live with the two village teachers in the village residence. Mr. MacGibbon, the new Indian agent, is quite sincere and eager to do his best and I believe in time will be a good representative.\nOutremont, May 15, 1927,\n22 Robert Ave.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nPermit me to congratulate you on the acquisition of Miss McNulty, Miss McDonald and Miss Dunning to your staff of teachers at St. Regis. In the examinations just held they proved their worth and they are worth retaining in your department.\n\nI still cling\u2014and I offer it only as a suggestion\u2014to the opinion that the St. Regis Island should have a teacher residing on the Island. Too many days are lost on account of the difficulty in crossing, the whims of the river and the moods of the Indian. This would necessitate an Indian teacher. There is a Miss Snow who replaces some of the teachers in case of illness at Taughnawaga, who might be available. I did not broach the matter to her in my recent visit to Taughnawaga as I do not know your opinion on the advisability of engaging an Indian teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nInspector of Schools\n\nRussell F. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 19th, 1927.\n\nMadam:\n\nThe services of a teacher will likely be required for the next school year, beginning on or about September 1st, next, at the St. Regis Island Indian Day School, St. Regis, P.Q. As there is no residence provided at this school, it will be necessary that the teacher reside with an Indian family.\n\nMr. Cuddihy, Inspector of Schools, informs us that there is a Miss Snow, who replaces some of the teachers at Caughnawaga in case of illness, whose services might be available. I shall be pleased to have a report from you at your convenience as to the qualifications that Miss Snow possesses, and if you would recommend, in the event of a teacher being required at this school, that she receive the appointment. As full information as you can give regarding Miss Snow's ability will be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev.

MacGibbon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Regis, Que.\nSaint Ann's Convent,\nBaughnawaga, May 12, 1927.\n\nMy dear Sir,\n\nIt gratifies us to know that our girl graduates receive sufficient training in our schools to be recommended as teachers. Miss Snow of the class '24 who has replaced some teachers now and then in case of sickness, is a well qualified little person and teacher; but her mother will not allow her to leave home. She is very timid and frail.\n\nAs a mark of appreciation for your great kindness and your constant cooperation in our work, I would sacrifice Miss Snow our best assistant teacher. She has been associated with the work of the primary classes and has always given entire satisfaction for four years. She is twenty-five years old, painstaking, trustful and very respectable.\n\nShe was trained by one of our most competent teachers, consequently she was moulded into a capable, conscientious teacher. Her love for children, together with the many plans and devices taught her have assured her success. She commands respect from the children, she has discipline and assumes control. Apparently she is quiet and seems to enjoy my place she calls her home. I think she is just the sort of a girl you need in that lonely village of St. Regis.\n\nIf you intend to secure her services, I would advise you to do so soon before she goes away for the summer. Also state the salary as money plays a very important role with the Iroquois.\n\nTrusting I have given you sufficient information, I am,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nSister Mary Rose Alm\nPrincipal\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is probable that the Department will arrange for the new incumbent to live at the teachers' residence in St. Regis Village and arrangements will have to be made to row her back and forth daily. If this plan is not now feasible, will you please telephone to me at the Department upon receipt of this letter? In that event, a teacher who would live with the Indians on the Island would have to be secured.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. A. MacGibbon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Regis, Que.\nOttawa, August 9th, 1930.\n\nMadam,\n\nI wish to refer to your application for a position at an Indian school. There is a vacancy at the St. Regis Island Indian Day School, which is in the St. Lawrence River a few miles east of Cornwall. The incumbent of this post would live at St. Regis Village with three other teachers at Indian schools. The teacher in charge of the residence is Miss Margaret MacNulty, R. R.

The teacher of the Island School will be taken across a half mile of water on the St. Lawrence by boat, morning and night. The Department offers you a salary of $60 per teaching month, with free heated and furnished residence. Of course, you would have to share the cost of the meals and laundry with the other teachers.\n\nPlease see Miss MacNulty without delay and let me have an answer as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

He has the same relation to you as school trustees and you should look to him for guidance in all matters pertaining to the conduct of your school and your relations with the Indians. Miss MacNulty will no doubt give you advice in connection with teaching methods.\n\nI may say that Miss Helena Dubois, of Hammond's Bridge, Telephone R-2098 J., has recently been appointed teacher at St. Regis Village.

I refer to Miss Lyla Spottwood, of Waltham, Que., who has a model diploma for Quebec and 7 years' successful experience. She is 26 years of age. I have explained conditions to her and she has applied for the position.

Salary at the rate of $80 per teaching month will be allowed in your case. This salary will be subject to a 10% deduction during the present fiscal year.\n\nThis school is situated on St. Regis Island in the St. Lawrence river. It is a mile and a half from St. Regis Village, which is in Quebec. You will reside in St. Regis Village. A furnished and heated teachers' residence is provided by the Department for four young lady teachers. Miss Frances Morris, of Sheenboro, Que., is the senior teacher on the reserve, and, in connection with academic questions, you should look to her for advice as you commence your work. She lives in the same residence.\n\nThe Indian Agent, who would bear the same relation to you as a local School Board, is Mr. W. A. MacGibbon. He lives at St. Regis and you should look to him for instructions and advice in all general matters. The best way to proceed to your school by train is by New York Central to Nyando Junction, N.Y., and then get a car to St. Regis Village. However, I would advise you to drive to the school when you first go there, using the ferry which is just to the east of Cornwall. Take a ferry which goes to St. Regis Village. The wharf is but a couple of hundred yards from your residence.\n\nDuring the winter months, you would ski or snowshoe to your school, approximately 1\u00bd miles. In the summer, the Department engages an Indian to row you across to the island, night and morning.\n\nIf anything interferes with your accepting this post, please write to the Department without delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMiss Helen McRea,\nR.R.

There has not been any great degree of sickness amongst the school children during the month and of course improvement in working conditions for the family earner has assisted inasmuch as many of the children are better clothed and do not miss school on that account. At the Chetlain school the week from the 19th., to 23rd., was lost on account of illness of the teacher's father which necessitated her remaining away from school.\n\nD.P.

School was closed on St. Regis Island at the close of the school month and will remain closed until September. This is due to the teacher resigning from her position. Considerable damage was done at the Village school towards the end of the month due to children breaking all the windows at the school.

This is due to the flu epidemic mostly. In general it can be said that attendance at the various schools has maintained a high level. Such a high percentage is particularly noteworthy at the Chetlain school where it was difficult to get the boys to school. The reverse is now the case as far as the boys are concerned. With the exception of the Cornwall Island east school no manual training is carried on. The village boys get the benefit of some training along this line when such is possible with the time at the disposal of the local constable. With only one man now working here less time can be devoted to such work amongst the boys. Due to the poor facilities at St. Lawrence this winter it has not been possible during December to get to St. Regis Island School. The conditions are such that it is not safe to walk nor can a boat be used. Only emergency trips are made by the Indian residents of the island.\n\nIn general the children on the whole appear to be well-behaved and industrious. There is very little incentive for those children in our Quebec schools to develop much energy to studies after they reach the age of 15 as the prospect of being able to attend a high school is no better than in past years. The hardest period to keep those children at school is between the age of 15 and 16. The boys in particular just wont exert themselves too much after 15. This situation is most unfortunate as they have just reached a point in life when they should be capable of absorbing some knowledge. I feel though that if we could give them the kind of training they would like at this period we would be well repaid and would not have any attendance problem on our hands to contend with.\n\nT.L. Bonnah,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 15, 1946.\n\nDear Mr. Black:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of July 10, enclosing communication from Miss Rita Gaze, teacher of the St. Regis Island Indian Day School.\n\nMiss Gaze was transferred to the St. Regis Island School on September 1, 1943, and we were advised by the Indian Agent at that time that she was quite satisfied to accept this appointment.\n\nThere has been no suggestion received regarding the transfer of this teacher to another school for the academic year 1946-47. It is our intention to retain her services for that academic year at her present school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nE.J.F. Pratt,\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nDonald E. Black, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, May 12, 1947.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nMr. T. L. Bonnah, your Indian Agent, has forwarded to me the attendance percentages of the schools in his agency for the month of April.\n\nMay I add my congratulations to him for this splendid achievement of your pupils and yourself.\n\nIt is only by continual attendance that our Indian children can achieve results similar to those of the white children. If we wish them to advance to higher education, it is most important that they have a thorough and complete grounding in their elementary studies. This can only be obtained by diligent work and constant attendance.\n\nI will watch with interest the progress of the children at your school and it is my sincere hope that your pupils will proceed to high schools, technical schools and other institutions of advanced learning.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

O. McDonald\nJohn Thompson\nmark\nOttawa, August 5, 1908.\n\nThe Acting Deputy Minister,\n\nThe St. Regis Island school is centrally situated and with the following repairs will answer for a long time. It is 16'9\" by 24'6\" and 11' high and well lighted. There are ten pine desks, which, if fastened to the floor, would provide the necessary accommodation, if three more were added. The inside plastering along the floor should be protected by a rainsealing and the outside would be better for painting.\n\nMr. Thompson, on whose farm the school-house is located, has offered to do the whole of the work for $33.00, and I would recommend that Mr. Agent Long be authorized to have the repairs made by him, as he takes a great interest in the school and keeps it in good order. I found the closets clean and about one and one-half tons of coal on hand. This school was closed for some years and I consider the Department was quite justified in reopening it, as the children on the island could not possibly attend the St. Regis school, owing to the distance and having to cross a wide arm of the St. Lawrence.\n\nThe late teacher, who was too young and inexperienced for the work, has resigned and a new one is needed. An application has been received from Joseph F. Phillips for the position of teacher at The Chenaill. He is\napparently a well-educated Indian, who completed his course in the St. Laurent College, near Montreal, and has enclosed his diploma. I think an Indian teacher better suited for this school than a white for the present, as the pupils are all in the lower standards and very few of them understand English.

Our extended experience as iron founders for over forty years enables us to surpass all others who are in the quality and finish of our castings; they are a special feature in our desks.\n\nWoods, as generally furnished, are hard maple or birch, rubbed and varnished; other woods can be furnished if required, at extra prices. They are joined by dovetail and grooved joint in addition to screws\u2014the strongest fastening known.\n\nThe backs and seats have solid glued and dovetailed joints, making them as strong as if cut out of one piece of wood, and are properly curved to enforce a correct position on the part of the pupil.\n\nScrews are used instead of ordinary nails. The hinge for this purpose is strong and cannot break, and is absolutely noiseless.\n\nInk Wells, with handsomely nickel-plated covers, being flush with the top, and iron castings to protect the glass, are furnished with each desk. Two wells with each desk, the extra well will be fitted with a sponge, will be furnished when ordered at an extra additional charge.\n\nDesks may be shipped either \"set up\" or \"knocked down.\" In either way we pack them so that they will come to hand in perfect order, and when set up they will be described \"knocked down,\" and for long distances the difference is not more than pay the cost of setting up, which is a work of no difficulty whatever.\n\nPrices and further particulars furnished promptly on application.\n\n\"PARAGON\" SCHOOL DESKS\n\nView of Row of Paragon Desks in Position.\n\nThis cut shows Double Desks with Double Seats, each accommodating two pupils.\n\nLIST OF THE DIFFERENT SIZES MADE:\n\n| No. | Description       | Age Range |\n|-----|-------------------|-----------|\n| 1   | High School       | 12 to 18  |\n| 2   | Grammar           | 12 to 15  |\n| 3   | Intermediate      | 10 to 13  |\n| 4   | Junior            | 8 to 10   |\n| 5   | Primary           | 6 to 8    |\n| 6   | Kindergarten      | 4 to 6    |\n\nDIMENSIONS:\n\n| No. | Height to Top of Desk | Height to Front of Seat | Length of Single Desk | Length of Double Desk | Width of Top | Space occupied |\n|-----|-----------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------|---------------|\n|     | 30                    | 17 1/2                   | 29 1/2               | 24 1/4               | 23          | 21 1/2        |\n|     | 28 1/2                | 16                        | 28 1/2               | 23 1/4               | 22          | 20 1/2        |\n|     | 26 1/2                | 14 1/2                    | 26 1/2               | 21 1/4               | 21          | 19 1/2        |\n|     | 24 1/2                | 12 1/2                    | 24 1/2               | 19 1/4               | 20          | 18 1/2        |\n|     | 22 1/2                | 10 1/2                    | 22 1/2               | 17 1/4               | 19          | 16 1/2        |\n|     | 20 1/2                | 8                         | 20 1/2               | 15 1/4               | 17          | 14 1/2        |\n\nStarting at back ends without desks, one omitted at end of each row, as per cut, and front desks without seats, supplied in all sizes.\n\nIndian Affairs.

DEPUTY MIN. & SECRETARY\nOF INDIAN AFFAIRS,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\n\nDEAR SIR:\n\nThe writer made a personal inspection of the schoolhouse on St. Regis Island and found same in a very poor condition for school children. The ceiling at present is only 7 ft. 10 in. high and the lumber forming same of a very rough quality with cracks and knot holes and only one thickness at that. The wainscoting is 2 ft. 6 in. high and above that to ceiling is plaster; this is all picked and broken and could not be repaired by patching. The door is a 1\" batton door and the frame very bad and roughly put in\u2014both door and frame are required new. The windows are in good shape (we made same a short time ago for an indian, we think).\n\nWe would suggest that the ceiling and walls above present ceiling be done as follows in order to make building warm and comfortable. Carry walls up say 2 ft. 6 in. higher than present wall from ceiling to have about 2 ft. 6 in. of segment in centre of building thus leaving ceiling from floor level at centre of building about 12 ft. The ceiling and side walls should have two boardings of matched boards, 2 layers felt, and should be ceiled on face side say with 5/8\" V. joint and carried down to wainscoting. Finish doors and windows to receive the ceiling. The floor or base of floor re-\nquires a moulding around as the base was not put on very closely. The chimney stands at present on two plank\u2014this also would require to be finished around. The seats are all in good shape. The teacher's desk is a common box on four legs.\n\nWe will do all above mentioned work, furnishing all material and painting interior with two coats (color to suit) for the sum of two hundred and ten dollars ($210.00). Should you think a teacher's desk necessary we will put one in for seven dollars and fifty cents ($7.50) extra. If favored with this work we wish you would kindly give us order as soon as possible as it is very difficult to get material on the Island. We are\n\nYours very truly\n\nDict. L. A.

It was not properly seasoned and the Public School Inspector reports that as a result the joints are parted to the extent of from one-half to one inch in some places.\n\nI may also say that a similar complaint in regard to the interior woodwork in the new school in the village of St. Regis has been received.\n\nThe Department has no doubt that you were not aware of the fact that the lumber furnished was not properly seasoned and therefore request that you will be willing to make the necessary reparation.
