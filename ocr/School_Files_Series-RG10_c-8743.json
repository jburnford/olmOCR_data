(RG 10, Volume 6403, File 831-5, part 5)\nMr. G. Selvig, Contractor, Prince Rupert, B.

Put on new flashings on the entire roof where indicated.\n3. Put on new ridge boards.\n4. Check chimneys and stop present leakage into house.\n5.

When ready to load, please give the office notice of time.\n\nF. Earl Anfield.\nIndian Agent.\n\nCOPY.\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\nDecember 23rd, 1947.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C., Vancouver.\n\nAttached please find voucher no. 1285 in the sum of $1230.45 being account rendered by Gunnar Selvig, P.O. Box 654, Prince Rupert, B. C. This firm was given the job of repairing the roof and carrying out other approved repairs to the Metlakatla Day School as outlined in the attached copy of instructions to Mr. Selvig in this regard.\n\nDue to very bad weather, the work was delayed until late in the fall when Mr. Selvig rushed a crew over to Metlakatla and put on the new roof and later carried out the interior repairs.\n\nI went over to inspect the completed work at which time the foreman pointed out to me the very dangerous condition of the main timbers supporting this building. The hazard of collapse was such that I instructed the foreman to proceed immediately to open the front of the building up for further inspection, which revealed that all holding timbers had rotted leaving only 1/2 inches of holding space on two of the supporting posts and not more than 3 inches of holding surface on any other posts in the foundation. Further examination disclosed that on the front verandah the upright posts and cross timbers were in an advanced state of rot. On my return to Prince Rupert I contacted Mr. Selvig and instructed him to carry out such repairs as would make the building safe. He was unable to give any price on this type of work but dispatched five men the next day. The final accounts have now been received showing an over expenditure of $575.45 over the sum authorized. Needless to say receipt of this account came as a shock, it being my understanding with Mr. Selvig that the work should not cost more than $200.00. In conversation with Mr. Selvig this week he went over the accounts in detail and advised that had this work not been done, the entire structure would have been grossly unsafe. Once started he had to carry timbers right through the building and reinforce the entire verandah to make the place safe in order to protect the investment already made of a new\nroof and the lining with Donnaconda board.\n\nI am not sure if you know this building personally. It has a gigantic roof and the weight of which is carried by the verandah posts on the front side. Repairs to this and the timbers beneath them were essential and whilst I regret exceedingly the tremendous expense incurred on this old building, I could see no other way out than to have the work proceeded with immediately.\n\nApplication is, therefore, made for an emergency sum of $575.45 to meet the further costs of repairs on this building. I realize that this should have been placed before the Department for authorization but I had not idea at the time that the damage was so extensive nor that it would be so costly. I am prepared, if necessary, to accept responsibility for this work and if the Department so decide will meet the cost myself from monthly deductions from my salary.\n\nI may say that my only desire was to keep the school at Metlakatla in operation where we have a first class teacher and a grand bunch of children whose attendance is now at an all time high. The physical plant at Metlakatla is a sad story and it seems that I have fallen heir to its collapse both as to the school and the teacherage. May I say personally that I am sorry this additional cost has cropped up and regret having to add this worry to the closing days of your Commissionership in B.C.\n\nF. Earl-Anfield.\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYour File 168-3-5 (W.T.1)\n\nUnder date of August 13th, 1947, the Department authorized an expenditure of $655 for repairs to the teacher's residence at Metlakatla. Immediately following receipt of your letter the Indian Agent was instructed to proceed to have the work carried out but nothing further was heard from him in regard to the matter until receipt of the attached letter with vouchers covering a total expenditure of $1,243.20.\n\nMr. Anfield incurred the additional expenditure of $588.20 without any reference whatever to this office despite the fact that there is a daily air mail service between Prince Rupert and this city, as well as telegraphic service always available; consequently I am not impressed with the explanation he offers nor am I at all satisfied that the urgency was such that it precluded reference to this office for authority in the usual way.\n\nMr. Anfield apparently is a frequent offender in incurring expenditures without the requisite authority despite repeated warnings and the Department may find it necessary to put a stop to this practice by confronting him on some occasion with the necessity of having to meet the unauthorized outlay himself.\n\nThe accounts in question are being recommended for payment and if the expenditure is to be a charge against the $47,500 authorized for new schools and additions in British Columbia please advise as it will be necessary to curtail the building program in the Kwawkewlth Agency now underway.\n\nW.S.

After considering the voucher that you forwarded we find it necessary to return it in order that you may adopt the under mentioned procedure.\n\nPlease arrange to have two vouchers issued -\n\n(1) Voucher for materials amounting to $389.14, plus the 10% on this amount which is the contractor's fee and should show on the account which makes a total of $423.05. Attached to this voucher should be a new account from Gunnar Selvig showing the items mentioned only and to which should be attached the receipts from the firms from whom the contractor purchased the materials. You can issue a purchase order for this amount and attach it to this voucher.\n\n(2) Another voucher should be issued for the item of boat hire, plus the wages of the five persons engaged in the work, plus the Workman's Compensation Board charge, plus the contractor's fee of 10% which will make a total voucher of $793.60. On this voucher the number of hours each man was employed should be shown, the rate per hour and also the dates on which these men were employed.\n\nBoth vouchers, of course, should be certified\nby the Agent and also certified by you.

I understand from the Treasury Branch that at least one of the cheques has gone forward and that the other will be sent this week.\n\nIt might be well to point out to Indian Agent Anfield that the delay in paying Mr. Selvig is due in large part to the fact that Mr. Anfield totally exceeded his authority in connection with the cost of the repairs to the Metlakatla teacher's residence. Possibly Mr. Anfield will advise Mr. Selvig to the above effect so that Mr. Selvig will realize that the delay in payment is not due to inaction on the part of head office.\n\nBernard F.

S. Arneil, Indian Commissioner for B. C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nRe: Metlakatla Indian Day School.\n\nThe building requirements for the above mentioned school have been discussed with Mr. Indian Agent Anfield and a careful check has been made of the school age and pre-school age population. As a result we are in agreement that the construction of a one room school will meet the present need and the requirements for the next six years, the time for which any secure forecast can be made. The present teacherage is the old agency building which is a fourteen room structure to which repairs costing over a thousand dollars were made in the last fiscal year in order to keep the building habitable. It is my opinion that the upkeep and the heating of this building will make it uneconomical when a compact unit can be constructed when the new school is erected.\n\nMr. Anfield has secured a bid from a local contractor for the erection of a one room school with teacherage through the use of former army buildings of Loxstave construction. He will be writing you with regard to the tender and submitting the plans prepared by the builders. I have seen the plans and consider them suitable for the requirements at Metlakatla,\n\nR. F. Davey,\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools.\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\nApril 14th, 1948.\n\nW. S. Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B. C., Box 70, Vancouver.\n\nAttached please find contract and specifications for a proposed one room school and teacherage for Matlakatla, B. C. The plan of this school will be sent over to you from the blueprinters in Vancouver to whom the original tracing has been sent. The change from a two to a one room school was reached after very careful consideration of all factors involved and it is believed that this plant will adequately serve the needs of this village for some years to come.\n\nI have gone over the specifications in detail with the North-West Construction Company and believe that we will get a suitable job for the money requested. It is considered that the bid, under today's conditions, is reasonable. The bidding firm has other large contracts pending and are anxious and ready to commence work on receipt of instructions so to do from the Department. It is suggested that the contract and specifications be reviewed by the legal branch of the Department as the firm request a definite contract in this case so that they may draw on the job by progress reports.\n\nIt is recommended that if funds are available this work proceed immediately. No other firm has presented a bid on this work.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER FROM MR. W. S. ARNEIL,\nDated April 15, 1948.\n\nMetlakatla -\n\nThe information we now have, and which we have asked\nthe Agent to confirm, is to the effect that a two-room school\nis necessary here and it has been suggested that we should also\nprovide accommodation for teachers. This matter is presently\nthe subject of correspondence with Mr. Anfield as the need for\nadditional accommodation for teachers is not apparent having\nin mind the large expenditure recently made on the present\nteachorage and its size which should provide ample accommoda-\ntion for two teachers, either married or single.\n\nI might mention that in Early February Mr. Anfield\nsubmitted tenders covering the transfer and re-erection of two\nLoxstave buildings from Pillsbury Cove to Metlakatla for school\nuse and he has been requested to advise if these tenders still\nstand in which case they will be referred to the Department,\nor otherwise we may, if the Prefabricated Structures' plan of a\ntwo-room school is considered suitable, recommend the provision\nof prefabricated buildings.\nAir Mail\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: School Construction Program - B.C.\nMetlakatla School\n\nFurther to my letter of April 15th and in particular section one dealing with our requirements at Metlakatla, Skeena River Agency, I am enclosing herewith Mr. Indian Agent Anfield's letter of April 14th, contract specifications, and plan referred to therein covering the construction of a one classroom building with teacherage by the Northwest Construction Company. This is substantially the same proposal referred to in my letter above mentioned, apart from the fact that it has now been definitely determined that construction of a one room school will meet the present need and the requirements for the next six years; reference District School Inspector Davey's letter of April 13th attached. You will note Inspector Davey's reference to the present teacherage for which the Department made substantial expenditures for repairs recently, and his opinion that maintenance costs and heating costs would make use of this building uneconomical. In view of the fact that only one teacher will be required at Metlakatla this opinion is no doubt reasonable and the construction of a combined single classroom and teacherage would seem advisable.\n\nI would recommend acceptance of the tender submitted by the Northwest Construction Company in the amount of $9,850 as set out in the contract and would ask that early consideration be given to this recommendation in order that construction may be proceeded with as soon as possible.\n\nW.S.

Also attached is a tender from the company for the moving and setting up of three Logstave buildings (now situated at Pilsbury Cove). It is the intention of the company to dismantle these buildings and from them to secure sufficient materials to erect the school as outlined in their drawings and specifications. Mr. Indian Agent Amfield has made the following comment concerning the plan presented:\n\n\"I have gone over the specifications in detail with the North-West Construction Company and believe that we will get a suitable job for the money requested. It is considered that the bid, under today's conditions, is reasonable. The bidding firm has other large contracts pending and are anxious and ready to commence work on receipt of instructions so to do from the Department. It is suggested that the contract and specifications be reviewed by the legal branch of the Department as the firm request a definite contract in this case so that they may draw on the job by progress reports.\n\n\"It is recommended that if funds are available this work proceed immediately. No other firm has presented a bid on this work.\"\n\nMr. Indian Commissioner Arneil also recommended the acceptance of this tender. We wired Mr. Arneil, asking if it\nwould not be preferable to have this company submit a tender for the erection of a standard one-room school and attached teacherage. He replied stating that he considered these converted logstave buildings would provide adequate school facilities at a lower cost than the erection of our standard one-room school.\n\nWe are in urgent need of a day school at this point as these Indians are among the most progressive on the Pacific Coast. Unfortunately, the community is quite isolated and it will be difficult to get general contractors to tender on this project.\n\nTherefore it would be appreciated if we could have your advice with regard to the acceptance or rejection of this tender.\n\n[Signature]\n\nEncl.\n\nDirector.\nInd.

Payment of this account is recommended. The amount was incurred as wages paid to two Indian women by Miss Cora Merrett for scrubbing the Metlakatla temporary classroom during the Easter holidays. The building is fairly old and the floors very rough. Miss Merrett considered that the floor should be thoroughly scrubbed using a strong disinfectant. She informed me that this action had been taken towards the end of the holidays and that she had paid the women $5.00 a piece for the day's work. I instructed her to make out labor sheets and believe that they should be paid and so recommended.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRe: Metlakatla Indian Day School,\nSkeena Indian Agency, British Columbia.\n\nWith reference to your marginal notation dated the 29th ultimo, on a memorandum from Mr. Hoey dated June 28th regarding the above, the sketch plan and specification submitted by the Northwest Construction Company, to the Indian Affairs Branch, do not present a complete and satisfactory picture.\n\nThe structure proposed would be very temporary, resting only on concrete pads, having 3\" x 3\" studs at 2'-0\" centres for what appears to be a 13 or 14 foot wall. There is no indication of bridging for the horizontal series of 8 windows and a door, on the south side. One of the most desirable features of \"Loctave\" construction, the tension joint at corners, is not provided. Wall insulation is not quite sufficient and no insulation is indicated for the floor which is supported by beams above grade.\n\nElectrical data supplied is too vague for analysis. The proposed 3/4\" x 160\u00b0-0\u00b0 water service connection is too small.\n\nIn view of the fact that material for the building, with very minor exceptions, is to be supplied by the Dominion Government, and that it is prefabricated, requiring reassembling only, the price of $9,850.00 appears to be high, and we do not recommend acceptance.\n\nThe sketch plan and specification which accompanied Mr. Hoey's memorandum are attached for return to Indian Affairs.\n\nEnclos.: R.A.

If at all possible to secure the additional funds, it is recommended that the bids, as submitted, be accepted and work commenced without delay. It is most urgently recommended that the full basement be put under the school and that flush toilets and wash basins be installed therein.

C.; all firms are located in Prince Rupert, B. C.:\n\n(a) MITCHELL AND CURRIE LTD. - contract price for the moving of the prefab. building to site; foundation and full concrete basement under school and residence, as per bid $ 8259.00\n\n(b) THOM SHEET METAL WORKS LTD. - furnace installed as per bid 1995.47\n\n(c) SMITH AND ELKINS LTD. - (a) plumbing of residence 898.00\n(b) Flush toilets and washbasins in school basement 385.00\n\n(d) GRANT AND NEWTON LTD. - contract for complete wiring of school and teacherage, including basement, all in rigid conduit 575.00\n\nTotal of contract bids above cost of prefabricated structure $ 12,112.47\n\nEst. cost of prefab. school and teacherage 5,850.00\nEst. cost of freight to Prince Rupert 1,000.00\n\nEstimated cost of school, less painting $ 18,962.47\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Metlakatla Indian Day School\n\nI wrote you under date of August 4th recommending purchase of a prefabricated one-room school with teacherage for Metlakatla village, Skeena River Agency, and subsequently requested Supt. Anfield to secure bids on the erection and completion of the building in anticipation of an order being placed at an early date.\n\nYou will note from Mr. Anfield's letter of August 30th attached, that he has been successful in securing bids from the various firms mentioned and that the cost of erecting and completing the building including heating, wiring and plumbing but less painting, will be approximately $19,000. This amount is larger than we had anticipated but we were not familiar with the conditions which would be encountered at Metlakatla involving transportation of materials by scow and the necessity for unloading at flood tides. The amount is not considered to be unreasonable in view of all the circumstances and I would recommend acceptance of the tenders attached.\n\nThe necessary funds additional to the $10,000 provided from appropriation can be secured by means of a transfer from the remaining balance of the appropriation for construction at Hazelton. I would suggest that an amount of $10,000 be transferred, making a total of $20,000 for Metlakatla and leaving the balance of the appropriation for Hazelton at $8,000.\n\nW. S.

S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\n\n-ep\nEncl.\nSeptember 9, 1948.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nWe have your letter of the 31st ultimo, file 12-11-3, with reference to the Metlakatla teacher's residence.\n\nWe have carefully considered the contents of your letter and it is felt that the quotation of $8,259.00 for moving the prefabricated building to the site and providing a foundation, is extremely high.\n\nIn other parts of the country a foreman is engaged and Indian labour is used for the construction of the foundation. The work can be done under the general supervision of the Indian Superintendent.\n\nIt has always been our understanding that the Metlakatla Indians are an advanced group and we feel it should not be difficult to secure proper Indian labour at Metlakatla. By constructing the foundation in the manner suggested, there should be a considerable saving.\n\nPlease give the matter further consideration and let me hear from you again.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\nTo make sure that this bid is low I have asked Northwest Construction Company to put in a bid also. This will be wired to you tomorrow afternoon by army signal.\n\nWith regard to doing this job on a day labour basis, I have scoured the city for a competent foreman with experience in prefabricated structures. Work in Prince Rupert is very plentiful and competent help is almost impossible to obtain.\n\nThe Metlakatla men are still out fishing and will not be through setting until November 15th by which time this building should be just about finished if the contracts are let at once. It is considered that sufficient labour of an efficient type would be impossible to obtain for this job from this village. These men are fishermen, not carpenters and the cost on a day labour basis would be exorbitant. I would quote the experience of the Kitkatla water system as an example of the difficulties that might be expected with Indian labour unless a competent foreman could be supplied by Prefab Structures Ltd.\n\nWhilst I am willing to supervise the work if the Department insists on doing it by day labour with a competent foreman, I would respectfully point out that apart from Miss Batt, I am without competent assistance in the office, in addition to which I will necessarily be away a great deal in October and November in the distant villages.\n\nIt is therefore recommended that subject to a lower bid from Northwest Construction Ltd. tomorrow, the contracts be let to Mitchell & Currie and other sub trades as submitted.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Superintendent,\nSkeena River Agency.\n\nEnclos.\nW.S. Arneil, Indian Commissioner for B.C., VANCOUVER.\n\nRe: Metlakatla Day School.\n\nRe yours of Sept. 29th, file 12-11-3, the delay in answering yours of Sept. 15th is regretted, but due to extreme pressure of work and an effort to try and find a method that will get this school built at a lower cost than that of the bid submitted by Messrs. Mitchell & Currie Ltd of this city.\n\nI have interviewed this firm several times and their final offer is that they will cut $750.00 off their bid if satisfactory arrangements can be made to secure accommodation for their crews and save time and boat hire taking them over every day. They also agree to doing the job on a cost plus 10% basis, the Department to supply an inspector of works on the job.\n\nIt is noted in your letter that you state, \"apart from that covering the transfer of the building to the site and the provision of a foundation at a cost of $6,259.00\". I would point out that the bid of Mitchell & Currie in this sum covers a lot more than this, to wit, the erection of the prefab building on the foundation; complete and ready for the painters, (other sub-trades will put in wiring, plumbing and heating concurrently with the main job), erection of chimney and sewers. Their bid will therefore be $7,509.00 and not $8,259.00 as I have concluded arrangements with Metlakatla people to house and board the crew as a charge on the main contract.\n\nAttached please find revised bid on the general contract from Mitchell & Currie Ltd. in the reduced sum, and their offer to do the job on a cost plus basis.\nwill be difficult to make arrangements for protecting it from the weather unless work is underway at the site.\n\n-W.S.Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nP.S. Since writing the above a message has been received from Supt. Anfield that the Northwest Construction bid $11,635.00.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Metlakatla Indian Day School\nYour file 168-3-5 (E.1)\n\nWith reference to Mr. Neary's letter of Sept. 9th regarding the high cost of the erection of a new school at Metlakatla, while I will concede that the overall cost of this project would appear to be high I would point out that the quotation of Mitchell and Currie Ltd., $8,259.00, includes in addition to moving the prefabricated building to the site and the provision of a foundation, labour and the provision of all materials necessary for this work and also labour required for the erection of the prefabricated sections. In other words it includes everything necessary apart from the prefabricated sections and material and labour for the installation of heating, plumbing and wiring.\n\nSupt. Anfield has, however, reference his letter of October 1st attached, been able to secure a reduction of $750 in the firm's tender by arranging for accommodation for the workmen in the village. Mitchell and Currie's bid of $7,509.00 is enclosed and although you will note that they are prepared to undertake the work on a cost plus 10% basis it is felt that it would be unreasonable to ask Mr. Anfield with his present staff to supervise the work and consequently I would recommend acceptance of their tender. The tender from the Northwest Construction Ltd., referred to by Mr. Anfield has not been received and presumably will not be forthcoming.\n\nI should appreciate an early decision with respect to this matter as the building is ready for shipment and it\nOctober 26, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nACTING DIRECTOR,\n\nMetlakatla Indian Day School.\n\nThe correspondence hereunder, concerning the erection of a one-room day school and attached teacher's quarters, has been giving Mr. Phelan and myself a great deal of concern.\n\nIn our Estimates for this year we have the sum of $10,000.00 for the erection of this school. Normally, a school of this type costs between $14,000 and $17,000, when it is erected in the standard way. This, however, is a prefabricated building and you will note that the total cost will be over $19,000.00 (see Mr. Amfield's letter of August 30, Flag one down).\n\nI have discussed with Mr. Brown the possibility of enfranchisement for this Band of Indians. Before making any recommendations to you concerning the acceptance of the tender attached hereto, I would welcome an opportunity of discussing the situation at Metlakatla with you.\n\nBernard F.

C.\n\nPreamble to attached Tender for Metlakatla School and Teacherage\n\nMr. Jack Martin, our General Superintendent and myself have inspected the proposed site and in order to clarify our tendered price, we beg you to take the following points into consideration and thereby realize the difficulties attached thereto, which we must overcome. Viz -\n\n1 All materials must be handled frequently during transhipment from Prince Rupert dock to actual site.\n\n2 There being no dock at Metlakatla suitable for the landing of materials.\n\n3 Beaching point for scow is in an exposed position and the use of an alternate sheltered point is expected during course of project which will increase cost of handling considerably.\n\n4 There is the possibility of bad weather necessitating the holding of scow at Prince Rupert and thus increased demurrage would be entailed.\n\n5 We have allowed for the employment of a standby vessel to facilitate the protection of the conveyance and its cargo as well as to supply transportation to Prince Rupert for any emergency which might arise.\n\n6 There being no accommodation in suitable condition for housing personnel, an allowance for the cleaning and overhaul of existing building is included.\n\n7 Due to the shortness of suitable working time we have and will guarantee the complete co-operation of all subtrades.\n\n8 Our estimated time for completion of project would be ten weeks from acceptance of contract and delivery of materials shipped by Prefabricated Buildings Ltd., Vancouver.\n\nNORTHWEST CONSTRUCTION LTD.\n\n[Signature]\nNeil G. Kingston\nManaging Director\nWe have carefully examined the site of proposed building and have checked our material and labor requirements for the construction of Multi-Flex building specified for this project and beg therefore to submit our tender and recommendations.\n\nThe Photostat of plans show a full concrete wall extending to bottom of floor joists, which is, in our opinion, superfluous, considering local conditions. Concrete wall to 6\" above earth grade would be adequate in this instance.\n\nWe have, however, quoted on both full and half walls and would be pleased to conform to Department requirements in this matter.\n\nWe would like to recommend the change of roofing material from Cedar Shingles to asphalt shingles, which we feel are certainly suitable to local conditions. This change would not entail any increase in cost on our part and should be supplied at the same price from source.\n\n\"To the erection and completion of building specified, on Photostat submitted by \"Prefabricated Structures Ltd., Vancouver\" \u2014which would include the following work,\n\n1. Supply transportation for all materials and labor from Dock at Prince Rupert to site at Metlakatla.\n\n2. Supply labor and material for concrete walls and floors in specified building.\n\n3. Supply all labor and material for chimney as per plan.\n\n4. Supply all labor and material for the installation of concrete Septic tank and rockpit required by Provincial health code for twenty persons.\n\n5. All labor and equipment for excavation of basement and walls to adequate soil bearing strata and for the moving and rough grading of spoil.\n\n6. All labor and material required to take care of basement drainage of surface water.\n\n7. Sanding of all finish floors, preparatory for the varnish in Teacherage and oil in School area.\n\n8. Supply and erect partitions in basement of school area for proposed sanitary facilities (Toilets and basins) Three each for boys and girls.\n\n9. To co-ordinate the work of all sub-trades to satisfactory completion of project and to leave building and site in clean and proper condition for delivery and acceptance by the agent for the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\n10. We are not to supply\u2014 Any labor or transportation for the sub-trades.\n\n11. The Northwest Construction Ltd to pay all Compensation, Holiday Credits, Unemployment Insurance, Provincial Sales tax on Material supplied by the Northwest Construction Ltd., as required by Dominion and Provincial Statutes.\n\nThe Tendered price for the above work would then be $11,635.00 (Eleven Thousand six hundred and Thirty five Dollars)\n\n(This above amount is for all work, including full height concrete wall.)\nShould the Department want the wall height lowered to 6\" above earth grade there would be a saving of $410.00 (Four Hundred and Ten Dollars) on the above quoted tender price, which in turn would reduce the overall amount to $11,225.00 (Eleven Thousand, two hundred and twenty five dollars).\n\nWe request that progress payments be made upon approval of the Department's agent and that upon delivery and acceptance of building that final payment be made within thirty days.\n\nRespectfully submitted for your consideration and approval this 4th day of October 1948.\n\nNORTHWEST CONSTRUCTION LTD.\n\n[Signature]\nNeil G.

They are minimum rates only and nothing herein is intended to constitute a contract between employers and employees. Rates and subminimum rates from the same source may be agreed upon by agreement between employers and employees in the district or by change in prevailing rates.\n\nWhere, by provincial legislation, or by agreement or current practice, the working hours of any class of workers are less than 44 per week, such lesser hours shall not be exceeded on this work, except in cases of emergency as may be approved by the Minister of Labour and then only subject to the payment of overtime rates as specified by the Minister of Labour.\n\nA. I. (See next page)\n\nIndian Affairs, RG 10, Volume 6403, File 831-5, part 5\n(2) Where there are special circumstances which in the judgment of the Minister of Labour make it expedient that he should do so, he may decide what are the current or fair and reasonable rates of wages for overtime, and what is the proper classification of any work for the purpose of wages and hours. Immediately upon receipt of notice of any decision of the Minister of Labour hereunder the Contractor shall adjust the wages and hours and classification of work so as to give effect to such decision.

In case the Contractor shall fail so to do, or fail at any time to pay to any employee or employees for any services performed or any hours or late wages due under the terms set forth in the schedule so fixed thereto by the Minister of Labour hereunder regarding overtime and classification, the Minister of Labour may authorize and direct the Minister to pay any such wages at the rates so fixed and to deduct the amount thereof from any moneys owing by the Government to the Contractor or any such employee or employees, and such moneys so held by the Contractor or the Government be deemed and taken to be payment to the Contractor, and the Contractor shall be bound in every particular by any such authority, direction and payment as aforesaid.\n\n(3) For the protection of the workmen employed, the Contractor shall post and keep posted in a conspicuous place on the premises where the contract is being executed, occupied or frequented by the workmen, the Schedule inserted in this contract, also the preceding paragraph (2) and any decision of the Minister of Labour made thereunder.\n\n(4) The Contractor shall keep proper books and records showing the names, trades, and addresses of all workmen in his employ and the wages paid to and time worked by such workmen, and the books or documents containing such record shall be open for inspection by the Fair Wages Officers of the Government at any time it may be expedient to the Minister of Labour to have the same inspected.\n\n(5) The Contractor shall not be entitled to payment of any money which would otherwise be payable under the terms of the contract in respect of work and labour performed or the execution of any contracts hereunder until he shall have furnished the Minister in support of his claim for payment a statement attested by statutory declaration, showing: (1) the rates of wages and hours of labour of the various classes of workmen employed in the execution of the contract; (2) whether any wages in respect of the said work and labour remain in arrearance; (3) that all claims for wages in respect of work which has been duly completed with a view to the event of notice from the Minister of Labour of claims for wages, until the same are adjusted. The Contractor shall also from time to time furnish the Minister such further detailed information and evidence as the Minister may deem necessary in order to satisfy him that the conditions herein contained to secure the payment of fair wages have been complied with, and that the workmen employed as aforesaid upon the portion of the work in respect of which payment is demanded have been paid in full.\n\n(6) In the event of default being made in payment of any money owing in respect of wages of any workmen employed in the said work and if a claim therefore be made by the effect of the Minister and proof thereof satisfactory to the Minister is furnished, the said Minister may pay such claim out of the moneys at any time payable by His Majesty under said contract and the amounts so paid shall be deemed payments to the Contractor.\n\n(7) These conditions shall extend and apply to moneys payable for the use or hire of horses or teams, and the persons entitled to payments for the use or hire of horses or teams shall have the like rights in respect of moneys so owing them as if such moneys were payable to them in respect of wages.\n\n(8) With a view to the avoidance of any abuse which might arise from Subletting, the following provision shall be inserted that subletting, other than such as may be customary in the trades concerned, is prohibited unless the approval of the Minister is obtained; subcontractors shall be bound in all cases to conform to the conditions of the main contract, and the main contractor shall be held responsible for strict adherence to such contract conditions by the party's subcontractor; the contract shall not, nor shall any portion thereof be transferred without the written permission of the Minister; no portion of the work to be performed shall be done at the homes of the workmen.\n\n(9) All workmen employed upon the work herein specified in and to be executed pursuant to the said contract shall be residents of Canada, unless the Minister is of opinion that Canadian labour is not available or that other special circumstances exist which render it contrary to the public interest to enforce this provision.\n\nA.

The tender already received from the Thom Sheet Metal Works of Vancouver, British Columbia would seem to be very high. The installation of a furnace for a one-room school and teacherage for $1995.47 plus rental of a boat for transportation and freight is much more expensive than the installation of a similar unit at other one-room day schools. It may be preferable to buy the furnace and piping ourselves and then arrange for the installation by a furnace man.\n\nWe will expect to hear further from you concerning this in the near future as the general contractors will, no doubt want to have the heating unit installed shortly after they begin work on the building itself.\n\nBernard J.

Anfield has submitted the attached voucher No. 490 covering Progress Payment No. 1 in favour of Smith and Elkins Limited in connection with the plumbing installation at the Metlakatla Indian Day School. The Company's tender does not specify that Progress Payments are to be made and the Department is not therefore obliged to make any payment until the installation is complete.\n\nI have recommended the voucher for payment and it is left to the Department whether it is passed for payment immediately or held in abeyance.\n\nI had intended writing you within the next few days with regard to the transfer of funds necessary to complete the several school buildings which were started last year and were uncompleted at March 31st but all necessary information has not yet been received. Insofar as the Metlakatla school is concerned, however, Mr. Anfield had advised that a total of $6000 will be required but I gather from his communication that this amount includes $277.76 for desks and return of the contractor's deposit amounting to $1509. Apart from these two items, $4200 should be sufficient and I would recommend that this amount be transferred from the balance of the appropriation for the Alberni classroom block.\n\nW. S.

Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B. C., Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nAttached please find requisitions for paint required for the Metlakatla Indian Day School, this Agency. Attached also please find bid from Philpott, Evitt & Co. Ltd. in the sum of $142.30 covering the supply of paint and paint brushes for this job. Purchase of this material is recommended and the Department's instructions appreciated as soon as possible as the weather has turned fine and work could proceed without delay.\n\nWith regard to labor, I have consulted three painting contractors in the city and they advise me that an estimate of labour is based on the first class painter using one gallon of paint per 8 hour day. This job will require 80 gallons of paint and at $10.00 per day, the labour cost of $800.00 is indicated. It is planned to hire two fairly competent Indian painters and to pay them $10.00 per day. An accountable advance in the sum of $800.00 is requested for this work.\n\nIn addition to this, it will be necessary to install all the new desks on 1 x 4 strips and to move the entire school and equipment in the teacherage to the new building. An accountable advance for labour in the sum of $200.00 is requested in connection with this work which involves the installation of the kitchen range and plumbing therewith.\n\nThe Department's instructions will be appreciated.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Superintendent.\nJune 21, 1942\n\nF.M. Anfield, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nRe: Painting Wetlakatla School\n\nWith reference to your letter of June 17th, I cannot believe that the cost of painting a one-room school with teacherage would run as high as $1,400 for labour and material. Your letter of August 30th, 1942, estimated the cost for labour and material at $850.00. Even this amount is considered to be high, in view of the cost of painting identical buildings elsewhere in the Province.\n\nI wish mention that we are presently painting an identical building at Redstone and although we have yet to secure an estimate on the interior painting, the cost of painting the exterior for material and labour is less than $150.00.\n\nThe cost of the Wetlakatla School is out of all proportion to the cost of identical school buildings in other parts of the Province. I would suggest that you review your requisition for materials, revise your estimate of labour and re-submit the matter.\n\nW.B.

Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B.C., Box 70,\nVancouver.\n\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nJune 25th, 1949.\n\nRe: Painting of the Metlakatla Indian Day School.\n\nYour 12-11-3 of June 21st to hand. Attached please find amended requisitions for material totalling $359.95. It is not considered necessary to obtain new bids as the unit price on this paint is shown on the bid submitted by Philpott, Evitt & Co. Ltd., this city.\n\nA revision of labour costs has been made and an accountable advance for $500.00 is requested. If it is found that further funds will be required, they will be requisitioned in due course. An additional amount of $100.00 is requested by accountable advance for the labour costs of moving the present school equipment, installing new desks, etc.\n\nAttached please find a bid on painting this school by H. C. McVety, a fully experienced contract painter who has the contract for painting the Cellulose Corporation buildings at Port Edward. He is a first class workman. He was taken to Metlakatla and measured this building up himself. His bid is entirely independent of mine submitted on June 17th. It is noted that his material cost is $684.50 compared to mine of $442.30. His labour cost is about the same. It should be said, however, that he planned to use a painting machine throughout, whereas my bid was for all hand brush work. It should be stated that my bids were based on a two coat job throughout using first class paint which is the only kind that will stand up to the incessant rain fall of this north country.\n\nIn line with your request, I have cut this estimate to the minimum and would ask that immediate action be taken to issue purchase orders and forward accountable advances for we will lose what few days of fine weather we may yet have this summer. It would not have been possible to commence painting yet in any case as it has rained incessantly since the contractors turned the building over to us.\nIn connection with McVety's bid, I should say that he informed me that there would be an additional amount allowed if we were unable to transport this painting machine to Metlakatla on the \"Naskeena\". This machine weighs about 1600 lbs. and I would not allow it to be loaded on the boat.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Superintendent.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Metlakatla Indian Day School\n\nYour file 831-5 (E.1)\n\nI am enclosing Supt. Anfield's letter of June 17th and subsequent exchange of correspondence with regard to cost of painting the above-mentioned school building. You will note that this office took the view that Mr. Anfield's estimate for material and labour was exorbitant and that in his recent letter of June 25th he states that he has cut his estimate to the bare minimum. Although we still feel that his estimate is out of line, it is not seen how we can pursue the matter further without delaying the project unnecessarily and possibly missing weather suitable for painting.\n\nMr. Anfield's estimate for labour is $500 for painting plus an additional $100 for moving the school equipment, installing desks, etc., and approximately $360 for paint. I would recommend that an accountable advance of $600 be forwarded to Mr. Anfield and that this office be authorized to place an order for the paint required.\n\nS.

A careful check of the plans would indicate that the heat load of this building will be in the neighbourhood of 130,000 B.T.U. The furnace quoted has a B.T.U. rating at the register of 112,455. It can be expected, however, that the teacherage will not require a full load of heat when the school is in operation and when the school is closed, the furnace should be of ample capacity to heat the teacherage.

Construction has proceeded to the extent where the heating system should be installed. We are erecting a one-room school with attached teacherage.\n\nSuperintendent Anfield has secured a tender from Shenton's Sheet Metal Works, 3rd Avenue, Prince Rupert, B.C., to supply and install a McClary furnace for an amount of $945.00.\n\nThis tender was referred to Indian Commissioner Arnell who recommends its acceptance, as the firm is stated to be reliable and the equipment which they intend to install meets our requirements.

His bid was based on acceptance of contract during the time construction was in hand, which would allow him to work with the main contractors as to roughing in. The main contract finished in June. No roughing in or cutting for outlets was done, it being impossible to direct the contractors as to location of same. Shenton will have to take a carpenter over to do all this work.\n\nYour advice will be appreciated.\n\nfca/ym\n\nF. Earl Anfield\nIndian Superintendent\nAir Mail\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Metlakatla Day School Furnace.\n\nYou will note from Superintendent Anfield's letter of August 10 attached, that Shenton Sheet Metal's Tender was based on the assumption that a carpenter would be on the job to do the necessary cutting-in for installation of the furnace and pipes and that the company will require an additional $50.00 if they do this work.\n\nThe only other competitive Tender was on the same basis and the company's request is considered to be quite reasonable. I would suggest that Shenton Sheet Metal be authorized to bill us separately for this work.\n\nW.S. Arneil\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nAugust 23rd, 1949.\n\nMr. W.S.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Metlakatla School\n\nYou will note from Supt. Anfield's letter of August 26th attached that a further advance of $200.00 will be required to prepare the new Metlakatla school building for use. The work apparently is being proceeded with. I would ask that $200.00 be forwarded to Mr. Anfield to meet the cost.\n\nWe are unable to determine from our file whether or not the amount referred to in my letter of May 21st, $4,200 will be sufficient to meet all costs in connection with this building as it would appear that some vouchers were forwarded direct to the Department.\n\nW.G. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nThe school is almost finished and will be ready for occupancy in September.\n\nWe have run out of funds and the sum of $200.00 will be further required to complete setting up of new desks, plumbing of stove and range into the new teacherage, removal of heavy cupboards from the old school and setting up in new plant. Also for the removal of all furniture and equipment from the old to the new teacherage.\n\nI am having the work rushed and have assured the men they will be paid.\n\nIt is considered that a good job has been done by the painters who have had bad weather to contend with.\n\nF.

It was unfortunate that galvanized nails were not used when repairs were made in 1936. It appears now that shingles will be continually blowing off. We have made temporary repairs pending further action in this matter.\n\nI recommend that the exposed side be reshingled. The material required is listed on the enclosed form. The approximate cost will be as follows:\n\n| Material                          | $109.20 |\n|-----------------------------------|---------|\n| Freight on shingles and nails     |         |\n| to Metlakatla                     | 12.00   |\n| Labour including shingling and    |         |\n| scaffolding                       | 100.00  |\n| Total                             | $221.20 |\n\nJG/pb\n\nEncl.\n\nJ.

Old clothes, stockings, underwear, shoes, etc., are scattered in all directions; boxes of empty food cans are piled here and there, and in the kitchen bread, lard, and other edibles are scattered and mouldy. The bathroom is filthy, toilet blocked with excreta. Upstairs, school and janitor supplies are heaped up in some rooms and scattered over the floor in others.\n\nIn the attic I found stacks of box files belonging to the Naas Agency as far back as 1895 and a quick scrutiny indicates that these should be boxed up and brought over to the office here until time permits a closer examination and retention of valuable records.\n\nThe roof of the teacherage has been shingled on one side only and a fair job done.\n\nI believe that there are sufficient kitchen utensils and supplies to meet the needs of a teacher next year. A new bed and mattress should be bought and apart from this, there is sufficient furniture in the place.\n\nThe house must be thoroughly cleaned out from the basement to the roof and the downstairs rooms should be yellowed. Estimate of the work follows:\n\n| Labour | 2 women, cleaning & scrubbing for 4 days | $40.00 |\n|--------|------------------------------------------|--------|\n|        | 1 man, velloing, 5 days @ $6.00          | 30.00  |\n|        | 1 man, packing & transporting Agency files to Prince Rupert - labour and boat hire | $10.00 |\n|        |                                         | $80.00 |\n\n| Material | 50 lbs. Vello @ 20\u00a2 | $10.00 |\n|----------|---------------------|--------|\n|          | Soap, cleansers, kalsomine brush | $10.00 |\n|          |                     | $20.00 |\n\nMinor repairs to plumbing, kitchen range, tidying up yard, repairing gate, new door in basement | $25.00 |\n\nTotal required, accountable cheque requested, school and teacherage | $150.00 |\nThe teacherage is a large building, designed and built for a very large family. Its upkeep is necessarily expensive. As it is right now, no teacher would stay in it for five minutes and if there is to be any hope at all of getting an appointment made to this school, time and money must be spent on it.\n\nIt is realized that both buildings are old and should be abandoned but in view of the possibility of a new school with attached teacherage before final enfranchisement of this Band, it will be necessary to use the present place for another year at least.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nMajor D. H. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C., Vancouver.\n\nYour 215-8-4021 of May 23rd, 1946, to hand. Mr. Affleck arrived in Prince Rupert on Sunday evening of the 26th, was unable to contact me and left the same night, for Skidegate. He met Mr. Findlay and gave him what amounted to an enlargement of the subject matter of your letter. I wired Miss Merritt offering her Port Edward senior room and received the following reply this morning:\n\n\"Not interested in Port Edward Pupils too transient and difficult stop Accept Metlakatla if house and school put in good repair and cleaned Fuel including two tons of coal for house ample supplies dishes and cooking utensils salary as now stop letter in mail - Merritt\"\n\nI went to Metlakatla and inspected both the school and the teacherage, which is located in the old Agency building.\n\nSCHOOL is in a most disgusting condition. Text books and supplies are lying all over the room, paper and rubbish on the floor and worst of all, the rats have got in and have eaten the backs and covers from scores of text books. In the spare room, coal is lying around. The school is an absolute disgrace to the Department and it is recommended that $25.00 be authorized as an expenditure for the immediate employment of women to clean the place; to buy rat traps and poison and get the place in some sort of order.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nI am enclosing Mr. Indian Agent Anfield's letter of May 30th and would bring to your attention his comments in connection with the condition of the Metlakatla Indian Day School and teacherage. Although these buildings have been unoccupied for some time it is difficult to understand why the conditions described by Mr. Anfield should have been permitted. There would appear to be no alternative however to having the necessary cleaning and repairs carried out and I would recommend that an accountable advance for $150.00 be forwarded to the Agent and that authority be granted for the purchase of a new bed and mattress for the teacherage. It is noted that the expenditures estimated by the Agent total $125.00, but it is presumed that he wishes to have the extra $25.00 available to take care of any unforeseen costs.\n\nFor D. M.

MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 23rd instant, the Department approves an expenditure of $212.50 for purchasing a kitchen range and coal heater for the Metlakatla School.\n\nIt is noted that you will endeavour to secure the items mentioned at a lower price if possible.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Anfield's letter of the 17th instant requesting authority to expend $218.50 for the purchase of a kitchen range and coal heater for the Indian Bay School teacherage at Metlakatla.\n\nThe demands for expenditures in this Agency have been extremely heavy and it is unfortunate that these requirements could not have been anticipated, however there appears to be no alternative but to recommend approval of the application. If this can be authorized I will endeavour to secure the equipment at lower cost than that estimated by the Agent although these articles are in very short supply at the present time.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl.\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C., Vancouver.\n\nRe: Metlakatla School Teacherage.\n\nIt will be necessary to make immediate purchase of a kitchen range and a coal heater for the teacherage at Metlakatla. A suitable range can be purchased for $140.00 and a coal burning heater for $72.50 (including freight, delivery and installation at Metlakatla), and authority is requested to make these purchases forthwith.\n\nFrom the date of Miss Merrett's arrival as teacher of this Day School, she has complained about the kitchen range. I have been over three times myself and checked this equipment and have engaged men to overhaul it and all pipes appertaining thereto, as well as the chimney. It is still unusable except under extremely smokey conditions. The stove is 25 years old and was in the teacherage prior to the advent of Mr. T. A. Bryant as teacher. The ovens are burned through and it is impossible to get any draft. The air vents are broken on both sides of the oven and the bottom flues are rusted through. In addition to this, it has a huge fire box and in order to get any heat at all, the teacher is burning in excess of 100 lbs. of coal per week.\n\nIt was my opinion for a while that the teacher was exaggerating the condition of things and following her repeated complaints and a note received last week that unless something was done about it she would have to leave, I spent the whole of Sunday at Metlakatla trying to get this range in working condition but without results.\n\nThe Department will save one-half the cost of the new range in reduced fuel consumption. Much as it is regretted to request these payments at this time, I have no recourse but to inform the Department that this stove must be replaced.\nat once if the school is to continue this winter. The kitchen ceilings are thick with soot due to the burned-out flues in the stove, and a teacher should not be asked to live under such conditions.\n\nWhilst at this teacherage, I made a careful examination of the furnace, which has not been used for at least five years. It is beyond repair and the heating of this huge house will have to be done by the kitchen range and another coal heater located in the dining room. There is a small coal heater there now but the entire base of it has burned out - in its place there is a sheet of tin which prevents any draft from operating and as a result the stove is useless.\n\nFor your information, this teacherage, formerly the Agency, is a huge building, four storeys high, with at least twelve rooms and a basement.\n\nIf the teacher is going to be comfortable this winter, a proper heating stove will have to be installed on the ground floor as the furnace is absolutely unusable.\n\nThe expenditures are recommended and it is requested that the matter be placed before the Department by airmail.\n\nF.

Miss Merritt was suffering from rheumatism as a result of sleeping in a damp bedroom and rather than have her leave forthwith I procured a small studio couch for her and placed it in the dining room where we have an oil heater which can be kept going 24 hours a day.\n\nThe purchase of this studio couch is recommended and vouchers covering same are attached herewith. I have delayed sending these in before as I wished Inspector Davey to see the conditions under which this teacher has had to live.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\n\nCopy for the information of the Dept.\nFebruary 25, 1947.\n\nP. L. Anfield, Esq., Indian Agent, Prince Rupert.\n\nI have your letter of February 15th, in connection with the condition of the Metlakatla teacherage, and your Voucher No. 137 referred to therein. The voucher is being forwarded to the Department and recommended for payment, but in future, I would ask that you secure authority from this office before incurring any such expenditures unless, of course, the circumstances are such that immediate supply is an imperative necessity.\n\nWith regard to the condition of the teacherage, and in particular the roof, it is noted from our files, that 14 squares of shingles were provided a short time ago, and although it is understood that these were to be used on one side of the roof only, it is not understood why the entire roof was not repaired at that time.\n\nIt is noted that an amount of $3800.00 was provided in your 1947-48 estimates for a one-room school with teacher quarters at Metlakatla, which amount appears to be far less than the cost of such a building at this time, unless you had in mind utilizing materials from some other building.\n\nI would appreciate receiving from you, information with respect to the building contemplated at Metlakatla, and the basis on which you arrived at the estimated cost.\n\nD.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nWe have your letter of the 4th instant enclosing a letter from Indian Superintendent Anfield with reference to the old teacher's building at the Metlakatla School.\n\nAs a general rule we have no objection to transferring old buildings for whatever purpose they can be used on a reserve, when they are no longer required for school purposes. However, as Superintendent Anfield states he has an offer of $3,000.00 for this building, we do not feel disposed at the present time to approve turning it over to a needy family of the Metlakatla Band.\n\nWe would appreciate it if you would let us have the name and address of the person from whom Mr. Anfield received the offer of $3,000.00, and also any information you may have available, so that we can submit the matter to the Salvage Officer.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nPP/ST Supt. of Indian Education\nP.O. Box 187.\n\nPrime Rupert, B.C.\nApril 27th, 1949.\n\nW.B. Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B.C., Box 76,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Old Teacher's residence - Metlakatla, File No. 12-11-3.\n\nYour 12-11-3 of April 21st having reference to the above named subject. The party bidding $3000 on the teacher's residence is Mr. George D. Ryan, presently Chief Councillor at Metlakatla. Mr. Ryan operates a general store at Metlakatla and his wife is Post-mistress. If the building were sold to them they would move the store into the old office annex of the teacherage. The Post Office is already located in a room connected to the office annex of the teacherage.\n\nThe teacherage proper is 54 feet long and 40 feet wide and consists of a basement, ground floor, first floor and attic. The attic contains two rooms, closets and shelves. The first floor contains four bedrooms, two large and two small, all plastered. A lot of this plaster is broken away on the north side of the building due to leakage through the walls. Stairways and hallways are in good condition. On the ground floor there is a kitchen, dining room, sitting room, pantry and bathroom. Plumbing is poor. The dining room living room, kitchen and pantry are all lined and ceilinged with donnecona board and are in good shape. The living room has a firelace. The kitchen is equipped with a range, hot water tank and sink. The basement is full with a half cement floor. There is an old furnace, unused and unusable. Foundations are only fair, though as a result of work done a year ago last November, sufficient new posts and timbers are in place to make it safe.\n\nOutside: The roof is in first class condition having been completely reshingled in the past four years. The outside walls are weather beaten and porous due to lack of paint.\n\nGeneral: There is no doubt that this building in any city would be worth a great deal of money. Even in Metlakatla it is a question whether it is worth more than $3000 offered. I believe, however, that the Department would be wise if it is purchased rather than let out privately to one party.\n\n(sgd) F.

You will note that George D. Ryan, an Indian residing on the reserve, is prepared to pay $5,000.00 for this building. I would appreciate it if you would advise what procedure should be adopted in handling this matter.\n\nI might add that Indian Commissioner Arneil recommends acceptance of Mr. Ryan's offer.\n\nBernard F.

However, the Branch must be prepared to declare that price secured is the best obtainable.\n\nYou might instruct Commissioner Arneil to arrange for the sale to Geo. D.

Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nNovember 4, 1931.\n\nW.E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nI have the honour to forward herewith my report on the Metlakatla Indian Day School, Nass Agency. This school was inspected on the 30th of September.\n\nIn forwarding this report, I particularly wish to draw your attention to my remarks and recommendations with regard to the establishment of a Manual Training class in this school.\n\nI am very anxious that some sort of Vocational Training be established, where possible, for the boys and girls in our Indian Day Schools. Many of the Residential Schools are now unable to accept any more pupils. In fact, during my last itinerary in the northern part of B.C. I found a number of pupils attending the Day Schools, who last year were pupils of Residential Schools. If it is the policy of the Department to have these children attend the local Indian Day Schools, in preference to more distant Residential Schools, the subject of Vocational Training is of even greater importance in the Day Schools, than it has been in the past.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGerald H. Barry.\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6404, File 831-11, part 1)\nEXTRACT from Report of G.H. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools for B.C., regarding his inspection of the METLAKATLA INDIAN DAY SCHOOL on September 30th, 1931.\n\nOriginal on File 168-3-6.\n\nVocational Training:\n\nSome Manual Training has been done out of school hours by the teacher and boys. Some of this is good. I beg to recommend that the second room mentioned above be turned into a Manual Training shop, by the provision of a heater and terra cotta pipe chimney. An extension of the electric light wire would be required. If the Department would provide two sets of tools (individual) and one set (general), two benches, and the necessary lumber, the teacher would teach this subject. The general set of tools would cost about $120 and the individual sets $10 each, the heater, pipe and wire would cost about $60, making a total of about $200.00. Manual Training would, of course, be taught out of the ordinary school hours.\nOttawa, November 20, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools for the Province of British Columbia, in forwarding his report on his inspection at the end of September last, of the Metlakatla Indian Day School, strongly recommends the establishment of a manual training class. He states that some manual training has been done out of school hours by the teacher and boys and that, if the Department will provide two sets of tools, individual, and one set, general, two benches and the necessary lumber, the teacher will teach this subject. He also states that the cost of the set will be about $120 and the individual sets about $10 each. He further recommends that a room for the purpose be fitted up as a manual training shop by the provision of a heater and terra cotta pipe chimney, at a cost of about $60, making a total expenditure of about $200 in supplying the equipment and fitting up the room. The manual training work would be taught by the teacher after the regular school hours.\n\nI have to request that you will arrange for the purchase from sources which have been indicated to you, of the above equipment and to have a room fitted up for the purpose. The Inspector states that there is an extra classroom in the school building which could be used for the purpose, and that it would be necessary to extend the electric light wire to provide light for this room. Please give this matter your early attention and have the material supplied and the room fitted up in order that this work can be commenced by the teacher at an early date.\n\nAfter the above supplies have been furnished, you should forward a voucher, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred. You should state on the voucher that the expenditure is to be paid from \"B. C. Special Appropriation.\"\n\nI shall be pleased to hear from you regarding the action taken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKensie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. E.

No covering letter from you appears to have accompanied this requisition.\n\nYou should state the necessity for the tool cupboards and for the furniture. Is the material to be used in conducting a class of the older boys in manual training, or will the teacher make the cupboards and furniture, or how will the work be carried out? Our funds are extremely limited, and unless there is urgent need for the material asked for by the teacher, we would not be prepared to authorize same. When we hear further from you, consideration will then be given as to whether the material asked for can be authorized or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. E.

This accounts for the authorized figure of $200.00 being slightly exceeded.\n\nIt will be necessary to have two cupboards made for the safe-keeping of the tools. This work can be done by the pupils, but so far no grant has been made for material for the class to work on.

It is noted that the approximate cost, including transportation, will be $17. You may also purchase the materials mentioned to be used for general work in the making of furniture, etc., at an approximate cost, including transportation, of $19. You should obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost of the above authorized material. These you should attach to a proper voucher form, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. If possible, these accounts should reach the Department before our books close at the end of the present fiscal year. It is noted that the pupils are taking great interest in the manual training work.\n\nRegarding your recommendation that Mr. Bryant, the teacher, be paid at the rate of $10 per month during the time the manual training classes are in operation, I have to say that, while the Department appreciates the services of Mr. Bryant, it is regretted there are no funds available to pay him for this service, in addition to the salary allowed him as teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

A. Bryant, a grant at the rate of $10.00 a month for five months during the academic year 1933-34 in order to remunerate him for his services in the conduct of a manual training class after school hours. This payment will, of course, be subject to a deduction of 10%. Mr. Agent Collison is being so informed and instructed to forward vouchers, when necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\nSecretary.\n\nG. H. Barry, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nVictoria, B. C.\nOttawa, September 13, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nInspector Barry, in reporting on the Metlakatla Indian Day School, states that, for approximately five months in each academic year, Mr. T. A. Bryant, the teacher, conducts a class in manual training after school hours. Mr. Barry states that the work done by this class is excellent and the Department trusts that it will continue.\n\nIt has been decided to allow Mr. Bryant remuneration for this extra work at the rate of $10.00 a month for a period not exceeding five months during the academic year 1933-34. The payment just mentioned will be subject, of course, to a deduction of 10%.\n\nYou should forward a voucher in payment of Mr. Bryant's services when you consider it timely.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF INSPECTOR G. H. BARRY,\nINSPECTOR OF INDIAN SCHOOLS, following his inspection\nof the LETLAKATLA Indian Day School, on May 28, 1933.\n\nOriginal on 168-3-6.\n\nManual Training: There are five boys taking this course after school for about five months of the year. During the summer this class does not meet, as the big boys are away. Two small sets of tools and one set for the instructor have been supplied since my last inspection. Two large benches and tool cupboards are now completed. The class is starting on individual projects, and are making drawings to scale. The work done so far is \"Excellent\". I should like to see such vocational training started in a number of our more efficient day schools. In this case I have been asked to recommend a small grant of $100.00 per annum to the instructor, who is very interested in this work. Owing to the need of money in other directions, I would recommend that Mr. Bryant be paid ten dollars PER MONTH less 10% for the actual months during which Manual Training is carried on at this school, about five a year.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6404, File 831-11, part 1)\nSir:-\n\nI beg to transmit herewith Voucher #5512 attached to which is an account received from Messrs Thompson Hardware Company, Prince Rupert for material etc. supplied for making tool cupboards in connection with the manual training classroom at the Metlakatla Indian Day school. This expenditure was authorized by the Department in letter received dated February 9th/33., # 168-3-II., and accounts for part of the material have already been forwarded to the Department for payment. By some oversight on the part of the Firm supplying the material, the enclosed account for hardware was not sent in and the omission was not noticed by this office at the time. I regret this should have happened and hope settlement of the account will be made. I might state the material was delivered and the cupboards were satisfactorily completed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. E.

These classes are being held after school hours, and is, I consider, one of the most useful undertakings being carried on this agency for the benefit of the older boys of the village.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nEC JJ\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMetlakatla Indian Day School\n\nManual Training\n\nMonthly Report - October 1934\n\nRegular classes have been held during the month and work resumed in the workroom.\n\nTwo ladders for use around the school have been constructed mainly from native wood obtained in the bush.\n\nAs the ability to build boats would be of great use to my pupils, I would like to initiate and lay out work of this type, and suggest the purchase of sufficient material to build a small row boat. The cost of the material together with some boat clamps etc. would be approximately $55.00.\n\nThe work would be carried out by the older boys whilst the younger ones were engaged on minor projects.\n\n\"T.A.Bryant\"\n\nMonthly report for November 1934.\n\nEight workshop sessions were held in addition to technical drawing lessons during the month.\n\nGood work has been turned out particularly some kitchen furniture\u2014table and ironing boards.\n\nAverage attendance 5\u00bd pupils each session.\n\nMonthly Report for December 1934.\n\nDrawings of work planned for the spring were executed and five periods of instruction were held in the work-shop during the month at which there was an average attendance of five pupils.\nOttawa, February 12, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your l-C-7942 of the 29th ultimo, enclosing voucher in favour of Mr. T. A. Bryant covering remuneration for conducting manual training classes at the Metlakatla Indian Day School during the December quarter. In this connection, I would point out that official letter of September 13th, 1935, only authorized a payment to Mr. Bryant for five months during the academic year 1933-34 and we did not receive any communication from you requesting an allowance for this purpose during the academic year 1934-35.\n\nMr. Bryant's salary rate as teacher of the Metlakatla Indian Day School is $1,050 a year. If he was allowed $50 for his services in conducting the manual training classes, it would make his total compensation for the year $1,100. The Salary Deduction Act passed at the last session of Parliament provided that, from April 1st, 1934, payment to any official could only be made at the rate of $1,000 a year if his total compensation is between $1,000 and $1,111. Mr. Bryant has been paid $100 a teaching month or at the rate of $1,000 a year since April 1st, last, and, consequently, this is the only amount which we can pay him.\n\nThis does not mean that Mr. Bryant should discontinue his manual training classes. As a matter of fact, he is being paid more this year than he received last year. This is shown by the following statement:\n\n| Item                          | Amount |\n|-------------------------------|--------|\n| Salary as teacher for 1933-34 | $1,050.00 |\n| Grant for manual training 1933-34 | $50.00 |\n| Total                         | $1,100.00 |\n| Less 10%                      | $110.00 |\n| Net amount paid               | $990.00 |\n\nWith regard to the material required for the manual training classes, you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of same. It is noted that this will cost, approximately, $65.00, and payment will be made from B. C. Special Appropriation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. E.

Bryant for remuneration in conducting manual training classes, it is regretted that it is not possible to pay the amount requested for the purpose.\n\nThe Department realizes that Mr. Bryant is doing good work and is entitled to extra remuneration for conducting the manual training classes, but, as pointed out in official letter of February 12th, last, present regulations will not permit our making him any payment for this service.\n\nA bill passed at the present Session of Parliament provides that there will be no deduction from any person whose total remuneration does not exceed $1,200. Under these circumstances, it will be possible to allow Mr. Bryant payment for his services in conducting the manual training classes next winter. You should apply early in the Fall for the necessary authority.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 12th ult., respecting payment of the instructor of the manual training class at Metlakatla, I would state that I was under the impression the Department's letter dated September 13th, 1934 authorized payment of salary during the continuation of the class, especially as the letter stated it was hoped the work would continue.\n\nAs stated in previous reports, the class is doing excellent work and bringing results, and I would strongly recommend that the class be continued and the teacher's salary provided for during the five months in each academic year.\n\nVo.6672 is enclosed covering remuneration for January and February, payment of which is recommended.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI beg to refer to Department's letter of April 15th, file 168-3-11, respecting remuneration for Mr. T.A.

The native woods are being used. The teacher would give instruction in boat building, that is in the building of small row boats, if he had some more equipment. He is asking for a small engine and band saw. He requires this if he is to make proper use of the native woods. I understand that this matter is the subject of correspondence between the Indian Agent and the Department of Indian Affairs. I should be glad to see the Vocational Training, which in the case of the boys includes Manual Training, encouraged in the Indian Day Schools.\nOttawa, September 20, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your I-H-8619 of the 13th instant, I beg to say that the Department will allow Mr. T.

(RG 10, Volume 6404, File 831-11, part 1)\nOttawa, August 12, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the third instant and to thank you very heartily for the information contained therein. I may state that a number of requests have reached the Department in recent months from Indian day school teachers in British Columbia, for supplies of material suitable for the promotion of manual training at their schools.\n\nIn my reply I have intimated to the teachers that they should communicate with the Indian agent in each case, either personally or by letter, and have him forward their requests with his recommendations to the Department. I feel that we should have the advice and close cooperation of our agents in the promotion of this work. A great many of the smaller schools are not suitable for vocational instruction except in a very limited sense.\n\nThis opinion is, I feel, in conformity with the views expressed in your letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nW. B. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\nSir:\n\nWith regard to the recommendations made by Inspector Barry that native basketry and domestic science should be taught in some of the day schools in this agency, particularly with regard to Gwinsha, Metlakatla and Gitlakdamix schools, and your request that I should give an opinion on same, I would state that where the teacher is capable and willing to carry on a domestic science class for sewing, knitting etc. it should be encouraged.\n\nIn some of the day schools in the agency instruction along these lines is already being given. Many of the teachers however, have had no training or liking for these subjects and would naturally not care to take them up. Also where male teachers are in charge of schools it would be a waste of money to employ Indian women as teachers. The Indians now are past the stage when they are satisfied with second grade tuition and unless these subjects can be taught well, no interest will be taken in them and it will merely be an unwarranted expense.\n\nWith regard to the question of instruction in native basketry, mats etc. it must not be forgotten that many of the Indians, particularly the younger generation, in their desire to imitate white people and their ways\u2014rightly or wrongly\u2014consider that they have outgrown instruction in such arts as were carried on in past generations of their people.\n\nWhilst this idea is of course ridiculous, the fact remains and unless it is made attractive to the children, classes of this kind will be of no lasting value. Whilst such instruction is successfully given in residential schools where the pupils are obliged to attend classes, the case with day schools is somewhat different.\nand unless the children take kindly to it, it will not be successful. This is my candid opinion but I consider where proper instruction can be given an experiment should be made and I would recommend that the Department make available, a sum of not less than $50.00 for each school for instruction in native arts, to be used at the discretion of the agent in any school where such work can be tested as it will be impossible to lay down a hard and fast rule owing to the fact that conditions vary at the different schools.\n\nWith regard to domestic science classes, where these are held I would suggest that the teacher be required to send in proper requisitions to the department for the needed material, and where pupils are more advanced a sewing machine will be necessary.\n\nI have not dwelt on the subject of manual training for boys. With the exception of Mr. T.A. Bryant of the Metlakatla Day School; Mr. John Hayhurst, assistant at the Greenville school is the only man fitted to conduct such a class. At the latter school however, there is no accommodation, there being only one classroom.\n\nNaturally the whole question of giving extra tuition in day schools along the lines mentioned is very involved, each school differing from another. We have no facilities as provided in the residential schools where firstclass training can be imparted and materials easily obtained.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nWEC/JJ\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, June 2, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reporting regarding his inspection of the Metlakatla Day School on May 7th, Inspector Barry writes:\n\n\"I am also anxious to see some Arts and Crafts work started in this school. Baskets could be made with some success if there was an Indian woman engaged for one afternoon a week who knew how to teach such work.\n\n\"I understand that Mrs. Alfred Auckland, who is a woman of over 50 years of age, could teach basket making and such other native work as might be necessary at this time.\n\n\"It is important that some form of Handwork of use to the Indians be taught in the Day Schools, and I would recommend that a sum of not more than one hundred dollars be authorized as payment for the above mentioned teaching at the rate of five dollars per month. Some material will be very necessary if this type of work is to be carried out in the school. I should like to see some sewing done also, and the children (Girls) should be taught to knit and crochet, while the Boys are working at Manual Training.\"\n\nI would appreciate having your views on Mr. Barry's suggestion, and, if you approve, you should state definitely how you consider the work could be best handled.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nW.

I may also say that when ever I am at Nanaimo I always spend considerable of my time in the same cause... I have written to Mr O'Connell on the subject and will reply further on the question when I hear from him.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nJ. D.

Ditchburn, Inspector of Indian Agencies in Southwestern British Columbia on the Indian Schools in Southwestern British Columbia, for the year ended March, 1911.\n\nNanaimo Day school (Methodist)\n\nThe Chief of the Nanaimo Band reported to me that there were 10 children on the Nanaimo River reserve whose parents wish them to attend school, but it is too far to the Indian school at Nanaimo, being about six miles by road. They all speak good English, and their parents are desirous of their attending the public school which is close by. The Department should make arrangements with the Superintendent of Education for British Columbia for the entrance of these children into the public school.\nOttawa, August 29th., 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Inspector Ditchburn in his annual report on the schools in his Inspectorate states that the Chief of the Nanaimo Band reported that there were 10 children on the Nanaimo River Reserve whose parents wished them to attend them but it is too far to the Indian School being about six miles by the road. There is a public school close by and they wish the Department to make arrangements for their attendance at this school. The Department is willing to pay a reasonable fee for the education of the Indian children at this white school if the Trustees are willing that they should attend and I would ask you to at once take up this matter with them and ascertain upon what terms they would be willing to admit them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. R. Robertson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan's Station, B.C.\nNanaimo, B. C.\n\nJune 15, 1911.\n\nW. R. Robertson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B. C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI respectfully acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 14th, inst No. 448-2. And in reply may state in regard to the non attendance of children at school Nanaimo reservation, and Mr. Inspector's Green recommendation that I be given authority to round up children of school age and cause their attendance, is most surprising to me to say the least.\n\nI am constantly when in vicinity of schools giving every attention to the attendance of pupils, which can be seen by my diary from time to time, since my appointment as Dom. Constable.\n\nI may say that I have found the question of school attendance a very hard and difficult task, and there is no additional authority that Mr. Inspector Green can have conferred upon me that would bring about any perceptible result for the better.\n\nI have given a lot of attention to this matter in the face of my many other duties, when I visited the school on reservation 13th, inst., I found only two pupils in attendance which I reported accordingly in my Diary stating the almost impossible task of controlling those children at this and other particular seasons of the year, understanding their nature and general circumstances of their parents here and there fishing, digging, clams, catching crabs, others at home minding the house and younger children while the mothers are engaged.\nengaged washing scrubbing &c etc for people about the city, all of which and much more has to be contended with, and to be too rash in the governing of the same would in my opinion have a great tendency to do more harm than good.\n\nI informed the teacher Rev. W. J. Knott the other day that I would endeavor if possible and circumstances permitting me, give very close attention to conduct of the parents in causing more regular attendance of their children at school on returning again after the coming holidays which is now only a few days off.\n\nHaving the honor Sir,\n\nTo remain Yours. Obediently\n\n(Signed) Thomas O'Connell,\nPov. Constable.\nCowichan Agency\nIndian Office\nDuncans Station, B.C. Oct.24th,1911\n\nSir:-\n\nIn reply to yours of the 29th, of August last No.117008-I in reference to Indian children of the Nonsimo River Reserve attending the public school there. I have the honor to state I am in receipt of a letter dated the 13th, inst., from Mr. W. Raines Secretary of the North Cedar School Board, the following is an excerpt \"I beg to state that the teacher has more children than she can attend to at present and we expect more to attend this next week so we could not think of the Indians going there.\"\n\nI may also remark that if the parents were at all anxious to have their children educated, they could do so with very little inconvenience to themselves, by sending them regularly during the winter months to the school on the town reserve where they generally live at that time. Mr. W. J. Knott makes the following remark in a letter dated the 23rd ultimo. \"I have no idea they will ever walk about one mile and a half to school up there when they would not attend my school so near by\". I regret that arrangements could not be made for their attendance at the white school, but I agree with Mr. Knott, and am sure that they would not attend with any degree of regularity.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAct. Deputy & Secretary of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nSir:\n\nHaving further reference to mine of the 14th, of last June No.451-Z in regard to attendance at the Nandmo Indian Day School.\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith copy of a letter dated June 15th, last from Mr. Thomas O'Connell, Dominion Constable. It will be seen that everything is being done to keep the children in attendance at school.\n\nMr. W. J. Knott, the teacher takes a great interest in the work. I do not think that Mr. O'Connell requires any further authority than he holds as present to force an attendance of the children at school.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ. D. Mclean, Sec.,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, November 9, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo in further reference to the attendance of Indian children from the Nanaimo River Reserve at the public school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department regrets that arrangements cannot be made for the attendance of these children at the white school, but your remarks stating that there is no reason why they should not attend their own school during the winter months are noted. It appears to the Department that the only course in this case is to remove these children from the custody of their parents and place them in some of the residential schools. You will be good enough to advise the parents that if these children are not sent to school with reasonable regularity when conditions are favourable the Department will have to consider taking the action above referred to. Kindly report at a later date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. B. Robertson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan's Station, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6404, File 832-1, part 1)\nExtract from Report of Inspector A.E. Green on the Nassimo Indian Day School, December 29, 1911. Original on File 117008-6.\n\nGENERAL REMARKS:\n\nThe teacher is discouraged at the irregular attendance and informed me he is thinking of giving up the work in the summer holidays unless the attendance improves. With only four or five present he says he feels as though he is throwing the time away. Pupils should be required to attend when living near a school.\n\n(Sgd.) A.E. Green,\nInspector\nOttawa, January 27, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to official letter of November 9th last, in reference to the attendance at the Nanaimo Indian Day School and I have to ask you to report on this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. H. Robertson, M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan's Station, B.C.\nReport of Inspector Ditchburn for the Month of January, 1912.\n\nSouthwestern Inspectorate, B.C.\n\nHerewith I submit my report of inspections made during the month of January, 1912:\n\nThe Nanaimo Day School was visited on the 25th, but I only found two children in attendance. This is generally the best day school in this Agency, and the Rev. W. J. Knott is a good teacher and takes a great interest in his work. The trouble here is that the parents will not make their children attend the school. There are over twenty children of school age on this reserve who should attend the school fairly regularly, and Section 7 of the Regulations Relating to Indian Education should be put in force. There would be no use in telling the parents that the children will be put in a boarding school, for until more schools of this kind are provided, there would be no room for them, every boarding or Industrial school being at present filled to its capacity. As Constable O'Connell visits this reserve very often, he should also be empowered to act as Truant Officer. I think if a few of the parents were prosecuted it would have a good effect. I went all over the reserve and saw the parents of absentee pupils, and informed them that unless they saw that their children went to school regularly that they would be fined. I have since been informed that there was a very good attendance the next day.\n\nSgd. W. E. Ditchburn,\nInspector.\nSir:\n\nHaving regard to your letters of the 9th, November last and of the 27th, ultimo, No. II7008/I in reference to attendance of pupils at the Nanaimo Indian day school. I have the honor to report as follows; On receipt of letter dated the 9th, of last November I at once advised the parents of the contents of your letter, and I visited the Nanaimo Reserve on the 25th and 26th, ultimo, in company with Mr. Inspector Bitchburn, there were only two pupils in attendance at the school, we called on all the parents at home, and told them if they did not send their children to school the regulations of the Department would be enforced, the next day there were seven pupils at school. I may say that when the parents are home, they generally send the children off to school and a few of them play truant and go into the City to play with white children who are not forced to attend school. The chief cause for the non attendance is the parents leave the reserve to dig clams and fish when they are absent for about a week at a time and have to take the children with them.\n\nThe parents of the children at Nanaimo River did not move to the town reserve this winter as they were employed at\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nsinking the shaft for the Western Fuel Co. at that point.\n\nIn regard to sending the children to a residential school, there is not a vacancy in any school in this vicinity all are carrying more than their grant calls for.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 23, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant in reference to the non-attendance of Indian children at the Nanaimo Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department must insist upon the parents sending their children regularly to school while they are on the reserve. It will be necessary to put into force clause 7 of the Regulations and you will be good enough to govern yourself accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. R. Robertson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncans Station, B.C.\nNanaimo, Oct. 29, 1912.\n\nJ. R. Robertson, Esq.,\nDuncan, B. C.\n\nMy dear Sir:\n\nYou've of a few days since, received in reference to the appointment of Miss Rogers to the Day School here, I may say. The appointment was made by Rev. T. Perrier, who no doubt has informed the Department in reference to the matter.\n\nMy throat has been troubling me for some time. Dr. says it is goiter, and in order to treat it properly I must have more rest. Miss Rogers is sent with the approval of the General Mission Board of the Meth. Church to relieve me, I understand it is only for a time.\n\nThe children seem to be very fond of her and doubtless she will do good work. The average attendance last week was over 19. I hope it will be in the interest of the Indian children. It was impossible for me to continue in the school room and take necessary treatment.\n\nYours most sincerely\n\n(Signed) W. J. Knott.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith copy of a letter dated the 29th ultimo from Mr. W. J. Knott, teacher of the Indian day school at Nanaimo, informing me that owing to throat trouble he required a rest and that Miss Rogers had been sent by the General Mission Board of the Methodist church to relieve him.\n\nI will recommend that the Board's action be approved of.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.

I have two years' High School Standing and matriculation standing in English History, Greek & Mathematics.\n\n2. I have had six years experience in teaching Indian Day Schools in Skidgate and Hartley Bay.\n\n3.

Maclean Esq.,\nPost Deputy and Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nAlta.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6404, File 832-1, part 1)\nOttawa, September 28, 1916.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from Mr. Agent Robertson, who forwards a letter from the Rev. P. R. Kelly, who is in charge of the Methodist Mission at Nanaimo, in which he states that he is now teaching the Indian school there.\n\nThis is the first intimation the Department has received of Mr. Kelly having been placed in charge of this school and, as he is acting in the dual capacity of teacher and missionary, the Department does not consider that it should be called upon to pay the full amount of the salary provided for this school. When the sum of $600.00 was set apart for the teacher's salary it was not contemplated that the teacher should be engaged in missionary work. The Department would like to know what arrangements were made with Mr. Kelly in regard to salary.\n\nMr. Robertson is being informed that, under the circumstances, the Department will raise no objection to Mr. Kelly's being employed as teacher, but I would again call your attention to the fact that no appointments should be made without consulting the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools, Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nBrandon, Man.\nOttawa, September 28, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant enclosing a communication from Mr. F. R. Kelly of Nanaimo in which he informs the Department that he is the Methodist Missionary in charge of the mission there and will also assume the duties of the day school teacher.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this is the first intimation the Department has received of Mr. Kelly having been placed in charge of this school and the Rev. Mr. Perrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian schools, is being written to in regard to the matter. Under the circumstances the Department will raise no objection to Mr. Kelly being employed as teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. R. Robertson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncans Station, B.C.\nI have just returned from Nanaimo, at which place I was making a cash distribution among the Indians of their interest and royalty monies and while there I met the Rev. P. R. Kelly, the missionary and school teacher, who has been doing such excellent work at the day school on the Nanaimo Indian Reserve. Mr. Kelly informed me that he receives his salary direct from the Methodist Church of Canada, the Department's cheque of $50.00 per month being paid direct to that body. He has, however, been in receipt of the bonus cheques which have been paid to him through Mr. Indian Agent Robertson. Upon the Methodist Church learning that Mr. Kelly was in receipt of the bonus to meet the high cost of living they deducted that amount from his salary and he naturally feels that he is not being treated fairly in this matter. I said that I would write to you as I felt sure that you had no knowledge that such was the case and in order that you might look into the question. It certainly appears to me that as these bonuses have been paid to meet the increased cost of living during the period of reconstruction the action of the officials of the Methodist Church in deducting the amount of bonus from Mr. Kelley's salary are destroying the principle upon which the decision to pay them was arrived at.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies.\nAugust 21, 1919.\n\nDear Mr. Arnup -\n\nThe Chief Inspector of Indian Agencies has just written informing me that the bonus paid to Rev. Mr. Kelly, as teacher of the Nanaimo Indian day school, was deducted by the church authorities from the amount of his salary. The salary of $600.00 as well as the bonus are voted by Parliament for this school and the funds should not be diverted in any other direction. Mr. Kelly is entitled to his salary as paid by the Department through the church, and also to the bonus which was paid direct through the Indian Agent. I presume that the full amount of the bonus already paid, namely $187.50, was deducted; if so, I shall be pleased to know that a cheque for this amount has been forwarded to Mr. Kelly.\n\nI am informing our Inspector that this action is being taken.\n\nThis is the only instance of the kind that has been brought to my attention, but as the teachers of Methodist schools are paid through your office and all received the bonus there may be other cases where deductions were made; if so, kindly let me have a list with names and amounts in each case, together with your assurance that the same action as requested in Mr. Kelly's case has been taken.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nRev. Jo H. Arnup, B.A.,\nAssistant Secretary of the Foreign Department of the Methodist Church,\nWesley Building,\n290 Queen St.,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6404, File 832-1, part 1)\nAugust 21st, 1919.\n\nDear Mr. Ditchburn -\n\nI have your letter of the 14th inst., regarding the payment of salary to Rev. Mr. Kelly. I have today written to Rev. Mr. Arnup requesting him to forward to Mr. Kelly a cheque for the full amount of the deduction made which I presume was $187.50.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. H. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nVictoria, B.C.\nAugust 22nd, 1919.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYours of August 21st is to hand. You report information from the Chief Inspector of Indian Agencies to the effect that \"the bonus paid to Rev. Mr. Kelly as teacher of the Nanaimo Indian day school was deducted by the church authorities from the amount of his salary.\" Permit me to say that your information is entirely incorrect. The books of the Missionary Society show $600 received from Ottawa on account of the Nanaimo school. The same amount was paid Rev. Mr. Kelly on that account. The bonus, as your Department knows, was not paid through this office, and I did not even know the amount until receipt of your letter today.\n\nThe same reply must be made to the latter portion of your letter, where inquiry is made regarding other amounts withheld from salary of teachers on account of the bonus granted; in no case was the bonus paid through our office; and in every case the full amount received on account of salary was paid. Where less than the full annual amount was received, because of shortage in the number of days on which the school was open, the discrepancy was made up by the Missionary Society. A total of $600 was voted to meet these items, which are anticipated and regularly provided for in the appropriations of the Missionary Society.\n\nOf course, Mr. Kelly's salary as teacher is only a part of his income from the Missionary Society. In addition to an allowance for his pastoral work at Nanaimo, he received certain amounts during the year for supervision of the mission work at Cape Mudge. I am having all these accounts investigated in order to ascertain whether any confusion or error in respect of Mr. Kelly's distinctively missionary relations to the Society may have given rise to the mistaken impression conveyed by your letter.\n\nMeanwhile, I should greatly have appreciated an enquiry on the part of the Department as to the handling of\nsalary and bonus granted to Mr. Kelly and other teachers before the receipt of such a conclusive letter as yours of yesterday.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nJE/JM.\nSeptember 2nd, 1919.\n\nDear Mr. Arnup,\n\nI have your letter of the 28th August in reply to mine of the 25th regarding the reduction alleged to have been made from the salary of Mr. Kelly of the Nanaimo Indian day school.\n\nFor your information I am sending a copy of the Chief Inspector's letter. You will note how positive Mr. Kelly was in his statement to that official, and it was on the strength of this letter that I wrote you the letter above referred to.\n\nI shall be very pleased to know that Mr. Kelly has received his full amount of salary and bonus as teacher so that I may advise Mr. Ditchburn.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. J. H. Arnup, B. C.,\nAssistant Secretary,\nForeign Department of the\nMethodist Church,\nWesley Building,\n299 Queen Street,\nToronto, Ont.\nToronto, Sept. 8, 1919.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to acknowledge your further letter in reference to salary of Peter Kelly, missionary-teacher at Nanaimo, and also the enclosed copy of the letter on the same matter from your chief inspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nHaving gone carefully into this whole matter I am glad to be able to assure you that instead of having his salary reduced, Mr. Kelly received from the Missionary Society $50 more for the same work than during the previous year, entirely exclusive of the regular government grant and war bonus previously referred to. Examination of our books shows that other missionary-teachers in British Columbia in no case received less out of missionary funds than during the previous year. With only one or two exceptions increases were granted, ranging up to $150.\n\nIn further reference to Mr. Kelly's case, it would appear that his complaint to your inspector arose out of a misunderstanding between him and the Missionary Society regarding his remuneration for work which has no direct relationship to the Indian Department. As mentioned in my former letter to you, Mr. Kelly was placed during the past year in direct charge of pastoral work at Nanaimo and in addition had supervision of the mission at Wape Mudge, where no man had been stationed for the year. In the administration of a new scale of salaries adopted by the General Conference of the Methodist Church in October last, there appears to have been some clerical error or confusion by reason of which Mr. Kelly received less than the amount to which he believed himself to be entitled as an ordained minister of the Methodist Church. I am now going into this matter both at our office and by correspondence with the chairman of Nanaimo District and anticipate no difficulty in reaching a satisfactory adjustment when\n\nDuncan C.

Miss Jessup was, therefore, paid $12.50 for the month of September; $37.50 for the December quarter and $37.50 for the March quarter.\n\nDuring the fiscal year 1921-22, which began April 1, 1921, bonus to Indian school teachers is being paid at the rate of $15.00 for each teaching month. She was, therefore, allowed $45.00 bonus for the June quarter and she will be allowed $45.00 for the month of September this year. For the December and March quarters next, if she continues in this school, she will be allowed $45.00 bonus for each of these quarters.\n\nThe Indian Day School Regulations referring to the payment of broken periods, do not apply to payment of bonus.

A. R. Lett, the principal of St. George's Industrial School. He will take up his duties as teacher and disciplinarian Aug. the 1st.\n\nWeekly I shall forward a copy of your letter to him and if he prefers the Nanaimo school to the school at Lytton, the change can be made the 1st of Sept when the Day Schools open. In the meantime he is at work, getting acquainted with Indian children.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT.P.H. Cairns\n\nInspector of Indian Schools.\nExtract from Inspector Barry's Report on his visit to the NANAIMO INDIAN DAY SCHOOL on March 19th, 1936. - Original on File 152-11-6.\n\nRemarks relative to methods employed by teachers:\n\nMiss Klippert was trained in the Toronto Normal School, and holds an Ontario Second Class Certificate. She has attended four Provincial Summer Schools in Victoria, and has as a result received certificates in Primary Work, Leather Work, Pottery, etc.\n\nShe taught for some six years in Ontario, and for some twenty-five years in British Columbia. She has been here for a large number of years.\n\nThe teacher is making every effort to put into practice some of the methods shown to her when I inspected her school. Miss Klippert is not as young as many of our teachers and for that reason is not able to get through as much work in the day as younger and more modern teachers could do. She is however working hard to get the children on in their work. While I am satisfied that the children are making progress, I wish the Department to know that Miss Klippert is probably in the last five years of her teaching career, as she is not modern enough in methods to be retained after the age of 60 years.\n\nI have taught several lessons for her during the present inspection. These were aimed to interest in particular her older pupils in their work. It is of course just here with the Grade 6, 7 and 8 children that she appears at her worst as a teacher, for they need more time and definite teaching than she can give to them, the greater part of a large attendance being in the Primary and Junior Grades.\n\nExtract from Inspector Barry's Letter, dated March 19, 1936, addressed to Assistant Commissioner Perry, enclosing above report. - Original on File 152-11-6.\n\nI have the honour to forward herewith my report on the Nanaimo Indian Day School, Cowichan Agency, which I inspected today, March 19th, while passing through Nanaimo on my way to Port Alberni.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Graham was not of course present at this inspection.\n\nThere is nothing of a confidential nature to report with regard to this school. The general standing is not quite as good as it was some three months ago mainly because the teacher, Miss Klippert, spends too much time with the Primary Grade and not enough with the Senior Grades. As there are a large number in the school and Miss Klippert is not as young as she used to be, I do not know of any way to remedy conditions at the present time. I do not believe that Miss Klippert should be permitted to teach here after she reaches the age of sixty years. I have reported her present age as 56 in accordance with information she gave me some years ago.\n\nThough I am not asking that any change should be made here at the present time, I have every reason to think that a much younger and well trained teacher, with three or four years experience, would be able to make a very great improvement in the standing of the Intermediates and Senior Grades. I would just ask the Department to keep Miss Klippert's age in view when discussing the work at this school with officials of the United Church of Canada.\nOttawa, Oct. 3, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Department approves of the appointment of Miss B. D. Elsop as teacher of the Nanaimo Indian Day School. The salary allowed her will be at the rate of $1000 for the 10 teaching months, supplemented by the bonus provided by law. The local Indian agent and Mr. Inspector Cairns have been informed accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent,\nMethodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nExtract from report of Inspector Cairns on the Tamanico Day School, dated November 13th, 1925.\n\nOriginal on file 152-11-6.\n\n\".......Miss Ellipert finds the work of this school very heavy. She has an enrolment of 46 and reports to be that she finds it impossible to do the work as it should be done.\n\n\"In previous reports I have recommended that an additional teacher be engaged for the winter months. I notice that there are twenty-eight pupils in the first and second grades combined. I would recommend that some scheme be worked out that would relieve the situation. There is no empty building on the Reserve. It would therefore, be necessary to erect a classroom that would accommodate these junior pupils.\"\nOttawa, Oct. 3, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that Rev. T. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, has nominated Miss E. S. Klippert for the position of teacher of the Nanaimo Indian Day School.

We understand it is her intention to obtain a school in the city of Vancouver. I shall be pleased if you will nominate a properly qualified teacher to succeed her - duties to begin when the school re-opens on or about September first, next.

She is giving these pupils an excellent training. The juniors are taught mat weaving and paper folding. They do good manual work. I regret to say that Miss Ozburn has informed me that she intends to send in her resignation June 1st. She is resigning with the intention of getting a school in the city of Vancouver.\n\nR. H.

Peter R. Kelly asked me if I was going to recommend an Assistant. He thought there was too much work for one teacher. I pointed out to him that there was no Fourth Reader class and the work could be done very well by one teacher.\n\nSince coming back to the office I wrote the teacher suggesting that she let the Junior pupils out early both A.M. and P.M. She could then give closer attention to the Second and Third Reader classes. I do not think the attendance would justify an additional teacher at present.\nOttawa, August 12, 1922.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to refer to official letter of the 25th ultimo, regarding the appointment of Mr. Dunbar H. McLean as Teacher of the Nanaimo Indian Day School.\n\nWe are now advised by Mr. Inspector Cairns that Mr. McLean has accepted the position of Junior Teacher and House-master at the Lytton Industrial School. We are approving of his appointment at Lytton, and it will, therefore, be necessary to secure the services of a teacher for the Nanaimo School.\n\nWe have informed Mr. Inspector Cairns that Mr. McLean's appointment at Lytton is approved and that it might be advisable for him to endeavour to obtain the services of a qualified teacher for Nanaimo. We have requested him to communicate with you, giving full particulars regarding the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher whom he may secure.\n\nI presume this will be satisfactory to you. If not, you yourself can arrange for the appointment of a suitable teacher and inform Mr. Cairns and the Department as to the name, etc., of the teacher whom you appoint.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

We have received a communication from him, stating that he has accepted this position and that he began duties on the first of August. We are writing the principal of the Lytton School, approving of his appointment.\n\nWe will take up with Rev. T. Ferrier the question of obtaining the services of a teacher for Nanaimo. It might be advisable for you to endeavour to secure the services of a qualified teacher and inform Mr. Ferrier of the name, qualifications and experience of the person whom you are able to obtain.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nFor Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nR. H. Cairns, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nRoom 45, Post Office Building,\nVancouver, B. C.\nOttawa, January 20, 1937.\n\nReverend Sir,-\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a recent report of our Inspector regarding the Nanaimo Indian Day School. This shows that, while fairly satisfactory work is being done, Miss Klippert has now reached an age where her services are not as efficient as would probably be secured from a younger teacher.\n\nI may add that this Indian day school is situated close to the town of Nanaimo and, recently, some of the white residents of that town have made complaints regarding the progress that is being made by the pupils. While these complaints are not serious, at the same time, I feel that, taking everything into consideration, it would probably be in the best interests of the work at this point to have a younger qualified teacher take over the duties when the school re-opens after the summer holidays.\n\nI am bringing this matter to your attention at this time in order to give you an opportunity to consider where you could place Miss Klippert. There is no doubt that she is entitled to some consideration in view of her long and devoted services.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. Geo. Dorey,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. W.,\nToronto, Ont.\nSupt. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nFor some time I have been thinking that I may have to give up my work, and the question of income is disturbing me. Not being under the provincial government, I have not the benefit of the Teachers' Superannuation Fund, and I consider that having served for nearly twenty-eight years in the Indian work I should have some recognition of my services.\n\nMy salary during the first half of these years was very small and my expenses heavy. I have not been able to save very much, and as you know the Indian work is always more or less a drain on the purse, there being so many cases needing help.\n\nI understand that all other employes in the Indian Department receive a pension, and I consider the teachers should be treated in the same manner, even if only a small allowance.\n\nMay 8, 1937\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6404, File 832-1, part 1)\nShould you give my case favorable consideration I would be deeply grateful.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nEvelyn S. Rippert\nOttawa, June 5, 1937.\n\nMadam:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo, enquiring if teachers of Indian day schools are entitled to superannuation.\n\nTeachers of Indian day schools are not classed as permanent Civil Servants. They do not contribute to the superannuation fund as other Civil Servants do and, as a result, no provision has been made to allow superannuation to teachers of Indian day schools on their retirement. The only payment that this Department can allow is a gratuity equal to two months' salary, which, in your case, would amount to $230.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

This resignation is effective December 31, 1937, and Mr. Graham is being advised that the Department accepts it.\n\nI would appreciate your nominating a qualified teacher to take charge of this school on January 3, 1938. In securing a teacher for this school, I would direct your attention to official letter of January 20, 1937, in which I pointed out that the Nanaimo School is situated close to the town of Nanaimo and it is therefore advisable to secure a well qualified teacher to take charge of this school, in order that there may be no possible complaint from anyone who might take an interest in the work that is being done.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

The Government has always considered the obstacles standing in the way of their inclusion insurmountable. In view of this fact, the suggestion contained in the last paragraph of your letter cannot be considered. It has occurred to me that you might communicate with the Annuities Branch, Department of Labour, Ottawa, asking them for a schedule of rates.

S.S. Osterhout, D.D., representing the United Church of Canada, in which he nominates Miss Mabel Suffill as substitute teacher of the Nanaimo Indian Day School, Cowichan Agency, for two weeks, September 19th to 30th inclusive, during the absence of Miss Creighton the regular teacher who is still ill.\n\nMiss Mabel C. Suffill, 1292 E. 28th, Vancouver, is an experienced teacher holding a B.C. First Class Certificate. She has had experience of some two years in Provincial schools, and I am informed by Inspector Barry that her inspectors have spoken very highly of her ability. Captain Barry is anxious to have the Nanaimo Indian Day School opened as soon as possible and recommends the temporary appointment of Miss Suffill for a period of at least two weeks and until Miss E. Creighton is certified by her medical adviser as well enough to resume her duties.\n\nMiss Suffill is being given special help by the Inspector this afternoon and she will proceed to Nanaimo on September 17th to open the school on Monday the 19th.\n\nIt is presumed that as Miss Ella Creighton has been given leave by the Department for the first half of September she will be sent a cheque later for the salary while Miss Suffill will be paid salary for the second half of the month by cheque from Ottawa, each girl receiving the sum of $50.00 as the regular salary at this school is $100 a month.\n\nI should be glad if the Department would let me have a telegram approving of the arrangements made here in this matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 3, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 29th ultimo it is noted that owing to illness Miss Ella Creighton will not be able to re-open the Nanaimo Indian Day School until the middle of September.

She had been suffering from a severe attack of rheumatism, but I thought she would be able to attend to business, so I did not think it necessary to take her to hospital. She was able to walk about the house comfortably, but showed no signs of improvement.\n\nI would like to say that she was always kind to everyone, and I would like to suggest that she should be visited by the doctor when she returns home. I have heard that she is recovering slowly, and I believe she will make a full recovery.\n\nI am sure you will agree with me that Mrs. Maclean deserves our sympathy and support.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH.

A report by myself to the Department on the Summer School will be made shortly as requested by Major J.M. MacKay Indian Commissioner.\n\nAs the Cape Mudge and Campbell River Day Schools are supposed to open on October 1st, I regret I cannot make any comment on these schools to date I have not been notified that teachers have been appointed. It is hoped the Department will do everything possible to get these particular schools opened as the children are in the villages and ready to attend. In respect to the Quatsino Indian Day School the same situation exists there as I have not been notified of any teacher being appointed; however in this particular school it is not quite so important as the pupils have not all returned to the village as yet.\n\nI am feeling rather upset in respect to Miss Uphill, teacher of the Campbell River School. In her case she was quite willing to remain there provided the Department gave her an increase in salary to cover her increased cost of accommodation, and personally I think she was entitled to it, but instead of giving her the increase, she was permitted to be transferred to the Nanaimo Day School at an increased salary, which resulted in the Campbell River School being left without a teacher and the necessity of breaking in a new one.\n\nx x x\n\nM.S.

Uphill asked me to find out just what deductions are being made from her monthly cheque. I know that her salary is $100.00 per teaching month, less 5% for unemployment Insurance and compulsory Savings, which would make her receivable amount $95.00.\n\nNaturally, she has not yet received a cheque this term, but wants to know just what deductions are being made so that she can complete the Tax Return Form.\n\nWhile no mention was made of this Teacher getting a Cost of Living Bonus I wondered if such is the case. I am also uncertain as to whether or not she has to pay Defence Tax, if so this will mean a further reduction.\n\nI hope you will understand that I was not able to get any idea from Miss Uphill just how much her cheque amounted to each month last term as she has forgotten the exact amount received.\n\nI personally believe that it would be a good idea if the Department would advise the various Agent's just what deductions are being made each month from each of the Teachers of Indian Schools. In most cases we are told the salary they get, plus cost of bonus, but we don't know how much the cost of bonus is, so that we don't know the total amount of their cheque, neither do we know whether or not the deductions are made from the amount of salary only, or from salary and cost of living bonus. If I might have the above information it would be appreciated.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nD.M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\n(R.H. Moore)\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 30, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th instant, with reference to the salary of Miss L. Uphill, teacher of the Nanaimo Indian Day School. I have noted the contents of Mr. Moore's letter.\n\nI was under the impression that all civil servants were aware that the bonus, since August 1, 1942, was 17% for those earning under $2,100 a year, without dependents, and at the rate of $18.42 a month provided they can establish the status of a dependent. The income tax deductions vary with the amount of salary earned but are computed on the basis that the monthly salary is paid for a 15 month period. If at the end of the year the total income has not reached this amount, a person can apply for a refund of any overpayment.\n\nLast year the bonus was at the rate of 11% and consequently the monthly amount paid to Miss Uphill for the period October 1, 1941, to June 30, 1942, was as follows:\n\n| Monthly salary | 120.00 |\n|----------------|--------|\n| Bonus - 11%    | 11.00  |\n| Total          | $111.00|\n\nDeductions:\n5% of basic salary\n\nThis amount is placed in the superannuation fund and when Miss Uphill leaves our employ it will be returned to her with interest 5.00\n\nNational Defence Tax at 7% on the basic salary plus bonus - 7% of $111. 7.77\n\nTotal deductions 12.77 12.77\n\nNet salary $98.23\n\nFrom October 1, 1942, her monthly salary rate will be as follows:\n\n| Basic salary - $100 a month | 100.00 |\n|-----------------------------|--------|\n| Bonus at the rate of 17%    | 17.00  |\n| Total                       | 117.00 |\n\nDeductions:\n5% for superannuation fund 5.00\nIncome tax 13.57\nTotal deductions 18.57\n\nBalance $98.43\n\nThe Income Tax is computed at the rate of $18.57 a month. This includes compulsory savings of $6.28.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nBox 70, Vancouver, B. C.\n\np.t.o.\nWe first deduct the $8.28 from the $18.57, leaving a balance of $10.29.\n\nAs an amount of $5.00 is being deducted for superannuation fund, this amount is taken from the compulsory savings amount of $8.28, leaving a balance of $3.28. The total amount of income tax and compulsory savings is therefore $13.57, as stated above.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nSir:\n\nDuring the past few days I have had enquiries from three of the Day School teachers asking if I knew why their pay cheques for October had not arrived, I refer to Miss Uphill at Kamloops, Miss Keeble at Songhees and Miss E. Crosland at Tsartlip.\n\nPlease check up on the cause of the delay and have the cheques sent forward as soon as possible. These teachers have been without pay for three and four months and are really in need of their pay cheques on time.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n(R.H.

This was due to the necessity of making a large number of changes in the paylist owing to the increased bonus and the deductions for income tax. All cheques were mailed last week and should have reached the teachers by this time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. R.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B.C.\nREPORT ON COWICHAN INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF JUNE, 1943.\n\nNanaimo, Songhees and Saanich Indian Day schools closed at the end of the month for the summer vacation. The other three day schools in the Agency closed the previous month. Three pupils were recommended by the Inspector and Teacher to enter High School from the Koksilah Indian Day School. It would appear as if these three pupils made a good showing. Our one High School pupil at present attending the Duncan High was the only pupil in the school to pass with honours into Grade 12 and got high praise from the Principal at the closing exercises for her brilliant work during the year. I have recommended that she be permitted to continue her studies again next year in the same High School.\n\nR.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\nDuncan, B.C.\nJune 26th, 1943.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI beg to submit herewith a letter-and copy of same-received from Miss L. Uphill, Teacher of the Nanaimo Indian Day School, which I trust you will find self explanatory.\n\nIn this connection I wish to say that Miss Uphill has proved herself, in my opinion at least, to be a splendid Teacher with excellent control during school hours both in and out of classroom. She has given a great deal of her own time to the organisation of women's clubs on the reserve not to mention her attendance at same. She has also been a splendid worker for the children of the reserve and the Church in arranging entertainments and concerts-in which the children have taken part-as well as the ordinary school entertainments.\n\nI believe that we are extremely fortunate in having a girl like Miss Uphill in one of our schools. The example she has set the children in cleanliness and her help in encouraging neatness of appearance among the pupils in and out of school has had a splendid effect and the fruits of this teaching can be seen in evidence around the reserve.\n\nI have no hesitancy in recommending that Miss Uphill be put on the same Salary basis as her predecessor who got $10.00 monthly more than Miss Uphill is getting.\n\n(R.H. Moore)\nIndian Agent.\nMr. R. H. Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Moore,\n\nAs teacher of the Kwaaimo Indian Day School, I hereby make application for an increase in salary.\n\nThe Provincial Schools are operating on a wage scale, and so give credit for previous experience and present terms of office.\n\nI would appreciate this request being drawn to the attention of the Commissioner.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nLaura M. Uphill\nMajor D. H. Mackay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nReferring to your above noted letter and with particular reference to the last sentence of same I wish to advise that there is no information in this office either just what salary Miss Creighton received as teacher of the Nanaimo Indian Day School at the time of her resignation but Miss Uphill told me that she was getting $110.00 per month. However, on referring the matter to Miss Creighton I was informed that she was receiving $100.00 a month the same as Miss Uphill is getting at present.\n\nHowever, salaries have advanced at practically all schools during the last year or so and I feel that Miss Uphill's ability is deserving of practical recognition, which is the reason for my recommendation.\n\n(R. H. Moore)\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Moore's letter of the 26th ultimo an 13th instant requesting an increase in the salary of Miss L. Uphill, teacher at Nanaimo Indian Day School.\n\nIt will be noted that in the first instance Mr. Moore requested to increase the present salary up to that of Miss Uphill's predecessor, Miss Creighton, but on my enquiry he ascertained that Miss Uphill was receiving the same salary as did Miss Creighton at the time of her resignation.\n\nWhile Miss Uphill is considered a fairly good teacher, and there is no doubt that cost of living has increased, any increase will probably be followed by requests for similar treatment from the other schools in the Agency. However, if the Department has the funds, I would be prepared to approve of an increase of $5.00 per month for the ensuing term, provided the attendance at the school justifies continuation of that amount.\n\nFor D.M.

Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Nanaimo Indian Day School.\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of above date and file and have noted the contents. I read Mr Inspector Davey's report of the 16th ultimo at the time it was received at this Office and immediately felt that the main reason for poor attendance at this school could be put down to the fact that all the pupils had not returned to the reserve at the time Mr Davey made his inspection.\n\nI visited this school last Friday and checked the attendance, which was quite satisfactory. I spoke to Mrs Hill about it mentioning the comments of Mr Davey. She told me that she and Mrs Logie had adopted a new system now, which is an immediate visit to the home of any absentee pupil to find out just what the cause is and that it was working out very well indeed. I signed the register and from glancing casually at the attendance marks on it I got the impression that the attendance was quite good. I did notice that one or two pupils from the River Reserves, No. 3 particularly, were rather irregular but I am reasonably sure that sickness was the reason in those instances. It is impossible for the teachers to check on them as the reserves are 6 miles or so away from the school, however, I did suggest to Mrs Hill that it might be advisable for her or Mrs Logie to take the odd trip out on the bus which takes the pupils home, so that they could find out definitely if sickness was the cause of absence, and I am sure she will do so if necessary. My candid opinion is that most of our teachers do not visit the homes of the pupils half enough, in fact some don't do any visiting, and it shows on the registers.\n\nR.H.

(RG 10, Volume 6404, File 832-3, part 1)\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOwing to the fact that I am not receiving the bonus for this year I consider that my salary is not enough for the amount of work I am doing in comparison with the salaries of teachers in graded schools.\nDuring all the years I taught in the Indian Schools, I have never asked for an increase in salary but now that I have all the grades from the Receiving Class up to Grade 12, which means I have to work overtime in order to cover the work. I feel the salary is not enough, therefore would appreciate very much having the salary I had last year including bonus.\n\nI trust you will give this your favorable consideration.\n\nRespectfully yours,\nEvelyn S. Skipworth\nOttawa, September 9, 1925.\n\nMADAM,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 1st instant, I beg to say that, owing to the discontinuance of the bonus from March 31st, last, the Department has increased the salaries of teachers in Indian Day Schools by $150.00 for the academic year. This increase dates from April 1, 1925.\n\nPreviously to last April you were paid salary at the rate of $1000.00 a year, plus bonus of $150.00, or a total of $1150.00. As you are aware, your salary was forwarded to you through the treasurer of the Methodist Missionary Society, while your bonus was paid direct to you. From April 1st, last, your salary was at the rate of $1150.00 and for the June quarter a cheque for $345.00 was sent to the treasurer of the Methodist Missionary Society. You will, no doubt, receive this amount for that quarter and you will note that you are now being paid at the same rate as when you were allowed bonus.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMiss E. S. Klippert,\n204 Nicol Street,\nNanaimo, B.C.\n214, Nicol St.\nNanaimo, B.C.\nSept. 23, 1875\n\nM. M. Turner\nDept. of Indian Education\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThank you very much for the information regarding the increase in the salaries of teachers in Indian Day Schools, dating from April 1, 1875.\n\nI have just received the sum of $250 for the June quarter.\n\nRev. Mr. Macdonald, Nanaimo, is now the missionary treasurer. I will mention the fact to him, as he probably has the balance of the $250 on hand.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Deputy & Secretary, Dept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 1, 1920\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th ultimo, requesting that 32 single seats be ordered for the use of the Nanaimo Indian Day School and enclosing copies of prices received by you for supplying the same.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Rev. P. T. Kelly, teacher of the school, and Rev. T. Perrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, who were here recently, brought before the Department the need for a new school at Nanaimo. They point out that the present school building is inadequate for the educational needs of the children on the reserve and urge that a new school building be erected during the coming summer on a new site near the church. The Department is disposed to grant their request.\n\nThe Indians of the Nanaimo Band have to their credit at Capital Account in the Trust Funds over $67,000.00 and, as a new school building would be for the benefit of all the Indians and represent a permanent improvement, it is considered that the cost of erecting the same should be provided from the above funds at the credit of the band. If a new school building is erected it would be required to provide accommodation for about 40 pupils, and as it will be near the town of Nanaimo, a modern and thoroughly equipped building should be provided. Such a building would cost approximately $5,000.00.\n\nThe Department would like you to place this matter before the band in council as soon as possible, representing to them the need of a new building and the value it would be to their children and also that it would benefit the whole band and endeavour to have them pass a resolution setting aside from the funds at their credit the above sum to erect a new building.\n\nW. R. Robertson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan's Station,\nB. C.\nIf this resolution is obtained by you it should be forwarded to the Department.\n\nI would point out that under Section 89, Sub-section 2, of the Indian Act, the Department could take the amount necessary without referring the matter to the band, but it is considered that it would be better to consult them and obtain their consent to the providing of the necessary funds.\n\nA new site will also be necessary and Rev. Mr. Kelly stated that he thought a suitable site near the church could be obtained from Daniel Cushman by paying him a small amount for his improvements. It would be necessary to obtain two acres to provide play grounds, school garden, etc. You should also enquire into the selection of a suitable site and if you consider the land owned by Daniel Cushman to be the best location for a new school, you will be good enough to ascertain from him the lowest price at which the above named quantity of land can be obtained. The cost of the site will also be taken from the band funds.\n\nYou should state the kind of building you would recommend should be erected, the approximate size of the same, whether the material could be obtained in Nanaimo and full particulars as to how the building should be heated.\n\nYou will be good enough to give this matter your prompt attention and forward the resolution of the band authorizing the funds to be taken from their capital and the particulars asked for regarding the site and the building.\n\nIf this new building is erected it is considered that it would be advisable to await until such time as it is finished before supplying the desks asked for by you.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\nMEMORANDUM,\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nRev. P. R. Kelly and Rev. T. Ferrier, who were in the office on the 18th instant, drew attention to the need of a new day school on the Nanaimo Indian Reserve. Mr. Kelly is the teacher of this school.\n\nThe present building is inadequate for the needs of this reserve. It is old, dark and gloomy and at times is very much overcrowded. Mr. Inspector Cairns has also drawn the attention of the Department to the need of a new building. He said, in his last report of inspection, that a new school building should be erected during 1920, with modern equipment, and that a good school on this reserve, doing first class work, would be a great help in raising the status of other day schools in the province. The reserve is adjacent to the town of Nanaimo, and both Messrs. Ferrier and Kelly pointed out the credit that would accrue to the Department in the erection of a thoroughly equipped and modern school building so near to the town.\n\nDuring the December quarter there were 37 pupils enrolled, with an average attendance of 27. On some days 36 children attended, although it was hardly possible to accommodate them for lack of space and seating arrangements.\n\nMessrs. Ferrier and Kelly recommended that a school be built to accommodate 40 children, as there are that number on the reserve, about 35 of whom live near the school, and there are 10 other children who reside on the Nanaimo River about five miles distant.\n\nThe Nanaimo Band have $67,467.90 to the credit of capital. This amount is made up from royalties received from coal mined on the reserve by the Canada Western Fuel Company.\n\nA sum.\nA sum sufficient to erect a suitable building for 40 children and equip it thoroughly could be taken from the above amount under Section 89, Sub-section 2 of the Indian Act.\n\nI would recommend that steps be taken to have a new building erected during the coming summer, and that Mr. Agent Robertson be instructed to call the band together and lay the matter before them and have them pass a resolution to provide the necessary funds. If they refuse to do this, it can be taken as above stated from the capital at their credit.\n\nIf a new building is erected it would be necessary to obtain a new site, as the site on which the present school stands is too small and has no room for play-grounds. Mr. Kelly told me that a suitable site would be near the church and that he thought it could be obtained from Daniel Cusman, an Indian, by paying him a small amount for his improvements.\n\nA request has been received for 32 new desks and Mr. Kelly stated that, if a new school building were erected, it would be well to wait until then before any new equipment is purchased.\n\nThere is no doubt, from the reports received from the Inspector and the Agent, that a new building is required and it appears to me that the Indians could very well consent to give the necessary amount from their funds. If you approve of this work being undertaken the Architect should prepare the necessary plans and Mr. Agent Robertson should be requested to take the steps necessary to obtain a new site and the consent of the band to provide the funds.\n\nI may say that no accommodation would be required for the teacher in the new building, as the teacher could obtain board and lodging in the town of Nanaimo quite close to the school.\n\nRegarding the ten children mentioned as residing on the Nanaimo River, five miles distant from the present school, Rev. Mr. Kelly stated that arrangements could be made, should a new school be erected, to have them transported to and from the school at a cost of $2.00 per day, and that the Indians should provide this from their funds.\n\nI consider that they should also pay the full salary of the teacher.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I understand that the Nanaimo Indians have some $67,000 to their credit in royalty from the coal under their reserve.\n\nSteps have already been taken by the Rev. Peter Kelly and a letter has been written to your agent by your secretary. It would be well if a little pressure were brought to bear on this question so that the school might be erected this summer. Personally, I think the school should cost somewhere in the neighborhood of $15,000. Inasmuch as this investment is for the good of the Nanaimo Reserve and it is close to the city of Nanaimo and we have a splendid attendance at that School, we should have a good building.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6404, File 832-5, part 1)\nOttawa, July 14, 1920.\n\nRev.

It is hoped that the Indians will consent to provide the funds necessary to build the new school. As soon as a reply is received from the Agent the Department will be in a position to consider the erection of a new school building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

August 2, 1920\n\nSir,\n\nI reply to yours of the 1st, April last, in reference to obtain a resolution from the Nanaimo Indians authorizing the Department to set aside the sum of $5000.00 from their capital account, Indian Trust Fund Account No.176 for the purpose of building a new day school on their reserve No.1 at the city of Nanaimo, B. C.\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith copy of a resolution asking the Department to set aside the sum of $5000.00 for a new school building, to be erected on site of the present play ground near the old school.\n\nI will recommend the resolution to your favorable consideration.\n\nThe site proposed by Rev. Mr. Kelly was unanimously opposed, the lot referred to, of Daniel Cushen's consists of only a little over \u00bd acre, and on the lot there are fifteen fruit trees, the owner proposes to build a new house there, and objects to selling at any figure. The present play ground is quite suitable and consists of a little over one acre, and it is thought that a small lot adjoining can be bought from the owner Susan, the lot faces the beach.\n\nIn regard to the kind of building, I will recommend a building similar to the Songhees school which has proven very satisfactory. This school was built in 1913. It is a frame building with a cement basement and heated by furnace and hot air. It was built to accommodate 24 pupils, of course the Nanaimo will have to be a little larger.\n\nThe material, gravel and lumber and cement can be obtained at Nanaimo.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.

(RG 10, Volume 6404, File 832-5, part 1)\nMEMORANDUM\n\nHon. Sir James Lougheed -\n\nThe day school on the Indian reserve adjoining the city of Nanaimo is inadequate for the needs of the reserve. The building is old, dark and gloomy, and at times is very much over-crowded. The school inspector for the province of British Columbia and the Superintendent of Methodist Indian schools and missions have pointed out the necessity of providing better facilities for the education of these children, of whom there are about 35 living adjacent to the school, as well as 10 others some distance away.\n\nThe Indians themselves have passed a resolution approving of the expenditure from their band funds, which amount to over $67,000.00, being royalties received from coal mines on the reserve.

In 1890 the school building was improved, the work being done by the Indians and the Department allowed $287.00. The Church of England discontinued their mission on the Nanaimo Reserve about the year 1892 and the school was closed for the following two years.\n\nIn 1894 the Methodist Church authorities applied for permission to use the building for school purposes. (See file 117008-5 Closed) With the consent of the Church of England authorities this was done and under the auspices of the Methodist Church a school has been continued at this point since that time.\n\nIn official letter of August 2, 1920, Mr. Agent Robertson recommends that the new day school on the Nanaimo Indian Reserve be erected on the present site which consists of a little over one acre. He further states that it would be advisable to purchase from the owner, Susan, the small lot adjoining the school site. As the present school site has been used for school purposes since the year 1886, it would not appear necessary to obtain any further title to this land, but, if it is decided to purchase the additional lot recommended by the agent, a quit claim deed should, no doubt, be obtained from the present owner.\n\nIndian Affairs.

He thought it was just what we needed.\n\nDo you think the Department could be in favor of us getting it. The children sing so well and I have had to teach them without the instrument except when we borrowed one.\n\nThanking you for any help we can get from the Department.\n\nYours most sincerely,\n\n(Signed) Evelyn Klippert.\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing you herewith copy of letter from Miss L. S. Klipert, teacher of the Kamimo Indian Day School, asking for authority to purchase an organ for the school. I would strongly recommend the same as the Indian children take a great interest in music, and the same tends to make them more keen on their studies and attendance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n(Alfred H. Lomas)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 7th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo, enclosing copy of a communication from Miss Klappert, teacher of the Namismo Indian Day School, in which she requests that an organ be supplied for the use of the school, and states that she can obtain a second hand one for the sum of $20.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it is not the policy of the Department to supply organs for the use of Indian day schools, and it is, therefore, regretted that it will not be possible to comply with the teacher's request. The usual procedure to obtain this equipment at day schools is to raise the money required by holding concerts, and I would suggest that the teacher use this method in the raising of the amount required for the purchase of the organ.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. H. Lomas, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B.C.\nThe Sec of Indian Affairs\n\nWhen I first took over the Indian boys at the Nanaimo Reserve for technical work, I noted that physically they were in poor shape. However, I organized a football team and in a short time an marked improvement was very evident.\n\nLast year we won the School League Shield open to the district.\n\nOf course, you will readily understand that there is some expense incurred which has been met by the boys &c.\n\nAs the boys are not ready to fit this year, it has been a trying season. But I intend to carry on, to get out some support in the way of a football. I also want eleven hostages for the winners. Cheap ones will do and I will be pleased.\nto pay half the cost out of my own pocket.\n\nThey could be purchased much cheaper in Eastern Canada, just small silver ones will do.\n\nThe boys are bright, mentally alert, and I can guarantee they will make good citizens.\n\nThe work they do is quite advanced.\n\nWe have built a house, two a lool,\n\nand hot air engines and etc.\n\nIf you would like more photos will only be too pleased to send them.\n\nMr. Evans, the Inspector suggested my writing you direct.\n\nYours very faithfully\n\nJohn G. Macdonald\n\nWe will be quite pleased with second hand tools anything that is hirable.\nOttawa, December 12, 1925.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nPlease deliver to Room 503, Booth Building, for the use of the Namaqua Indian Day School, two footballs complete. These should be of the same type and price as usually charged, and payment will be made upon receipt of your account, in duplicate, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMessrs. Ketchum & Co.,\nSparks St., OTTAWA.\nOttawa, December 12, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, relative to the sports which you have organized among the pupils of the Nanaimo Indian Day School, and requesting that 2 footballs and 11 badges be supplied.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that an order will be placed here and 2 footballs will be sent to you.\n\nRelative to the badges, the Department has nothing of the type requested by you and is not prepared to authorize any expenditure in the purchase of same.\n\nIt is noted that the boys are making good use of the instruction which they receive in their manual training class.\n\nI would request that in future you forward any communications through the office of the local Indian Agent, Mr. A. H. Lomas, Duncan, B.C.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn G.

Somerville\nOttawa, May 4, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, requesting authority to incur the expenditure required in having the Nanaimo Indian Day School building repainted with two coats of paint and the old building, now used as a manual training school, given one coat.\n\nIn reply I beg to say the Department will approve of your arranging to have this painting carried out. You should see that a good grade of paint is used and that the work is satisfactorily performed. The exterior of the day school building is to be given two coats and the old school building, one coat. Any minor repairs required can also be carried out. It is noted you estimate the cost to be approximately $156.\n\nAfter this work has been completed to your satisfaction, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the paint and other material and for the labour. This painting should be done at a time when it will not interfere with the regular classroom activities at the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nA. H. Lomas, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B. C.\nDuncan, B. C.\nApril 27th, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to make application to you for authority to have the Nanaimo Indian Day School repainted, with two coats of paint. And also the old school building now used as manual training school, the cost of which I obtained would be approximately $156.00, including a few minor repairs.\n\nI would strongly recommend that same be done as both buildings are in need of painting. One coat will be sufficient for the old building, which is allowed for in estimate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Alfred H. Lomas)\nIndian Agent.\n\nRussell T.

I understand that he drives them about 6 miles each way each school day. Mr. Inspector Barry reports that 9 out of a possible 11 were present from this outside reserve on the day of his visit and that this service is under the supervision of Dominion Constable O'Connell.\n\nThe Department expected that, with the appointment of Paul White for this service, the attendance would materially increase over what was secured when there was a train service. I find that the average attendance at the school is in excess of what it was one year and two years ago.\n\nPlease let me know if White is doing this work in an efficient manner also if he is securing a maximum attendance and is not only regular but punctual.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B. C.\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of May 11th re the attendance of the pupils at the Nanaimo Indian Day School, from the #2 Reserve.\n\nI beg to say that on every occasion that I have visited this school, I have made a point of enquiring about these children and their attendance, and have found that every child is accounted for.\n\nI have asked both Constable O'Connell and Miss Kippert the Teacher for a report, copies of which I now beg to enclose, and which I trust you will find satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H. Graham)\nIndian agent.\nNanaimo, B.C.\nMay 21st, 1931\n\nH. Graham Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn compliance with your instructions, desiring a report relative to attendance of pupils from the River Reserve.\n\nI may state that eleven children of school age only being available, on River Reservation, their attendance at school since being conveyed by car has been exceptionally good, as the enclosed report of the teacher Miss M. Ripert will substantiate.\n\nIndependent of my periodical visits to the school, I have caused Chief Paul White to make special (verbal) reports to me, names of children failing to attend and cause of their absence.\n\nIf not sick, or otherwise having no reasonable excuse, I at once confer with the parents, whom I have to a degree, warm up a little, occasionally.\n\nBut in the hole the question of attendance, taking into reasonable consideration, is about as near to the daily attendance of the children at the school, as conditions existing from time to time, that is unavoidable.\n\nRemaining your obediently\n\n(SGN.) Theo O'Connell.\nBom. Constable.\nThe average attendance for the eleven pupils from the Nanaimo River Reserve who are attending the Indian Bay School for the month of April was 6.75. During the month of May 9.04 some of the pupils were absent on account of sickness during the \"flu\" epidemic; otherwise the pupils have been very punctual and regular in their attendance.\n\nThe progress is very much more satisfactory, since the car has been in operation.\n\nPreviously the attendance was very irregular. Jerry Good one of the pupils, has been using his bicycle instead of the car, partly I think on account of family difficulties.\n\nHoping the present arrangements of transportation may continue satisfactory to all concerned.\n\nS. Clippert,\nTeacher.\nMay 29th, 1931.\n\nDear Senator Planta,\n\nFollowing your visit to my office a few days ago, I communicated with the Indian agent at Duncan, B.C., regarding the service being given by Chief Paul White in transporting the Indian children from the Nanaimo River reserve to the Nanaimo Indian day school.\n\nI am now in receipt of a reply from the Indian agent with which he encloses reports from the constable and the teacher of the school. The constable states that the attendance of these children at school since being conveyed by car has been exceptionally good. Chief White is required to give the constable a report of the non-attendance of any children for whom he is responsible stating the cause of absence. The teacher reports that the progress of the children is very much more satisfactory since the car has been in operation and she hopes this arrangement for transportation may continue.\n\nIt would appear that the Chief is giving good service and that the arrangement is proving satisfactory.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nHon.

Pragnell, Inspector of Indian Agencies for British Columbia, dated June 17th, being his inspection report No. 1. of Cowichan Agency. In connection with the several matters reported on, it is recommended, provided the Department is favorable, that Mr. Indian Agent Graham be instructed to purchase individual mugs or cups for the use of the children in the schools reported on.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn.\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\nKamloops, B.C., June 17th, 1931.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nCowichan Agency Inspection Report No. 1.\n\nI visited the Day School at Nanaimo No. 1 Reserve and met Miss Clifford, the teacher. There were twenty-two in class on the day of my visit and the school was well kept and well run.\n\nI visited the Day School at Comiaken, where the teacher, Mrs. Roe, was mistress. There was only one child in class. She informed me that all the other children had accompanied their parents to the berry picking in the U.S.A.\n\nI visited the Koksailah Day school, Miss Cleff in charge. There were nine children in attendance and everything seemed very satisfactory.\n\nI also visited the Songees Reserve Day school. There were nine children in attendance, and everything there was also quite satisfactory.\n\nIn connection with these day schools, I should recommend that they all have cheap aluminum or enamel cups provided, upon which the children's names could be marked, and the children instructed to use individual mugs. This has been done at many other day schools, and is a good preventative from T.B. infection.\n\nGeo. S. Pragnell,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, July 3, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to that portion of your letter of the 22nd ultimo, transmitting the report of Colonel Pragell, Inspector of Indian Agencies, on his inspection of the Indian schools in the Cowichan Agency, in which he recommends that individual mugs or cups be supplied for the use of the children, I have to say that the Department will approve of the number of enamel drinking cups required being supplied to each school. You may arrange for the purchase and delivery, or instruct Mr. Agent Graham, Duncan, B.C., to do so. Only the number of cups absolutely required for each school should be supplied.\n\nThe account covering the cost should, if possible, show the expenditure in supplying the cups at each school separately.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.

Just as the regular Hecla furnace with steel radiator retains a leading position among furnaces of that type, so the \"Series 700\" all-cast Hecla is designed to exceed other cast iron furnaces in efficiency, durability and satisfactory performance. Every part is heavy and strong, made for a long life of service.\n\nReturn Flue Radiator\n\nThe \"Series 700\" Hecla differs from all other all-cast furnaces in that it has what is termed a return flue radiator, with both direct and indirect fire travel. The radiator here illustrated is placed around a particularly large and heavy combustion chamber. It is deep and narrow with a\nThe illustration above shows the deep cup joint joining the radiator to the combustion chamber. These same deep cup joints are used throughout the construction of the furnace.\n\nThe picture above gives a good idea of the weight and strength of the return flue radiator.\ndivision plate that gives long fire travel twice the length of any other all-cast furnace thus making every square inch of the radiator an effective heat radiating surface. Because this feature has the effect of doubling the distance the fire has to travel before it reaches the smoke pipe, it practically makes the heat from the firepot do double duty. It means more heat going to the house and less up the smoke pipe or the work done with less fuel.\n\nThe heavy return flue radiator is a very important part of the equipment of this new furnace and will appeal strongly to the purchaser who seeks a massive, rugged furnace with large heating capacity combined with unusual economy in operation. The arrows in the illustration indicate the double distance the fire has to travel in the radiator before passing into the smoke pipe.\n\nOther Special Features\n\nIn addition to this valuable feature the \"Series 700\" Hecla has these other exclusive and special features, the same as the regular Hecla furnace:\n\n- A patented steel ribbed firepot that lasts indefinitely and increases the radiating surface threefold.\n- A patented circular water pan set in the base ensuring ample moisture in the air, evenly distributed to all flues.\n- Heavy triangular independent grates to give a clear burning fire without waste of fuel.\n- Large convenient door for firing.\n- Holes in furnace front for water coil connections for domestic water supply.\n- An all-cast specially designed combustion chamber.\n- Extra wood grate to convert the Hecla into a wood burning furnace when required.\n- A special gas ring if necessary for use when burning natural gas.\n\nIt also has the full regular equipment\u2014check dampers complete with chains, pulleys, etc., poker and scraper. Pages 14 to 19 give full descriptions of these special Hecla features.\n\nThe new \"Series 700\" Hecla is made in six different sizes for both pipe and pipeless systems, and in each case the steel ribbed firepot carries our twenty year unconditional guarantee.\nThe New \"Series 700\"\nHecla Warm Air Furnace\n\nAll Cast with Return Flue Radiator and Steel Ribbed Firepot with 20 Year Guarantee\nIN FIVE SIZES PIPE AND PIPELESS\nSaves One Ton in Seven\n## SPECIFICATIONS\n\n### HECLA (ALL CAST)\n\n#### 700 Series No.\n\n| Diameter of Firepot | Depth of Firepot | Weight of Firepot | Square Inches Radiant Surface | Size of Fire Door | Diameter of Smoke Pipe | Distance from Floor to Bottom of Smoke Pipe Collar | Diameter of Radiator | Height of Radiator | Height of Castings | Shipping Weight | Square Inches Warm Air Pipe Capacity | Heating Capacity in Cubic Feet | Code |\n|---------------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------|------|\n| 16\"                 | 12\"              | 120 lbs           | 134                           | 12x13            | 8\"                     | 34\"                                           | 28\"                 | 16\"             | 46\"            | 715 lbs         | 254                               | 10,000                          | Portable |\n| 19\"                 | 12\"              | 144 lbs           | 201                           | 12x13            | 8\"                     | 36\"                                           | 30\"                 | 16\"             | 46\"            | 830 lbs         | 317                               | 15,000                          |        |\n| 22\"                 | 12\"              | 168 lbs           | 254                           | 12x13            | 8\"                     | 37\"                                           | 36\"                 | 16\"             | 46\"            | 1120 lbs        | 410                               | 25,000                          |        |\n| 25\"                 | 12\"              | 192 lbs           | 317                           | 12x13            | 8\"                     | 38\"                                           | 40\"                 | 16\"             | 46\"            | 1270 lbs        | 513                               | 35,000                          |        |\n| 28\"                 | 12\"              | 216 lbs           | 370                           | 12x13            | 8\"                     | 39\"                                           | 40\"                 | 16\"             | 46\"            | 1400 lbs        | 606                               | 50,000                          |        |\n| 33\"                 | 12\"              | 240 lbs           | 432                           | 12x13            | 8\"                     | 41\"                                           | 40\"                 | 16\"             | 46\"            | 1600 lbs        | 709                               | 60,000                          |        |\n\n### HECLA CASES (700 SERIES)\n\n| No. | Diameter of Casing Rings in Inches | Size of Bottom Casing in Inches | Size of Top Casing in Inches |\n|-----|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| 716 | 33                                | 81 x 16                         | 82 x 28                      |\n| 719 | 36                                | 91 x 17                         | 91 x 28                      |\n| 722 | 42                                | 109 x 17                        | 109 x 28                     |\n| 725 | 45                                | 113 x 17                        | 118 x 29                     |\n| 728 | 54                                | 136 x 23                        | 136 x 28                     |\n| 733 | 57                                | 133 x 29                        | 133 x 29                     |\nI am prepared to re-condition old furnace, cold and warm air pipes for the sum of eighty-five dollars ($85.00).\n\nThe above price includes everything necessary in labor and material to complete the job in a workmanlike manner.\n\nThe price of supplying and installing New Series 700 Hecla warm air furnace complete in every detail including cold air pipe made of 26 gauge galvanized iron, and all necessary repairs on warm air pipe is two hundred and twenty five dollars ($225.00)\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

C.\n\nDear Sir.\u2014\n\nAccording to instructions I have made a thorough examination of the furnace in Nanaimo Indian School. I find the furnace is in very bad condition, and in need of extensive repairs. A new dome is necessary, also fire-box and grate frame.\n\nPart of the cold air pipe will have to be renewed and some of the warm air pipes repaired.\n\nEnclosed you will find estimates for re-conditioning old furnace, cold and warm air pipes, also price on new 700 Series Wecla furnace. The reason I have selected this furnace is because this is the heaviest furnace made in Canada, and has the longest guarantee.\n\nEnclosed you will find full description of same.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJHB/WMB\n\nCowichan Indian Agency\nAug 1, 1938\nDuncan, B.C.\nDuring the latter part of last term the furnace in the Nanaimo Indian Day School was giving considerable trouble, and the smoke coming into the class room so badly, Miss Klippert the teacher became alarmed and sent for a plumber who had to take the furnace all to pieces to find out what was wrong, and he found some of the castings broken.\n\nI went up and examined it myself and found that considerable repairs were needed both on the furnace and the pipes, so I asked Mr. Bailey, who had taken it apart to give me an estimate on the repairs to the old furnace, and also on cost of a new one.\n\nI am now enclosing his estimate, and would like to recommend that I be authorized to have the old furnace repaired, as I think it can be put in workable order and thus save having to purchase a new furnace. Unless the Department think it will be more economical in the long run to install a new one.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H. Graham)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nChief Paul White,\nCedar B.C.\n\nTo Mr. Graham,\nIndian Agent,\n\nComplaint of Transportation for school children from Nanaimo River to No. 1 reserve.\nI have been running 6 miles round trip return. Two return trips comes to 24 miles that is one days work. At 5 schooling days in a week and in 1 month comes to 30 schooling days at 2 return trips a day comes to 40 trips a month which comes to $45. or a month it proves that all I have been getting was $1.12\u00bd a day out of that sum I have been buying my own gas, oil,\nwear and tear and also repairs by\nthe time I get through with all\nthis there is nothing left. In\nfact I have been digging into my\nown pocket. Now since I've been\non the job I found myself in debt\nof over $100 or that is for oil and\nrepairs. Of course it was my\nown offer at $45 a month as\nI did not understand how much\nit would take to run. When I\nstarted on the job I found out\nthat is what we call a broken\nday. That is to say when I\nstart off in the morning at 8:30 A.M.\nget back at 9:30 A.M. and ready\nto go down again at 2:30 P.M.\nget back at 3:30 P.M. and the\nday is short. So let us begin and not be miserable on the job.\n\nI figure the present system honestly dealt with would be $3.00 a day comes to $60.00 a month in wages and out of that I buy oil and gas $15.00 allowed for repairs which will total $75.00 a month.\n\nFigure as follows: 6 mi. way @ $5.00 return trip 12 mi. @ $1.50 for 2 return trips = $3.00 day schooling day comes to $3.00 5 days = $15.00 4 weeks 1 month comes to $60.00 wages Allowance for repairs is $15.00 month Total $75.00 month.\n\nI hope you will find this quite\nin order. Dear Mr Graham & wish you would kindly mention about that reduction of my salary to our government as I am not in position to pay it for I have a big family as you know my salary is small. After this holiday season when I start again I want to start very carefully so to get myself out of the hole providing that I must live. Wishing to thank you so much.\n\nI remain\nyour obedient servant,\nChief Paul White\nSir:\n\nWhen visiting Nanaimo recently Chief Paul White spoke to me about small amount that was allowed for transporting children from Nanaimo River Indian reserve to the Nanaimo Indian Day School. I told him to put his complaint in writing, which he has done, I enclose copy herewith.\n\nI might state that the Chief has done good conscientious work in carrying these children backwards and forwards, and I know that he has certainly not made much money out of it. The Nanaimo Indian Day school is certainly a credit, and it is largely due to the Chief transporting these children that such regular attendance is kept up, and I would like to recommend that if it is at all possible, that he be granted an increase for this work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H. Graham)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA\nOttawa, August 10, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 1st instant, enclosing a communication from Chief Paul White with reference to the amount paid him for transporting the children from the Nanaimo River Reserve to and from the Nanaimo Indian Day School.\n\nIn this connection I have to request that you will state the number of children that require transportation, also the farthest distance from the school which any of the pupils have to travel. As our funds are limited, it is necessary to closely check all expenditure. As you are aware, the sum of $15 per month is now being paid for this service, or a total of approximately $450 per school year. Before the Department can come to a decision as to an increase in the monthly rate allowed, I shall be pleased to receive the above information, also what further increase you would recommend be given. I may say that we would not be prepared to make any allowance for repairs and upkeep of car.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B.C.\nOttawa, August 10, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 1st instant, regarding the furnace at the Nanaimo Indian Day School, and enclosing an estimate which you received covering the reconditioning of the present furnace, and also an estimate of the cost of installing a new one.\n\nIn reply I have to say it is noted that the present old furnace can be put in workable order and you recommend that it be repaired. As our funds this year are extremely limited, it is considered that it would be satisfactory to have the old furnace repaired, and you may arrange to have this work carried out. It is noted that the cost will be $65. If Mr. Bailey is on the list to receive consideration, you may arrange with him to carry out the work. You should see that a satisfactory job is completed and the furnace placed in good, serviceable condition.\n\nAfter the repairs have been completed, you should forward an account, in triplicate, stating, in detail, the repairs carried out, the time employed and the rates paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

C.\nJanuary 23rd, 1933.\n\nMr. H. Graham,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B. C.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nIn answer to your letter of the 17th inst., I wish to explain why it is necessary to have paper towels and liquid soap rather than the ordinary roller towelling.\n\nThis is to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, both the \"children's diseases\" and skin diseases. When twenty children or more use the same towel and the same cake of soap, and if one child should be contracting measles or some other communicable disease there is grave danger that the other nineteen children would develop measles, getting the infection direct from the towel.\n\nMost of the infectious diseases are caused by germs and these germs are transmitted in the nose and mouth discharges and therefore by the hands; therefore it is most important that each child has his own towel.\n\nIn the case of \"impetigo\" or any of the skin diseases it is more important that other children do not dry on the same towel as the child with the disease, for these diseases are very infectious.\n\nDuring our last session of \"impetigo\" fortunately when we had the first cases there were still some paper towels and liquid soap left, so the disease has not spread a great deal. Since the supply has come to an end we have had the few remaining cases use newspaper, instead of cloth towels to prevent it spreading any further.\n\nAfter the first five cases of impetigo, when it was found that there had been only four new cases. If the community towel had been used the number of cases would have been greatly increased.\n\nThe children with impetigo have been kept at school as it was found that when they stayed at home the parents would not give the treatment regularly, and the conditions did not clear up. With daily treatment at the school the \"sores\" have disappeared in a comparatively short time.\n\nI hope it will be possible to renew the supply of paper towels and green soap. We already have the containers for the latter.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(Signed) Muriel Upshall.\nSir:\n\nIn the last requisition forwarded to the Department for supplies for the Nanaimo Indian Day School, they requisitioned for liquid soap and paper towels, and I received a reply stating that these were not supplied.\n\nI might state that this same controversy took place just a year ago, and the late Commissioner Mr. Ditchburn ordered these as well as instructing me to get containers for the soap, which are of course on hand at present.\n\nI might state that there has been considerable trouble in this school with different children diseases, and it was for this reason that the district nurse recommended these and I now enclose copy of letter just received from the Nurse on the subject.\n\nI sincerely trust that the Department will be able to see its way clear to grant these.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H. Graham)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\nFebruary 3rd, 1933.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your letter of January 27th, enclosing a letter from Miss Upshall. You may purchase paper towels and liquid soap for the use of the children at Nanaimo Indian Day School. If they are not available in Duncan have Mr. Perry buy them for you in Victoria. It will be in order to include the cost of these articles in the next drug account.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nH.

It is noted that, after investigating the trouble, it was found the water pipe had become completely corroded throughout and that new pipe is required. In this connection I have to confirm the following night lettergram to you of today's date:\u2014\n\n\"May purchase, from firm on approved list, new pipe required for water system, Nanaimo School. Keep costs installing pipe, digging and filling low as possible. Use Indian labour as far as possible.\"\n\nIt is noted that the quantity of pipe required will cost approximately $184.00 and that, besides, there will be the cost of digging and filling the trench in which the pipe is installed. Further, it is presumed, there will be the cost of investigating the trouble.\n\nAs our funds are extremely limited, the Department has to request that you will see that all costs in placing the water system at this school in good condition are kept down to the lowest possible point. It is hoped that you can use Indian labour for the work of digging and filling.\n\nAfter the new pipe has been installed, to your satisfaction, and the water supply at the school placed in good condition, you should forward accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the pipe and for the labour in having it installed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

This is considered rather low in view of the fact that the Department is allowing $50 a month for transporting the pupils to school.\n\nPlease let me know at once whether or not Chief Paul White is performing his duties in a satisfactory manner. You should also state the average attendance during the month of October.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B.C.\nSir:\n\nIn reply to yours of the 6th instant, regarding attendance at the Nanaimo Indian Day School, on which you make comment on the average attendance for the month of September last, I might say that during this month there was nearly 100% attendance for those that were on the reserve; there were some children who came at the beginning of the month and were then taken away by their parents when they left for the saltery.\n\nDuring the month of October the average attendance was 95%, which was also really very good, as there were 12 children still away at the salteries, and there are also old children away sick.\n\nThe work performed by Chief Paul White in transporting the children from the River Reserve to the school is quite satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. Graham\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nDuncan, B. C.\n\nNovember 16th, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nOn behalf of the various Indian Day Schools in this Agency, I would like to ask that an expenditure similar to that granted in previous years be allowed this year to provide a treat for the pupils at Christmas, namely:\n\nNanaimo Indian Day School $10.00 (41-27)\nCowichan $5.00 (23-17)\nKoksilah $5.00 (13-10)\nSonghees Indian Day School $5.00 (4-10)\nTsartlip Indian Day School $5.00 (1-1)\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.

I had no idea and he did not report to me that there was so much work needed, only on receipt of his bill did I know that all this work was required, but he states that the furnace was in such a condition that it could not work without the repairs being done immediately, thus the reason my application was not made for permission to have the work done.\n\nTrusting the Department will approve of this expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(H.

The ventilator also requires some attention, as during rainy spells from certain quarters the rain beats through ventilator (having wooden vanes) and thereby soaking ceiling and causing unnecessary damage to the ceiling which is quite noticeable, and if allowed to remain in this condition will cause a greater amount of damage than if properly repaired between now and school opening in the fall.\"\n\nYou will remember that in official letter of April 26 you were advised that an amount of $400.00 was available for repairs and improvements at the five Day Schools in the Cowichan Agency. When replying to that letter you should report specially on the repairs which you consider necessary to the Nanaimo School giving an estimate of the cost and also full details regarding any material required.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D.

Barry our Inspector of Schools on the matter. This report covers the matter of repairs needed in general. I will, however, in the meanwhile endeavor to obtain an estimate from Acting Indian Agent Caldwell at Duncan as to cost of repair, and as full details as possible regarding any material required. Upon hearing from him, I will forward this information to you.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nFor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nExtract from Inspector Barry's report on the Nanaimo Day School dated May 27, 1938.\n\nEXD.\n\nMany repairs to the school are necessary, and a new hot air coal burning furnace will be required before school opening in September. At present the smoke gets into the classroom as the lining of the furnace is worn out and broken. Possibly the Acting Indian agent would be able to let you know just what the required new furnace would cost. The hot air pipes if cleaned out would not need to be replaced as they are in good condition in general.\n\nIn general the Nanaimo Indian Day School building needs many repairs, but quite good work is being done in the classroom by Miss Creighton and the children.\n\nI am informed by the teacher that the Acting Agent wishes me to report on the damage to the school buildings, and certain other matters with regard to the buildings.\n\nThe school is located on what I may term a Village Green. The older ex pupils and Indian youths who are idle should be kept off this ground around the school till after school hours. They interfere with the school if it is in session or if the teacher is taking Drills etc. outside.\n\nThough strong wire mesh was placed on the school windows this was not sufficient. A number have been broken by the balls used in Box Lacrosse played on the field in which the school is located. Very heavy strong wire guards are needed now for the windows which I hope may be mended during the summer vacation. Several pieces of glass will be needed.\nThe steps to the school porch on the Boys' side need repair.\n\nThe inside of the school is in need of kalsomine. The furnace is not worth repairing and will need to be renewed this summer if school is to be held in the room as at present smoke makes its way into the room. There is a fine clean basement with a hot air pipe furnace. The pipes will need to be cleaned out but they can be used again. The coal burning furnace is not worth repairing. No doubt the Indian Agent will be able to report on the estimated cost of the necessary repairs.\n\nRepairs are also needed to the doors of the school.\n\n(Sgd.) Gerald H.

(RG 10, Volume 6404, File 832-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nDear Sir:\n\nSome time ago it was brought to my notice that Chief Paul Whyte, who transports the Nanaimo School Children from Nanaimo Indian Reserves, 2, 3 & 4 to Reserve No. 1, where the Indian Day School is located, did not go to all the reserves to pick up the children in the morning or in the afternoon when he brought them back from School, but made them walk across the railway trestle bridge across the river to his house where they got into his car.\n\nAs soon as I found out that this situation existed I immediately instructed Paul Whyte that he would have to go to the reserves in question and pick them up at or near their own homes, and return them there after School. Apparently the original agreement was made with the thought in mind of keeping down the cost, but if one of the children ever fell off the bridge or got killed by a train while crossing it would certainly not be economy from the point of view of the Department, and what a scandal it would cause.\n\nWith the additional mileage that Whyte has to travel daily to pick up and deliver these children, it is not fair that he should be expected to do it for the price of $60.00 which he is receiving at present. His car must be in good condition and he should carry accident Insurance. He travels a distance of 32 miles daily, or a total of approximately 756 miles monthly, and at 13\u00a2 per mile which is a reasonable charge, the price should be approximately $110.00 monthly. However, I would not advise this much, but would recommend an amount of $80.00 per month or 23 school days. If this is agreed on I would also recommend that he be made to take out Accident and personal liability insurance.\n\nI might say that I discussed this matter with Inspector's Coleman & Barry when they were in this Agency last month, and took them over the route which the Chief is now having to travel. I would recommend that this rate apply as from January 3rd, instant, as Whyte has been making the extra mileage ever since late in November last.\n\nYours Obediently,\n\nD. M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nVancouver, B. C.,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6404, File 832-5, part 4)\nDear Sir:\n\nIn acknowledging receipt of your letter date and File no. above mentioned, regarding the transportation of the Nanaimo Indian school children to and from the No's 2 and 3 reserves to the Indian school on No. 1 reserve, I beg to advise that the average number carried daily amount to twelve.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(R.H. Moore)\nIndian Agent.\n\nD. M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\nVancouver, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith an application received from Mr. Indian Agent Moore for authority to increase the allowance made to Chief Paul Whyte, of the Nanaimo Band, for the transportation of Indian children from Nanaimo Indian Reserves Nos. 2, 3 and 4 to the Indian Day School on Nanaimo I. R. #1, involving a daily trip of 32 miles.\n\nIt will be observed that the mileage has been increased by Chief Paul Whyte taking on the children at or near their homes and returning them there after School; some of the children were previously crossing the railway bridge on foot, which the agent considered a very dangerous practice.\n\nAs the new transportation cost will amount to only 0.9\u00a2 per mile for each child, on an average of 12 children a day, I would recommend approval of the application, subject to the average number of pupils so transported not falling lower than 10 pupils per day, the number to be certified by the teacher each month.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

(RG 10, Volume 6404, File 832-5, part 4)\nSir,\n\nDuring a recent visit to the Nanaimo Indian Day School I found that the Teacher had not received all the articles she requested in the Requisition submitted last December. I refer to Drano for the water pipes, Plunger for the toilet, as without it the system seems to keep blocking up, and toilet paper. I might add that these items were again asked for in the Requisition submitted just before the Easter holidays, and while the authority has not yet been received it is not possible to wait any longer.\n\nOwing to the fact that this was an emergency, I authorised the purchase of 3 tins of Drano, 1 plunger and 1 doz. rolls of toilet paper. If this had not been attended to it is reasonable to expect that the whole plumbing system at the school might block up and would be an expensive job putting it in working order again. I trust my action in this matter will be approved.\n\nI also found that the chimneys in the school are very dirty and require cleaning very badly. Generally this job is put off until the summer holidays but they seem to be dirtier this year than usual and need it very badly now. Apart from the dirty condition of the chimneys and furnace pipes, which I might add will also have to be cleaned at the same time, there is quite a serious fire hazard with the chimney's in the condition they are in at the moment. Kindly authorise this expenditure at your early convenience. The same price that has been charged in other years will prevail again this year, as the work is done by the City of Nanaimo Chimney Sweep.\n\nYours obediently;\n\nThe Secretary;\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nMines & Resources.\nOttawa.\n\n(R.H.Moore)\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nApril 18, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 11th instant the Department approves the action taken by you in purchasing 3 tins of Draino, 1 plunger and 12 rolls of toilet paper for use at the Nanaimo Indian Day School.\n\nYou may arrange for the necessary cleaning of the chimneys and furnace pipes at the Nanaimo School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. R.

LePas, of Nanaimo, B.C.\n\nThe gentleman writing is a responsible businessman in the City of Nanaimo and no doubt what he says can be taken as being correct.\n\nThis letter might throw some reflection on the administration of Indian Affairs in this municipality, as surely the care of the buildings would be one of the matters that these gentleman would be careful to consider.\n\nI hope you will have this matter investigated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. W. Mayhew.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6404, File 832-5, part 4)\nMr. R. W. Mayhew, M.P.,\nParliament Bldgs.,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Mayhew:\n\nRe: Indian School--Nanaimo Reserve.\n\nI do not know if Mr. Alan Chambers is in Ottawa at present or not, so thought I would write you direct in case he is not there.\n\nI examined the \"Indian School\" today and find that several matters require attention. I discovered a number of broken windows, some sashes would not open and others were minus sash cords. It is necessary that windows open freely for the proper ventilation of class room.\n\nA window ventilator should be build on inner wall of class room for proper ventilation. This window could be opened for closed as required and could be opened or closed by attaching a cord to same.\n\nIt appears the school requires painting on outside and class room should receive some attention, as well as Trellis work in and around outside stairs.\n\nThree years ago Mr. Chambers had the Department of Indian Affairs carry out suggestions which I made at that time, and I believe it would be considered good business to carry out suggestions contained herein by this summer; if left longer it would prove much more costly.\n\nI mention these matters for what they are worth and hope the improvements will be carried out.\n\nWith kindest personal regards,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n(Sgd.) Leo F. LePas.\nOttawa, March 28, 1941.\n\nDear Mr. Mayhew:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of March 25 and also copy of a letter received by you from Mr. Leo F. LePas, of Nanaimo, attached thereto.\n\nThe records here indicate that in response to a request received from the Indian agent repairs were undertaken at the Nanaimo Day School early in 1940. Repairs undertaken at that time amounted to $76.25. This school was visited again by the Indian agent and by Commissioner MacKay early in December 1940 and repairs, consisting mainly of painting, were authorized. These repairs amounted to $35. A voucher covering the cost was submitted to and paid by the Department on January 24 of this year.\n\nWe look upon the Nanaimo Indian Day School as one of the best Indian day schools in the province of British Columbia. Inspector Barry, in his report on this school dated February 20, 1941, states:\n\n\"This school is a great credit to the Indian Agent and to the teachers employed. I notice that Indian Agent Moore has arranged for an extension of the physical training program by having basket ball goals erected. This is an excellent move and will result in greater wellbeing for the pupils. The general standing of this school is excellent.\"\n\nI may state -\n\nF. W. Mayhew, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\nI may state that in addition to the regular teacher, Miss Creighton, a manual training instructor, Mr. Emerson, and an instructor in native wool, Mrs. Rice, are employed at this school. In view of this fact, it is exceedingly difficult for me to understand why the repairs to which Mr. LePas refers, particularly the repairs to the windows, have not been undertaken by the manual instructor. It is my intention to communicate with the Indian agent and ask him for a full report on the condition of the school. Just as soon as this report reaches the Department, I shall be glad to communicate with you again.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\nOttawa, March 28, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith copies of correspondence relating to the condition of the Nanaimo Indian Day School. The subject matter of these letters, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nThe records here indicate that certain repairs were undertaken at the Nanaimo School in the summer of 1940 and again toward the end of the year. In view of this fact, it is exceedingly difficult to understand why Mr. LePas found it necessary to discuss the condition of this school with Mr. Mayhew.\n\nThe Department would like to know if it is customary for citizens other than representatives of the Department and clergymen to visit Indian day schools in your agency. No such visits are permitted in eastern Canada, and we feel, in justice to the teachers employed and as a source of protection to them, citizens should not be permitted at will to visit Indian day schools in British Columbia. I should think the law with respect to trespassing on Indian reserves would apply in such cases.\n\nIf windows have been broken at the Nanaimo School, the Department would like to know why these repairs have not been undertaken by the manual training instructor employed at the school. It will be very much appreciated if you can undertake an investigation of conditions at this school at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

I also included an amount of $125.00 in my estimates for that school for further repairs during the current Fiscal year. With reference to the ventilation of the school and the necessity for the new window ventilator, I might say that this school has got along for the past twenty years with the ventilation system as it exists at present so there is no reason why it can't get along for another year or two if necessary, at all events this is not serious. The repairs to the windows can and will be done as soon as the money is available but in the interval nonseems getting hurt and there is really nothing serious the matter, in fact the school is in much better condition than some of the white schools right in Nanaimo City. I have been instructed times without number that I was not to ask for anything during the war that we could get along without, and I certainly think that the ventilation of a school that has been operating for over 20 years can continue to function satisfactorily for another year or two if necessary. Painting will be carried out this year, if funds are provided.\n\nUnder date of March 4th, ultimo I was instructed by the Department in their letter No. 57-152 to have Mr. Layes Insure this school for a period of three years and in my letter to him I asked him to look over the building to see if the risk could be reduced. In due time I received his reply which went forward to the Department under date of March 25th, with covering letter from myself. This explains why Mr. Layes did not consider it necessary to visit this Reserve.\n\nHowever, you have brought up a very important point in connection with the general public visiting Indian houses without permission from units of the same day schools, and your comments are noted regarding the practice in eastern Canada. It is only a matter of time that I took this question up with the Department in the office of the Indian Commissioner, asking that steps be taken to take necessary action under the Indian Act for the protection of our Indians. But I was informed verbally by Major Macdonald that it was considered wise as it might tend to attract publicity to the Trespasser, and although I reported under date of last on this matter I have not yet received a reply or recommendation from the department. My consideration is that the general public in this Province trespass where they please on our Reserves and there is nothing about it; largely because we know nothing about it and it is all over.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nMines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I am particularly interested, of course, in the regulations that permit strangers to visit our Indian day schools especially when these schools are in operation. In an attempt to protect our school teachers to the utmost extent possible, I am disposed to think that visitors should not be permitted to visit these schools except when accompanied by the agent. This restriction would not of course apply to clergymen. It has occurred to me that the whole matter of trespassing on Indian reserves might be taken up by you with Commissioner MacKay. I mentioned the matter to Major MacKay during his recent visit to Ottawa, but the limited time at our disposal did not enable us to discuss the matter very fully.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

H. Moore, who states that the present ventilation system at the Nanaimo School has served the school for the past twenty years and in view of instructions that he had received he considered he would not be justified in asking for anything but absolutely necessary repairs or alterations during the war. Moreover, it is his opinion that the school is in much better condition than some of those for white children at Nanaimo. The agent will have repairs made to the windows as soon as money for the present fiscal year is made available to him, and it is our intention to paint the school and make minor repairs to the classrooms during the year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\n\nR.

Moore, who states that the present ventilation system at the Hanima School has served the school for the past twenty years and in view of instructions that he had received he considered he would not be justified in asking for anything but absolutely necessary repairs or alterations during the war. Moreover, it is his opinion that the school is in much better condition than some of those for white children at Hanima. The agent will have repairs made to the windows as soon as money for the present fiscal year is made available to him, and it is our intention to paint the school and make minor repairs to the classrooms during the year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\n\nR.

I might say that the latter's estimate was the lowest and the one which I will quote below. I am listing the repairs in the order in which they should be done depending on their importance at this time.\n\nGenerally agreed that the roof must be reshingled the cost of which is given below:\n- 24 M #1 XXX Shingles @ $3.75 = $90.00\n- 48 lbs. Galvanized nails @ .13 = 6.48\n- Labor stripping & shingling @ 3.00 = 72.00\n- 12 gallons of shingle stain @ 1.85 = 22.20\n- Labor staining roof @ 2.00 = 28.00\n\n$215.68\n\nThe exterior of the school is badly in need of painting, owing to the proximity of the building to the salt water the paint has almost all gone off, especially on the sea side, and the lumber is becoming damaged. The cost of this work follows:\n- 12 gallons of paint @ $4.20 = $50.40\n- Labor charge for painting @ 8.60 = 88.60\n\n$139.00\n\nInterior of the school requires to be Kalsomined but this can be left for another year, as the cost of material and labor will amount to:\n- Ventilator should be installed in west wall of school at an approximate cost of $10.00\n- Windows should be repaired and new weight cords installed. Manual Training Instructor could do that job after the School re-opens at an approximate cost of $2.50\n\nPersonally I consider that the first two items, viz., Re-shingling the roof and staining same and also the painting of the outside of the building should be done this year, and I would so recommend.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nThe Secretary;\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nMines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\n(R.M.

(RG 10, Volume 6404, File 832-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa,\nJune 13, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs a result of complaints regarding the condition of the Nanaimo Indian Day School received from Mr. R.W. Mayhew, M.P., I recently wrote to Indian Agent Moore and he recommends that the roof of this school be re-shingled. He estimates the cost as follows:\n\n| Item                        | Cost   |\n|-----------------------------|--------|\n| 24 M #1 XXX Shingles        | $3.75  |\n|                             | $90.00 |\n| 48 Lbs. galvanized nails    | .13    |\n|                             | 6.48   |\n| Labour stripping & shingling| 3.00   |\n|                             | 72.00  |\n| 12 Cals. shingle stain      | 1.85   |\n|                             | 22.20  |\n| Labour staining roof        |        |\n|                             | 25.00  |\n\n$215.68\n\nPlease arrange for the purchase of the shingles, galvanized iron and shingle stain. Under separate cover you will be forwarded an accountable cheque for $97.00 to cover the cost of the labour.\n\nYou may also authorize Indian Agent Moore to have a ventilator installed at a cost of $10.00 and new weight cords installed in the windows at an approximate cost of $2.50.\n\nMr. Moore estimates the cost of painting the exterior of the school at $139.00 including labour and material. It would be appreciated if you would secure prices on applying Insul-Bric to this school. We have tried this on other schools and its cost varies little from the cost of paint. It makes a very satisfactory job and, besides, obviates the necessity of painting the school in the future.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M.

When replying to you on the 4th instant I neglected to refer to that portion of your letter. Today I am in receipt of an account amounting to $47.05 covering the cost of insurance for a period of one year.\n\nI am not aware from what source Indian Agent Moore obtained information to the effect that we would pay this insurance policy. If White is going to do this work and he is required to take out insurance this should be done at his own expense. I should appreciate your so advising Messrs. Wilson & Company Limited whose account is returned to you with this letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.

Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe are enclosing herewith three certified copies of Policy No. 905137 of the Core District Mutual Fire Insurance Company, issued in favour of Johnny White, Cedar, B.C., in respect of a School Bus which he will drive. We were instructed to do this by our Agent on Vancouver Island, who got his instructions from Mr. Moore, the Indian Agent at Duncan, B.C.\n\nWe understand that your department is to be responsible for the amount of the premium for this policy and we enclose our account in this connection. We are uncertain if this will be attended to direct from Ottawa but if not, you will perhaps inform us to whom this should be directed.\n\nIt is, of course, necessary for any person who is to operate a School Bus to have this form of insurance, as permission to operate is not granted by the local Provincial Police until evidence of such insurance is filed.\n\nWe might also mention that we also carry insurance on the Indian Schools attended by the children who will use this bus.\n\nTrusting that you will find the enclosures in order, we are,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nWILSON & CO., LTD.\n\n[Signature]\n\nHC/H\n\nIndian Affairs.

The whole matter of transporting children to this school should be carefully reviewed at the end of June, 1942. In the meantime the teacher should be instructed to prepare a statement showing the number of children transported to the school each day. At the end of each month this statement should be forwarded to this office.\n\nWould it be feasible or cheaper to make use of horse transportation? As you are aware we have no assurance that gasoline and oil will be available for the duration of the war.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nOctober 1, 1941.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to forward herewith a copy of a letter received from Mr. Indian Agent Moore regarding the transportation of Indian children living on the Nanaimo River Indian Reserve to and from the Nanaimo Indian Day School.\n\nIn the last paragraph of Mr. Moore's letter he refers to this matter as having been discussed with Dr. McGill during the brief visit the Director made to Chief Paul White. It is true that this subject was brought up by Chief White at the time but I do not recall Dr. McGill passing any opinion as to what he considered the rate of payment should be or making a decision in the matter.\n\nInspector Barry considers that $125.00 per month is high since it provides for the transportation of not more than fourteen children and in this I am inclined to agree with him. In January, 1940, Mr. Moore wrote to this office pointing out that Chief White could not continue to operate his bus for the amount then allowed and suggested a monthly rate of $110.00, or approximately 15\u00a2 per mile, the mileage travelled being approximately 736 miles per month. This rate would not be excessive for the service rendered and would be in line with what the Department is paying for the transportation of the children attending the St. Catherine's School.\n\nAs it would be out of the question to make other arrangements that would be as satisfactory at any less cost, I would recommend that $110.00 per month be\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nallowed for the current school year and that the matter of transportation at this school be reviewed this coming summer or immediately following the close of the term in June.\n\nWith reference to the second paragraph of Mr. Moore's letter, there is no information on file here which would indicate that the Department agreed to assume responsibility for the payment of such insurance but it is possible that the Department may have had some correspondence with Mr. Moore on the subject of which we have no record. Such protection is, however, considered necessary and as Chief White is unable financially to meet the costs himself, the Department might consider doing so for this year at least, or until such time as better arrangements can be made.\n\nI should appreciate the Department's decision in these matters at an early date.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\n/GR\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to previous correspondence and our discussions regarding the transportation for the Nanaimo Indian school children, I wish to advise that Johnny White, son of the Chief, succeeded in getting his \"Class A Drivers License\" and is fully qualified to drive a school bus. He has also made arrangements to buy a G.M.C. School Bus, capacity 14, at a price of $915.00. This car has been inspected by the Police and found very satisfactory; it is a 1939 Model and in perfect mechanical order. He got an allowance of $300.00 for his old car which leaves a balance of $615.00 to pay which he must do at the rate of $50.00 per month. White's License No. is 207.\n\nHe has arranged to take out the necessary insurance covering the bus insofar as theft, fire or accident to the car itself is concerned. However, there is the Public Liability and Property damage Insurance which this Department tentatively agreed to pay and which will amount to a premium of $47.60 per year. However, as we do not use the bus for a year we can apply at the end of the school term\u2014next June\u2014for a refund of one-sixth of the premium. This Policy is being sent to Ottawa by the Insurance Agent direct as we must have coverage commencing next Wednesday and it is going forward Air-Mail this afternoon, with a letter of explanation from the Insurance Agent.\n\nYou will remember that during the visit of the Director, yourself and I to the Chief the question of Salary was mentioned and $125.00 per month was asked. Dr. McGill did not think that amount was too much and I was of the opinion that he would recommend payment at that rate. Actually, when we take into consideration the cost of gas, oil, tires and any necessary repairs nowadays this does not leave very much for the operator when he pays $50.00 per month for the Bus. It amounts to less than 15\u00a2 per mile which is less than half what we are paying for the Cowichan Bus. I would recommend that this matter receive immediate attention and that the above suggested arrangements be made. You might please advise me by telephone not later than Tuesday morning next so that I may make the necessary arrangements for the bus to be in use the following day.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6404, File 832-5, part 4)\nOttawa,\nOctober 3, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department finds it necessary to return your voucher No. 395.

When the Department agreed to allow $110.00 a month for transportation of pupils it was understood that approximately 14 pupils would be carried daily. Please keep a careful check and each month, when forwarding the voucher in favour of White, you should show on the voucher the average number of children carried each day.\n\nOn the date on which Inspector Barry visited the school the bus arrived at the school at 8:35 in the morning. This meant that it must have left the River Reserve very early. You should point out to the driver that the Department considers that he should not reach the school sooner than 8:55 each morning. This will give those residing at a distance a better chance to be ready when the bus passes.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. R.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B.C.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nExtract from Inspector Barry's letter to Major MacKay dated October 27, 1941.\n\nThe transportation of children from the Nanaimo River Indian Reserve by bus continues. I consider the sum allowed this year for this service, $110.00 a month, very liberal indeed. The teacher acting on Departmental instructions is keeping a record of the number of children transported daily. The average for the twelve days on which the bus has been operated this month so far is as mentioned in my report under 7 per day. I asked her to urge these children to attend regularly and I spoke to the children themselves and told them that the bus cost a considerable sum and that if attendance was not good it would have to be discontinued. I made a point of being at the school at 8:50 a.m. but did not see the bus driver as he had reached the school this morning at 8:35 a.m. He should arrange to reach the school just before 9 a.m. and make certain he has not left pupils behind by being too early in starting from the River Reserve.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nLetter No.\n\nOffice of the Indian Agency,\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 3771-3956,\namounting to $112,278.85.15 in favour\nof Central Lumber Company, Nanaimo,\nB.C., Indian Account - Credit Voucher,\nfor payment to Central Lumber Company, Ltd.,\nfor\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental\n\nLetter No. 152-11-5 dated 15-11-5.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa\n\nForm No. I.A. 518\n\nIndian Affairs.

C.\nApril 28th, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDuring a recent visit to the Nanaimo Indian Day School the condition of the steps outside the school and leading up to the doors was brought to my attention. These steps need new stringers and it is thought that there is enough lumber, odd pieces in the right sizes, available in the manual training building and that is not being used for anything else that could be utilized for that purpose. This would save buying any extra material and the pieces I speak of have been on hand for some considerable time so that we might as well make use of them.\n\nThe Manual Training Instructor could do the work but he would have to take another day\u2014or maybe a day and a half to do the job properly\u2014and for which we would be called upon to pay him at the same rate as we pay for his daily services, once a week, viz., $7.00\n\nThe work is of a nature that the boys of the school could not be employed at, as they are quite small and would only be in the way.\n\nThe labor for the entire job should not take more than $10.00 and I would recommend that approval be given for this work to be undertaken as soon as possible.\n\nYours obediently;\n\nD.M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\nVancouver, B. C.\n\n(R.H.

H. Ormond of Nanaimo, on the work required.\n\nI would recommend that this application be approved and, as it is considered advisable to have the work done as soon as possible, the Department's decision at an early date would be appreciated.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nDuncan, B.C.\nMay 18th, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to attach hereto in duplicate a copy of a letter received from Mr. R.M. Ormond, Nanaimo B.C., regarding certain necessary repairs to the furnace of the Nanaimo Indian Day School.\n\nIt has been three years, or will be next winter, since any repairs were made to this furnace and on one of my recent visits to the school I noticed that some of the pipes needed attention as they were breaking away at the joints. I therefore asked Mr. Ormond to inspect the furnace and let me know just what was required to put the plant in first class operating condition again.\n\nI included the sum of $100.00 in the Estimates for repairs to the Nanaimo School and trust that this work can be attended to before the summer holidays commence, as I don't like the idea of the school being open at all during the holidays, for any reason, as there is always something missing or broken afterwards and no one will accept the responsibility. I would therefore recommend that the work be attended to and that it be done before school closes at the end of June.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nD.M.

In this regard I beg to advise that I called on the firm of Walls & Bradshaw to make arrangements for them to proceed with the work as soon as conveniently possible. I left a copy of the original Requisition with the firm and explained how the accounts should be submitted upon completion of the work etc. and returned to Headquarters.\n\nSome days later I received a letter regarding the matter which explains that an error had been made in submitting the original estimate, probably by our own Manual Training Instructor, who did not give the measurements of the building and misinterpreted the labor charge mentioned. However, I discussed the matter with the firm again over the telephone and I find that provision for the porches, steps, basement door and windows had not been made in estimating the required amount of materials, which will amount to $650 more than quoted the first time, or a total of $400.00. The labor costs will run almost twice that amount or a total of $700.00. These costs, I might say are in keeping with prices which have been quoted to me in Duncan, in fact about $15.00 less.\n\nUnder the circumstances, I am sending herewith a copy of two letters in duplicate which I trust will be self explanatory. I would respectfully request that the matter be referred to the Department with a view to finding out if I may have the work done at the new price quoted.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nD.M.

(Ri 10, Volume 6404, File 832-5, part 4)\nOttawa,\nNovember 11, 1942.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of October 1, 1941, and official reply of October 4, 1941, approving, temporarily, the expenditure of an amount of $110.00 a month for transportation of children to the Nanaimo Indian Day School. We do not appear to have received any subsequent correspondence regarding this expenditure but yesterday we received an account for the transportation for the month of October, 1942. On reviewing the statement attached to the voucher it is found that on October 2 only 4 pupils were transported to the school and the largest number transported on any one day during the month was on October 14 when 11 children were carried. On the other days in the month the number transported varied between 4 and 11. The average attendance of pupils transported during the month was 8. Consequently the average cost was approximately $14.00 a pupil and at this rate the average cost per pupil for the academic year would be approximately $126.00 a pupil.\n\nWhen you add to this figure the average cost of the teacher's salary, fuel and other expenses it is evident that it is more expensive to have these children educated at the Nanaimo Day School than it is in a residential school. I am, therefore, inclined to feel that the children from the Nanaimo River Indian Reserve should be enrolled in one of the residential schools and the expenditure for transportation discontinued at the end of the current month. However, as you are visiting the Cowichan Agency in connection with the St. Catherine's Day School, you may possibly have an opportunity of reviewing the situation at the Nanaimo School also. I will await your report with interest.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nStatement\n\nM.

Yoshill (Teacher)\nSir,\n\nThis is to inform you that I met Inspector Coleman also again today. Chiefly to discuss the school bus transportation racket. I was surprised to know that your department was quite prepared to hold back my January salary because of the trouble that occurred at my house. Which should have no business to happen with me it was just because my son brought the bus into the house after I was in bed. The police picked him up in bed sleeping. Naturally I was charged with being in possession. I wasn't even drunk and I have no intention of practicing any such thing. So you may know that there is no need for me to be deprived of my cheque as I own need it. I have to pay $50.00 on the car by the month and...\n$35.00 for the car licence plate $4.00 for my Chauffeur licences. So you can see how badly I need January's cheque. So please be good enough to forward it on the 1st of the month for I shall be expecting it on that date. I am in receipt of a letter from agent Moore dated Dec. 29/43 advising me not to come on the 3rd. I am now going to quote his word thereon. However, this is to inform you that pending any inquiry into the bus transportation of pupils to the Wainwright Indian Day School. You are asked not to take the pupils back when it reopens on Jan. 3rd without further advice. Well gentlemen that does not go to say that my time was seized. I have shown their letter to my solicitor solicitor and he advised I was entitled to my collect. Surely I don't want to do that. Yes! I have been friends and I want to be friends with you forever. So I beg of you gentlemen to settle this in my favor. Sending you our best regards.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohnny Whyte.\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n(RG 10, Volume 6404)\n\nFile 831-8, part 1\nSkeena River Agency - Metlakatla School -\nTeachers' Residence -

(RG 10, Volume 6404, File 832-6, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCAJADA\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nI would refer to your letter of November 11, 1942, file 152-11-5, regarding transportation costs of pupils of the Nanaimo Indian Day School.\n\nIn this connection, I would advise that there was no opportunity of visiting the school until the end of January and early in February when Mr. Inspector Coleman was making an inspection of the agency and discussed the problem with Mr. Indian Agent Moore and Johnny Whyte, Indian, who is the owner and driver of the school bus.\n\nA Crime Report dated December 16th was received from the Provincial Police, copy of which is enclosed, stating that this Indian had been charged with possession of liquor on December 14th and fined $25.00 and costs for having intoxicants on his Reserve. This was referred to Agent Moore, as Johnny White was the driver of the school bus and trusted with the care of children and it was considered that the matter called for some consideration. Mr. Moore was requested to furnish me with his report and recommendations in the matter, and on December 29th last he advised that he had, on that date, informed this Indian not to continue transportation of the pupils until further advice. The driver remained in suspension for the month of January, during which month very little could have been done in any event as the roads were blocked with snow part of the time.\n\nAs the Indian was still paying for the cost of this school bus, I authorized Mr. Inspector Coleman to re-instate him on his visit to the agency if he considered it advisable in the interests of the safety of the children concerned. Following a discussion with Mr. Agent Moore and Johnny White, the Inspector agreed to the bus resuming service, commencing the first ultimo, its continuance pending a future decision of the Department contingent on an improved attendance by those pupils using this\n\nP.T.O.\nservice, and also subject to this Indian not becoming further involved with the police and intoxicants. The responsibility for encouraging improvement in the school attendance was referred to Johnny Whyte.\n\nThis man showed some disposition to object to his suspension and claimed payment for the period, as will be seen from his letter enclosed, but I do not consider his representations should be entertained. He has two more payments to make on his car and some expense in connection with the purchase of his licence and insurance fees which may amount to $100.00.\n\nI am now in receipt of a report for February and find that the daily average of the number of children conveyed is still only 8 pupils which works out at $13.75 per month or 68\u00a2 per day for each pupil. While I do not entirely agree that these children could be educated at less cost at a residential School, as the Nanaimo Day School would, no doubt, continue to operate, I do feel that the costs are too high for the distance travelled and that unless there is a marked improvement by the end of the term that the service might be discontinued.\n\nD.M.

This is a cast iron sectional furnace and the sections are sealed with furnace cement and should be reset periodically. As the furnace is roughly handled, it requires resetting more often than the average furnace. A shaker handle is also required for the furnace. Grates are in good repair and when the fire box is thoroughly cleaned they will work freely. At present a horse shoe is lodged between two grates locking same.\n\nDucts, both hot air and cold air returns are in poor repair. We would recommend installing two new hot air runs as the existing ones are all of the light tin type and have been badly battered. Cold air ducts should be straightened out and resealed. Smoke pipe is in poor shape and should be replaced.\n\nTo carry out the above work and place heating plant in good repair, the cost would be Seventy-Eight Dollars and Fifty Cents ($78.50).\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nH. B. Ormond\n\nIndian Affairs.

Ormond of Nanaimo, B.C., amounting to $78.50.\n\nMr. Ormond will not quote on the materials nor list same until the furnace is pulled down and he can see exactly what is required, although he figures that the amount quoted should cover them.\n\n(R.H. Moore)\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Moore's letter of July 6th with reference to repairs required to the Nanaimo Indian Day School furnace. Mr. H.B. Ormond's letter of June 29th outlining the work to be done at a cost of $78.50 is also enclosed.\n\nAlthough Mr. Moore omitted to make provision in his estimates for these repairs, it is anticipated that there will be a balance available from other repairs provided for and it is recommended that authority be granted to Mr. Moore to have the necessary repairs made.\n\nD.M.

As the furnace can not be lighted at all it is very likely that the school will have to close unless the weather warms up very noticeably within the next few days. If funds can be provided for this expenditure I would recommend that the new furnace as mentioned by Mr. Ormond be installed.\n\nR. H.

I therefore asked Ormond Plumbing Co. of Nanaimo to go down there and make the necessary emergency repairs unless he found that they were going to amount to more than $25.00 when he was to notify me.\n\nI also found that the school is just about out of coal and entirely out of kindling wood. I would therefore ask that I receive the authority to purchase two tons of lump coal at $10.80 and 1 cord of dry wood at $10.00 delivered in bin. This will be enough fuel to carry us through until next fall when we will be getting in our new supply.\n\nR. H.

MacKay\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nPost Office Box 70\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDuring a visit to the Nanaimo Indian Day School just before school closing I found that one of the side doors got broken from the outside after school hours; the exact reason not known although it is surmised that it was accidentally damaged by some of the young men of the Reserve practising lacrosse on the school grounds, one of them getting body checked into the lower panel of the door.

Nos. 2 and 3,\nSchool-age Children.\n\nDuring a recent visit to the above reserves a strong protest was made to me about lack of school facilities for these children. I reviewed the indifference of the parents to the facilities provided by the Department some years ago, to which they admitted, but say that it will not happen again.\n\nThe present set-up on these Reserves, at present, is as follows:\n\n1) Ten (10) children of school age.\n2) No accommodation for them at the white Public School, at Cedar.\n3) Nanaimo School Board has not, so far, consented to our children, from the River Reserves, travelling by their bus into Nanaimo to attend our own school on the Number 1 Indian Reserve.\n4) I can get a Taxi Company, in Nanaimo, to transport our children to the Indian School in the a.m. and take them home in the p.m., at a flat daily rate of five dollars ($5.00). This is a much better plan -- but more expensive than the Nanaimo School Bus, owing to the fact that our own bus would pick up the children right on the Reserve, whereas the regular school bus does not leave the Highway, which, in the case of at least four of the children, would entail a one and one-half (1\u00bd) mile walk to the Highway and the same distance back. This is a long way in wet and stormy weather and, no doubt, would result in irregular attendance. However, if we are going to give these children an education it is going to cost approximately one hundred dollars ($100.00) per month for transportation only, and that is not on a per capita basis, but on a flat daily rate -- which I would recommend be considered.\n\nR. H. Moore\nIndian Agent.\n\nREMEMBER\nNANAIMO DISTRICT BOARD OF SCHOOL TRUSTEES\nDISTRICT NO. 68\n\nOffice of the Secretary-Treasurer\nTelephone -- 34\nNANAIMO, B.C.\n\nSeptember 13, 1947.\n\nR. H. Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDUNCAN, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Moore:\n\nYour letter of August 1st was given much consideration at the last regular meeting of the School Board.\n\nThe School Board is sympathetic with the idea of giving the Indian children the best educational advantages possible, but it regrets it is unable to admit these children into the North Cedar School. The learning situation there is already difficult because of the overcrowded conditions and of our difficulties in obtaining additional staff.\n\nWith regard to conveying the children into the Indian School, the Board feels it cannot permit these students to ride on the school bus. As it is now the transportation problems are sufficiently complicated and allowing these children such transportation would only complicate matters more so. As a suggestion, could you not make arrangements with one of the bus companies to transport these pupils into town?\n\nYours truly,\n\nSigned: \"Ruth Brown\"\n\n(Miss) Ruth Brown,\nSecretary-Treasurer.\n\nRB:es\n\n(EL)\nDuncan, P.

C.\n\nReplying to your letter above noted, I wish to say that the enrollment at the Nanaimo Indian Day School last week-end was 27, with an expected enrollment (as soon as all the families return from fishing and the U. S. A.) of 44.\n\nThere are 36 regular desks and tables, and benches for another 10 in the school at present, which in my opinion is far too many pupils for any one teacher to have.\n\nThe more I think of this school and its pupilage, the more convinced I am that if the children from the River Reserves do come in, another teacher is almost a must.\n\nR. L. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\nSept. 18/47.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nPost Office Box 70,\nVANCOUVER, B. C.\n\nReplying to your letter, date and file number above noted, I wish to advise that a Taxi Company, with a large car, will supply transportation for the Nanaimo School children to and from their reserves at five dollars ($5.00) per day.\n\nWhat I tried to infer was that the regular bus transportation companies, who would be prepared to provide this service, at the same price, did not have a small vehicle for that number of pupils, and of course their large busses would cost much more.\n\nR. H. MOORE\nIndian Agent.\n\nRHM: EI\nDuncan, B. C.,\nSeptember 16th, 1947.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nPost Office Box 70,\nVANCOUVER, B. C.\n\nFurther to my letter, of recent date, re educational facilities for the Indian children of the Nanaimo River Reserves, I attach, herewith, in duplicate, a copy of a letter from the Secretary of the Nanaimo School Board which I hope may be found self-explanatory.\n\nI may say that, in discussing the matter of transportation with one of the companies who is, at present, providing transportation facilities for the white schools, I was informed that the minimum charge which any operator could give would be five dollars ($5.00) per day, or roughly one hundred dollars ($100.00) per month. This company would be prepared to do it at this price but have not got a small vehicle for ten children, except a right-hand-drive which will not be approved as a Public Conveyance.\n\nIt appears to me that the day has passed when we can expect transportation at less than Provincial rates.\n\nR. H. MOORE\nIndian Agent.\n\nRHMiEL\nEncl.2.\nIn reply to your letter, date and file number above noted, I would advise that I visited the Nanaimo Indian Day School yesterday and went over the list of pupils with Mrs. Hill and this is what I found:\n\n28 pupils at present in school,\n16 pupils still to come, when they return from the United States and fishing grounds,\n1 pupil from Nanaimo River already in attendance and included in the 28. (He rides his bicycle to and from school daily),\n9 pupils on the River Reserves still to provide accommodation for, including transportation.\n\nAs you will see from the foregoing, there will be a total of 53 children who should be in school. The school building can not accommodate any more than 36 at the outside, although we have had more in it but it was too crowded.\n\nThe set-up which we may reasonably expect is:\n\n40 to 53 pupils in attendance every day \u2014 which is far too many for one teacher and a one room school. At least 10 or 12 of these are beginners this year. Family Allowances are responsible for the children starting school earlier than under the Indian Act and Indian parents are becoming more educational conscious, particularly the younger married people \u2014 the result being a better feeling toward school which makes for better attendance.\n\nIt is obvious from the foregoing that something has to be done to provide education for the Nanaimo children and I should like to submit, below, a list of suggestions which may have some merit.\n\n1) Open a room in the present Manual Training building (which used to be a school) for Grades 1 and 2 and put in a separate teacher.\n\n2) As Manual Training is taught one day a week only, move benches and tools down to the basement of the present school where it could be carried on in a pinch.\n\n3) If the two previous suggestions are accepted, the installation of electric lights, in both buildings, becomes a necessity.\n\n4) If the first two are not looked upon with favour then open an extra school room in the basement of the Church, which the Indians use as a Church Hall, providing, of course, that the Indians would agree \u2014 which I am not so sure of.\n\n5) If the first suggestion is accepted, then some repairs will have to be made to the Manual Training room before any pupils could be moved in there. Pending this, and if a teacher is available, I believe that two of them could carry on for awhile in the school, as at present, but I should like to talk that, as well as my other proposals, over with Major Davey on the ground.\nIn conclusion, I may say that Mrs. Hill is unable to do justice to herself, or the children, if she has more than 36.\n\nR.

As indicated in Mr. Moore's letter this matter was discussed with him on the occasion of my recent visit to the school. Observations made at this time and information included in Mr. Moore's letter dated September 27th clearly indicate the need for additional accommodation.\n\nThe plan proposed by Mr. Moore is considered satisfactory and the estimate secured by him for the work to be done does not appear to be excessive. It is recommended therefore that this work be proceeded with providing funds are available.\n\nR.F. Davey,\nInspector of Indian Schools for B.C.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am forwarding Mr. Indian Agent Moore's letter of September 10th and subsequent letters from him in connection with the provision of school facilities for Indian children of the Nanaimo Band from which you will note that the only solution to the problem of providing educational facilities for these children is the establishment of a second classroom at the Nanaimo Indian Day School. You will note that District School Inspector Davey, Mr. Doucet and Mr. Moore visited the school some time ago and of the various proposals considered deemed it best to provide for a second classroom in the present school basement.\n\nMr. Moore has secured an estimate of the cost of the necessary work involved and Inspector Davey, reference his memorandum of November 18th, has recommended that the work be proceeded with if funds are available. No specific provision was made in the estimates for this work, but if funds are not available elsewhere possibly $1,000 of the amount allotted to this Province for new school construction could be used for this purpose.\n\nIt is anticipated that we should be able to secure a teacher for a second classroom at this school after the Christmas holidays. I would recommend that the Department endeavour to allot the necessary funds and that authority be granted to have the work proceeded with immediately.\n\nD.M.

I assure you however that our estimate is a very conservative one and is based as follows:\n\n4 Lights in class room complete with fixtures @ 15 dollars each outlet. And as recommended for proper balance of lighting they will be placed at three or four feet from windows and one over teachers desk at rear of class room. Bulbs will be 500 watt aluminum shielded for indirect lighting effects.

In Mr. Moore's letter of September 10th he mentions that there are ten children of school age who should attend the Nansino Indian Day School and that he can make arrangements with the Taxi Company in Nansino to transport the children to the school in the morning and take them home in the evening at a flat daily rate of $5.00. As the purpose of providing the additional classroom at this school was to make accommodation available for these ten children it is presumed that the suggested arrangement with respect to transportation is approved but I should appreciate confirmation of this by air mail.\n\nD.

No information was given regarding the distances that these children reside from the school. Educational authorities throughout Canada agree that children under ten years should be able to walk two miles each way to school daily and children over that age should be able to walk three miles each way daily. If the children reside within the distances just mentioned, it should not be necessary to supply transportation for them.\n\nTransportation at the rate of $5.00 a day means approximately $100.00 a month which appears high for the number of children involved. Is there any likelihood of the North Cedar white school being enlarged and if so, would they be willing to accept the Indian children? It would certainly involve a great deal less expense if they attended this school than to drive them to the Nanaimo Indian school.\n\nIt has been decided to approve the transportation cost at the rate stated in Indian Agent Moore's letter for the balance of the current academic year provided the distance from their homes to the school does not fall within either of the classes mentioned above.\n\nIt should be distinctly understood by all parties\nJanuary 21, 1948.\n\nMr. W.S.

S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nPost Office Box 70,\nVANCOUVER, B. C.\n\nATTENTION: MR. R. F. DAVEN.\n\nI should like to refer to your above letter and particularly the last paragraph of same and would advise that I visited this school a couple of weeks ago and found the exits from the basement room and the washrooms a source of annoyance to the teachers and worry to me.\n\nAs you know, the toilets are upstairs which means that the pupils from the basement room have to go up there. This means that they leave the lower room -- go half-way up the stairs, out the side door, round to the front of the building and then in to their respective washrooms. The doors are either slammed shut or left open and blow shut and the entire building shakes with the impact. It depends on the direction the wind is blowing whether the door stays open or blows shut. If the former, the basement room is like a barn and, if the latter, the entire class rooms are in a turmoil with noise and papers blowing hither and yon.\n\nI reread your communication and felt that we could not go on like it is at present so thought that, if we could have vacuum door closers installed on two doors, we could get along for the current school year and then, next year, the new doors could be installed and the closers transferred from the old doors to the new as they will be required anyway.\n\nThese closers can be installed at a cost of fifty-four dollars ($54.00) and I have asked the Contractor to let me know how soon we could have them put on.\n\nPlease advise if I may incur this expenditure as I have never known of a more distracting situation in any school I have ever visited. The teachers and pupils were continually on edge and the wind was blowing through the building so that it was next to impossible to hear what the teacher or pupils were saying.\n\nR. H. MOORE\nSuperintendent\nCowichan Agency\n\nRHM:EL\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Nanaimo Indian Day School\nYour file 152-11-5 (E)\n\nIn the final paragraph of Mr. Neary's letter of August 16th it was suggested that Supt. Moore should bring to your attention in December the requirements for repairs and replacement needed for the interior and exterior doors at the Nanaimo Indian Day School. Mr. Moore's letter of October 14th attached indicates that it would be desirable to immediately have vacuum door closers installed on two of the doors for the reasons stated.

Moore's letter of November 25th regarding damage to the windows and the door at the Nanaimo Indian Day School. You will note that Mr. Moore plans on having the windows and the door covered with a heavy screen in an effort to control this periodic damage. The cost of the repairs necessary will be approximately $45.00 and I would recommend that this expenditure be approved.\n\nW. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMr. W. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nPost Office Box 70,\nVANCOUVER, B. C.\n\nDuring a recent visit to the Nanaimo Indian Day School it was brought to my attention that several panes of glass were broken. The outside side-door panels were broken through being banged with the football and softball from the playground. The blinds needed to be put up and a pin-board erected in the basement class-room.\n\nTo get away from broken windows (we replace two dozen each year) and doors in the future I asked that the windows be covered with a heavy screen and the side door also covered by a screen, in an effort to control this damage.\n\nThe usual set-up at Nanaimo, with respect to the playground and its proximity to the school building, makes it impossible to prevent breakages unless we take definite precautions and that is exactly what I have done.\n\nShould this door be broken during a holiday or over the weekend the chances are that the school would be entered and supplies stolen.\n\nThe total cost of the foregoing will be about forty-five dollars ($45.00) for which I should like authority to expend.\n\nR.

We note the tables at which a number of the students are working and would appreciate more information regarding their size. We are considering the provision of such tables at other Indian day schools and have found that the standard classroom tables as listed in the various school supply catalogues are too wide for our purposes.\n\nWe would like to know the size of these tables therefore and also any further information concerning their manufacture. It is presumed that they have Masonite tops.\n\nThe Penitentiaries Branch of the Department of Justice is anxious to tender on the manufacture of these tables and they intend to have them made for us at the various penitentiaries across Canada.\n\nBernard F.

The tables shown in the pictures accompanying Inspector Laver's report are 4' wide and 6' long and 30\" high. They are covered with Masonite. We have tables of other types in some of our other schools, for example, at the St. George's Residential School; the tables in use in the primary room are 3' long and 2'6\" wide. Both of these tables are also in use in many of the Provincial schools. It is generally found that the height of 30\" is too high for many of the beginners and at least one table should be provided of 27\" in height for this group. In some cases individual tables with a top surface of approximately 18\" by 24\" are provided, although the Provincial authorities recommend a top surface of 3' by 4' for group tables. It is found that if the room space permits the extra foot in width is desirable. Of the three types mentioned, Inspector Laver prefers the 4' x 6' group table which accommodates six pupils.\n\nThe chairs for primary pupils should be 18\" and 14\" with approximately half of each size provided for each group.\n\nThe tables should also have shelves or drawers approximately 4\" deep. The tables in use in our schools are equipped with shelves and are found to be quite satisfactory and are cheaper than the graters.\nThe cost of the 4' by 6' table runs around $50.00. The 2' by 3' table costs about $10.00. The primary chairs 14\" high can be secured at varying prices but it has been found that those at about $3.00 are the most satisfactory as they seem to stand up better than the cheaper ones.\n\nWherever possible the tables should be provided with Masonite tops.\n\nInspector Davey has requested that he be provided with a flash synchronizer for use in the taking of interior pictures. Mr. Davey has provided himself with his own cameras and is completing a card index of all Indian schools in the province with pictures of each affixed to the cards. This piece of equipment may be purchased for $5.00. It is recommended that the purchase of this be authorized.\n\nW.J. McLean\nCommissioner for I.O.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Voucher 1417 - Cowichan Agency\n\nThis Voucher requests payment of $99.00 covering the cost of transporting children from their homes on the Nanaimo River Reserve to the Nanaimo Indian Day School for the month of September. There is also included in the Voucher an item of $4.00 to interview children. Please let us have an explanation for your reason for this particular expenditure.\n\nIn view of the contents of official letter of January 21st, 1948, we feel that it is advisable to reconsider the necessity for providing transportation. We would like to know the distance the children reside from the school. It is also noted that in the original request for authority to incur expenditure for transportation (see letter dated January 16th, 1948) it is mentioned that 10 children would take advantage of it. A review of the accounts indicate that for several months past, the number transported is less than 10.\n\nPlease let us hear from you.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Transportation of school children\nNanaimo Reserves 2 and 3\nYour file 832-5 (E 1)\n\nWith reference to Mr. Phelan's letter of Nov. 3rd, Supt. Moore in his letter of November 15th attached outlines the reason for the $4.00 expenditure included in Cowichan voucher No. 1417, and in view of his explanation the expenditure is considered to be justified.\n\nWith regard to the continued provision of transportation for children from the Nanaimo River Reserves, accommodation is not available in the white school for these eight children and as their home conditions apparently are satisfactory it is not felt that they should be admitted to a residential school. It is obviously too far for them to walk to school and consequently payment of $4.00 a day for transportation is recommended.\n\n-W. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nDuncan, B.C.\n\nNovember 15th, 1949.\n\nW.S. Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Transportation of School Children:\nNanaimo I.R.'s 2 & 3 to Nanaimo I.D.S.\n\nReference your letter of above date and file, I wish to advise as follows:\n\n(1). The charge of $4.00 by the transportation was to take Mrs Hill to the River Reserves just prior to the opening of school in September so that we might determine the number of pupils immediately available and decide if the bus should be started with the opening of school, or held off for a week or so if the children had not returned to their reserves. This was authorised by me as a precautionary measure to assure ourselves that we would not be providing transportation for two or three pupils only.\n\n(2). As I see the present set-up where the pupils reside a minimum distance of 5 miles from school and a maximum of 6 miles, there is not much that we can do except continue\u2014so long as the present number of children are of school age. If the number get below 6 then we should consider them attending residential school, or, better still, the Cedar Public School\u2014always providing there is room, which there is not at present.\n\n(3). There are eight pupils in attendance from the river reserves, which are the only ones of school age.\n\n(4). There are two trips made daily, one in the morning to pick up the children and take them to school and another in the afternoon to take them home again. The total distance traveled daily is 25 miles, which works out at 20\u00a2 per mile.\n\nR.H.

The amount of your Voucher is $121.02, but the Purchase Order was issued in the amount of $118.15.\n\nThe difference occurred in the fact that you added to the account $2.87 for freight. If you review the Purchase Order you will note that the quotation of $118.15 was f.o.b. Nanaimo, B.C.

INSPECTOR CAIRNS ON THE NANAIMO INDIAN DAY SCHOOL (April 10, 1924)\n\nI discussed the matter of manual training for the boys with the Rev. Peter R. Kelly and Miss Klippert, the teacher. Both of them are anxious to take up this subject in a scientific way.\n\nThey suggested that a partition could be run through the basement and one-half of it used as a manual training room.\n\nI asked Mr. Kelly to interview the manual training teacher for the city of Nanaimo and get from him all the information that possibly could concerning the cost, etc.\n\nWhen I have this information, I will forward it to the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa with recommendations.\n\nR. H. Cairns, Insp.\nOttawa, September 2, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th ultimo, in which you recommend that manual training classes be established at the Squamish Indian Residential School and the Nanaimo Day School. In reply I have to inform you that favourable consideration has been given and I should be pleased if you would inform Agents Perry and Lomas that they should get in touch with proper instructors and each make a definite proposal to the Department. You should explain to them how the work could be undertaken and what equipment will be needed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy Secretary.\n\nR. H. Gairne, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\n402 Holden Bldg.,\nVancouver, B. C.\nOttawa, April 14, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that Rev. P. R. Kelly has again urged the Department to establish manual training activity at the Nanaimo Indian Day School. I have suggested that Mr. Kelly see you and that you present to the Department a proposal and an estimate of the cost of furnishing the equipment and giving the instruction desired.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nA. H. Lomas, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan Station, B. C.\nSir:\n\nHaving referred to your letter of the 14th April last in regard to Mr. R. Kelly urging the Department to establish manual training at Maniago Indian Bay School, I would inform you that difficulty has been experienced in obtaining an instructor, which I hope will be overcome within the next ten days.\n\nIt is expected that the old school building will be utilized as a work shop. I am holding a meeting of the band on the 7th instant when I expect the building will be arranged for.\n\nI might say in conclusion that I am surprised at Mr. Kelly's activities regarding the manual training school while at Ottawa, and would say, that had it not been for unfulfilled promises of assistance on his part, the matter would of already been arranged.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Alfred H. Lomas)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\nSir,\n\nHaving further reference to yours of the 14th April in connection with proposed Manual Training in the Nanaimo Indian Day School, I beg to report as follows:\n\nThe question of a building for manual training has been gone into and the Indians of the Band have consented to allow the old schoolhouse for Training. The old building is suitably situated and affords good light. It will be necessary to have the building re-shingled at a cost of approximately $100.00.\n\nAs regards work benches, these can be procured from the Kuper Island Industrial School, and are the property of the Department.\n\nThe approximate cost of carpenters tools, etc., as per list forwarded me by Mr. R. H. Cairns, Inspector of Indian Schools, for 10 pupils, would be approximately $275.00. In addition to this, material for work would be required, but would not involve a great expense.\n\nI have taken the matter up as regards an instructor and have correspondence from Mr. J. G. Somerville, Manual Training Instructor of Nanaimo City and other schools, who from personal knowledge, I know to be an experienced instructor, who quotes his price at $32.50 per month; this would be two sessions per week, and from 8 to 10 sessions per month.\n\nThe question of holding this training on Saturdays, has been suggested by Rev. P. R. Kelly, Missionary at Nanaimo. Such an action would be unwise indeed. Most of the pupils have a great distance to come to school, and it is thought that having studied all week, it would be detrimental to their health to deprive them of the weekend holiday.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Alfred H. Lomas)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nJune 30, 1925.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nFor some time I have corresponded with Mr. Inspector Caima, Mr. Indian Agent Lomas and the Rev. Mr. Kelly, with reference to commencing a manual training class at the Nanaimo Indian Day School. Work benches can be secured without cost, except freight. The proposed programme will mean $32.50 per month for the instructor plus a small sum for working materials. The only outfit that will have to be purchased now is tools, which can be secured for approximately $250. I am keen on trying this activity at one good day school in B.C. and should be pleased to have your approval for the expenditure.\n\nRussell J. Ferrier\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, June 30, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 798-4-2 of the 19th inst., with reference to manual training activity at the Nanaimo Indian Day School. I note that the old school house can be used for this special activity and that it will be necessary to re-shingle it at a cost of approximately $100. You are authorized to have this repair effected without delay. Secure competitive prices before purchasing the shingles and give the labour to Indians. Labour returns in duplicate should be kept, showing the time of the men employed and their receipts for wages.\n\nPlease make the necessary arrangements to secure a suitable number of work benches from the Upper Island Indian Residential School. The receipted accounts for freight should be forwarded to the Department and reimbursement will be made.\n\nI note that Mr. Inspector Cairns has submitted a list of tools suitable for 10 pupils. The Department considers that the instructor should cooperate in the selection of what is needed and I have to ask you to keep the expenditure in this connection under $250. When you are submitting the account, in duplicate, in favour of the firm given the business, support it with a memo showing the firms asked to quote and the prices quoted.\n\nYou may engage the services of Mr. J. G. Somerville, the manual training instructor for Nanaimo City Schools. Payment at the rate of $4.00 per three hours' session will be allowed. It is understood that there will be two sections per week. Remuneration fees in this manner will be more satisfactory to the Department than so much per month. Please explain to Mr. Somerville.\n\nThe Department agrees that two half days during the school week should be devoted to this purpose and that it will not be necessary to have the special classes on Saturday. Please explain to the teacher that the Department expects her to teach the girls while the boys are at manual training and to give them special lessons in sewing, darning and related activities.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.
