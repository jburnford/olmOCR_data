I have given Miss Hitchcock's qualifications in a previous letter, and I would like to add that she is most anxious to help in Indian work. I have every confidence that she would do good and faithful work on a reserve. I have not heard from you regarding the transfer of Mr. L. Ahenakew from the South School to the North School at Fort a la Corne and of course Miss Hitchcock's nomination is subject to your agreement of the proposed change.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n(Sgd.)

As you are aware, Mrs. Ahenakew was teaching\ntemporarily, at the latter school until June 30,\n1945.\n\nWe have now received another letter\nfrom Bishop Martin, nominating Miss M. Hitchcock\nas teacher of the Fort a-la-Corne South School,\neffective September 1, 1945. We have approved this\nappointment and I enclose the necessary forms which\nyou should have Miss Hitchcock complete and return\nto this office as soon as she begins duties.\n\nFor Deputy Minister\n\nEnc.\nHouse of Commons\nCanada\n\nOttawa, Ontario,\nNovember 20, 1945.\n\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nBooth Building,\nSparks Street,\nOTTAWA\n\nGentlemen:\n\nThanks for yours received today re Harvey Jacobs, R.R. #3 Thamesville.\n\nYes, I am aware that the Department is engaging teachers who take charge of Indian day schools. On my trip north a few years ago I happened to call at an Indian school at Fort a la Corne and was greatly pleased to meet the teacher, who was an Indian. From all I could hear round about she was a splendid teacher and was doing good work. I believe her husband, also an Indian, had one room and she had another, it being a two-roomed school if I remember correctly. What I found, however, was that they were badly in need of maps of various kinds, and I promised to send to that particular teacher, whose name I have forgotten, a series of maps. If she is still there you will likely know, and if so I would be glad to send her maps.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJRM/P. John R. MacNicol.\nOttawa, November 23rd, 1945.\n\nDear Mr. MacNicol:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 20th instant, the teacher who was in charge of the Fort-a-la-Corne a few years ago is no longer there. There are two schools at Fort-a-la-Corne, the North and the South. However, both teachers have been replaced, therefore, the teacher you refer to would not receive the maps were you to send any.\n\nIt is customary for teachers to send in a requisition to this office for supplies which they may require. This includes maps, books, stationery, etc. I, therefore, feel certain that since your visit these schools have requisitioned and received the material necessary to carry out their duties.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. J.H. MacNicol,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nMARCH QUARTER REPORT.\n\nEducation\n\nAll day schools in this Agency have been open during the period covered by this report, attendance at a few schools has been irregular due to cold weather and the pupils' homes being situated at a distance from day school.\n\nA lunch consisting of a hot drink of cocoa with health biscuits was supplied each pupil at mid-day.\n\nWith the advent of spring and warmer weather regular attendance will be insisted upon at all day schools.\n\nH. J. McLeod,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 5, 1946.\n\nMr. H. J. McLeod, Indian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Saskatchewan.\n\nI have just received Inspector Mahood's report regarding his inspection of the James Smith Indian Day School on May 17.\n\nThe Inspector states that the supply of books and equipment should be improved. In this connection I may say that we have not yet received the requisition from the teacher for the classroom supplies for the academic year 1946-47. This should have been forwarded some weeks ago in order to give us time to secure the articles that we supply.\n\nThe Inspector recommends window blinds, screens and a few pictures, to relieve the monotony of the room. You may arrange for the purchase of these.\n\nIt is stated, further, that the walls and ceilings of this classroom should be redecorated. If you consider this necessary, please submit an estimate of the cost.\n\nMr. Mahood states that the present teacher, Mr. Ahenakew, has much to his credit as a teacher. However, the Inspector considers that it would be to the benefit of Mr. Ahenakew and the pupils if he were transferred to some other school and a new teacher engaged. Please let me have your comments on this suggestion.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nReference is made to your letter No.109-4-1 regarding Inspector Mahood's report covering North Day School, James Smith Reserve.\n\nIn regards to his recommendations re. decorating classroom, window blinds, screens and a few pictures. The matter will receive my attention.\n\nWith reference to classroom supplies. Mr. Ahenakew has received all supplies requested by him and, it not satisfactory or sufficient, the fault lies directly on his shoulders.\n\nI am pleased to report that, according to a communication I have received from the Rt. Rev. Bishop Henry D. Martin, Mr. Ahenakew does not intend to continue teaching on James Smith Reserve following termination of the present academic term and the services of a competent teacher are being sought by Bishop Martin for the ensuing term at the North Indian Day School on James Smith Reserve.\n\nN.J. McLeod,\nIndian Agent.\nJune 20, 1946.\n\nMr. N. J. McLeod, Indian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Saskatchewan.\n\nYours of 12 June refers to the intended resignation of Mr. Ahenakew as teacher of the James Smith Indian Day School (North).\n\nPlease ensure that his letter of resignation is forwarded to this office if he still intends to discontinue his teaching duties. We would also like to be informed as to the disposition of his funds in his Retirement Fund account.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nThe following report on the affairs of Duck Lake Sask Agency, covering the period 1st April to 30th April, 1946.\n\nEducation:\n\nAll day schools in this agency were open during the period covered by this report; reasonable satisfactory progress was noted, attendance fair, discipline fair. All day schools closed on June 28th, fo the annual holiday season.\n\nThe following Day School Teachers have handed in their resignations.\n\n1. Mrs E.G. Carlin, Whitesap Moose Woods Sioux, Dundurn, Sask.\n2. Mr. L. Ahenskew, James Smith Reserve North, Fort la Corne, Sask.\n\nReplacement teachers will be required for commencement of the September 1st 1946 academic term.\n\nN.J. McLeod,\nIndian Agent.\nTo Whom It May Concern:\n\nL-12835 (WO) CSM F.C. Dey.\n\nThis NCO has served with this Regiment continuously since April 1940 with the exception of time spent on courses.\n\nHe has been employed as an Orderly Room Clerk, Pay Clerk and Postal.\n\nDuring the last eight months - January-August 1943 he has been Educational NCO for the Unit.\n\nIt will be seen that CSM Dey has occupied positions of trust and responsibility during his service with this Battalion. Performance of these duties has been entirely satisfactory. He has always had plenty of initiative and good judgment into heavy tasks he has undertaken.\n\nHe has our complete confidence.\n\nI unhesitatingly recommend CSM Dey to anyone fortunate enough to receive his services.\n\nThis Unit repels the loss of CSM Dey because of his being selected for work in an active theatre of war.\n\nF.A.

Indian Agency covering the period July 1st. to Sept. 30th, 1946 is respectfully submitted.\n\nEducation\n\nAll day schools in this Agency, except Moose Woods Sioux, re-opened on September 3rd for the ensuing academic term. Following the duties at James Smith North Day School.\n\nTo date the services of a teacher for Moose Woods Whitecap Sioux Day School has not been found and every effort is being made to locate a suitable teacher. Attendance at all Day Schools now open has shown a marked improvement. Parents of Indian children in attendance at Residential Schools and are insisting that their children attend Day Schools on their Reservations, with the results that the seating accommodation at all Indian Day Schools is taxed to the limit and in a few cases overcrowding has resulted.\n\nTwo Indian families of John Smith Band are sending their children to a white day school adjacent to their reservation. The reasons given by the parents are that they do not want their children associating with white children.\n\nN. J.

(RG 10, Volume 6284, file 608-1, part 3),\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nReference is made to your letter dated November 20th., your file No. 109-4-1 (W.T.l.) regarding condition of the Teacher's Residence at North Day School on James Smith Indian Reserve.\n\nWith reference to the remarks of Bishop Martin quoted in your letter regarding the condition of teacher's residence being responsible for the resignation of Mr. Dey, I cannot agree with Bishop Martin's views. The teacher's residence is warm and clean, it is definitely not failing apart and furthermore Mr. Dey did not intimate to me that the condition of the residence had anything to do with resignation.\n\nTrue the interior should be repair, old plaster removed and the interior replastered and furnace repaired or replaced with a new furnace. Cement cistern should be installed, fences repaired and school yard cleaned up, also all buildings painted on the exterior. However, I wish to make it clear that the premises and buildings are definitely not in an unhabitable condition.\n\nThe school building admittedly is too small to accommodate the number of Indian children in attendance. All of these matters were discussed by me with Mr. Dey and he is well aware of the fact that due to shortages of materials and skilled labour nothing can be done about the matter at present, especially during the cold weather months. It is my intention to have necessary buildings completed in the future and I have discussed with Mr. Dey future plans for proper buildings to be placed on James Smith Reserve for educational purposes.\n\nMr. Dey has never indicated to myself that the teacher's residence was entirely unsatisfactory and he is well aware of the fact that during the war years we were unable to carry out a building program.\n\nI realize the difficulty Bishop Martin is confronted with in regards to securing the service of satisfactory Indian Day School teachers, in fact a shortage of qualified teachers is prevalent throughout this Province. However to lay the blame on our Department buildings is definitely not the solution to his problem and I can assure Bishop Martin a large number of outside teachers are living in hotels at so called tenements in white settlements in comparison with the teacherage at the North James Smith Reserve School.\n\nI am definitely of the opinion that Bishop Martin is not aware of the reasons for Mr. Dey leaving and on my next visit to Prince Albert I will call and discuss the matter with him personally.\n\nIn the meantime I do not feel that it is wise to recommend any further expenditures in connection with the teacherage and School class room, as I am definitely of the opinion the only proper solution is to erect new buildings as and when materials and skilled labour become available.\nNo doubt equipping all Day School teacher's residence with proper furniture and kitchen equipment would be an inducement to qualified teachers assuming the duties, however I hesitate to recommend such expenditures as it would mean a large outlay not only now but in future years.\n\nIn conclusion allow me to state that the only solution to the problem, as I see it, in regard to securing the services of qualified teachers is to have all Indian day school teachers under the Civil Service Commission free from missionary services and hired directly by the officials of our Department. This method coupled with an upward revision of salaries would produce results.\n\nThe following sums have been expended in decorating and cleaning the North Day School and Teacher's Residence during the month of August 1946.\n\n|                | Materials | Labour |\n|----------------|-----------|--------|\n| North Day School | 40.00     | 50.00  |\n| Teachers Residence | 50.00     | 50.00  |\n\n$190.00\n\nN.J.

Erect a new combined teachers residence and class room in a suitable location approximately five miles distance from our present day school buildings.\n\n2.

Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor\nof Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.,\n\nJames Smith North Indian Day School\n\nPlease find attached a self-explanatory letter from Mr. Indian Superintendent McLeod concerning his plans for the James Smith North Indian Reserve.\n\nIt is presumed that you are aware of these recommendations.\n\nBernard F. Heary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nBFN/HH\n\nEncl:\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: James Smith North Day School (605)\n\nProvisions are being made in our 1950-51 estimates for finances to cover costs of enlarging class room accommodation at this school.\n\nTwo day schools are now on this particular Indian Reserve, one located near the north end of the Reserve and close to Department farm buildings; the other located seven miles south and towards the south end of James Smith Reserve. The Indians homes located on this particular Reserve are scattered over an area of approximately sixty square miles, with the highest number adjacent to the area served by the north day school with the results that the class room at this particular day school is overcrowded. Whereas, an increased attendance could be accommodated at the south day school, however, this is doubtful as 29 pupils are now available.\n\nThe following shows the number of school age pupils and under school age children of James Smith Band:\n\n| School Age | Under School Age |\n|------------|------------------|\n| Area North School - 42 | 65 |\n| Area South School - 29 | 65 |\n| Total | 71 |\n\nTo overcome the difficulty here on James Smith Reserve in connection with providing additional accommodation is a problem that requires careful thought with an eye towards the future.\n\nThe farming area of James Smith Reserve all lies towards the southern part of the Reservation, however, at present the wooded area from which supplies of fuel wood is available to our Indians therein lies towards the north, with the results that I believe our Indians will reside in greater numbers in the future towards the wooded area.\n\nIn view of the foregoing I believe we should increase class room accommodation at the north day school and move the south day school and teacher's residence approximately one mile west and one mile north from its present location moving the south day school will provide for an increase slightly in attendance and possibly absorb a few children of school age now in attendance at the north school. This move will also place the buildings in a more central part of the southern end of the Reserve and at the same time place the buildings adjacent to good water supplies. I might add here that water supplies are not available at the present site of the south school and water for use of teacher and school is being hauled a distance of approximately two miles.\nI therefore recommend that consideration be given to enlarging the class room at the north day school by additions to the present building or by erection of a new two room day school at this location. I might add that the present school building at the north is old and will require considerable repairing in the near future. It is of log construction and sheated outside and inside.\n\nW. J.

Schmidt,  \nIndian Agent,  \nDuck Lake.\n\nDear Mr. Smith:\n\nIn conversation with Miss Jean McKay, Prince Albert, the other day her correspondence with you, with regard to our pre-mission tests, was referred to. I suggested to her that, since I was more familiar with the situation leading up to this correspondence, it might be well for me to write to you in the matter in order that any misunderstanding might be readily smoothed out.\n\nMay I refer to the organization under whose guidance our premission tests are arranged? Three inspectorates combine in the scheme; namely, Kinistino, Shell Lake, and Prince Albert. Our Examination Board consists of the three inspectors, a representative from each of the three Inspectorial Teachers' Associations, and one from the city schools of Prince Albert. Miss Jean McKay is the secretary of this board. As I have intimated, the test papers are prepared under the direction of this board. A test paper for each subject is provided to each pupil in a school. For this service each school board contributes the sum of $2.00 for each room in the school. I must point out that the tremendous burden of work that this service imposes can be carried only if the trustees cooperate freely, as they did in the past, and that the burden is carried by those who use the service to teachers and pupils is of utmost importance.\n\nSome of the Indian schools have been receiving this service mainly these schools in the Shell Lake inspectorate. The plan has followed that for our secretary to send an invoice in June, I think, to the Agent on the basis of $2.00 per room, for the year. We inspectors... (text not legible) and that this was the regular course to follow, and I submitted to our secretary advise each Agent accordingly for these schools which have a good-sized enrolment in the middle and upper grades.\n\nThe Indian school teachers have been themselves purchasing a set of papers, that is, one copy of each test in each subject for all grades. This has cost them $1.00. Some of these teachers have been obtaining papers from neighboring rural schools, but this is not satisfactory, as perhaps the main value of the papers is the information they give of the curriculum as a guide to the teacher for the following year. I should think that one set of the papers would be sufficient for such a school as that on the John Smith Reserve, as there are few pupils above the primary grades. I know that Mr. Waite would much like to have this service.\n\nI hope that this explanation will make the situation clear, and we may look forward to your cooperation in the matter of the schools under your jurisdiction.\n\nSigned, J.T.

I suggested to her that, since I was more familiar with the situation leading up to this correspondence, it might be well for me to write to you in the matter in order that any misunderstanding might the more readily be smoothed out.\n\nMay I refer to the organization under whose guidance our promotion tests are arranged?

I need not point out that the tremendous burden of work that this scheme involves can be carried only if the trustees cooperate freely, as has been the practice in the past, and that the burden is carried only because the service to teachers and pupils is of utmost inalienable value.\n\nSome of the Indian schools have been receiving this service, mainly these schools in the Shell Lake inspectorate. The practice is followed there for our secretary to send an invoice in triplicate, I think, to the Agent on the basis of $2.00 per room, for his approval. We inspectors understand that this was the regular course to pursue and suggested that our secretary advise each Agent accordingly for those schools that have a good-sized enrolment in the middle and upper grades.\n\nSome of the Indian school teachers have been themselves purchasing a set of papers, that is, one copy of each test in each subject for all grades. This has cost them $1.00. Some of these teachers have been borrowing the papers from neighboring rural schools, but this is not very satisfactory, as perhaps the main value of the papers is the interpretation they give of the curriculum as a guide to the teacher during the year.

Where the teacher has purchased the material himself, I think it has been in this form. It would seem to me that one set of the papers would be sufficient for the Indian Day schools in the Prince Albert inspectorate, since there are so few pupils above primary grades in these schools. I cannot, of course, speak for the schools in the other two inspectorates.\n\nAs an inspector with schools under his supervision the tests are of almost invaluable service as they provide a standard check of progress and of ground covered. The pupils' answer papers are kept in the school until the next visit of the Inspector, when he checks them over and discusses the situation with the teacher.\n\nI shall be glad to know your disposition of this matter for our instruction and that of the Indian Agents concerned. I should appreciate a reply at your earliest convenience, as the papers are mailed out by the first of June.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Omlington,\nInspector of Schools\n\nPrince Albert, Sask., May 16, 1936.\n\nThe Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe: Inspectorial Promotion Tests in Indian Schools\n\nFor two or three years past some, I think, most of the Indian day schools in the Prince Albert, Kinistino, and Shell Lake inspectorates have made use of the promotion tests prepared for these three inspectorates. In some instances there appears to have been some difficulty in getting the requisition approved for their payment. I would refer to the letter of your Department under date of April 29, 1935, to Mr. G.P. Schmidt, Indian Agent, Duck Lake, Sask., a copy of which was forwarded to me.\n\nTwo of three of the teachers of Indian Day Schools in this vicinity have again expressed their desire to have the promotion tests this year. I, therefore, thought best to lay the whole situation before you, as suggested by the examination board, in the hope that the matter might be cleared up once for all.\n\nMay I refer to the organization under whose direction and guidance our promotion tests are arranged? Three inspectorates, viz., Prince Albert, Kinistino, and Shell Lake, combine in the scheme. Our examination board consists of: the three inspectors, the president of each of the three inspectorates' teachers' associations, and one from the Principals' Association of the city of Prince Albert. The preparation of these papers, as you will appreciate, involves a tremendous amount of labour, which is done gratis. Expense is involved in printing the question papers and in clerical work in their distribution. The service to schools consists in supplying each pupil with a separate paper for each subject, that is for pupils above Grade III, and for about half of the subjects in Grades II and III. For this service a charge of $2 per school or room has been found to balance our books satisfactorily.\n\nAs I have indicated some of the Indian schools have been receiving and appreciating this service. I think some of the teachers have been paying for the material themselves. Some have been borrowing it from a neighboring public school, giving the tests on days following the dates on our time-table. I would point out that this last plan is not very satisfactory, as perhaps the main...\nOttawa, May 21st, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, with reference to using Inspectorial Promotion Tests in certain Indian day schools.\n\nI would appreciate if you would communicate with Mr. G. F. Schmidt, Indian Agent, Duck Lake, Sask., who is being authorized to purchase whatever is required by the teachers in the above line.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nJ.

You will remember that the Department wrote you regarding this matter in official letter of April 29th, 1935.\n\nYou should consult the teachers of the day schools in your Agency and arrange for providing them with the test papers which you consider are absolutely necessary. Payment for these will be made on receipt from you of a properly certified voucher, in triplicate.

I am sorry to ask your further consideration of this matter.\n\nMr. Schmidt, Indian Agent, Duck Lake, Sask., to whom your letter referred, has been good enough to approve of these tests for the Indian day schools in his agency. You will note, however, that my letter refers to \"Indian Agents\". I am sorry that I did not make it specific that some of the schools referred to lie in the Leask or Mistassini Agency, (I am not sure of the name) Mr. Davis being the agent. Some teachers in his agency have again approached me to write you that they may have the same privilege as the schools in the Duck Lake Agency. Three schools in Mr. Davis' agency have approached me, viz.: Ahpahkakoops, Wm. Watts, or Sturgeon Lake, and Little Red.\n\nActing on the intimation of your letter may I suggest that you refer this matter to Mr. Davis, Agent, Leask.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is expected that there will be a small surplus left which would be sufficient to cover the cost of the minor repair to the chimney. I beg to request authority to use it for that purpose.\n\nI recommend that authority be granted to purchase 3 packets of kalsomine and one kalsomine brush for the purpose of kalsomining the kitchen mentioned, at a cost not exceeding $4.00.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nS.H.

Richford, Teacher at the Fort a la Corne North Day School, has requested to be supplied with the items as listed on the attached form No. 37, in triplicate.\n\nThe lock on the children's dining room is broken beyond repair. Four inside-door-locks in the Teacher's residence are broken off and the doors cannot be kept closed. These locks were broken off a number of years ago.\n\nThe water and refuse pail is required to replace those that have been in use in the children's dining room and are now worn out.\n\nThe water fountain in the school is rusted through and is of no further use. A stoneware crock could be used to replace it at less cost than a new fountain.\n\nI recommend that the items requested be supplied.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nS. H.

The fencing around these grounds is down in many places and requires to be rebuilt. The old covering of the school well is rotting and a new one is required.\n\nForm No. 37 in duplicate is enclosed, listing thereon the materials required and an estimate of the cost of labor to complete this work.\n\nI recommend that this work be done and that Indians be employed to do it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. H. SIMPSON,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nSHS/B\nDuck Lake, Saskatchewan\nJuly 22, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to Departmental letter No. 109-9-5, dated the 18th instant, pertaining to my letter of May the 22nd last, in connection with repairs required at the Fort a la Corne North Day School, it appears that my letter has not reached the Department. A copy thereof, together with Form No. 37, in duplicate, listing the materials required, also an estimate of the cost of labor, are attached hereto.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. H. SIMPSON,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nSHS/B\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6285, file 608-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa,\nAugust 8, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd ultimo with reference to painting and repairs at the Fort a la Corne North Indian day school.\n\nIn the current year's appropriation it was only found possible to include the amount of $300.00 for repairs, improvements and new equipment at the schools in the Duck Lake Agency. We have already authorized expenditures of approximately $172.00. This leaves a balance of $128.00 still available.\n\nIf all the work requested for the Fort a la Corne North school were done the amount available would be considerably exceeded. Owing to the present setup of our appropriation this is not possible to consider.\n\nYou may purchase the 6 screen windows and arrange for the repairs to the fence at a total cost for material and labour of $19.15.\n\nWith regard to the painting it is considered that owing to lack of funds you should only do the interior painting this year. In view of the fact that this work will have to be done at once in order to have it ready before the school re-opens after the summer holidays you may arrange for local purchase, from firms on the approved list, the quantity of paint required for the interior painting of the school and teacher's residence if you consider that this is necessary. It is understood from your letter that Indian labour only will be employed to do this painting.\n\nYours truly,\n\nS. H. Simpson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\n\nR. A.

(RG 10, Volume 6285, file 608-5, part 5)\nThe Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am writing your office again after an interval of four years in the matter of providing Promotion Guide material for the Indian schools in this area. In this connection I would refer to your letter to me under date of May 21, 1936, and of June 13, 1936. I would also request that my letter to your Department of May 16, 1936, be read in considering this matter.\n\nIn the intervening years some misunderstanding has arisen in the case of some schools. I think with the change of teachers in some schools has been the main cause. It is possible, too, that the Agents of the Department, concerned, have either forgotten your Department's instruction of four years ago or interpreted your instructions to apply only to the one year, 1936.\n\nThe school inspectors (now superintendents) concerned in conference recently expressed themselves strongly as to the value of this material in their supervisory services to the schools, concerning which I wrote on May 16, 1936. As president of the organization for the preparation of this material I was requested to write your office and petition for your approval to the Indian agents for its purchase. It seems to me that as to whether it is really needed in a particular school is one that should concern the individual teacher and the superintendent. The enrolment varies and it is evident that with pupils in grades I and II only this service is not so vital. Might I respectfully suggest that your office write the two agents concerned instructing them to approve the purchase of this material should the teacher request it. Perhaps it is too much to suggest that your instructions be so worded that we need not have to approach your Department in the matter again.\nOttawa,\nMay 25, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 18th instant with reference to supplying Promotion Guide material for the Indian schools in the Carlton and Duck Lake Agencies. Our funds are so limited that it is impossible to give favourable consideration to this expenditure at the present time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J. T.

Although no authority was given for this expenditure the account is being paid. However, it is noted that 9 panes of glass were broken in the residence and the same number in the school. Please let me have an explanation for the breakage of so much glass. Was it due to any carelessness on the part of the teacher?\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. S.H.

Richford, teacher, that since he has been in charge of this school as from September 1st., 1938, one glass at the school was accidentally broken by a foot ball and two were broken at the teacher's residence owing to a storm window being blown off in a high wind. The glass required was chiefly for storm windows, which have not been repaired for a number of years.\n\nThe reason that authority to purchase this glass was not applied for was due to a requisition made by this office on July 29th. last for glass and putty for Department buildings being returned with a note advising that there was a standing authority for inexpensive minor repairs as may be necessary.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nS.

The buildings at the South School also should be done,\nbut at present are in better condition than those at the other school.\nBoth these items are listed in the estimates.\n\nS.H. Simpson,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nIn the 1944-45 Estimates, Duck Lake Agency, a request was made for interior decorations of the teachers' residence, at John Smith's Reserve, Moose Woods Sioux Reserve, James Smith Reserve, and Kinistino Reserve.\n\nI would recommend that these be approved of and granted. Mr. Simpson, the Agency, states that with respect to the interior decorations at the John Smith Day School, and floors in the dining room and hall way are badly worn and in the first place there is only a one-ply lumber. There is sufficient experienced Indian labour on the reserve to do the work.\n\nThe Agent also request that if funds are available outside repairs be made to the Fort a La Corne North Indian Day School. This building is in bad need of re-painting. I also notice that the South School on the same reserve could do with a re-painting but at the present time it is in better shape than the school north of it.\n\nM.

Morris, of Welfare Division, to proceed with necessary repairs at a reasonable cost as soon as possible.\n\nN.J. McLeod,\nAct. Indian Agent.\nOttawa, July 6, 1944.\n\nMr. N. J. McLeod, Acting Indian Agent, Duck Lake, Sask.\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, with reference to the damage to the James Smith Indian Day School. It is noted that you estimate the cost of repairs at $150.00.

However, before requesting for authority to make any expenditures for mid-day meals I would appreciate having your ruling as to what is considered the proper procedure to follow.\n\nSince the opening of day schools on September, 2nd I have visited all Day Schools in this Agency and have requested the day school teachers to have a meeting of the Indian women and discuss this problem with them and at the same time prepare a sample lunch as a demonstration for their future guidance in preparing lunches for their children's mid-day meal while attending day school.\n\nN.J. McLeod,\nA/Indian Agent.\nOttawa, 18th September, 1945.\n\nMr. N.J. McLeod, Acting Indian Agent, Duck Lake, Sask.\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant with reference to mid-day meals supplied at Day Schools in the Duck Lake Agency. As you state, the Department feels that in view of the payment of Family Allowances, it can reasonably be expected that Indian children should receive better meals and the parents should be able to provide them with better lunches than in the past.\n\nWe have no intention of totally refusing some assistance towards the mid-day lunch at some schools but we feel in future our assistance should be confined to serving a hot drink plus the special biscuit which has been prepared under the direction of the Medical Services. We have already ordered the following quantity of biscuits for schools in your agency and it is expected they will arrive shortly:\n\n- James Smith Day School: 450 lbs.\n- John Smith: 300 lbs.\n- Fort a la Corne: 400 lbs.\n- Kinistino Day School: 600 lbs.\n\nIf you consider it necessary you can shift the quantity of biscuits in any way you consider advisable.\n\nAuthority is granted for the purchase of cocoa and milk required to serve a hot drink during the winter months at the four schools in your agency.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n| Item Description | Quantity | Unit Price | Total |\n|------------------|----------|------------|-------|\n| 2x4x6 Spruce     | 20       | $0        | $0    |\n| 2x4x14 \"         | 4        | $7        | $28   |\n| 2x4x5 \"          | 12       | $6.5      | $78   |\n| 2x4x5            | 4        | $3        | $12   |\n| 1x6x12 Spruce Flooring | 8    | $2.82     | $22.56|\n| 1x10x5 Spruce S4S | 8        | $2        | $16   |\n| 1x6 Spruce Drop S4S | 120  | $19.84    | $2380 |\n| Com.

Heating and ventilation are satisfactory.\n\nFloor - Clean at times of visit. Recently scrubbed. Provisions made for new boys only are in 3 months. Properly school boards or other schools think that the health and education of their children demand that school be scrubbed at least twice a month. The Indian school should be scrubbed at least once a month.\n\nClosets - Both uncleaned - Carpets not satisfactory condition. Boys' rooms are uncleaned.

(We should have an electricity line.)\n\nGENERAL REMARKS\n\n(Under this heading the Inspector should report upon the general management of the school and offer any suggestions for improvement he may wish to make.)\n\n1. Grading under \"Inspector's Examination\" unsatisfactory. Pupils are young and deficient. Percentages given are uncertain determination of standards. An offer statement from inspectors as to how school is functioning in preparing Indians for living would be more to the point, would be more stimulatory to the teacher, call for views from the inspector and yield true information to the department. Why not use the regular reports forms of this province sending Trustees Report to Indian agent.\n\n2. Management of work is generally satisfactory. Reading and language both oral and written should receive most prominent attention. The library should be better supplied with reading matter suitable to these children. I have commented the efforts to train habits of caution and cleanliness also the utmost taken in household science generally. This I believe should be an important part of the work. The great function of this school should be the setting up of these ideals, the establishment of these attitudes and the forming of these habits that make for success in life. These are the abiding things woven into the fabric of the character of the individuals that stick and influence long after information may be forgotten. There also are the things that come only with the good teacher and can not be measured with a yard stick and definitely reported in percentages. Your teacher I think is well endowed by nature to give such training.\n\n3. Salary of teacher is too low to hold the good man. It is a little better than half the average salary in this province.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This is a trifling matter, and I am sure if blinds had been requisitioned for they would have been supplied.\n\nWith regard to the scrubbing of the floors, it would appear that the teacher had instructions that provision should only be made for scrubbing the school once in three months; this is an order I have heard nothing of, and the school should be scrubbed once a week or at least once every two weeks.

Good intuition. Methods very fair but would be improved by training.\n\nHealth: Good\n\nSuccess: Doing well. Has confidence of class. Keeps grounds and schoolroom neat and tidy.\n\nSuggestions: See last report re training of teacher.\n\nIf you have a well trained and successful teacher in any of your Indian schools would advise that you send Mr. Goodman to visit him for at least a week.\n\nA suitable library would help the teaching. A supply of books suitable to these children should be at once provided. Would suggest that the teacher make his own selection. He knows the pupils intimately and knows what will interest them.\n\nREMARKS RELATIVE TO THE EXAMINATION OF THE PUPILS\n\nAttendance very irregular and unpunctual. No school can do its best work under such circumstances. Considering this the school has made fairly satisfactory progress. Eight of the pupils have been legitimately advanced a grade since last visit. The real improvement is noted in the tone, the more general brightness, the wider interest and the greater responsiveness and power of expression. While the advance is not great it is real and in the right direction and indicates a force at work and the inertia overcome. Standing of grades is not generally on a par with that of corresponding grades of public schools of my Inspectorate. This I think cannot be expected. The average intelligence is probably lower. Standing in reading only fair; writing and spelling above average; language written and spoken poor; arithmetic fair. Reading and language should be stressed and should be based on material that appeals to interest of child.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDATE OF INSPECTION: June 28, 1923\n\nIndian Affairs.

A clean, orderly tidy environment is highly important.\n\nReading and language, both oral and written should receive most prominent attention. See remarks re library. The teacher must keep ever before him that he is fitting these children for living; that he is to widen their environment and interests, raise their ideals and brighten their mental machinery and weave into them those habits that make for success in life. Your present teacher has a good appreciation of this.\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the Fort a la Corne Day School situated on the James Smith's Reserve in the Duck Lake Agency.\n\nThe report on the whole is not very satisfactory; the teacher is not qualified, the attendance is poor and they have not made very great strides during the year, if any. While the management of the school is considered good and the grounds kept neat and tidy I doubt very much if the Indians are getting the education they should at this school.\n\nI notice that the Inspector in speaking of the standing of the grades states that they are not on a par with corresponding grades at the public schools of his inspectorate and he goes on to say \"I think this cannot be expected\". I do not agree with the Inspector, my experience has been with the average Indian child that put alongside a white child in a class room he can hold his own every time. I think foreign children receiving training such as the Indian children receive at this school would show perhaps to the same disadvantage.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M.

Mr. Murison is not here at the present time, but I will question him with regard to the moving of the North End Day School to a more central point. He will be able to tell me whether this is profitable or not.\n\nFORT A LA CORNE NORTH DAY SCHOOL\n\nThis school is situated on the north end of the James Smiths reserve. The school room is a modern building with a basement and is heated with hot air. The teacher's residence is a well built frame house with a dining room for the children attached. The buildings are both in a good state of repair and I found both the school and teacher's residence in a clean and tidy condition. There are three boys and six girls enrolled. The average attendance being about 50% of the enrollment. It was 40\u00b0 below zero on the day of my visit and as a consequence only two pupils turned up and these were sent home. Mr. E.B. Goodman is in charge as teacher. He appears to be intelligent and interested in his work. His wife is Field Matron for the reserve; she has had many years experience in the Indian work and I should judge is very capable. Practically all the older children are now attending boarding school, consequently the pupilage available for the day school are all very young.\nInspector's Report on the Fort a la Corne North Day School,\nSituated on James Smith Reserve, Province of Saskatchewan\n\nDate of Inspection: June 30, 1925.\n\nNumber of pupils present: 1 Boys, 3 Girls.\n\nNumber of children of School age on the Reserve: 4 Boys, 10 Girls.

Grade I are beginners; they have but little understanding of English. Method in this work might be improved. Grade III have improved since last visit. Writing and spelling very fair. Language, fair. They need much oral work to cultivate ear and tongue and secure right habits of speech. Pupils read with considerable freedom. They are finding interest in stories and are reading books from library.

This, I think, is a very telling, a very vital improvement. The school is making progress. Pupils are attentive and orderly and show a willingness and a desire to do well that is encouraging. The senior class can do much independent reading. I believe considerable use is made of library. Language while improving requires much attention. The teacher gives much time to oral work.

The fire had just been lit. Many children present. The building was cold and remained so until nearly noon. Such conditions should not exist. When the children arrive the building should be warm and comfortable. Many are not warmly clad and to sit in cold seats shivering is bound to produce illness.\n\nDuring my visit the children were constantly reminded that conduct, forming lines, marching were in preparation for the visit of some archdeacon.

I may say that I met Mrs. McFarlane, the teacher, at Onion Lake where she had charge of a public school and where the white parents of the children spoke very highly regarding her ability as a teacher and her devotion to her work.\n\nThe Inspector comments on the cross light in the school being bad. This matter might be adjusted by changing the windows as he suggests at comparatively small expense. I will look into this matter when I next visit that Reserve.\n\nIt is also noted that the school building was cold until nearly noon on the day of the Inspector's visit and that many of the children are not warmly clad.

As a guide in understanding the child the IQ should be taken and the probable learning rates and Mental Ages determined.\n\nLanguage is a main problem in the school. These pupils hesitate to speak out. I would suggest that care be taken to develop desirable attitudes especially in pride in workmanship. That is greater care in neatness in writing, care of books etc.\n\nI felt that results of the effort put forth by the teacher are showing in the increased attendance and enrolment. Further the community service rendered in the organization of the various clubs and the help given to the men in manual training and to the women in practical sewing and cooking is to be commended. I feel that such work is more in line with the abilities and interests of the individual type as in this community and such should be extended.\n\nRichford is to be commended on his work in this direction. Previously he had taught in a school of fast learners to whom he gave an enriched curriculum. Care should be taken to speak slowly and unhurriedly and to gauge the inspector of schools rate and interest.\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs.

Tests show that there is a wide range in the learning abilities of the pupils and these range from very low in one case to quite average mental ability. Such calls for a very diversified program and equipment. Additional reference books and texts, a more extensive program should be carried out in the upper grades.\n\nSchools in this territory use the Work and Play Series for the junior grades.

The School Plant:\n\nThe schoolroom has just been redecorated and is neat and tidy. Two window panes have still to be replaced. There is a dearth of library and textbooks which reflects seriously upon the progress of the students. These students are mostly in the Junior grades and require elementary texts which they could read. Most of the books in the library and some of the texts used are too difficult for them.\n\nII. Work of the School:\n\nMr. Ahenakow is a forceful teacher, well-acquainted with classroom procedures. He is giving effective leadership in face of such difficulties as irregular attendance and lack of equipment. Reading is the subject to be stressed before one could expect much progress along other lines. There should be provided for this school an abundance of reading material on the Grade One, Two, and Three level. New-type readers which are carefully prepared in regard to their vocabulary load should be provided. The Work-Play Series by Gates and Others, the Easy Growth in Reading Series by Milbreth and Others, would be very useful. Books are needed in other subjects as well, but care must be taken that they are not difficult to read.\n\nMr. Ahenakow and Mrs. Ahenakow are to be complimented on their real interest in the welfare of the students. Mr. Ahenakow is supplying some instruction in Manual Training, while Mrs. Ahenakow instructs the girls in sewing, knitting, and embroidering. This type of instruction is going to be of real practical value to the students and should be encouraged and expanded through adequate supply of materials and equipment.\n\nInspector of Schools\n\nN.B.\u2014ONE FORM TO BE USED FOR EACH CLASSROOM TEACHER\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6285, file 608-6, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe supply of books and equipment at this school has not noticeably improved since my last visit a year ago. The classroom library is practically non-existent and the small number of books which are available for the teacher are not sufficient in number to allow each pupil copies. The room lacks a clock, a globe, supplementary materials, a musical instrument of any kind (guitar, radio, gramophone). If instruction is to be improved equipment of this kind will have to be provided. New desks have been installed but the larger part of the desk equipment is of the old double type. The walls and floors of the classrooms are moderately clean and show evidence of care on the part of those responsible for the upkeep of the building. However, window blinds, screens, and a few pictures to relieve the monotony of the room would be of great value in improving the room. Walls and ceiling of the classrooms should be redecorated this summer. The suggestion that a new floor be laid is a good one; failing this, the present floor should be painted.\n\nPremises are neat and clean. The playground swings need repair and new ropes. The exterior of both school and teachers' house could stand painting in the near future.\n\nInstruction at the school could be considerably improved by securing the books and equipment already listed. It is felt that greater interest in reading would be brought about if reading corners of good quality were provided and if the teacher in charge made use of more progressive procedures. Small reading of the pupils should be of more purposeful nature and should be combined with an effort to make the reading materials more meaningful and more interesting to the pupils. In the handling of the children, also, more attention should be given to making the classrooms an interesting and enjoyable place in which democracy is practised and in which children are encouraged to develop initiative and independence. A wiser handling of the children in the classrooms should be combined with playground supervision so that through organized games and athletic activities a better pupil-teacher relationship will be established. A health and cleanliness program might be instituted in which the children are encouraged towards greater cleanliness and towards the practice of better health habits.\n\nInspector of Schools\n\nN.B.\u2014ONE FORM TO BE USED FOR EACH CLASSROOM TEACHER\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6285, file 608-6, part 1)\nThe present teacher, Mr. Ahmakew, has much to his credit as a teacher. However, I believe it advisable at this time that Mr. Ahmakew be transferred from this school. After a certain period of time in one locality there is a tendency to slip into an instructional \"rut.\" It would probably be of benefit to Mr. Ahmakew and to the pupils of this school were another teacher to be secured for this position. In considering a replacement, I would emphasize that instruction in Indian schools cannot be improved to great extent unless superior teachers with good training are secured. In order to secure such teachers, I believe that it is essential to increase the salary paid for this work.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nSuperintendent of Schools.\nFort a la Corne Indian School\nNorth Day School\n\nDate of visit November 15, 1946\n\nPost Office address of school: Fort a la Corne, Sask.\n\nGrades: I II III IV V VI VII VIII IX\nEnrolled: 7 9 10 3 2 3\nPresent: 5 2 9 3 2 1\n\nTeacher: Frank Charles Dey\n(Name in full)\nLicence (or certificate): Perm.

Floors are swept daily, but at present there is no dustbane on hand. This should be obtained and used daily. The floors are scrubbed once a month, but they are badly in need of paint. The toilets are kept clean by the pupils. All the buildings are in need of paint on the exterior. Windows should be repaired and broken ones replaced. The classroom is poorly lighted, with windows at the left and rear. It is however quite comfortable from the heating standpoint.\n\nThe classroom is extremely overcrowded, 34 pupils \"cramped\" into a space that would adequately seat approximately 10 children. A new school building is an urgent necessity with room for work table, sandtable, radio, and a projector. A shop room and Home Economics room adjoining the classroom would be an asset in cultivating the natural skill that is native to these children.\n\nPlayground equipment should be provided: Swings, teeters, and a football; none of these are on hand with the exception of old swing-poles without ropes. These are unsafe and should be replaced.\n\nThe teacher is very progressive, resourceful, and imaginative, but cannot be expected to stay unless his working conditions are improved. He is doing good work and an attempt should be made to keep him.\n\nInspector of Schools\n\nN.B.\u2014ONE FORM TO BE USED FOR EACH CLASSROOM TEACHER\n\nIndian Affairs.

I feel that she is giving satisfactory service in the school. She maintains a rather fresh viewpoint with respect to teaching.\n\nIt was very pleasing to note that new individual chair-type desks have been placed in the school. The interior has been redecorated. The floor is slivered and needs two or three good coats of floor enamel. The janitor work is satisfactory.\n\nSwings, testers, football, softball equipment is needed to provide recreation for the children.\n\nThere is a great shortage of books in the library. I would recommend the purchasing of Cadmus books for the school. Crayons, scissors, tempera paint and brushes, large sheets of drawing paper or a roll of kraft wrapping paper, modelling clay, are needed for Art. Tonettes and \"Fun with Music\" (RJ Staples--available: Sask Book Bureau) should be placed in the school to provide enjoyment in music for the children.\n\nJohn Estok\nInspector of Schools\n\nIndian Affairs.

The blackboards and floor are poor; the furnace needs repairs. It is also felt that the room will be greatly overcrowded next year, at any rate, within the next few years. The purchase of the new, single chair-type desks is to be highly commended but some of them need minor repairs before they are greatly damaged.\n\nSupplies are adequate in the line of notebooks, pencils, and paper, but more varied art supplies is recommended. Plasticine, modelling clay, paints, construction and weaving material are recommended.\n\nThe library is very poor. The cases in which they are kept are unattractive and there is a lack of good reading material. It is recommended that approximately $25 per year be invested in good children's books for the next few years. The Cadmus books would be very satisfactory for library additions.\n\nThe work of the school is progressing satisfactorily. Mrs. Burbridge is giving her best both as teacher and as a social worker. Her age and illness however, handicap her to some extent. There has been some trouble in discipline but I believe that the matter has now been settled and things are running smoothly. In the future I feel that more practical projects of the time could be devoted to Arts and Handicrafts; Indian children in other schools seem to do very good work and I feel that these should be stressed in both of the day schools. Music and physical education need to be made a part of their school lives. Practical Health Education is very essential in the lives of the pupils and perhaps this could be stressed.\n\nInspector of Schools\n\nN.B.\u2014ONE FORM TO BE USED FOR EACH CLASSROOM TEACHER.\nREPORT OF THE REGIONAL INSPECTOR OF INDIAN SCHOOLS\n\nSASKATCHEWAN\n\nName of School: James Smith North Indian Day School / Agency Duck Lake.\n\nDate of Inspection: November 23, 1951.\n\nDate of opening for the term:\n\nAttendance:\n\n| GRADE | I | II | III | IV | V | VI | VII | VIII | Total |\n|-------|---|----|-----|----|---|----|-----|------|-------|\n| Enrolled | 9 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 19 |\n| Present | 7 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 17 |\n\nNumber of Classrooms: 1\n\nNumber of desks in classroom: 36\n\nName of Teacher: Mrs M.

It should be made one of the most attractive schools in operation with reasonable care and interest on the part of the teacher, and by landscaping of the school grounds.\n\nThe time of my inspection on a Friday afternoon was devoted mainly with an interview with the teacher, Mrs Burbridge, concerning her proposed transfer to the Little Red River Indian Day School at the end of December. However, the pupils were busy engaged in clearing up their weekly assignments. An examination of their exercise books revealed that good work was being done in their classroom. Good use was being made of the school library. At recess the pupils were provided with several varieties of indoor games.\n\nIt may be necessary to supply more heat to the basement during the cold weather, either by an additional pipe from the furnace, or by a small heater. The full basement can be put to good use for many school activities.\n\nE. N.

It is definitely not large enough for a good softball diamond. When the new school is completed care should be taken to clear and level a good sized yard for this purpose.\n\nIt appears that children living on the reserve are only entered in the register if they attend school. I feel that a record should be kept of all children whether they attend or not; perhaps they could be listed in some other portion of the register. I also feel that a revision of the registers in Indian schools is needed. No provision is made for the age of a child or for the number of days he attended in each grade. When a child is promoted during the course of the year the date of such promotion should be recorded. At present this is not done.\n\nA good assortment of library books has been received during the year. I am happy to be able to say that the condition of the library is showing improvement. The teacher has a set of the World Book Encyclopedia (1922 Edition) in the school. While the set is a good one, it is nevertheless too old to be of much value. I feel that a basic reference library is essential and a good set of reference books be provided without having to deduct the books from the library quota.\n\nSupplementary readers are needed so that when the children finish their basic readers they can continue the reading program without \"going over the reader again\". You will realize, I am sure, that it is hard to maintain reading interest by repeating. Supplementary readers are needed for all grades from 1 to 4, one copy for each child. The new Work-Play series is recommended. (MacMillan Publishing Co.)\n\nProgress in Grade 1 appears to be slow. The teacher states that it generally takes two years' school for a child to complete grade one. Grade 2 shows fairly good progress. Other grades are doing average work. I feel that Mrs. Burbridge is giving fairly satisfactory service at the present time.\n\nIt is recommended that a school radio be provided. The school broadcasts are becoming increasingly better and more stimulating. I have seen wonders in Art and Music by using the radio in the classroom.\n\nInspector of Schools\n\nN.B.\u2014ONE FORM TO BE USED FOR EACH CLASSROOM TEACHER\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is urgently recommended that a new school be built either on this or on another location to take care of the needs of the children on this reserve.\n\nThe supplies appear to be adequate with the exception of Art and Handicraft materials. I am given to understand that \u00bd lb of plasticine or modelling clay is supplied to pupils in Grade 1. I suggest that this is of no value whatever. Any quantity less than 1 lb per pupil is ridiculous. I also suggest that the supply be not restricted to grade 1, but be supplied to the primary grades. I would also suggest that tempera paint be supplied to grades below Gr. 1. Creative art should be developed from the time the child starts school, and I do not believe that it is wise to restrict the lower grades to the use of crayons alone. They should be permitted to use tempera at an early age, and they should have large brushes, large sheets of paper, and an adequate supply of tempera powder. Four assorted callers, (four 1 lb cartons, I assume) will not last during the year if used to the extent that they should be used.\n\nMrs. Burbridge has taken a summer school class this year, which is very commendable. I believe she has skill as a teacher but there is slackness in some respects. The bell is not rung punctually at all times. Assignments are not corrected promptly. There is a general weakness in language in all grades, but especially in the lower grades. In some instances parent-teacher relationship is not very good. One boy was out of school for a year as a result of a problem in discipline and a lack of understanding between parent and teacher.\n\nAttendance in the upper grades is good. From any observations I have made it would appear that the average Indian child can progress as well in school as the average white child if given the same opportunity and healthful, stimulating environment. It would seem, however, that the Indian schools are not able to secure the best teachers. Something should be done to make the Indian schools attractive enough for teachers to be happy in their surroundings. This would, I am sure, result in better Education for the Indian.\n\nJohn Estek,\nInspector of Schools\n\nN.B.\u2014ONE FORM TO BE USED FOR EACH CLASSROOM TEACHER.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The pupils appeared quite healthy, and were well-dressed and clean.\n\nTHE SCHOOL PLANS:\nThere is a noticeable difference in the general cleanliness and tidiness of the school since Reverend Grey's appointment as teacher. This is one of the new schools being put into operation in November, 1951. Even with the heavy enrolment, the floors of the class-rooms and halls are in excellent condition. The strip of coconuts matting in the hall helps to prevent wear and tear on the floor. The basement can be fitted up as a lunch room, playroom and project room with little difficulty.\n\nSUPPLIES:\nAdditional supplies of primary seat work material, tents, supplementary reading and sports equipment are needed. It is understood that a special requisition is being submitted for these items.\n\nREMARKS RELATIVE TO METHODS EMPLOYED BY TEACHER:\nClasses in reading and singing were observed. The reading results were quite good. It is suggested, that, in the music period, the children should learn songs more suited to their ages and capacities. There are many good school songs available in the song books recommended by the Department of Education, which children enjoy singing.\n\nReverend Grey is energetic in his teaching and demands a high standard of work from the pupils.

It appears that she works hard, she checks the work very carefully and thoroughly, and obtains good results. Writing in this room is very good in all grades. I saw splendid examples of art work in tempera and crayon; it is suggested that modelling, basket weaving, and other forms of craft be introduced. I believe that Indian children excel in this and they should be given every opportunity to develop their talents.\n\nMusic is perhaps not stressed as much as it should be. It is strongly urged that a battery be provided for the audio-record player and a supply of gramophone records be given the schools. These are not luxury items but an essential aid to classroom activity. We frequently deplore the fact that more money is spent on Tobacco and alcohol than on Education and try to educate the people of the province so that they will feel more has to be spent on Education; I feel that here is an opportunity for our Federal Government to set a good example by providing these teaching aids.\n\nIt is suggested that Reading, Writing, Language, Arithmetic, and Manipulatives be stressed. Social Studies, Healthful Living, Science, (Nature Science) and Music, however, should be given a proper share of the time table.\n\nMrs. Belke performs many duties in the community outside of the school: Church Activities, practical nurse, Junior Homemakers' activities and so forth, and it is felt that she is a decided asset to the community.\n\nInspector of schools\n\nIndian Affairs.

You might deal in a general way with your methods of teaching and state what devices you have used to arouse and maintain the interest of the pupils in their school work.\n\nIt is noted that the enrolment at this school is not so large as it should be. The Department would like to know what efforts have been made to secure a better attendance and to have any suggestions that you may be able to make as to means that might be adopted to stir up the interest of the parents, in order that their children may receive the benefits of the practical education placed so easily within their reach.\n\nMrs. Ada Godfrey,\nTeacher,\nFort a la Corne,\nSask.\nAs stated above the Department wishes you also to deal with your work among the parents and others on the reserve, showing what has been done to improve the conditions of their home life.\n\nThe object in asking for this information is to apply your methods, if possible, in other schools and on other reserves favourably situated for increasing the effectiveness of day schools.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nDear Sir,\n\nYour letter No. 253341/1, dated March 26th duly to hand.\n\nI need not tell you how grateful I am, not only for the increase of salary, but also for the encouraging remarks you make concerning my school. It will greatly add to renewed energy and stimulus in my work during the school year upon which we have just entered.\n\nThe welfare of the Indians; the desire to raise them both morally and physically to a higher standard in life, has been my one aim during the whole time they have been under my care.\n\nTo bring this about, I soon became aware that my work would be of a more extensive nature than just a school teacher of the children.\n\nWhile looking forward to the future generation for great results of my work among the children, at the same time it became quite apparent that unless I could raise the tone of the parents' lives too, my efforts among the children would be partly lost.\n\nTherefore, while ministering to the educational wants of the children, it has always been my endeavor to elevate the parent with the child. It was not an easy attainment.\nto achieve, for the Indians themselves were of the very \"raw material.\"\nThe work has been very uphill, and discouragements have arisen time and time again.\nBut, with God-given strength I have kept on, and the reward is beginning to show itself.\n\nRegarding the enrolment at my school, which you say \"is not so large as it should be,\" I would like to state that I have every possible child of school-age on the Register.\nIndeed, I have even brought in several children under school-age, as well as retained the over-age scholars, in order to get a good average.\nI often wish there were more children in this band, that I could then get a larger enrolment.\nI notice in your letter that you refer to this school as \"Fort a la Corne Indian Day School.\"\nThis is not exactly correct, as there is a school of that name, at Fort a la Corne, proper, 10 miles from here.\nMy school is known as the South Fort a la Corne School.\n\nFrom the very commencement of my work here, it has always been my endeavor to make the children's school life as attractive and interesting as I possibly could.\nKnowing that the maintenance of the child's interest...\ninterest is the first step to education. I have sought by all possible means to arouse and keep up this interest.\n\nThe mastering of the \"three R's\" is always uninteresting work for children, if taken almost exclusively. The interest of Indian children especially soon tires.\n\nConsequently I have introduced many varied subjects, in addition to those laid down as the code of work for Indian scholars.\n\nKindergarten have I specially taken up; finding my own material, and sparing no pains to add a little pleasure into the lives of the little ones under my care.\n\nDrawing and singing, both of which the Indians are very fond, are two other subjects in which they have achieved wonderful success.\n\nMusical Drills, such as the \"hoop drill\" and \"stave drill\" are also indulged in at such times as their interest for other work seems to be lagging.\n\nAs a further inducement to the scholars to attend school, for the last five years we have had a small school garden. I paid an Indian for turning up the sod, and each child who cares to go to the trouble of breaking up and preparing the soil, is furnished with a little plot to itself, and supplied with various vegetable seeds, which, when grown to ripeness becomes its own property.\n\nWith the different seasons of the year, different means have to be adopted to arouse fresh interest, without which latter there would\nwould be the tendency to drop off school attendance all together.\n\nFor the last three years I have encouraged my older scholars to enter into the Competition at the local Fair.\n\nIn the year 1905 my school gained a Diploma (which we now have framed on the school wall) from the Winnipeg Exhibition, for a general exhibit.\n\nLast Fall they entered, with white children, in the Scholars Competitions at the Manitoba Agricultural Fair, and my school carried away eleven prizes out of twelve.\n\nThis was a great encouragement to them, as it meant cash for each prize winner to spend as it liked at Christmas.\n\nEach of the two previous years they gained a special prize for general Indian schoolwork, which prize money was spent in giving the scholars a little party and presents at Christmas.\n\nAlso, as a further inducement to attend school, I have offered, for the last two years, book prizes twice yearly to the two children who come first and second in total attendance.\n\nDuring the winter months, I also make hot soup for the children's mid-day meal. This latter is very much appreciated.\n\nConsidering all the inducements I have held out to them to attend school regularly, the result has not been so gratifying as I was ambitious for it to be.\n\nThis only goes to show how poor a chance a school would have, which possesses a teacher who was not enthusiastic for her or his scholars.\nscholars, or who had no resourceful power to interest the scholars while they were at school.\n\nIf I may be allowed to say so, I think the present system of allowing the parents to take their children with them on all their hunting trips etc., is answerable to a great extent for the poor yearly average in most of the Indian Day Schools.\n\nUnder the present conditions, the children are bound to go with their parents, because it would be unreasonable to expect children to remain in their homes alone.\n\nThis difficulty might be overcome by the erection of a building, in which the teacher could house and keep them during such times as the parents were obliged to be away.\n\nThe supplying of the children with food, would be a great inducement to the parents to leave them behind.\n\nSince you ask me to suggest, too, any means that may be adopted to stir up the interest of the parents to induce them to send them to school regularly, might I suggest that, at Treaty time, the parents of such children who had made a certain percentage of attendance at school during the past year, receive as a reward, so much extra cash for each such child. (The percentage to be fixed by the Inspector)\n\nI wonder whether, too, when the trails are almost impassable in the winter with snow, and in the early spring with water, whether some reliable person could be deputed and paid...\npaid for fetching the children to school, by sleigh or waggon as the case may be.\n\nWhere the children live two or more miles from the school this is specially needed, and never more so than it has been this past winter. Just now, too, the roads are swimming with water, and all the scholars are suffering from very severe coughs and colds.\n\nConsequently, school at present is very badly attended. Had it have been possible to get the children to school without getting their feet soaking wet, as they have been, these coughs and colds would not have been so prevalent, and the school attendance would have been so much better.\n\nThe Farm Instructor's residence is 10 miles from here; so that it is impossible for him to take up this work here, as well as at Fort la Corne.\n\nRegarding the improvements in the home life of the Indians, I think the root of my success lies in the fact that I, being a married woman, have my own home and family right amongst them; and every condition and phase in my home, acts as an incentive and copy for them to imitate, and to do likewise.\n\nWhile not allowing any undue familiarity, I have kept my house open for them to visit, just as they felt the wish or necessity. If they have come for any special purpose, or in any need of help, I have always been ready to aid them, even to the sacrifice of...\nof my own self, providing I could see the ultimate end would be their own enlightenment and uplifting.\n\nAlthough not forcing it upon them, I have endeavored to make my own life and home a pattern of what I would like theirs to be. Knowing that the home depends largely upon what the woman makes it, I have specially tried to train my girl scholars in household management, both in school and in my own home, and have encouraged them to do the same in theirs. Especially in cases of sickness have I tried to help them, not only in nursing them in disease, but teaching them how to prevent disease to a great extent.\n\nThe management and rearing of their babies has been my chief phase of nursing, and in cases of sickness I have held myself ready at all hours to go to their aid. Indeed so great is the Indian respect and faith for this part of my work, that I am frequently being fetched to sick babies in the Fort or some part of the band, 10 miles north.\n\nNever once have I allowed myself to become too familiar with them, but at the same time I have never let them feel that I put myself above them in any way; and, as long as they do not forfeit the honor, have always treated them with the respect that I expect them to treat me and mine, and indeed anyone in authority with whom they come in contact.\n\nBefore closing, I would like to add, that...\nwhile putting myself up as a pattern to them,\nI have endeavored to keep before my own\nmind the example of Christ, who pleased not\nhimself; and thus, have tried to make my\nservice for the Master, the ground work of\nthe whole.\n\nI trust the above will give a little insight\ninto my work here. If there is anything\nI have not made quite plain, or any point\nwhich may occur to you, that you would\nlike made clear, I will endeavor to explain,\nif you care to write further to me.\n\nI remain\nYours obediently\n(Mrs.) Ida Godfrey\n\nJ. N. McLean\nSecretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, May 5, 1908.\n\nMadam,\n\nThe report on the methods employed by you in conducting the South Fort a la Corne Indian day school has been received and the Department wishes to thank you for the careful manner in which you have dealt with the subject.\n\nIt fully appreciates the difficulties you have to contend with and will do all in its power to assist in carrying on your good work.\n\nThe Department will supply you with necessary Kindergarten material, drawing books and Kindergarten songs upon requisition. The Kindergarten outfit should be simple and inexpensive and you should state the name of the publisher of the song book, if possible.\n\nIt is most gratifying to learn that your pupils have been so successful in competition with other school children at the different annual fairs held in the West, and as an incentive for further efforts the Department will be prepared to provide prizes for the most deserving pupils or furnish means for a Christmas tree; whichever you think more suitable.\n\nTo\n\nMrs. Ada Godfrey,\nTeacher\nFort a la Corne, Sask.\nTo further encourage the pupils in their efforts at gardening you may purchase a small supply of seeds and send in the account through the Agent for payment.\n\nThe Department approves of furnishing a mid-day meal and it will give aid for this purpose. The Agent will be instructed to furnish you with certain plain provisions for use in this connection.\n\nThe Department concurs in your suggestion that accommodation should be provided for children when their parents are absent on hunting trips and it would like to know about how many children would have to be accommodated. The Agent is also being communicated with on this subject.\n\nThe Department regrets that it cannot entertain your proposal to pay parents for sending their children regularly to school, but it does approve of the suggestion to provide means of conveying the children to school in certain seasons of the year, and it would like you to give the name of a person who would be willing to undertake this service and to state upon what terms.\n\nYour work in the homes of the Indians is highly appreciated and the Department will, as a recognition of this service, make provision for an annual increment in your salary until a maximum, which cannot be definitely stated at present, is reached.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nOttawa, May 11, 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department having received very satisfactory reports regarding the South Fort a la Corne day school, it has, as you are aware, been decided to increase the salary of the teacher to $400 per annum and also to assist her in carrying on her good work.\n\nThe pupils having evinced a fondness for gardening, the teacher has been authorized to purchase a small supply of seeds and to send in the account through you.\n\nAs an incentive to regular attendance, the Department has told the teacher that you will be instructed to furnish certain plain provisions for a mid-day meal. These should be limited to a supply of rice, salt, tea, soup meat, bacon and beans, in addition to the usual biscuits. These articles are to be purchased by you and furnished as required on the teacher's requisition, and separate vouchers should be forwarded to the Department for payment, as they should not be provided out of the provisions for relief.\n\nJ.

(RG 10, Volume 6285, file 609-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe teacher has suggested that accommodation should be provided for children when their parents are absent on hunting trips, and, as this suggestion is in line with the Department's policy in regard to schools, it would like you to consult with the teacher and let the Department know what the probable cost of a building suitable for the purpose would amount to. A plain, inexpensive structure is all that would be required, as it would only be used at intervals, and you should state what seasons of the year the parents are absent from the reserve and for how long.\n\nEven while the parents are at home some of the children are prevented from regularly attending the school in the early spring and late fall, owing to the bad condition of the roads. To overcome this difficulty provision might be made for conveying them to school, and the Department would like you to see if you could arrange with a person who would be willing to undertake this service and upon what terms.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nSecretary.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of May 11, 1909\n\nNo. 253341/1 I have the honour to inform you that when at the James Smith's reserve on 24th May last I consulted with Mrs Godfrey regarding a building to accommodate the children of her school during the periods that their parents are absent hunting, and we agreed that a building about 18 + 24 two stories in height with a lean-to kitchen 12 + 18 would give sufficient accommodation. I afterwards found that I could get sufficient logs on the reserve from the Indians of a size 20 + 22, which would give the same accommodation, and the building could be erected by the Indians of the reserve under the supervision of Farmer Macloy. It is a little difficult for me to give an exact figure of the cost of such a building, but feel certain that it would cost over $800.00 and probably less. This estimate does not include inside plastering which I do not consider necessary. It includes the necessary divisions up stairs, and down stairs, made of lumber. The building would require to be attached to Mrs Godfrey's dwelling, and that building belongs to the English Church. If the Dept wishes to have the building clear of this property, then a building large enough to accommodate Mrs Godfrey would require to be built, at an additional cost of say $400.00.

Would you kindly consider whether this system of increasing the attendance could be applied to other Day Schools in your Agency. The Department desires to increase the usefulness of these Day Schools and is prepared to assist and encourage in every way possible. It is noted that in your letter you made no positive recommendation as to the erection of the building under discussion. It is the wish to proceed slowly in erecting buildings until the Department is sure that they are required and that they will be a useful adjustment to the present system. Would you kindly consider this whole question.\n\nOn one or two other Reserves in Saskatchewan the plan of a semi-boarding attachment to day schools has been tried and found to work well. It was carried out in the first instance through the initiative of those interested in the schools and no demand was made upon the Department for board of the children or for the erection of buildings, but in districts where it is thought that the idea might be applied with advantage the Department is willing to assist to a considerable degree. Kindly give this matter your earnest consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. Macarthur, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\n\nSecretary.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 16th instant,\n\nNo. 253341 / I. I have the honour to inform you that I did not make any positive recommendation as to the erection of the building under discussion, because it opens up a wide subject. For instance, there are about twice the number of children on the roll of the La Corne North School as on that of the South School, you cannot very well erect a building, and board the children of the one School without doing the same for the other, and so on. My seven years as Agent leads me to say that according to my observation the money spent by the Department on Day Schools, is money largely wasted. Mrs Godfrey's School being a pleasing exception. If the Department desires to increase the usefulness of the Day Schools why not begin at the foundation? You must know that with a few exceptions the Teachers of Indian Day Schools are a poor useless lot. In the past 4 years there have been 4 different teachers in charge of the John Smith's School, and the same number in the La Corne worth School, only one of the lot being good. If course you knew that a salary of three hundred a year will not command a capable person. I am entirely in favour of the children being kept on their Reserves, educated there, in touch with their parents.\n\nRegarding the midday meal, and the proposal to convey the\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nchildren of the other two day schools on this Agency, to school, I could not with the present teachers recommend that it be done. In charge of the John Smith's School is Robert Bear, a Treaty Indian. He is a useless lazy fellow, that in Winter does not get his school opened until 11 a.m.\n\nAt present the La Corne North School is in charge of Miss Trail, a young girl, all right in every way, but that she has had no experience, and I do not think that she intends to stay long at the work. Both of these Schools are important, showing a school roll of about 30 pupils each. Pay the salary required, and secure teachers of the Mrs Geoffrey class, give the midday meal, have the children in winter conveyed to school, and the result would be that you would double the attendance; the Schools instead of been dead as they have been for the past five years, would become live and prosperous Institutions.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 6th., 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nIn connection with your letter of the 23rd. ultimo (No. 104) I have to say that you have been informed of the steps which the Department has taken to obtain better teachers for the day schools in your Agency, and I shall be glad to receive definite recommendations in the way of improvements in buildings or suggestions as to methods of increasing the attendance.

Also (2) I see that it is entered in your last Blue Book Report as \"Undenominational\".\n\n(1) I am of course glad that you have recognized Mrs Godfrey's excellent work & character, but I think that as we had not put her on our list for \"Improved Day Schools\", & as I am corresponding with you as to the elder & larger school at La Corne (Mrs Smith's), I might at least have been notified if you are so moving. I beg to ask your intentions.\n\n(2) I consider that \"undenominational\" does not describe her school. The Church of England has always looked after that school, engaged Mrs Godfrey, receives her reports, & aids her in little ways. I am very disposed to allow that school to be taken off our list, one of our most successful schools as it is. I beg to hear from you on the subject.\n\nI remain\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ.

Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 26th instant I beg to say that the Department desires to improve all the Day Schools in the Duck Lake Agency, and to increase their efficiency if possible. On the 26th. of July the Department wrote you on the subject of improving the teaching staff. Mrs. Godfrey's efficient work has been recognized, to some extent, by an increase of salary to $400.00, and the Department has been in correspondence with its Agent on methods which might be adopted to increase the attendance.\n\nThe school has always been shown in the records as an un-denominational one, but there would be no objection in the future, to including it amongst the Church of England Schools; and this will be done.\n\nThe Department has been in correspondence with Archdeacon McKay looking toward the engagement of a competent teacher for John Smith's Reserve, and it has pledged itself to pay to the Rev. R. F. McDougall a salary of $900.00 for his services and those of his wife who is a trained nurse. At present the buildings on the Reserve are not sufficient for the accommodation of Mr. McDougall, and the Department is in correspondence with Mr. Macarthur regarding the erection of a convenient residence, specially designed for the work. Mr. Macarthur will report in the near future on the needs of the educational work at all three points, and the Department would be glad to receive Your Lordship's co-operation in any suggestions you may care to make either following our letter of July 26th or the present communication.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRight Rev.

He has been asked to confer with you.\n\nThe Department has already had an expression of opinion from you on the different problems before it, but it is possible that during the payment of the annuities you were able to gather further information of practical importance.\n\nThe Department will await Mr. Chisholm's report, which will be the result of your joint deliberations on this subject; one of paramount importance at the present time and requiring the exercise of the utmost discretion and careful consideration, which the Department is convinced it will receive at your hands.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Macarthur, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nFort \u00e0 la Carne\n\nOct 15th\n\nMr. Macarthur\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYou will have been pleased, no doubt, to read in my returns just submitted to you, of the increase of school average over the corresponding quarters of last three years.\n\nI am more glad than I can say to show this increase, because the September quarter is invariably a badly attended one, as it contains so many very picking months.\n\nThe giving of the mid-day meal has been the chief incentive in drawing the children to school.\n\nBut I am sorry to say that the great increase of work this entails, under the present conditions, is telling greatly upon my strength, and unless I can get help I do not see how I can go on with it.\n\nAt the present time I am under Dr. Shadwell with heart weakness, due, he says, to the stress of work, and the rush with which I have to perform it.\n\nIf it were not for the fact that, while I am in office I must do my work concerning it, I suppose I should not make such a rush of it. But you will quite understand how hard it is to have to prepare meals for fourteen children daily (to say nothing of our own meals) together with the washing up and cleaning that this entails, and to teach school at the same time.\n\n5825\nOf course, if the dining room had been built,\nthe work would have been a little lighter,\nbecause I would not have had the rushing\nbackwards and forwards from the house to\nthe school, as I have had the last four\nand a half months.\n\nDo you think the Department will provide\nme with a woman's help at once?\nI do not want to have to give up my work\nhere just yet, but unless I can get more\nrest, which the doctor enforces, I see no\nhelp for it.\n\nYou see I have had all the extra work of\nthe school garden, too, this year; and the\nwork of getting it all out of the ground in\nsuch a hurry (and especially having no\nproper place to house it) has been very\nstrenuous, and has entailed a great amount\nof needless dirt in my own house.\nYou can quite believe that my salary has\nnever been sufficient to enable me to pay\nfor needed help. Before my rise, the wages\nwere not sufficient to keep me out of debt, I\nhad to draw money from England.\nAnd even now, although it enables us to live\na little more comfortably, yet I cannot afford\nto keep a girl out of it.\n\nWill you please give this matter your early\nconsideration, and let me know if I can\nengage help at once, and what wages you\nthink the Department will pay for such\nhelp.\n\nWith kind regards from all,\n\nI remain\n\nYours sincerely\n\n(Mrs.) A.

I at once wrote, telling her to get a girl to attend to the work, that it was not the Department's intention to ask her to do the work, and regretted that I had not before told her to do this, but that I have been waiting to hear from the Department as to final arrangements for the three schools.

This work, Mrs. Godfrey herself has done for the past five months, but could not continue to do, as her health gave way. I have also further to report that as no provision so far has been made for a dining room and kitchen, I arranged with Mrs. Godfrey that for the winter the mid-day meal will be cooked in her (Mrs. Godfrey's) kitchen, but this necessitated me purchasing a stove, the one of Mrs. Godfrey's in use being too small. I visited the school on the 12th instant; the day was cold and stormy. The day before my visit, Mrs. Godfrey considering that the weather was such as would prevent the younger children getting to school if not carried there, began the winter arrangement of sending a team for them. On both the 11th and 12th, all the children of school age were at school, and I have no doubt that an excellent average will be shown all winter.\n\nI had a talk with Mrs. Godfrey regarding the paragraph\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nparagraph in your letter to her in which you said; \"As an incentive for further efforts the Department will be prepared to provide prizes for the most deserving pupils, or furnish the means for a Christmas tree; whichever you think most suitable.\" We concluded that means for a Christmas tree would be best. Her pupils not only gained the silver medal at Winnipeg, but won all the prizes offered in their line at the Kinistino Exhibition; hence she thinks that by having a Christmas tree, each and all of them would receive something.\n\nThe expense of a Christmas tree, we estimated at $15.00\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nsir,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, reporting on the work being done by Mrs. Godfrey at the South Fort a la Corne School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department approves of the action taken by you in providing Mrs. Godfrey with a stove for use in providing the mid-day meal and also of the arrangements you have made for conveying the children to school.

D. McI\n\nSecretary.\n\nJ. Macarthur, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nDear Sir,- I wish to tender you the resignation of my duties as teacher at the South Fort a la Cerne School, which I ask you to kindly forward to the Indian Department at headquarters, as I desire to give the required three months notice, dating from Dec.31, 1909, to leave on March 31, 1910.\n\nI have two strong reasons for wishing to leave. The chief is, that I think the Indian Department is not treating me quite fairly as compared with their attitude towards the teacher of Fort a la Cerne school. In the first place my salary is very much smaller than hers, although I have previously given five of the best years of my life to the interests of the Indians here, and to the Indian Department, on a very little wage, viz $300.00, barely enough to keep body and soul together, considering the isolation of the place and the fact that for a long time we had to pay out so much of it to the Indians in order to get them to do the slightest thing for us. We even had to pay them a dollar ($1.00) freightage on every sack of flour we asked them to bring up for us from our nearest town. I tell you this to bear out my statement as to its being a starvation wage. You, yourself, Mr. Macarthur, will quite bear me out that my work here has been very strenuous, too strenuous to bear, had it not been for the fact, that through it all I could see nothing but good resulting from my labors. I will ask you to compare the Bighead Indians of 1903 and of the present time. Their improvement has been the one main reason for the continuance of my work. During the past few months great changes have been commenced in the two Indian schools here; changes which have been brought about as the result of my success here and which were suggested to the Indian Department by Mr. Godfrey and myself; but it seems to me, we have only placed the \"plums in the pie\" for other people to pick out. Do not think I am writing this in any jealous spirit, for nothing would be\nbe farther from the truth. Knowing from experience how hard INK Indian School teaching is, I maintain that Miss Hawley is, no doubt worth all the money she gets, and no one could be more glad than I that the La Corne Indians have got a promising teacher at last. But the point I wish to bring forward is, that if she is worth it, then surely so am I, especially considering the advantages she has in regard to nearness and help of Farm Instructor, and which I have had to do without. In what respect she is more worthy than I, I fail to see. Certainly as regards my work as school teacher my worth is shown by results. Disregarding all Government Examination reports, I can show for the six years I have served here, Two Diplomas and One Silver Medal gained by my school. These will stand as a monument for all time as to the efficacy of my teaching among the Indian scholars at South Port a la Corne School. And this from children who, when I first came here knew so little English, that they did not know that a cat bore the name of cat in English; they only knew its Cree name. Next, as regards my nursing and dispensing work. The fact (which you yourself can verify) that only a very small proportion of times in all the years I have been here, have the Department been called upon to pay special doctor's fees for the Indians of this end of the reserve, speaks for itself. When I mention the fact we very rarely see the doctor here, it bears out still more forcibly the amount of work I have necessarily had to do in this line. The last time Dr. Hawke visited South Port a la Corne officially, to my knowledge, was on Sep.3. I spoke to him then, and asked him to look at the eyes of a child who was going blind, and whose mother was already blind. He said he would be down again on the 10th. of the month, and he would look at the child then. If he made a visit on that date, it was not to this end of the reserve; and I saw nothing of him from Sep.3. until Dec.13. when he found himself accidently here, having lost his way to Port a la Corne. Mr. Geoffrey asked him to look at the feet of an Indian, who, presumably was suffering from Tuberculosis of the bone, and whose feet was in a very bad way. \"He could not stop\" he said, to do that, or anything else; and\nand that is about all the good the doctor is to us. The work all falls upon me. I think this will serve to show how much I do both as teacher and nurse. Then as regards her nearness to the farm Instructor, you can but grant this lessens her labour considerably.\n\nWhen you consider the fact that we are 9 or 10 miles from Fort la Corne where the Farm Instructor is living, and the we (myself husband and family) are 12 to 14 miles from the nearest store, you will recall how isolated we are, and how necessarily a vast amount of work has fallen to me that I ought not to have had to do, or else it was left for my husband to do, who has received no pay nor no recognition. Miss Hawley's responsibility ends with her teaching and nursing; but my responsibility is endless, as the Indians here have no one else to depend upon. They come to me to help them in all their difficulties. In other words I have to be farm instructor, teacher, nurse, minister, gardener, seamstress, blacksmith, cook, and general arbitrator and justice of the Peace at all times.\n\nI am just now preparing to have my Christmas tree at the school. It is dated for Dec. 29th. It is rather late, but unavoidably so, as I did not get your letter until Dec. 21st, to say that it was even settled that we were to have a Christmas tree here. Considering that the Christmas trees at both schools were given on the Success of Bighead School in the various exhibitions, we thought it hardly fair that theirs should be settled in good time to purchase suitable goods for same. Mine was thrown so late that I had very little choice of toys; as I had to take the fag-end of everybody's leavings. The farm instructor will bear me out that this was so, as he was at the store when I purchased them.\n\nI think I have now shewn enough of my grievances to show you the reason for my resignation; grievances which I thought it more straightforward to tell you than to say nothing.\n\nIn closing, I would like to suggest, first in the interests of the Indian Department for the better maintenance of their affairs, and in the interests of the Bighead Indians, that, when we give up office here, a farm instructor should be stationed.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Until a short time ago the minimum salary that could be paid the teacher of an Indian school was $300.00 but after the maximum salary was raised Mrs. Godfrey was the first to receive recognition as the Department had known of her work favorably for some time. In addition to the increment of salary a greater interest was manifested in her efforts and as soon as it was represented that an assistant was needed one was supplied, and of late anything that appeared necessary in order to make the work of the school more effective has been done. The Department did not intend to discontinue this interest in Mrs. Godfrey's work or to make it appear that her services had been finally and adequately paid for and that no further financial assistance should be given to her school. In the Government service increases of salary are made gradually, but when they are given they are of course permanent subject to continued efficient service. Mrs. Godfrey may look forward therefore at an early date to receiving additional remuneration, and the Department does not think that in the conditions on the James Smith Reserve there should be anything so distasteful to Mrs. Godfrey as to render necessary her\n\nW.

If she still finds that it would be impossible to work there it might be advisable to have her transferred to some other Reserve.

The Department has been pleased with her work and, if Your Lordship is thoroughly conversant with the situation, I think you will agree that the treatment accorded to Mrs. Godfrey during the past year has been most generous.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRight Rev.

But the amount of salary is incorrect, so the cheque is only made out for $100.00, the same as I was getting for the last year.\n\nAccording to the promises of the Dept., I was to receive from Oct 1st of April $500.00 per annum, instead of $400.00; and that increased rate was stated on my quarterly returns for June 30th.\n\nWill you kindly write to the Dept. and acquaint them with this error, that the deficiency may be remitted to me.\n\nI am enclosing the notice that came with the cheque.\n\nAugust 11th\n\nFort a la Corne P.B.\n\nSask.\nWhile you are writing on the point of my salary will you please find out for me definitely whether I am to receive any rations or not so that I may know exactly how I stand with the Dept.; as the Church authorities are under the impression that I am getting $500.00 as salary, and rations equal to the sum of Miss Hawley's board & keep.\n\nThis seems to be hardly the case; especially after receiving a cheque only for $100.00.

This the Department is not prepared to do, but in view of the most excellent services being rendered by her both in the school-room and in the homes of the Indians in the southern part of the reserve it has been decided to grant her an additional $100.00 in salary. This additional $100.00 will be in recognition of the latter mentioned services.

I may say that the Department is quite anxious to rush this work, but I would remind Your Lordship that plans and specifications in detail have to be obtained and then tenders have to be called for. Some considerable time must, therefore, elapse before any contract for this work can be awarded. For this reason it is impossible to have the building ready for occupation early in May or even in June. The Department has several other buildings that it is proposed to erect in this northern country and in order that the best prices may be obtained it is desired to call for tenders for all about the same time.\n\nWith regard to the South Fort a la Corne school I may say that the Department has granted Mrs. Godfrey three month's leave of absence from May 10th, next, and it is proposed to leave the school closed until her return.\n\nIn regard to Your Lordship's query I may say that the Department has no proposal to make in regard to the Sturgeon Lake school.

In the meantime it is not known that there is any vacancy, unless the temporary one at Sturgeon Lake. Should Mr. and Mrs. Godfrey eventually go to the place last mentioned there will, of course, at that time be a vacancy at Fort la Corne.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

This is a liberty, perhaps, in extending the leave of absence so kindly granted by you. But we are taking in so much sight-seeing for our boys' education, and we are also under the impression that Surgeon Lake will not be ready till September, that we trust you will not object.\n\nIf you wish us to return to duties earlier, we are quite prepared to\nto go by sailing on Aug. 9th.\n\nKindly send instructions as to your wishes, per return mail.\n\nI remain\n\nYours Obediently\n\n(Mrs.) A.

For this reason building operations have not yet been started. It is hoped, however, still to proceed with the erection of the building at an early date and when once started the work will be rushed to completion with as little delay as possible.

For this reason it will be necessary to resume work at the Fort \u00e0 la Corne South School for a time. The Department proposes, however, to begin the new arrangement at that point, that is, for you to take up the school work and Mrs. Godfrey the field matron work upon the Reserve. You will be paid a salary at the rate of $400.00 per annum and Mrs. Godfrey a salary of $300.00. Should this proposal however be not satisfactory, Mrs. Godfrey may continue with her work at this school on the old terms. Upon your arrival at the Reserve if you will communicate with Mr. Thos. Borthwick, Indian Agent, Mistawasis, he will be able to give you full information as to when the building at Sturgeon Lake may be ready for occupation.

I would ask you to keep this in mind and be good enough to advise Mr. Godfrey at least a month before the date on which you expect to have the school building ready for occupation in order that he may make the necessary arrangements for moving.

I would remind Your Lordship of the application received in March, last, from Mr. P. H. Gentleman of Melfort, Sask. Mr. and Mrs. Gentleman are prepared to take up the work in connection with an Indian school, the former as teacher and the latter as field matron. Mr. Gentleman has already received Your Lordship's recommendation and the Department will be pleased to appoint him and Mrs. Gentleman to the South Fort a la Corne School, should this meet with Your Lordship's wishes. The salary asked was $800.00 with house and fuel. As Your Lordship is aware the lodging accommodation at this school is very inferior, but it may be that the Department will be in a position to provide a suitable residence next year. The Department does not supply fuel. In this case it would be willing to increase the salary sufficiently to compensate for this and would offer $550.00 to Mr. Gentleman and $300.00 to his wife.

Mr. J. Marshall, now teaching at Battleford Indian School, would like to stay in Indian work if he can get such a position; otherwise he may return to the Public Schools of the Province. I should like to keep him. His heart seems in his work. He is an enthusiastic and good teacher, has taught for some years in our Public schools, and he made a good reputation and commanded a good salary.\n\nI answered to come help us at Battleford, I would continue the work if he can be reasonably assured of fair prospects. But Battleford School is decreasing, it will be closed before very long; so he must look for an improved school form if he can not see reasonable prospect of a Principalship. The only possible places seem to me the following, I don't know what the Dept. is going to do. (1) An Improved Day School at Red Plaats when the Boarding School closes (2) Ditto at Sturgeon Lake\u2014if the God Boys don't take it (3) Ditto at Big Head's (James Smith's, La Come) if the God Boys go to Sturgeon Lake (4) Boarding School at The Pas, when will that be?\u2014I can recommend Mr. Marshall.

I suppose as no final decision has been arrived at with reference to the closing of the Battleford School etc., as such final decision depends altogether on the financial aspects of the case, it would be possible to retain Mr. Marshall at the Battleford School for a time at least. The Department is hopeful of establishing a day school at Red Pheasant Reserve next season and he might be available for the position, or at James Smith's Reserve as it is the intention to transfer Mr. and Mrs. Godfrey to Sturgeon Lake. The house accommodation at James Smith's Reserve is very poor. You did not state whether Mr. Marshall is a married man.

I have spent five years teaching in...\nEngland, British Canada, for six months under the Indian Department at Fairford in 1905-6. The salary I had to throw up on account of the small salary & high cost of living $25 a month without any accommodation. I was saving to get married at the time, but the cost of reaching the place during these last few months pocket.\n\nLately I have been turning my attention to the farm for I find there is nothing to look forward to in the teaching profession that is under the present Provincial administration. Teaching is a mere stepping stone to other professions.\n\nAt the same time I am very fond of children and the schoolroom. I keep a firm hold on the pupils and always get on well with them and I am able to give up the school especially as I find the heavy work of the farm beyond my strength. From my experience at Fairford together with the salary recommendation the dept. now offer I feel certain the position would be permanent, all things being satisfactory, & I believe I could do good work.\n\nOf course I have no details of what work is required and ordinary school work would not be altogether satisfactory in an Indian School. I am however an enthusiast of practical work, and would endeavour to earn the boys cultivating plots of vegetables in...\nSchool house garden, if same should be fenced, also, if permitted, instruct them in carpentry during the winter season.\n\nOf course I understand that the department could not undertake any expenditure in this way.\n\nMy wife also is well fitted with regards washing, keeping the house, &c., &c.\n\nShould you consider my application satisfactory, I would wish to remain. I parallel for some time, my brothers are working the farm and would be some distance away.\n\nI trust you will give me your kindest consideration, and while of course I would like to go to the post as soon as possible, would be happy to wait the department's pleasure, if they could give me some idea of the duties that I would be required.\n\nYours truly,\n\nP.H. Guttenman.\nOttawa, November 27, 1911.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your note of the 20th instant and before this you will have received official letter of the 22nd. You were quite right in addressing the Secretary of the Department, as that is our usage, but I am glad to have your personal letter. The letter of Bishop Newnham's which you enclosed was an endorseration of your application so that I think there should be no difficulty in arranging that you take up the work at South Fort a la Corne.\n\nYou make reference to the accommodation being very poor indeed. There is only a log house there just now and it is pretty old, but I fancy it can be kept warm in the winter. The school-house is a few hundred yards away and the grounds are surrounded by a fence, if I remember rightly. We may be able to erect a better house there before long, but of course we cannot make any promises as regardsthat.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nP. H. Gentleman, Esq.,\nBeatty, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6285, file 609-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir:\n\nI have now twice recommended Mr. Gentleman for this position and have twice received notification that the Department was willing to appoint him just as soon as Mr. and Mrs Godfrey left this school. I believe I may have mentioned the name of Mr. Marshall for this post, but if so that was only a suggestion in case Mr Gentleman was not obtainable. Mr Marshall can wait for a later vacancy. I may refer you to Mr D. Scott, Superintendent of Indian Education.\n\nI beg to remain\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ. H. Saskatchewan\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter respecting the above, for which thank you.\n\nIn reply I wish to say that I understand from his lordship Bishop Strachan of St. Albert that I had his recommendation and I believe he mentioned this in a note I received from him a week ago in which he suggested that I should write to Hon. Scott, whom I did including his note.\n\nIf I recollect correctly, I believe his lordship sent me a letter of recommendation in the spring of this year, that I sent to the Dept. when the matter was postponed.\n\nI surmise however that you have replied to my letter before receiving his lordship's letter of endorsement for in a note I have from him dated the 8th he says that \"he had heard from the Indian Dept.\" \"would I be prepared to go\" & let him know by return. No doubt he has communicated with you by mail.\n\nI am writing him however, but I believe he is about to start on a trip to Europe, if not already gone.\n\nSo I understand that Mr. Archdeacon MacKay will give me particulars of the work in detail, also the line of studies.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I trust this will be correct.\n\nThanking the Deptt. for their kindness.\n\nYours truly,\n\nP.H. Guttenman\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 7, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo, and in reply I beg to say that the Department is pleased to accept the services of yourself and Mrs. Gentleman to take charge of the class-room and field matron work respectively in connection with the Fort a la Corne School. The initial salary paid will be $250.00 for your services as teacher and $300.00 for Mrs. Gentleman's services as field matron. The additional $50.00 is in lieu of fuel, which is not supplied by the Department. You may make arrangements to take up the work on the re-opening of the school after the Christmas holidays. Should this offer be acceptable kindly advise the Department at once and fuller instructions will be given and the Indian Agent notified of your appointment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nP. H. Gentleman, Esq.,\nBeatty, Sask.\nIndian Agent\n\nCarleton Agency\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI received your letter dated Nov. 13th on Nov. 18th. On the 22nd Farm Instructor J. McCloy drove out with me to Kinistino to enable me to board the train for Prince Albert on the 23rd. The train was about five hours late, so I did not reach P.A. early enough to go out that evening. This was fortunate as Mr. Scott & his men reached Prince Albert that evening from Sturgeon Lake. The work having been closed down by Mr. Knox so Mr. Scott informed me, until the spring Inspector Bisholm not being home I concluded the best idea was to come back here and so save further expense to the Dept.\n\nI was glad I had not attempted to move Mr. Godfrey and family out there, but had thought it best to go through & help the work out myself, as I knew the old building at Sturgeon Lake is not fit for a family of seven.\n\nI will forward my account for this trip for your approval as soon as it is ready.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW. H. Borthwick\nIndian Agent\n\nKinistino Hotel\nLask\nNov. 24th\n400977\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6285, file 609-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Agent\nThos. Borthwick\n\nSir,\n\nYours of the 28th Nov. reached La Corne Dec 8th and Big Heads Dec 10th.\n\nI am sorry I could not wholly comply with the request in your letter of Nov 13th, which was to move my family and effects into the building vacated by Mr. Hutchinson, but I endeavoured to meet your request, by going in alone to cater for the men employed on the building; it seemed useless to proceed further than Prince Albert, after I had ascertained that there was only one man left on the Sturgeon Lake Building & he was finishing the lathing.\n\nIn answer to a letter of mine inquiring about this building, the Indian Dept. advised me to return to Big Heads and await information from Mr. H. Borthwick as to when \"the building would be ready for occupation.\"\n\nThis was Aug. 28th & we were then in England.\n\nIf you can send three teams here as soon as the \"new building is ready for occupation,\" we shall be ready & willing to start, but not into the old building.\n\nI remain\nYours Obediently,\nW. Godfrey\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6285, file 609-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nYours of 24th to hand, regret that you listened to J.P. Scott. There has been no change in plans except that Scott was replaced by Robt. Hurd. Building is progressing and will be completed during next month.\n\nMr. Hutchinson is teaching at Sandy Lake and the Sturgeon Lake school is closed. I will be pleased if you can carry out the request of my letter, and assist in hastening the completion of the work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nMr. Godfrey,\nFort a la Corne,\nSask.\nSir,\n\nI have been advised of your appointment as teacher to the Sturgeon Lake Day School of this Agency, and have to inform you that through family circumstances, Mr. Hutchinson is compelled to move from Sturgeon Lake to Sandy Lake this week. I would be pleased if you could move to Sturgeon Lake at once, for the reason that we have had to rely on Mr. Hutchinson for the boarding of the Mechanics employed upon the dwelling, which you are to occupy, and the completion of the building would be greatly facilitated if you can continue this service for the plasterers still employed upon it. About $4.50 per week was retained for Mr. Hutchinson from each mechanic who boarded with him.\n\nThe idea is that you move into the building which Mr. Hutchinson has been occupying until your own is completed, and I think it will be best for you to load your effects on to teams at Fort A la Corne to come right through to Sturgeon Lake. The Department will pay all reasonable charges, and if you load the teams carefully there, (which I presume) your effects will suffer less than if unloaded on to the cars at your nearest station, and again removed and reloaded on to fresh teams at Prince Albert. Those employed could be paid by voucher, the cheques going through the Duck Lake Agent, or if you pay them yourself, the cheque in reimbursement would go direct from the Department to you at Sturgeon Lake. Be careful to take receipts in duplicate for all disbursements in connection with your transfer.\n\nHoping that you will arrive safely, and will be pleased with your new field,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nMr. Wm. Godfrey,\nFort A la Corne,\nSask.\nThe enclosed letter from Indian Agent W. J. Borthwick, dated November 13th, was received by me upon Saturday Nov 18th. After fully considering its contents, I decided that it was undesirable to move Mr. Godfrey and our family into such limited accommodation as the old building at Steurgeon Lake Day School, but that it would be the right thing to go to Steurgeon Lake myself to cater for the men employed there and to help in the completion of the building.\n\nOn Nov 22nd, Farmer J. McCloy of Fort la Corne drove out with me to Kinistino to enable me to board the train for Prince Albert leaving Kinistino Nov 23rd.\n\nThis train was over five hours late owing to a severe snowstorm on the 22nd, and it was after four P.M. when I reached Prince Albert, too late to make the trip of 25 miles from P.A. to Steurgeon Lake that day, considering the heavy fall of snow.\n\nOn the morning of Nov 24th I met in Prince...\nAlbert M.J. Scott who had been employed on the Building at Sturgeon Lake.\n\nHe informed me that all the men excepting one had been sent in from the Building by Mr. Inspector W. Knox, whom he said had also stopped the rest of the work until spring.\n\nI then endeavoured to see Inspector of Indian Affairs Mr. Chisholm, but was informed he was at Mistawasis, and although he would be leaving Mistawasis that day, he was not expected to arrive in Prince Albert until the 26th or 27th.\n\nI then telephoned Indian Agent W.J. Macarthur, Duck Lake and received reply that he had gone to Fort la Corne.\n\nI thereupon returned to Kinistino where I met Mr. Macarthur who had just arrived there from La Corne. His solution of the difficulty was the same as my own, to come back to South la Corne and await further instructions.\n\nWhilst in Kinistino Nov 24th I wrote a letter explaining my conduct to Indian Agent W.S. Bothwick, a copy of which letter I enclose.\n\nOn Dec 10th I received the 2nd enclosed letter from Indian Agent W. Bothwick, still asking me to comply with the request contained in his letter of Nov 13th.\n\nI enclose a copy of my answer to this dated...\nDec 11th, in which I quote part of a letter received from the Dept. dated Aug. 28th in which the Dept advised Mr. Godfrey to return to South la Corne as the Surgeon Lake Building was not completed; as the Building is not yet completed I felt justified in quoting the Dept's letter in my answer to Indian Agent Mr. Borthwick.\n\nYou will notice in my letter of Dec 11th to Indian Agent Mr. Borthwick I suggest he send three teams as soon as the Building is complete. I thought this would save loss of time occasioned between sending & receiving a letter of instruction.\n\nI am\n\nYours Obediently,\n\nW. Godfrey.\n\n400977\n\nSecretary Dept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, December 20, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. W. Godfrey, who has been appointed teacher at the Sturgeon Lake School, has written to the Department enclosing copies of your communications to him on the 13th and 26th of November and stating finally that he is waiting the completion of the building before he takes steps to move his family.\n\nThe Department regrets very much that Mr. Godfrey did not see his way clear to carry out your request, which would appear to be quite reasonable and the fulfilment of which would have expedited the finishing of the building. It is to be hoped that satisfactory progress is being made and that Mr. Godfrey will be able to move up at least during the Christmas holidays, as the Department has arranged for a successor to take charge of the Fort a la Corne South school, his duties to commence on the re-opening of the classes in January.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThos. Borthwick, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMistawasis, Sask.\nOttawa, December 20, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant in reference to your transfer to the Sturgeon Lake School.\n\nIn reply I beg to inform you that Mr. P. H. Gentleman has been engaged to take charge of the Fort a la Corne South School after the holidays. It is hoped, therefore, that the Sturgeon Lake building will be completed so that you can move up there between now and the end of the month and so that it may not be necessary to make any change in the present arrangements.\n\nWith regard to your expenses for transport I would say that if your account for the expenses of your trip to Prince Albert is submitted before that for your transport for the whole distance you may send it through the office of the Duck Lake Agency. It would be better, however, to include it with your final account for expenses, which should be forwarded through Mr. Borthwick's office as soon as possible after your arrival at Sturgeon Lake.\n\nYour engagement as teacher with the Department will commence as soon as you take up the work at Sturgeon Lake, but no allowance can be made for the time spent on your journey from Fort a la Corne to Sturgeon Lake. Under the circumstances it would apparently have been better had you continued on your journey to Sturgeon Lake and not returned to Fort a la Corne.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Godfrey, Esq.,\nFort a la Corne, P.O., Sask.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 7th inst., my wife and I are pleased to accept the Department's offer re South Fort in Comox, salary stated.\n\nMrs. Godfrey writes me, that they are awaiting the completion of their house at Sturgeon Lake and as soon as they can move, will notify us.\n\nI should be obliged if the Department, when writing to the Agent could mention this matter of building, so may be able to get the Contracting Engineer to get them to furnish, that we may take up the new work by the beginning of the new year.\n\nThanking the Department for their kindness.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nP.H. Gentlemen.\nOttawa, December 26, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department hopes that arrangements will be made whereby Mr. and Mrs. Godfrey can go to Sturgeon Lake so that you can take up the work at Fort a la Corne at the first of the year. No doubt you will hear from him at an early date. The Department has already written the Agent at Sturgeon Lake asking him to have the building completed as soon as possible. The Department will defer giving further instructions till such time as advised that you are leaving for Fort a la Corne.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nP. H. Gentleman, Esq.,\nBeatty, Sask.\nOttawa, December 26, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that the Department has arranged to have Mr. and Mrs. Gentleman take charge of the Fort a la Corne South School in place of Mr. and Mrs. Godfrey, their duties to commence just as soon as the latter leave for Sturgeon Lake. The salary agreed upon is $500.00 per annum for Mr. Gentleman as teacher and $300.00 per annum for Mrs. Gentleman as field matron. As you are quite familiar with the nature of the duties that they will be expected to perform I would ask you to give them every help in your power.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. Macarthur, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nOttawa, January 15, 1912.\n\nVery Reverend Sir,\n\nReferring to the question of the appointment of Mr. and Mrs. Gentleman as teacher and field matron respectively on the Fort a la Corne Reserve I beg to say that the salary as finally arranged with Mr. Gentleman is $500.00 for himself and $300.00 for Mrs. Gentleman.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\n\nVen. Archdeacon J. A. MacKay,\nBattleford, Sask.\nSir,\n\nYour letter of Dec 20th came to hand Dec 30th.\n\nThe contents thereof were a great surprise to me because I had received a letter from Mr Inspector Chisholm informing me that I had done well in returning to Fort la Corne, also that the new building at Sturgeon Lake would not be ready until spring.\n\nOn receiving your letter, it seemed to me the best plan would be to have an interview with Mr Chisholm or some other official who would be in a position to report the true state of affairs to the Dept.\n\nTo do this, on Jan 2nd I hired an Indian to drive into Kinistino with me, where I telegraphed to Mr Chisholm to ascertain if he was at home at Prince Albert.\n\nWhile awaiting an answer (which was four hours in coming) I received information that Mr Gentleman was in Kinistino and was about to engage a livery team to drive out to South la Corne school to take charge.\nAfter a mutual introduction and exchange of letters Mr. Gentleman decided to accompany me to Prince Albert if the expected reply was favorable. At last the message came \"Will be out of town tomorrow and rest of week home on Monday.\" Message received Jan 2nd time 16:30 O'clock. This meant that we must reach Prince Albert before 7 O'clock on the 3rd.\n\nThe next passenger train did not leave Kinistino until about 8 O'clock on the 3rd. A livery team for a drive of forty miles in the night with the temp -35 below zero was out of the question. The only way was to wait around in the cold, in the hope of getting through to Prince Albert on a freight train due about 2 AM at Kinistino. This freight train reached Kinistino at 5 AM and our illegal ride in the caboose cost us $2 each (minus a receipt) but we reached Prince Albert just in time to meet Mr. Chisholm.\n\nIndian Agent Mr. Borthwick was also in Prince Albert so that we were able to hold a consultation. The earliest date Mr. Borthwick could give as to when the new building at Sturgeon Lake will be ready is Feb 1st.\n\nI took no receipts of expenses on this journey.\nas I was not under orders, and I walked home from Kinistino; (three hours hard walking) as I could not afford a livery team being already 7 dollars out of pocket, plus two days without pay.\n\nIt is not my duty to censure Officials but I trust the Dept will understand that I am not in a position to spend time and money running round the country simply because some one (who is being paid) has been misinforming the Dept as to the real state of affairs at Sturgeon Lake.\n\nI remain\n\nYours obediently\n\nW. Godfrey\n\nJ D M'Lean Esq.,\nAss't Deputy Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of 26th ultimo, No. 253341/1, in which it is stated that Mr. and Mrs. Gentleman have been engaged to take charge of the Fort a la Corne south school, I have the honour to inform you that in a letter received today from Mrs. Godfrey, she states that they expect to leave for Sturgeon Lake Reserve about the end of the present month.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActg. Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir,\n\nYour favour of the 12th ultimo to hand for which I thank you, & in reply wish to inform you that we reached the reserve on the 30th of Jan. & were able to start work in the schoolhouse yesterday. I am glad to say that I find the house in very good order, and the accommodation much better than I expected.\n\nThere are however one or two matters that require attention, with reference to the well that Mr. Godfrey commenced. It is important that this should be completed as soon as possible. I find that the burial ground and the school houses and the stables, being on a steep incline, drain into the slough that has been used for water during the summer which is not at all satisfactory. Also some cribbing must be done before the thaw comes, otherwise it will cave in if left as at present.\n\nI should be pleased to receive instructions with regards to the teaching of sewing, the materials used, etc., when and how provided? Also, I find that there are not sufficient slates in the school, & if these are provided about 1\u00bd doz. are required.\n\nMr. McCloy has given us his assistance in obtaining wood, etc., and particulars as to how the work has been carried on, and I shall endeavour to continue on the same lines at present. If, however, the Department are thinking of making any matter the present time would be an excellent opportunity.\n\nAwaiting your instructions,\n\nYours Faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 14, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department is pleased to learn that you have taken up your work at the South Fort a la Corne School and found conditions fairly satisfactory.\n\nThe Acting Indian Agent will be communicated with in respect to the well and he will be authorized to provide you with a limited quantity of material for the purpose of teaching sewing to the girls and also to buy some slates. You will be good enough to let him have a list of the supplies that you consider necessary. I should be glad to have short reports from you at intervals on your work at this school and Mrs. Gentleman will be required to furnish a report each month through the office of Indian Agent showing the work performed by her as field matron.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nP. H. Gentleman, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nSouth Fort a la Corne School,\nKinistino, Sask.\nOttawa, February 14, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from Mr. Gentleman who has taken up the work of teaching at the South Fort a la Corne School.\n\nMr. Gentleman calls attention to the necessity for having the well completed. This should be attended to at once! He has also been instructed to submit a list of the articles that are required for the teaching of sewing to the girls and when this comes to hand you will be good enough to make the purchase. You may also purchase for the school eighteen slates and have them delivered.\n\nThe usual monthly reports will be expected on this school from this time forward.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. J. Campbell, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to inform you that Mrs. Godfrey, teacher at South Fort a La Corne school, has advised me that she left for Sturgeon Lake Reserve on 23rd instant. On advice of Mr. Inspector Chisholm, I did not go down to arrange with Mr. Gentleman to take charge, it being understood that all arrangements were complete.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, 10th May, 1912.\n\nEXD\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to inform you that your services as teacher of the Indian school at Fort a la Corne are no longer required, but you are hereby appointed clerk for the Duck Lake Agency in the room of Mr. Campbell. Your salary will be the same as that allowed your predecessor in office, namely $65.00 a month. Kindly report without delay to Mr. J. Macarthur, Indian Agent, Duck Lake.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMr. F. H.

Gentlemen, who has for some months been in charge of the South Fort a la Corne School, has been appointed clerk to the Indian Agent at Duck Lake. It will, therefore, be necessary to appoint a successor to take charge of the Fort a la Corne School at least after the summer holidays and the Department hopes that you will be able to nominate somebody competent to take up this work. If possible a married teacher whose wife will undertake the field matron work should be obtained and under such conditions the Department will allow a fair salary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nVen. Archdeacon J. A. MacKay,\nBattleford, Sask.\nDear Sir,\n\nI thank you for your letter respecting trees for plantation and wish to inform you that two large bundles have arrived from Indian Head. Under the present circumstances I am handing these over to Mr. MaCloy to plant round the new buildings at the North end. I made this request before I knew of the vacancy at Duck Lake, and it would be useless to plant them here with no one to give them attention.\n\nI also wish to say that it is entirely on account of the school attendance that I allowed my name to be submitted for the vacancy at Duck Lake... There are a large number of children at this end of the reserve, either past school age, or too young, and it will be a couple of years before there will be a good attendance, and I wish for more work. I also find that my wife could not undertake her work without help, had there been a large attendance.\n\nI think the Dept. would do well in closing the school here for a year.\n\nThe Rev. Archdeacon McKay of Battleford also Mr Macarthur have visited us, and expressed satisfaction of the work being done.\n\nI submit a report of the work done in school, and trust that I will be able to undertake the new work at Duck Lake to the Dept. satisfaction.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6285, file 609-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit a short account of the work done at this school during the past three months.\n\nI have devoted the time mainly to Arithmetic and Reading, the elder boys now being able to work the first four rules using Kirklands Arithmetic as far as exercise 29. The girls having mastered addition and subtraction; as well as the Multiplication and addition tables, I have used every possible way to get them to count quickly and correctly, and with the exception of the two youngest, they have made progress.\n\nI have spent considerable time in teaching the children common everyday words, I have used large coloured posters, taking up the entire side of one wall, and have made excellent progress, one very successful one being a huge poster by Hassel of three children riding on donkeys, and they have all been able to learn to spell, and write over a hundred words from this poster, I have also given them dictation, and they can compose their own answers to questions set about the posters.\n\nI have also given them a good deal of nature study and I find this appeals to them, and they are quick to learn any word connected with an animal.\n\nI have used the \"First Victorian Reader\" with the boys, and the Ontario Primer with the younger children, but have paid more attention to getting them to read sentences from the board that they can more easily understand, for I find they are inclined to read from the book in a very dull dismal voice which seems to be time wasted. I notice however they are beginning to read from their readers of their own accord, especially the animal stories.\n\nI have used daily the textbook on Calisthenics which they enjoy, the also can sing very well, better than white schools that I have had experience with.\n\nI have also given the boys some lessons in woodwork, and taught them to use the tools, and had we been staying I would have had them at work in the garden.\n\nI have read, and explained parts of Scripture to them, and they can say the LORD'S PRAYER and Grace before the midday meal.\n\nThe number on the register is twelve, and the average attendance eight but this is including three girls who are now past school age, and since the snow went away the attendance is very poor.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6285, file 609-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nIn connection with your letter of the 10th, intimating that Mr Gentleman had been appointed clerk at this Agency I have the honour to inform you that with the going of Mrs Godfrey the pupils of the South La Corne school to a large extent left school. Some of them were above school age, two of the younger children went to the north end, so that the attendance dropped down as low as 4. There are not many children all told at this end of the reserve, and their parents during the summer months are much off the reserve. I therefore do not think that an attendance could be got during the summer months that would make it worth while keeping the school open, and would therefore suggest that it be not reopened before the 1st of October.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In the meantime, in view of the fact that the number of children of school age at the south end of the reserve is small, the Department would like to have your views with reference to conveying these children to the school at the north end of the reserve and providing an assistant to Miss Hawley in case there would be sufficient accommodation in the new building erected last year for the average attendance that might be secured. If the South Port a la Corne School is to be maintained and a competent married teacher secured a residence will be necessary, but it might be that the conditions are such that the expenditure to provide this accommodation would not be justified, if there are not prospects of obtaining a good attendance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nJ.

I am sorry that Mr. Gentleman has been transferred from a school to an agency office as I consider him exceptionally well qualified for school work and it is very difficult to find men suited to such work. I shall bear in mind your wishes regarding a successor for Mr. Gentleman but I would suggest that it would be well to find out\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nif the attendance is likely to justify the employment of an effective teacher before another appointment is made. My impression is that a number of Mrs Godfrey's pupils are about of age to leave school and that for a year or two there may not be children enough to make up a good school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. H. MacKay\n\n412765\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to bring to your notice, that I understand that Mr Gentleman has received intimation of the Department's intention of transferring him to one of the schools at the James Smith's reserve, and while visiting that reserve to count the cattle last week, Farmer McCloy & I went into the matter of the number of children of school age able to attend there. As it is the South school that is vacant I surmise it may be this school that the Department are thinking of opening. The farmer & I enquired of the people at the south end, & I find that there are 15 children who could attend, there being a possible average attendance of 12 at the south end. I also understand that the Indians at that end are anxious to have this school opened again and on account of the good farming land at that end, one or two families who are wishing to go more into their farming operations are moving from the north end, for this purpose, & to be near the school as they have the idea that they could persuade the Department to open the school if there are enough children to attend.\n\nOn account of the good land, I think this will be the largest school on that reserve in a few years time. There are several young married families with children growing up in this neighbourhood, most of the ex-pupils that the Department have assisted to make a start having chosen this location.\n\nHaving found this out, and having to pass the school buildings on my way, I investigated the state of the buildings. I find the School-house in good repair, but the teachers residence is a difficulty. This is a small log structure belonging to the English Church. It is small about 30' x 30', with a small kitchen. There is\ncellar, or cupboards or any place for storage of provisions that would be required to be kept on hand for the children's mid-day meal. There are one or two windows out, & it would not seem to me from the few minutes that were necessary to look it over as being a suitable place to use for the purposes that it has been used for. Also being owned by the Church, I do not know who can be held responsible for its repairs.\n\nNaturally Mr & Mrs Gentleman knowing the place do not take kindly to giving up their present house in exchange for one of this nature, but at the same time as it seems that a successful school could be carried on, & seems to be required the matter will need some attention. I do not like asking anyone to take up the work at this point & having to use the present accommodation, & if the transfer is to be made it would be well if the Department could give this matter very careful attention, & I think that before the school is opened some proper accommodation should be made, or in sending anyone to the present house, it should be on the understanding that an arrangement will be arrived at with the Church authorities to enlarge & fix the present house, or that the Department will provide a small house, at no distant date. Certainly something would have to be done before the present house could be used in the winter, & it would be advisable to consider this early in the year before having & harvest seasons during which time it is so difficult to obtain satisfactory labour.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 9, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th ultimo in reference to the re-opening of the South Fort a la Corne School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this matter is receiving consideration by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Mr. Agent Schmidt will be advised of these appointments and I am enclosing herewith a copy of the Memorandum of Instructions for Field Matrons on Indian Reserves.

J. A. Newnham,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nBox 59,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nExtract from Agent's Report on the Fort A la Corne (South) Indian Day School, for the month of December, 1913.\n\nIf this school is to be kept open all year, provision should be made for the serving of the mid-day meal. This meal is now being served on the school seats which is very inconvenient and dirties same. The teacher's residence is too small to allow the serving of the meal therein, and it being an old log building, it is not worth repairing or enlarging to make it suitable. At present the meal is prepared at the teacher's house and is carried and served in the school room.\n\nSgd. Paul Schmidt,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, January 14, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to that portion of your report on the South Fort a la Corne Day School for the month of December last, in which you state that provision should be made for serving the mid-day meal if the school is to be kept open all the year I beg to say that it is now too late in the season to do anything in regard to providing accommodation for this purpose. If you will bring the matter up again in the spring it will be considered, as by that time the Department will be able to judge whether it would be justified in incurring the necessary expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The South school lost a matter of Twelve days time through this cause, while the North school was unavoidably closed for a period of twenty days.\n\nIf the Department wish it, the teachers of these schools will reopen these institutions prior to the close of the usual summer holidays, in order to make up for the time lost, though if this was done, it might be difficult to get the children back again before the actual close of their summer vacation. However, pending instructions from you, the matter will be left in abeyance.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nIndian Agent.\n\nOttawa.\nREPORT of Provisions used at Fort ala leone Day School\non James Smith Reserve, for Month ended June 30 1917\n\nAggregate Attendance Nil Meals Served Nil\n\n| Item       | On hand | Received during Month | Used during Month | On hand at end of Month | REMARK |\n|------------|---------|-----------------------|-------------------|------------------------|--------|\n| FLOUR      | 134     | -                     | -                 | 134                    | No school during month on account of quarantine for measles. |\n| BACON      | 31      | -                     | -                 | 31                     |        |\n| BEEF       | 0       | -                     | -                 | 0                      |        |\n| TEA        | 2\u00bc      | -                     | -                 | 2\u00bc                     |        |\n| RICE       | 4       | -                     | -                 | 4                      |        |\n| SOAP       | 0       | -                     | -                 | 0                      |        |\n| SUGAR      | 19\u00bd     | -                     | -                 | 19\u00bd                    |        |\n| SALT       | 29      | -                     | -                 | 29                     |        |\n| POTATOES   | 6       | -                     | -                 | 6                      | Potatoes expended as all have spoiled |\n| Baking Powder | \u00bd    | -                     | -                 | \u00bd                      |        |\n| BEANS      | 3       | -                     | -                 | 3                      |        |\n| Pepper     | \u00bd       | -                     | -                 | \u00bd                      |        |\n\nIndian Affairs.

D. McLEAN\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC.P. Schmidt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nExtract from letter dated October 23, 1917, from Inspector Crombie in regard to the schools on the James Smiths Reserve. Original on 115088/7.\n\nThe Indians are continuing to move from the northern part of the reserve to locations towards the southern part of the reserve more suited for farming and the attendance at the south school is better than ever on this account. While the buildings at the south school are very old, as will be noted from photographs submitted, the time is not opportune for the erection of new buildings there. My idea was to carry on at the south school for a time, until all the Indians who are likely to move to the southern part of the reserve get located, after which a more suitable and central location can be selected for the erection of new buildings. By doing this one school might be found to be sufficient to serve for the whole reserve in place of two as at present.\nREPORT of Provisions used at Fort a la Boire South Day School on James Smith Reserve, for Month ended November 1917\n\nAggregate Attendance: 260 Meals Served: 260\n\n| Item       | On hand (at end of Month) | Received during Month | Used during Month | On hand at end of Month |\n|------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|------------------|-------------------------|\n| FLOUR      | 46 lbs                    | 100 lbs               | 108 lbs          | 38 lbs                  |\n| BACON      | 11 lbs                    | 48 lbs                | 45 lbs           | 9 lbs                   |\n| BEEF       | none                      | none                  | none             | none                    |\n| TEA        | none                      | 5 lbs                 | 8 lbs            | none                    |\n| RICE       | 15 lbs                    | none                  | 5 lbs            | 10 lbs                  |\n| SOAP       | 1 bar                     | 2 bars                | 2 bars           | 1 bar                   |\n| SUGAR      | none                      | 15 lbs                | 10 lbs           | none                    |\n| SALT       | none                      | 50 lbs                | 5 lbs            | 49 lbs                  |\n| POTATOES   |                           |                       |                  |                         |\n| BISCUITS   | none                      | none                  | none             | none                    |\n| BEANS      | none                      | 10 lbs                | 10 lbs           | none                    |\n| OATMEAL    | none                      | none                  | none             | none                    |\n| PEAS       | none                      | none                  | none             | none                    |\n| Baking Powder | none                  | 1 lb                  | 4 lb             | 3/4 lb                  |\n| Pepper     | 1/2 box                   | 1 box                 | 2 box            | 1 box                   |\n\nCertified Correct,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTeacher, or Field Matron.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I beg now to lay the following requests and comments before you. I shall repeat some points discussed and dropped as impossible at present, because I want to have them on your files, as a reminder of what is desired and what I fully believe is due to your Indian work:\n\n1. I beg to apply for a substantial grant for the enlargement and improvement of the Lac la Ronge School building. The school is always full. We could obtain many more pupils from Stanley, Pelican Narrows, Montreal Lake, etc., were we enabled to provide accommodation. The school is well managed and efficient, at no extra cost to the I.D., though at the expense of the Church. The inclination of the I.D. is to dispense gradually with Day Schools in favour of Boarding Schools. If the I.D. cannot find the necessary funds, I would ask that it seriously endeavours to obtain them from the rather large Reserve funds of these Lac la Ronge Indians, now in the hand of the I.D. and lying idle.\n\n2. I would make the same suggestion as to funds in the case of necessary improvements to school and teacher's residence at Big Head's Reserve, South la Corne. The I.D. desires me to obtain a teacher for this Reserve. I can not do so until a proper residence is furnished. You yourself know how unfit for habitation is the old house, and you have said that it is not right for me to send a man to such a house. Meanwhile, there is a fine house and a good school at James Smith's Reserve, Fort a la Corne, unused for some time now, as the I.D. closed the school. It seems to me that there are three alternatives: (1) To build a new house for the teacher and repair the school, or, (2) to move the Fort a la Corne school and house to Big Head's, or, (3) to move it to some central place to serve both reserves, and then to renew the old plan of collecting the children daily by a carrier's route. The funds to be found as I have suggested above. If you re-build, a well needs to be dug also.\n\n3. I would again earnestly press for enlargement of the Onion Lake School. It is doing fine work, see Agent Sibbald's reports, and could get 20 more children, if allowed. This would relieve to some extent the reproach of there being no school for Thunderchild's and Sweet Grass Reserves, and would also enable us to carry on the school more economically. The funds could, if necessary, be provided here also from the Band's funds in the hands of the I.D. Pardon me, if I again repeat, that the I.D. in failing to furnish the Indians with proper educational facilities is laying itself open to grave reproach.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6285, file 609-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n4. Please let the I.D. remember that I have been for 3 or 4 years begging for a Day School for Thunderchild's Reserve, and a school or a Board-Matron for Sweet Grass. These ought to be supplied or the children otherwise provided for.\n\n5. There is great and pressing need for another Boarding School to accommodate the following Reserves: Mistawasis (Snake Plain), Sandy Lake, Sturgeon Lake and New Reserve, John Smith's, James Smith's, Big Head's, and perhaps Montreal Lake, - 7 or 8 Reserves. I understand that many of those interested in the Indians believe in increasing the number of Boarding Schools and decreasing that of Day Schools.\n\n6. I have just had a most interesting conference with the Sioux (Dakota) Indians north of Prince Albert, the two bands, Tomma Ainyamke's and Anpetu-wasioua's, now united in one, viz., the Round Plain. I believe they are not Treaty Indians, and are mainly heathen. They beg most earnestly for a school, and I have promised to do what I can towards getting it. There are some 14 or 15 children of school age, and other younger ones coming on. They say that the farmers round would send children to this school. So perhaps I could get a grant also from the Saskatchewan Provincial Government, and with that and the I.D. grant a school could be maintained. They have a school building and teacher's house which could be made fit for use without great expense. What can you do for them?\n\n7. As to Mr. Graham's suggestion for John Smith's Reserve, to remove the Lows and appoint a married Farm Instructor and a woman teacher, I am writing to him that I greatly deprecate it, at least for the present. It would not be fair to the Lows who have only lately removed there, and are doing good work. I have no other Reserve with a decent house for the teacher. A woman teacher would not do so well there, these children require a man. Mrs. Low can look after mid-day meals, and if necessary the Dispensing, far better than could a Farm Instructor and wife. There is a good excuse for the Farm Instructor but not near the school. I should strongly suspect any such move as long as Mr. Schmidt remains Indian Agent. It would be contrary to the expressed intention of the I.D. to stop the old scandals of corrupt Indian Agents and Farmers and to give us a better class. I hope you will not sanction it.\n\nWhile speaking of Mr. Graham, I wish to express my opinion that his methods and acts, while they may (?) be for the benefit of Indian Reserves in the South of this Province, have so far been detrimental to, or careless of, those in the North. We have not had a School Inspector since he carried off Mr. Crombie.\n\n8. I repeat, that you may have it on file, that I find it quite impossible with the present H.C.L. and high wages to procure proper teachers at $600 or even $700. They can get $1,000 or $1,200 for teaching British, Canadian, or Foreign day-schools.\n\nMay I ask you to have me supplied in writing with either a list of the salaries attached to each Saskatchewan Day School, or a general statement of salaries and bonus now given to improved Day Schools. Hoping you will not be angry at the length of my letter and my requests and looking for a reply,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I shall give careful consideration to each item but your Lordship will understand that it may be some time before you will receive definite replies to each of these proposals, as it is necessary in most cases for me to call for reports from our officers.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRt. Rev. J. A. Newnham,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nBox 39,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nDecember 31st, 1919.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nA short time ago I had the pleasure of a visit from His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan, when we discussed generally educational matters affecting his diocese. I asked him to place his requests and recommendations in writing and he has done so. I wish now to take up with you the question of the school on the south Fort a la Corne reserve. As you know there is no proper accommodation there for a teacher. The Bishop makes three alternative proposals - (1) To build a new house for the teacher and repair the school, (2) to move the Fort a la Corne school and house to Big Head's, (3) to move it to some central place to serve both reserves, and then to renew the old plan of collecting the children daily by a carrier's route.\n\nI am told that it is not practicable to move the school building from the north reserve; we had the matter looked carefully into on a previous occasion. I am not in favour of transporting the children to school; our experience in this respect has been far from satisfactory. It seems to me, therefore, that in order to provide for the education of these children, pending the carrying out of a more extensive system of boarding schools which of necessity cannot be consummated for some time, the only course is to provide a house for the teacher in the most economical way possible. I shall be glad to have your views on the subject.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nWm M. Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI have your letter No. 253341-1 of the 31st ultimo, regarding the matter of re-establishing a day school on James Smith's Reserve. I note the three suggestions made to you by His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan.\n\nPersonally I do not think it a wise plan to spend $2000.00 in the erection of a teacher's residence, under present conditions. As you are aware, we have a good school and teacher's residence on this Reserve at the present time, which are not being made use of, and I am not prepared at the present time to say if these buildings could not be utilized, for the purpose for which they were built, even on their present site.\n\nI would ask however that you allow this matter to stand in abeyance until next summer, when I will personally investigate the matter.\n\nIt is difficult at this time to come to any definite conclusion as to what should be done. The idea has occurred to me however that we might at some future date, be able to reduce this reserve by selling a portion of it, and if this can be done, the matter of where the school should be situated, can then be considered.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nD.G. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nJanuary 13th, 1920.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant with reference to the establishment of a school on the James Smith's reserve. I think your suggestion is a good one and we will defer further consideration of the matter until next summer.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nJanuary 13th, 1920.\n\nDear Bishop Newnham,\n\nReferring to your recent communication, with reference among other things to the erection of a teacher's residence on the James Smith reserve, I would state that I am in receipt of a communication from Commissioner Graham in which he suggests that we defer action until next summer. Of course in any event we could not build during the winter season.\n\nMr. Graham suggests that we might consider a reduction in the area of this reserve at some time in the near future, and for this reason the question of the location of a school and teacher's residence should be very carefully considered.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRt.

(RG 10, Volume 6285, file 609-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMemo re vacant schools in Saskatchewan\n\n1. I think this matter up with Dept. Sup't General last November & certain suggestions were made as to repairing schools & residing as with the Indians' Fund.\n\n2. F. O. La Corne - Big Head's Reserve. Teacher's residence unfit for habitation. The Dept. Sup't Gen. agreed that it would be unwise & impracticable to place a teacher in such a place. School is still closed - what am I to do? Meanwhile a good school & residence on the next Reserve, James Smith's, has been closed for two or three years.\n\n3. Thunder Cloud's Reserve has been demanding a school for years.\n\n4. Red Pleasant School will be vacant after June 30th; teacher leaving. Before I can secure a teacher I want to know (1) what salary for a teacher with Normal School Certificate? (2) If married couple go there, is there any further work pay (dispensing, etc.) for the wife not teaching? I have a couple in view, the wife a splendid all-round teacher. (3) Would you prefer a single male or female teacher?\n\n5. Big River, Carlton Agency, vacant for some time. Both school & house in shocking condition. Salary insufficient to secure a proper teacher.\n\n6. I should like some definite figures as to what salary will be given to a certificated teacher, & what arrangement for living, for all schools. Under present uncertain conditions, only $600 or even $700 I can not hope to get a teacher worth having.\n\nJ. A. Saskatchewan\nBishop\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's memorandum of the 31st ultimo regarding various matters in connection with the Indian day schools under your auspices in the Province of Saskatchewan.\n\nIn reply, dealing with the case of each school in the order in which they are mentioned in your memorandum, I beg to say, first,- with reference to the Fort a la Corne Day School, as you were informed by letter of January 13th, last, the question of providing educational facilities for the James Smith's Reserve is being considered by Mr. Commissioner Graham. He has asked that this matter stand in abeyance until next summer, when he will personally investigate and advise as to the best plan to provide educational facilities for the children of this reserve. He will consider the erection of a teacher's residence at Fort a la Corne; moving the residence from the James Smith's School; the re-opening of this school; or the removal of these schools to a more central point on the reserve, and report as to which of these schemes he considers to be the most advantageous.\n\nSecond,- Thunderchild's Reserve. The question of providing a day school for the children of this reserve cannot be favourably considered at the present time. It is hoped to be able to provide for the education of these children in residential schools.\n\nThird,- Red Pheasants. It is noted that the teacher will be leaving on June 30th next. The Department will be prepared to pay a salary at the rate of $900.00 per annum for a teacher with a Normal School Certificate. There is no need for the services of a married couple at this school, as the field matron work has been discontinued and there is no need for a dispenser. It is considered that a single female teacher would best meet the requirements at this school, and the Department will be pleased if you will endeavour to secure the services of a female teacher with a Normal School Certificate in time to take charge upon the re-opening of the school after the summer holidays.\n\nFourth,- Big River School, Carlton Agency. In November, last, Your Lordship brought to the attention of the Department the question of re-opening this school and appointing a teacher. Mr. Agent Weiss was instructed to inform you that a salary at the rate of $600.00 per annum would be provided and to request that you endeavour to obtain a suitable teacher. The Department will be prepared to pay a salary at the rate of $900.00 per annum for a teacher with a Normal School Certificate.\n\nRight Rev. J. A. Newnham,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6285, file 609-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nWith reference to the accommodation, the present house is owned by the Church and it is considered that Your Lordship should arrange to have it repaired and made comfortable to provide the necessary accommodation. Mr. Commissioner Graham is being written to regarding school matters on this reserve and requested to advise the Department as to his views in connection with the carrying on of the day school and the repairs necessary to the school building. As he is familiar with the conditions at this point the Department will await his decision regarding the re-opening of the school.\n\nFifth.\u2014Regarding the salaries the Department is prepared to pay for qualified teachers I beg to say that a salary at the rate of $900.00 per annum will be paid to teachers having Normal School Certificates. The names, qualifications and experience of teachers nominated by you should be submitted for approval in each case.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nFort a la Corne, Sask.,\n7-12-20\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.,\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have the honour to request that you give the following letter your consideration.\n\nThe School of which I am privileged to be Teacher of (Fort a la Corne North Day School) has a roll of pupils amounting to thirty with an average attendance of twenty-two, and if the complete school roll was in attendance there would not be sufficient room in the aforementioned school to hold them, as at the present time of writing I have only one empty desk at my disposal.\n\nI have been considering matters relative to the educational advantages of the children on the James Smith Reserve and I am given to understand that the South End is not open and in all probability will not be opened until spring of 1921, and I am further led to understand that the school roll on the South End School would amount to twenty. Drawing up these inferences I have come to the following conclusion and trust that you will take my suggestions in the way in which they are sent to you.\n\nIf the Department deem it advisable I fail to see any obstacle in the way of having the South End School transferred to the North End School, in other words that would make a necessary addition to the North End School which will be necessary anyway if the entire roll of the children at the North End are present at school, all the children from both schools could be under my tuition and thus save the Department a needless expense. I am further led to understand that there will be an erection of another building at the South End School, I have personally looked around the said school and if I may say so I am of the opinion that a new school is not necessary, and all that it requires is a little overhauling which could be done at a very little expense.\n\nNeedless to say this idea of mine comes under the Consolidated School System. This system has proved a great success amongst the public schools and I believe that the same success would be realized amongst the Indian people here. It is my opinion that an Indian could be hired to drive a team for the children from the South End School at a salary of forty or fifty dollars ($40.00 or $50.00) a month and there are Indians on this Reserve who have the horses which would suit just for that purpose.\n\nI trust that you will realize that I am only just bringing this idea to you from an educational and financial standpoint. I am very interested in the Indian Work and since I have been here a number of the young men have asked me as to whether I would give them school at night so as they could improve their English language and needless to say I willingly agreed to do so and am glad to be able to report that my efforts...\nWe up to the present time been very encouraging and it is because I want every child on this Reserve to have the advantage of an education that I am taking upon myself the liberty of making the suggestion to you.\n\nApart from this fact may I further state that this would bring the Reserve into a healthier surrounding, because the children from the South End could have all the medical treatment which they required and I would also be more in touch with the physical condition of their parents. I am using every effort which lays at my disposal to place these Indians on more a healthier footing than what they have been accustomed to live in, and I am glad to be able to report that the physical condition of these people are improving but that it will require all the efforts which we on this Reserve can utilize to bring such a thing to pass, for the Indians has apparently no idea whatever as to what they should do to keep morally and mentally clean especially in times of sickness.\n\nApologizing for any liberty which I have taken in making this suggestion to you,\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSirs,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nA.B. Fielden Taylor.\nOttawa, December 16, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant regarding educational matters on the James Smith's Reserve and stating the enrolment at the school which has recently been re-opened by you on the north end of the reserve.\n\nWith reference to your request that the children from the south end of the reserve be transported each day to your school I beg to say that in the past the Department has tried this method on various reserves with unsatisfactory results.\n\nThe Department has under consideration the re-opening of the school on the south end of the reserve where, with the addition of a few needed repairs, a building would be available. Mr. Commissioner Graham is considering the best plan for providing educational facilities for the children of this reserve and you might consult him in the matter. At the present time the Department is not disposed to re-open the school on the south end of the reserve nor provide transportation for the children, in order that they could attend the school at the north end.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

It is some years now since it was closed. Up to the time of its being closed the attendance was good and regular. It was closed on account of their being no proper house for the teacher, and the school building not being suitable. I have written several times to the Department, to our Church authorities and through the Indian Agent Mr. Schmidt at Duck Lake but with no result. I did not even get a reply to my last. There are some 25 to 30 children school age.\n\nYours truly,\n(Rev.) P. M. Lennan\nOttawa, March 31st, 1923.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st instant, with reference to the re-opening of the Fort \u00e0 la Corne South Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that about two years ago the question of re-opening this school was fully considered by the Department. From reports of Mr. Commissioner Graham it was considered inadvisable at that time, owing to their being no teacher's residence, the unsuitableness of the school building, and the probable attendance, to resume teaching operations at this school. However, we note you state that there are some 25 to 30 children of school age at the present time, and we will make further enquiries regarding the conditions existing, and whether it would be possible to provide the necessary facilities to resume the work at this school. As soon as we have full information we will then be in a position to state whether it would be advisable to re-open the school or not.\n\nThe above matter will receive due attention by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. R. Molennon,\nFort \u00e0 la Corne,\nSask.\nOttawa, March 31st, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nRev. R. McLennan, Fort a la Corne, Sask., has written requesting that the Fort a la Corne South Indian Day School be re-opened. He states that there are some 25 to 30 children of school age who could attend. The question of re-opening this school was considered by the Department some two years ago, but, owing to there being no teacher's residence, the unsuitableness of the school building and the probable attendance, it was not considered advisable to re-open the school.\n\nI have to request that you will make full enquiries as to conditions at this point, and state whether, in your opinion, the necessary expenditure should be undertaken to provide facilities for school purposes. You should state approximately the distance the children would have to travel from their homes to the school. You should report on the present condition of the school building, and state, if the school were re-opened, if it would be possible to obtain living accommodation for a single teacher. We will be pleased to receive as full information as possible regarding the situation at this school, and whether you would recommend that the school be re-opened, and, if so, the probable cost of placing the building in a suitable condition, and, if necessary, the providing of living quarters for a teacher.\n\nYour early attention to the above matter will be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I have been 40 years a missionary among the Indians, and know how hard it is for them to give up their mode of life and settle down to farming. Some hunters who have not yet become farmers have to go hunting with their families. At the South End there are a large number who never leave their homes.\n\nGeo. Tucker\n(Rev) R.

A new school room and teachers residence will have to be erected. The present school room, which is a very old log building, lathed and plastered, is badly rotted and cannot be repaired properly; the plaster outside is falling off through age and wear, the bottom logs are rotten and the building is sagging.\n\nThe old log building which was used as a teachers residence is not habitable; these buildings should be torn down and the new buildings erected on the same site.\n\nI would recommend that a teachers house and school room, similar to those at the Fort a la Corne North School be built, and that a married couple, who have had western experience, be engaged, he to teach, and she to take up the duties of Field Matron for the South End of the reserve. This would be the same arrangement as was in force when this school was open in the past.\n\nI would not recommend the appointment of a single teacher.\n\nA new well is required at this school as the old well is caved in and cannot be repaired.\n\nThe South School is distant, approximately, ten miles from the North School.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have noted that the present school room and teacher's residence are both uninhabitable and that they should be destroyed and new buildings erected on the same site. I have noted, further, that you recommend the appointment of a married man whose wife would perform the duties of field matron. I also understand that a new well is required, in the event of a re-opening. The Department is grateful for your careful report in this connection. The Rev.

McLennan, Missionary on the James Smith's Reserve, regarding the erection of a combined classroom and teacher's residence for the use of the Fort \u00e0 la Corne South Indian Day School. In reply I beg to say it is regretted that, owing to the heavy building programme, it was not possible to provide the funds necessary to erect this building in the appropriations for the current fiscal year. This matter will, however, receive consideration when our Estimates for next year are being prepared.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary\n\nG. F. Schmidt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nOttawa, January 30, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to that portion of your No. 309-9 of the 22nd instant, which relates to the education of the children on the James Smith Reserve. You will remember that it is your intention to discuss with Mr. Inspector Murison the advisability of moving the Fort a la Corne North day school ten miles to the south of the reserve, where there are a large number of our wards of school age.\n\nFrom reports on file, it appears that there are 26 children of school age living within two miles of the site of the old Fort a la Corne South school. In addition to these, there are 3 children six years of age and 24 still younger in the same area. These facts have been taken from a comprehensive report of Mr. Indian Agent Schmidt dated May 22, 1923. The local Church of England missionary and His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan have on several occasions urged the re-opening of the Fort a la Corne South Indian day school. R.C.M.P. officers who have patrolled the reserve have also drawn our attention to the number of children at the south end.\n\nThere are no suitable buildings available, with the exception of the stable; so the provision of a classroom and a teacher's residence would have to be made. In addition, a well is required.\n\nSometime ago the question of moving the Fort a la Corne North school buildings to the south of the reserve was discussed. After serious consideration, it was decided not to proceed with this undertaking. Today the problem is unchanged, as there has been in the North school an enrolment of 15 during the present academic year. The average attendance was never higher than 12 for any one quarter, but the teacher, Mr. Goodman, who is apparently doing good work, reports that eight additional children will be ready for school this coming summer. However, if the reserve is to be reduced in the immediate future by selling a portion of it, this scheme of moving the buildings might be considered, if the north part of the reserve is to be relinquished.\n\nPlease keep these facts in mind during your deliberations, and when you are discussing the question with Mr. Murison, make a recommendation to the Department. At the present writing, there is in the draft of the Estimates for Indian Education 1925-26 an item of $4,000 to build a combined school and teacher's residence at Fort a la Corne South.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAasst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6285, file 609-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOn my recent visit to Fort la Corne Indian Mission about ten days ago, a petition was presented to me by the Chief and members of the band, asking why the school at the South End had not been built when it had been promised so often, and when would it be constructed.\n\nI was told there were something over forty children at the end of the reserve who are running wild, without any school facilities whatever, and it would appear as though the claim for a school there was pressing.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nGeorge Exton Lloyd\n\nMr. Duncan Scott\nSuperintendent General\nIndian Affairs\nIndian Dept.\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 3, 1925.\n\nDear Bishop Lloyd:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 27th ultimo, with reference to the advisability of arranging for a re-opening of the Fort \u00e0 la Corne South Indian Day School. The Department has been in correspondence with Mr. Indian Agent Schmidt and Mr. Indian Commissioner Graham in this connection and I am hopeful that something can be done this coming summer. Mr. Graham on the 30th ultimo was requested to make a definite recommendation, and as soon as his report is to hand, arrangements will be made to provide facilities for the children in question.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRt. Rev. G. E. Lloyd, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo No. 109-9-1, with reference to the education of Indian children on the James Smith Reserve.\n\nAt one time I was of the opinion that the Fort a la Corne North School could be moved to a more central part and provide an educational centre for all the children on the reserve. This I find, however, is not feasible, and my recommendation is that the present Fort a la Corne North School, which has now an enrollment of 18 children, with an average attendance of 12, and the possibility of having this enrollment increased by 8 within the next year, should not be interfered with, especially in view of the fact that the central portion of the reserve is very sparsely settled.\n\nWith regard to the re-establishment of a school on the South end of the reserve, I think that a school should be built in the neighbourhood of where the old building is. There are no doubt sufficient children in this area to keep a school open the year round. For, as you say, there are 26 children of school age living within two miles of where this school would be, with a possibility of this number increasing. I would, therefore, recommend that the present North School remain where it is, and that a new school be built at the South end.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nThe Secretary,\n\nI notice that you have estimated the cost of building a combined school and teacher's residence at $4000.00. I fear that $4000 would not be sufficient for this, in view of the fact that there is considerable long distance freighting to do, and you cannot possibly build a school, even though the material is on the ground, for less than $1800.00.

LLOYD,\nBISHOP OF SASKATCHEWAN, DATED AUGUST 18, 1925.\n\nOriginal on #128-7-1.\n\nI think for several reasons it would be better to have Mr. Gentleman appointed to the school being reopened at Big Head's in the Fort \u00e0 la Corne South district. I understand this is now either ready or will be in the near future, and it would be certainly better for Mr. Gentleman on account of the reason of his leaving Grand Rapids, viz: Mrs. Gentleman's state of health.\n\nThis reopened school at Big Head's is within easy driving distance of a well equipped up-to-date hospital in Melfort, and is not a great distance from Prince Albert itself. There is no doubt Mr. Gentleman has done well as a teacher in Grand Rapids, and he ought to do equally well in reopening this school at Big Head's, which has been closed for so long.\n\nI would therefore nominate Mr. Gentleman for Big Head's School, but will not write to him until I hear from you in the affirmative, and if you agree that this suggestion is wise, I should be glad if you would cable him to that effect.\nOctober 6th 1925\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to forward enclosed herewith Reports of Provisions used for the mid-day meals at the John Smiths, Fort \u00e0 la Corne North, & Moose Woods Sioux Day Schools, this Agency, during the month of September, 1925.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.P.

The pupils were healthy looking and warmly clad in what appeared to be largely second hand clothing. The boys' clothing in particular was much too large for them and had evidently been handed down to them. A mid-day meal is served at this school. There is a garden in connection with the school which this year has provided for their requirements in vegetables.\n\nMrs. Mabel Burbridge is in charge as teacher.

The Department will be prepared to consider the appointment of Mrs. McFarlane from the first of January next, but it is noted that she possesses a non-professional second class certificate for the province of Manitoba and that it is some twenty-three years since she has had any teaching experience. I shall be pleased if you will advise the Department of her age and whether her husband is living and, if so, if it is intended that he will reside at the school with her.

The vacancy, however, was postponed until Christmas, and on hearing that it was not an Indian Department School Mrs. Burbridge refused to accept it. Meanwhile we were in touch with Mrs. Macfarlane and sent in her name to you as the Bishop's nomination. I have again consulted with the Bishop today and he is of the same opinion still, that a change is wanted at South Fort a la Corne, and asked me to write to you to this effect.\n\nWe do not wish Mrs. Burbridge to be out of a situation. Another situation was offered her which we thought equally good, but she now refuses to accept it. Have you another school you could offer her, as she wishes to remain under the Department?\n\nAt Fort a la Corne the Indians are divided, some siding with Mr. Bird and some with Mr. Burbridge, and the whole situation must have a bad influence on the Reserve. It is for this reason that we recommend a change.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW. E. J. Paul\nDear Sir,\n\nI received your letter (109-9-1) of the 3rd inst., re Mrs. Burbridge and the South Fort a la Corne School. I wish to place the whole matter before you.\n\nIn 1925 the Bishop asked Mrs. Burbridge to take charge of the school at Red Earth. This appointment fell through as the Indian Agent at the Psa did not wish Mrs. Burbridge to live on the Reserve with nothing much to do. Accordingly Mrs. Burbridge was appointed to South Fort a la Corne instead. Mrs. Burbridge held the Bishop's License as Lay Reader there for about four years. Unfortunately trouble arose between Mr. Burbridge and the Rev. E.W. Bird, the missionary who lives at the North End and has charge of all the missionary work on the Reserve, North and South. Each year at Treaty time a stall of refreshments etc., is held on the Treaty ground in aid of the Mission. In 1929 the weather was bad and much less money was raised than usual. Mr. Burbridge could not understand this and accused Mr. Bird of mishandling the funds. A very stormy meeting was held. Then Mr. Bird started legal proceedings for libel against Mr. Burbridge. I went there in February for the Annual Meeting, which was a difficult and unpleasant one, and I had the mortification of listening to the Indians pleading with the two white men to make up the quarrel. I persuaded Mr. Bird to withdraw legal action. Figures were carefully gone into later and found perfectly correct, so that there was no ground for Mr. Burbridge's accusation.\n\nBut it was very plain that the two families could not live and work happily on the same Reserve, and I thought Mr. Burbridge in the wrong for making a false accusation against Mr. Bird.\n\nBefore the Bishop left for England in May he notified Mr. and Mrs. Burbridge that there would have to be a change. In September last there appeared there would be a vacancy at Onion Lake Day School which is not under the Department. Mrs. Burbridge accepted\nOttawa, December 16, 1930.\n\nVenerable Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, with reference to the difficulty on the Fort a la Corne Reserve and the suggestion of his Lordship that Mrs. Burbridge be transferred from the South School. While this teacher's services have been satisfactory to the Department, if you believe that it is necessary to make a change, the Department will concur. However, there are no vacancies in Indian School work at the present time and I wish to suggest that you consider transferring her to some other Anglican Indian Day School in the Diocese. Of course, an exchange would not make room for the teacher you nominated to succeed Mrs. Burbridge.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nVen. Archdeacon W.E.J.

This school is conducted by the Department and the Anglican Church, jointly. The Department has correspondence with Mrs. Burbridge and with the church diocesan office, with reference to difficulties that have arisen between Mrs. Burbridge and the Reverend E. V. Bird, teacher of the James Smith Indian Day School, which is at the north end of the same Indian reserve. Mr. Bird is not responsible for Mrs. Burbridge's teaching activity, but he is the missionary for the whole reserve.\n\nMrs. Burbridge's services have been satisfactory to the Department and we have suggested to the church authorities that they solve the problem. Both teachers were nominated by the church. I understand that the Bishop is trying to arrange a transfer for Mrs. Burbridge and that she is opposing any move.\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDuncan Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent,\nGeneral Office of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nMy dear Duncan Scott:\n\nIt is quite evident that Mrs. Burbridge, the teacher at the South School of Fort la Corne, Indian Reserve with her troublesome husband are evidently intending to range the Indian Department behind themselves against the Bishop of the Diocese. As far as I know there would be no difficulty if Mrs. Burbridge were alone teaching in her school but there is endless trouble created by her husband.\n\nI therefore desire to notify the Department that I entirely withdraw my nomination of Mrs. Burbridge for this school as from Easter holidays and I cannot think of nominating her for any other Indian School in this Diocese.\n\nAt the present time it looks very much as though I shall have to close this part of the Mission altogether owing to the trouble caused by this teacher and her husband to the whole Mission.\n\nI am very much afraid that the Roman Catholic Indian Agent, Schmidt is not altogether free from blame in this matter but I have no way of actually showing the connection.\n\nI am very sorry indeed to have to take this action with regard to Mr. and Mrs. Burbridge but if the present condition of things is allowed to go on it will ruin the whole Mission.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nBelieve me to be\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nGEL:TR\n\nIndian Affairs.

We are in communication with more than one fully qualified teacher and will forward a name to the Department as soon as possible.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW. L. Paul\n(Archdeacon Indian Work.)\nCopy of Bishop's Letter\nArchdeacon's Office\nIndian Work\nPrince Albert\n\nDear Mr. Head,\n\nWith further reference to your letters about the Rev. E. V. Bird, the Bishop wishes me to say that he has written to Ottawa withdrawing his nomination of Mrs Burbridge as teacher of the South Fort a la Corne School, as from the Easter holiday. When Mr and Mrs Burbridge have left, he will then be able to judge better what is the best thing to be done with regard to Mr Bird. Whilst it is true that some people have written asking for Mr Bird's removal there are others who want him to stay on.\n\nI need hardly tell you that the Bishop will do whatever he judges to be really best for the welfare of the whole Mission.\n\nYours Faithfully,\nW. E. J. Paul.\nDeputy minister\nIndian affairs\nOttawa\n\nSir,\n\nOn January 12th I as chief called a meeting of the James Smith band to talk about our missionary Rev. E V Bird who has been making trouble here and acting in a wrong way. We sent a letter to the Bishop asking him to move Mr. Bird and I am sending a copy of his letter for you to read.\n\nAt first treaty government promised us schools and teachers. They have kept their promise. Now we have the best teacher we have ever had at the South end. She has been here over five years and there has been no trouble with her. She is good and kind and always does her best to help the Indians in every way and gives them\ngood advice. I wish the Government to keep this teacher and not to let other people take her away from us.\n\nI have been chief here for nearly 30 years and I have known six missionaries. This one, the Rev. E. V. Bird, is not a true missionary and does not give good advice. He is a trouble maker. He tries to make trouble between the Indians and the Government. He has just complained about us starving. I knew nothing about it, just Mr. Bird and 3 Indians at his house. I do not like that as I am chief. He says he is going to get rid of our Agent Mr. Schmidt too and I don't like that. I think it would be better for the whole Reserve if Mr. Bird could be sent away. There was never any trouble till he came and now it is all trouble.\n\nI hope the Government will help me in this.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJames Head.\n\nChief X His mark.\nOttawa, March 9, 1921.\n\nMr. [signature]\n\nPlease report on attached letter and return it to the office of the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nDo not file.\nMarch 15, 1931.\n\nDear Chief:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, with reference to the services of Mrs. Burbridge and the Reverend E. V. Bird. These workers are nominated by His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan, and I believe you should direct your petition to him.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Quayle\nSecretary\nMarch 19, 1931.\n\nDear Mr. Quirie:\n\nI have your telegram of the 11th instant and your confirming and explanatory letter of the same date, with reference to the dismissal of Mrs. Burbridge, teacher of the Fort \u00e0 la Corne South Indian Day School. Quite properly, you have forwarded a copy of your letter to Bishop Lloyd. Both Mrs. Burbridge and the Reverend Mr. Bird were nominated by the Church authorities, and your representations should be directed to His Lordship.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nA. B.

Sir,\n\nThe St Stephen's Church congregation and the St Luke's Church congregation have called a meeting to ask the Synod Authorities to transfer Rev E.V. Bird from these Parishes, for the reason that he is in disagreeable terms with the Indians in regard to various matters.\n\nThe Synod must not give Rev E.V. Bird the credit for what funds have been obtained from the Parishes named; it is the congregation's effort that the funds required by the Synod are available and this also includes what the Registers show for attendance at services.\n\nA few of the actual complaints will be shown below and the Congregations are asking the Authorities to act in this matter immediately.\n\nAs it has now been some time that the matter was to be attended to and nothing has been done yet, it is our desire that we have a Cree Missionary.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nChief James Head\n\n[signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

E.V. Bird re the above and I find the same to be correct.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary-treasurer.\n\nMarch 24, 1931\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Bishop of Saskatchewan has asked me, owing to his illness, to reply to your letter (109-9-1) of the 13th inst. In the request from the Chief of the Fort \u00e0 la Corne Indians that Rev. E.V. Bird be removed instead of Rev. Burridge.\n\nI beg to state that I met the Chief and ten or more of his band, by appointment, at Fort \u00e0 la Corne on the 21st inst. For over three hours I listened to all that they had to say. Their men, the Chief, Thomas Burns and James Okakewa definitely wished Rev. Bird to\nIn word away. Four men, Mr. Burns (sen.), David Clark, Norman Burns & Gilbert Constant, were usually strong on the side of Mr. Bird. Four other men brought up petty grievances, but did not ask for his removal. The meeting was so divided that I finally took a ballot, explaining that I did this simply to be able to let the Bishop know what the feeling of the people really was. This resulted in 21 votes for Mr. Bird, 6 (six) against. The only serious charge against Mr. Bird was the old one which the Chief put forward that he had mishandled the money taken at a refreshment-booth run in aid of Church funds at the Treaty, spent in 1929. This is Mrs. Mrs. Buxton's old accusation, or having examined the accounts, accepted bills he can find nothing wrong. I enter a statement to this\nArchdeacon's Office, Indian Work\nPrince Albert\n\nEffect by Rev. H. Wallace, Secretary, Treasurer & Co. Division.\nRev. Burridge are still saying that Mr. Bird has mishandled that money, and they are stirring up the Indians against him. I enclose herewith a letter of complaint against him in which the Chief's name is written in Mr. Burridge's handwriting, to which he has put his mark himself. He can neither speak nor write English.\n\nI also enclose a letter from Mr. Burridge to show that the handwriting is the same.\n\nIt is still my opinion, after further investigation, that there will come to peace, good will on the Reserve until Mr. Burridge leaves.\n\nHoping that this will explain the action that the Bishop has taken.\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW. E. J. Paul\nMarch 30, 1951.\n\nDear Archdeacon Paul:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant, with enclosures, in further explanation of His Lordship's wish that Mrs. Burbridge be removed from the Fort a la Corne South Indian Day School. The Department wishes to thank you for your letter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nVen. Archdeacon W.B.J. Paul, M.A., LL.B.,\nDiocese of Saskatchewan,\nSynod House,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nCOPY OF TESTIMONIAL.\n\nTo Whom it may concern,\n\nI take great pleasure in recommending Mrs. Siddons for a position in any elementary school. She is well qualified for this work and has had a very wide experience in the management of various types of public schools.\n\nFor the past four years Mrs. Siddons has had charge of the Lampburg school. I considered it one of the backward schools of this district and Inspectorate. Very little progress had been maintained by the students, and at no time were any pupils in grades above the fifth. The children were shy, diffident, and very hard to approach.\n\nIn the four years of Mrs. Siddons' stay at Lampburg a very different spirit has been imparted to the School. The children have become intensely interested in their studies, and marked progress is shown especially in the various branches of English.\n\nThe teacher has inspired them with a love of good books.\n\nAt the last inspection I found very encouraging signs due to the Teacher's attitude to her work and I know that Mrs. Siddons is actuated by a love of the work as well as a desire to help the children.\n\n(Signed) Owen Williams,\nInspector of Schools.\nCOPY OF INSPECTOR'S REPORT.\n\nLaupurg S.D. 3977.

The books are neat and well written.\n\nConstant supervision by the teacher is an incentive to good work and improvement. The School has participated in School Fair activities and the pupils have taken a good proportion of prizes.\n\nClass environment is very satisfactory.\n\nRoom is suitably decorated.\n\nStudents in VI and VII are well prepared for VIII.\n\nThe marked progress in Junior Grades is very noticeable.\n\n(Signed) Owen Williams,\nInspector.\nThe Honourable Duncan Scott,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir -\n\nWith further reference to the situation at Fort a la Corne Mr. Ford, the President of the Legion at Kinistino, called this afternoon. He gave me a document of fourteen pages written by Mrs. Burbridge making accusations against the Reverend E.V. and Mrs. Bird. I have positive proof that most of these are false, and we are rather tired of these continual false charges, and I wish to say once again that it seems absolutely necessary for the Burbridges to leave Fort a la Corne. Some of these charges were admittedly gossip coming over the telephone.\n\nThe Bishop begs to nominate as teacher at the South Fort a la Corne School Mrs. A.J. Siddons. She was four years at her last School and gave every satisfaction. She has been teaching recently in Alberta and has a Second Class Alberta Certificate, but she took Normal in Saskatoon and has a Second Class Saskatchewan Permit which she hopes to have made permanent by teaching in Saskatchewan. I enclose Testimonials from her Inspector.\n\nHoping that this nomination will meet with your approval,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW. E. J. Paul\n\nArchdeacon of Saskatchewan.\nOttawa, April 9, 1931.\n\nVenerable Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 1st instant, nominating the services of Mrs. A. J. Siddons as teacher of the South Port a la Corne Indian Day School, and stating the qualifications and experience which she possesses.\n\nIn this connection I have to request that you will inform the Department if Mrs. Siddons' husband is living, if there is any family, and, if so, who would live with her when she takes up duties at the school. When the Department has this further information regarding the civil condition of Mrs. Siddons, consideration will then be given to approving of her appointment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. Macdonald,\nSecretary.\n\nVen. Archdeacon W. E. J. Paul, M.A., L.L.B.,\nDiocese of Saskatchewan,\nSynod House,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nApril 23rd 1931.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI received your letter (No. 109-9-1) of the 9th inst., forwarded yesterday, in Miss Siddons and South Fort \u00e0 la Corne. Miss Siddons' husband is living, and is farming in Alberta, but would not go to Fort \u00e0 la Corne. They have two children, a boy whom they hope to send to high school in Prince Albert in September, or a girl of 11 who would live with her mother at the school. Our reason why Miss Siddons wishes to teach is to earn...\nenough to send her boy to high school - to board at St. George's College, Prince Albert.\n\nIn reply to Mrs. Siddons' first letter I told her that it would not be possible for our children to live on the Reserve, she replied that it was not their intention that he should do so. She feels that at least in the future she would be within reach of her son at Prince Albert, so he could go there for the holidays.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW. E. J. Paul.\nOttawa, April 30, 1931.\n\nVenerable Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, furnishing the information asked for as to the civil condition of Mrs. A. J. Siddons, whom you have nominated for the position as teacher of the Fort a la Corne South Indian Day School. It is noted that she will live at the school with a daughter, 11 years of age, and that her husband is farming and will not accompany her.\n\nThe Department will approve of the appointment of Mrs. Siddons to take up duties when Mrs. Burbridge retires. The salary allowed her will be at the rate of $90 per teaching month. I have to request that you will inform the Department of the date upon which Mrs. Burbridge retires and also the date upon which Mrs. Siddons begins duties.\n\nWe are informing Mr. Commissioner Graham and the local Indian Agent of the approval granted for the appointment of Mrs. Siddons.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

E.V. Bird\n\nN.B. The parents are anxious to have their children at school again.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith copy of a communication received from Rev. E.V.

Burbridge the teacher informed me that she was leaving the school and would probably move out during the Easter Holidays.\n\nI instructed Farmer Pollock to take over all Department property from Mrs. Burbridge when she was leaving and be prepared to hand it over to the new teacher who came.\n\nOn April 21st I received a communication from Farmer Pollock copy of which I also attach hereto.

Siddons\nTeacher\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith requisition for supplies for the Fort la Corne South Indian Day School.\n\nMrs E.M.Siddons advises me that there is no wheel barrow at this school and one is required to haul away the rubbish which collects around the school yard. In this I agree.\n\nShe also advises that the rope which was not allowed in view of the report in my letter to the Department, dated January 15th, last under file 1976-15-100 S, is required on account of the supply of water being hauled for the use of the school is in adequate for the use of the school and the teachers residence. Also that the rope in use at present is so short that it is dangerous to use.\n\nMail service to this point is at present very uncertain owing to the condition of the roads. It is also liable to be a matter of weeks before I will have occasion to visit this point and be able to find out if all the items requisitioned for are required. I would therefore request authority to purchase the items listed if, and when the necessity of doing so arises.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS.H.Simpson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSHS/CES.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Simpson, the Agency, states that with respect to the interior decorations at the John Smith Day School and floors in the dining room and hall way are badly worn and in the first place there is only a one-ply lumber. There is sufficient experienced Indian labour on the reserve to do the work.\n\nThe Agent also request that if funds are available outside repairs be made to the Fort a La Corne North Indian Day School. This building is in bad need of re-painting. I also notice that the South School on the same reserve could do with a re-painting but at the present time it is in better shape than the school north of it.\n\nM.

Ostrander, Esq., Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nEnclosed herewith please find requisition listing materials and labour required for decorating various day schools in Duck Lake Agency, as requested in your letter No. 305-11A dated August 3rd.\n\nAs finances may not be available to carry out all of the repairing and decorating asked for in this Agencies 1944-5 estimates the enclosed requisition covers the estimated costs of repairing and decorating that should be done this year, and in order of importance.\n\n1. Moose Woods (Whitecap) Sioux day school.\n\nThe class room is in poor condition and should be repaired and decorated as soon as possible. Decorating materials were secured last year from 1943-4 estimates and due to the Plaster on walls and ceilings being badly cracked and falling off it was decided to postpone decorating until the plaster was removed and replaced by wall board. The Sum of $137.88 is required to cover the costs of materials and labour. Decorating materials are on hand and the work will be completed at the time of removal of the old plaster and replacing with Wallboard.\n\n2. James Smith South day school & Tsamhhrs residence.\n\nThe building and grounds are very dirty and untidy and the buildings and grounds should be cleaned up properly before the Teacher assumes her duties on September 2nd next as a change in the teaching staff is being made at this school this coming term the premises should be in fair condition in order to impress on the incoming teacher the importance of keeping the buildings and grounds in proper condition. As this school is situated approximately 7 miles distant from the Department Farm buildings on James Smith Reserve proper fire guard protection should be provided. In the event of a bush or grass fire originating on the reserve during the fall and early spring months I am afraid that the buildings would become a total loss.\n\nWith reference to the remainder of the day school estimates outlined in my letter No. 4950-2I dated July 30th the work can be completed as and when finances are available and if necessary can be completed next season.\n\nIndian Affairs.

McLeod, Indian Agent,\nDUCK LAKE, Sask.\n\nWhen reporting on his inspection of the Fort a la Corne South School on Nov. 15, the Public School Inspector writes as follows:\n\n\"On the morning of my visit the room was cold and very uncomfortable. The furnace is burnt out and seemed to give more smoke than heat. Some window panes are out and this made the situation all the worse. A new furnace should be installed and steps built to the \"cellar\" to replace the ladder-box combination that serves as a means of descending. At present the whole thing is dangerous, to say the least.\n\n\"The plaster needs patching and the whole building needs painting thoroughly, and completely. The floor has been painted recently, and is in fair condition, except the cellar doorway. The blackboards are poor and should be re-surfaced with slating. There are insufficient desks to seat the pupils; these should have been requisitioned long ago. Children can hardly be expected to attend school when they have nowhere to sit.\"\n\nPlease let me hear from you in regard to the above. In connection with the desks, I presume that the 6 new desks had not reached the school at the time of the Inspector's visit.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nReference is made to your letter dated December 19th, your file No. 109-9-8 (W.T.I.) regarding report of the Public School Inspector in connection with the condition of the South Day School on James Smith Reserve No. 100, Fort la Corne, Sask.\n\nThe remarks of the Inspector are noted and while I agree with his recommendations in part, arrangements are being made to move the class room and teacher's residence to a more suitable location, where good water supplies are available. Provisions for this work are included in Duck Lake Agency Estimates 1947-48.\n\nIn regard to the condition of the furnace, in view of the alterations planned for 1947, it was not deemed advisable to install a new furnace and temporary repairs were made which did not prove satisfactory and we have discontinued the use of the present furnace and installed a large cast iron heater in the class room, which provides ample heating arrangements.\n\nWith reference to school class desks, these were ordered in 1946 estimates and were delivered recently and in addition, the Principal of Duck Lake Indian Residential School handed over 11 good used desk seats, these were all installed in the south day school class room.\n\nSome difficulty was experienced in securing window glass due to short supply. However all broken window glass have now been repaired and I believe the class room is in as good a condition as possible under existing conditions and with a view to alterations planned for the coming year.\n\nIn regard to improvements planned for the 1947 year. Extensive alterations and repairs are required, including installation of a new furnace and removal of the buildings a distance of approximately 1\u00bd to 2 miles, where suitable water supplies can readily be made available.\n\nIt is anticipated this method will overcome the present difficulties in regard to the condition of this particular building set up and when completed should prove satisfactory and be the means of securing the services of a more competent teacher than we now have at the south school.\n\nN.J.

(RG 10, Volume 6286, file 610-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir,\n\nUnder date of 29 December last, the Indian Commissioner wrote to the Bishop of Saskatchewan stating that he had received unsatisfactory reports of Mr. Robert Bean's work at the John Smith's Day School and urging an early change. Since then I have visited the school and am quite prepared to admit that things might be much better although the teacher cannot be held responsible for all that is unsatisfactory.\n\nMy object in addressing you direct is respectfully to inquire whether it is the intention of the Department to carry out the scheme of improved Day Schools as outlined in your letter of April 24th addressed to Rev. A. O. MacKay, Secretary of the Joint Committee on Indian Education.\n\nFrank Oddy, Jr.,\nDeputy Chief, General Office,\nIndian Affairs.\nThere is no Indian Reserve on Saskatchewan where the conditions for an improved Day School are more favorable than on John Smith's Reserve; and, as a change is called for, the time is opportune to introduce an improved Day School at the time of my visit there were 24 names on the Roll, 12 at School. Seven pupils had returned from Emmanuel College when that Institution was closed, not one of whom was attending the Day School.\n\nPov. Sir,\n\nYours obediently,\n\nJ. H. MacKay\n(Authorized)\nOttawa, March 5, 1909.\n\nVery Rev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th ult. in reference to the school on John Smith's reserve and suggesting the introduction of an improved day school at that point, which you state is most favourably situated for such a school.\n\nThe Department has for some time been aware of the unsatisfactory condition of this and other day schools in the West and it is most anxious to remedy the present state of affairs, but in order to do so it will require the co-operation of your Church, which is so deeply interested in the welfare of the Indians.\n\nTo carry out a plan for extending the usefulness of this school the difficulty presents itself of securing the services of a teacher with the necessary qualifications to take charge of it, and the Department would like you to suggest the name of a married man for teacher whose wife would be able to assist in carrying out the scheme, which includes improvements in the domestic habits of the women.\n\nVen. Archdeacon J.A. MacKay,\nBattleford, Sask.\non the reserve; the aim being to educate the Indian children amid their native surroundings and while inculcating principles of thrift and self-dependence to improve at the same time the conditions of life in their homes. It need hardly be pointed out that the success of the proposed plan depends largely on the persons selected to inaugurate it; they should be capable beyond all doubt of carrying on the work in which they are to be engaged. The Department is of the opinion that only such persons as are well versed in the usages of the country and have the welfare and improvement of the Indian at heart should be employed in this work.\n\nMay I ask that you will give this matter careful consideration and report to the Department at your early convenience, for it would be advisable to have the new arrangements made at an early date so that any field or garden work may be taken up in good time. Would you also be so kind as to state what would be considered a fair salary for this service.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nPrince Albert, Saskatchewan\nMarch 11th 1909\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to thank you for your letter No. 117084/1 of the 3rd inst., referring to a proposed improved day school on John Smith's reserve.\n\nIn reply, I beg to assure you that the representatives of the Anglican Church in this district will do all in their power to cooperate with the Department in this or any other scheme that has for its object the benefit and improvement of the Indians.\n\nI fully realize the importance of obtaining the services of capable persons to manage and carry on the work, and, in accordance with the Department's wishes, every effort will be made to select a man and his wife with the necessary qualifications. As soon as teachers can be found, their names will be submitted to the Department, but I should think it will take some time to provide the necessary personnel.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The school house at present in use is a very good building, and would probably be considered sufficient for present purposes, but a residence for the teacher will be necessary.\n\nReferring to the question of salary, Justice in the scheme set out in Mr. Reddy's letter of April 24th '08 the rate of pay is stated as:\n\nSchool Teacher and spouse, in cash $500.00\nTwo sections $120.00\nwith free house. I hardly think that the services of a really competent man and his wife could be secured for $500.00. I think $600.00 is the least that could be offered. To work on an Indian Reserve involves a good deal of self-sacrifice, and, while the position should not be offered to any one who is actuated by any higher motive than the object of gain, yet we cannot expect people, as a rule, to engage in such work at a sacrifice of both social and pecuniary advantages.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours obediently,\nJ.A. Mackay\nOttawa, April 1st., 1909.\n\nVery Reverend Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 11th ultimo I have to thank you for the promise of co-operation with the Department in endeavoring to improve the Day Schools. When the rate of remuneration was mentioned in the letter of the 24th April to which you refer, it was supposed that the free house, two rations and a salary in cash of $600.00 a year would be sufficient pay for a married man and his wife. Where it is thought advisable to erect a new type of building on any Reserve the situation of the Teacher would have some advantages, which it is hardly possible to deal with in an Estimate of salary and perquisites. In the erection of these improved buildings, the Department desires to proceed with caution, and as the buildings cannot cost less than from $6000.00 to $8000.00, it should be clear that the proposed location is unquestionably the proper one.\n\nOn John Smith's Reserve, which has not a very large population and where a commodious Day School building is already erected, it might be thought advisable not to erect a Day School of the improved type, but to furnish a convenient house for the Teacher. Could you ascertain whether there is at present a house favorably situated which the Teacher could use? If so, the Department would be disposed to consider the payment of the rental.\n\nIt is thought that sufficient encouragement will be offered to a better teacher if $400.00 in cash be paid as salary, with two rations, and either an allowance for rent or the\n\nJ. A. MacKay,\nBATTLEFORD, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6286, file 610-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nprovision of a house; the salary to be increased $80.00 a year until it reaches $300.00, as a reward for diligent service and approved results.\n\nI should be glad if you would give the matter further consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLAM\n\nSecretary.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 1st inst., No. 17084, I would say that there is no house favorably situated which the teacher could use. The only suitable house is the one occupied by the farming instructor.\n\nI would also point out that it is utterly hopeless to attempt to secure the services of a competent man and his wife to discharge the duties required by the Department, for $400 a year, even with the addition of two sections. This would mean a salary of about $520 or $550 for the two. Any certified teacher in Saskatchewan can command a salary of at least $600 with work not anything like so onerous as that required by the Department.\n\nWith regard to the unwillfulness of the\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\nDepartment to erect buildings on John Smith's Reserve because it \"has not a very large population.\" I would point out, referring to a letter recently addressed to the Rev. Mr. Tucker by the Deputy Chief General of Indians saying that the Department proposes to erect an Improved Day School on Mistawasis Reserve at a cost of $1000 and to assume an increased expenditure of $175 per annum, for increase to taking 2 teachers and his wife a month salary and provision for a mid-day meal for the pupils. Mistawasis Reserve has a population of 132 of whom only 87 are Presbyterians and there are only 20 children of school age. John Smith's Reserve has a population of 148 of whom 147 are Anglicans and there are 35 children of school age. I beg to draw your attention to these figures, not in a carping spirit but in a desire to have things fair all around.\n\nI may also mention that we are prepared to recommend for the John Smith school the Rev. Mr. McBayall, whose efficiency as a school teacher is well known and his wife being a\ntrained nurse is also admirably fitted for the duties that you acquire in a field station, but there is no prospect of their taking up the work under the conditions which your letter seems to indicate.\n\nSd: J. A. MacKay\n\nP.S. In\n\nYours obediently,\n\nJ. A. MacKay\nOttawa, April 30th., 1909.\n\nVery Reverend Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 19th instant I have to say that the Department is greatly interested in the prospect of obtaining for educational work on the John Smith's Reserve the Rev. R. F. McDougall and his wife, who is you state a trained nurse. In fixing salaries the Department is fully justified in taking into consideration the fact that, as the work calls for missionary co-operation of the Churches and those working with them can be counted upon, and in a late communication from the Advisory Board, it is laid down as a principle that the Churches would assist in every way in their power in devising some plan for the provision of improved teachers and nurses. In the present case the Department wishes to secure the services of the Rev. R. F. McDougall and his wife and is prepared to go far in meeting the requirements of the education but of course there is a certain point which could be impossible to advance. Would it be possible to secure the services of the Reverend gentleman and his wife at this time, without rations, if a convenient residence were provided? If the present day School building is a good one, it might be possible to erect a house for the Teacher, with a separate room for the pupils. Would you kindly give me definitely what is the lowest rent as payment for the\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6286, file 610-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 117084 of the 30th ult., and in reply to state that I should hope the Department would not consider exercising a salary of $600.00 for Rev. A. F. McDayall as teacher and $300.00 for Mrs. McDayall as nurse. The school proposed on John Smith's Reserve appears to be modified from the approved school on Mistawasis Reserve, which is on the plan sketched in your letter of April 24th, 1908. The idea of having a nurse however does not seem to be eliminated, and that appears to most people acquainted with the conditions on an Indian Reserve, to be the most important or one of the most important features in the plan. I would infer from your letter that Mrs. McDayall would be expected to attend to the duties of nurse as well as superintend the preparation of the midday meal and perform the other duties assigned to the teacher's wife where there is a nurse present.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nNo woman can do her own household work, attend to the pupils, and perform the duties of a nurse, without help, and Mr. Boydall will need hired help. It is of course a part of the scheme that the services of the elder girls should be utilized in the preparation of the mid-day meal, but that does not mean less occupation for the teacher's wife. The proposition that I have placed before you represents a saving of $225 as compared with the scheme providing for a nurse separately.\n\nMr. Boydall is at present engaged in very lucrative work among white settlers. He is Rector of a parish that has become self-supporting under his ministration, but he has accepted the idea of taking up this work, and I know of no one who is more likely to make it a success, as the first of the improved day schools we are especial anxious to give it every chance of success.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours obediently,\n\nJ. A. MacKay\nOttawa, May 31st., 1909.\n\nVery Reverend Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of May 18th, I have to inform you that the Department will agree to pay for the services of the Rev. R. F. McDougall and his wife at the rate mentioned by you, namely, $600.00 for Mr. McDougall as teacher and $300.00 for Mrs. McDougall as nurse and field matron.\n\nIn your letter you do not deal with the question of accommodation to be provided for Mr. McDougall. This matter was touched upon in letter of the 30th. of April. Probably Mr. McDougall could give some practical suggestions as to the buildings to be erected, and it might be possible to so interest the Indians that they might join him in erecting the building if the Department furnishes the material and some skilled labor. It would be fortunate if a spirit of co-operation could be fostered in this Band and if their interest could be stimulated to the extent of giving some practical assistance in the work.\n\nThe Department would be prepared to pay Mr. and Mrs. McDougall's salaries as soon as they begin their new duties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The Department will also be prepared to contribute a reasonable amount towards any expenditure that may be incurred in making this provision till such time as a permanent home can be prepared.\n\nI may add that this matter is now receiving the attention of Mr. Inspector Chisholm and Mr. Agent Macarthur.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS.

I did so chiefly because the Rev. R. F. Macdonald who had arranged to take up the work, was in a state of uncertainty as to whether his services would be required or not. Hitherto I have not received a reply to my letter and I am satisfied that either my letter or that from the Department has miscarried. I have written to Rev. Macdonald telling him that in view of the fact that nothing has been done in the way\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nProviding the necessary accommodation for an improved day-school.

Be good enough to advise the Department as to what plans, if any, have been made for this. A supply of tea can be sent from the Winnipeg warehouse. You will inform the Dept. of the quantity required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nJ.

For some reason unknown to me, the late teacher, R. Bear, stopped teaching at the end of September. I was only made aware of this late in October by Inspector Chisholm, who advised that Bear would open school on the first of November. I wrote Farmer Campbell telling him to let the teacher have what rice, beef etc. he would require for a daily mid-day meal. I was at this reserve on the 9th instant, but my time during the day was fully taken up with the sale of beef cattle. Just before leaving, I asked the Farmer how the school was getting along. He did not know the reason, nor have I had any further information. I am writing Farmer Campbell today to find out if the school has been re-opened; or if not, the reason why it has not. If the school is open I will go to the reserve and if possible, make arrangements for the mid-day meal.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nsir,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 1st, 1909.\n\nVery Rev. Sir,\n\nThe Department is advised that the school on the John Smith's reserve is without a teacher. As you are aware the Department was not able to complete its arrangements for erecting a permanent residence for the Rev. Mr. McDougall, but it expected that Mr. Bear would remain in charge of the school until such time as accommodation could be provided for another teacher.\n\nThe Department would like you to take immediate steps with a view to securing the services of a teacher to take charge of this school temporarily. Be good enough to attend to this matter at your earliest convenience and advise the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nVen. Archdeacon J. A. MacKay,\nBattleford, Sask.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 1st inst., I have to explain that there was no misunderstanding. Mr. Brown gave up his duties after the close of September quarter. The Board has been advised to go on with the school until the arrangements are ready for the proposed improved day school. His re-opening the school however has been delayed by a temporary illness but I expect he will resume the work very soon.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. A. MacKay\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6286, file 610-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of November 16th.\n\nNo. II7084/1, I have the honour to inform you that owing to the illness of the teacher, the John Smith's school has been for some time closed. The teacher informed me that he thought he would be able to open school at the New Year. When last at the John Smith's Reserve, I had a conversation with Mrs. P. Campbell (wife of the farmer) re-giving the school children their mid-day meal. She could not then say what she would be prepared to do it for. To-day, I have a letter from her in which she states that she thinks the work should be worth $30.00 per month. This I consider a most unreasonable sum for the work required. At the Lacorne north school we have an Indian woman doing the work for $2.50 per week, and the work is very well done. The cooking and cleaning both compare very favorably with the mid-day meal given at the Duck Lake Boarding School. There is no other person available for the work at this reserve, and in view of the worthlessness of the present teacher when in health, I do not think that much would be gained if the meal was given.\n\nIn this connection I would suggest that if the Rev. Mr. McDeugall is not going to this reserve, arrangements be made to place Mrs. Gedfrey in charge. This is\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nis a more important school than the LaCerne south school, the children on the roll numbering thirty, but there is another reason why I would like to have the change made. Mrs. Godfrey's husband happens to be a useless, indolent person who does very little work and a great deal of talking. He is continually butting into matters not only in connection with school work, but the management of the reserve in general, which is very disagreeable to the Farmer in charge. The last Farmer in charge, left without giving any reason, but I believe it was Mr. Godfrey's interference. The present Farmer, McCloy, has sent in his resignation to take effect on March 1st., giving as his reason that there is not room for himself and Mr. Godfrey on the reserve. Now Mr. McCloy is a most capable man, thoroughly competent in every way, and the Agency cannot afford to lose such men from any such reason.\n\nIt may be said that Mr. Godfrey would cause the same trouble on the John Smith's Reserve. I do not think so; the Indians are a different class, while as to the Farmer, it would be no great loss if he found there was not room enough on the reserve for himself and Mr. Godfrey. The annoyance caused by Mr. Godfrey is not new, having been going on for the past five years but in view of the very valuable services of Mrs. Godfrey, I have not before commented on it. Nor would I now, except that I wish to show that it would be to the advantage of the work if my proposal could be carried out.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, January 7th, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo advising the Department that the school on the John Smith's reserve will probably be opened this quarter and quoting the offer made by Mrs. Campbell to do the work in connection with supplying the mid-day meal.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the price asked for this work is considered altogether too high and the matter of supplying a meal may stand over for the present.\n\nYour suggestion with reference to the transfer of Mrs. Godfrey to this school is noted. I may say that the Department has not given up the idea of placing the Rev. Mr. and Mrs. McDougall in charge of this school. On October 9th, last, the Department wrote to Archdeacon MacKay offering to pay the salaries of Mr. and Mrs. McDougall if temporary quarters could be found for them. This, however, appears to be impossible and nothing can be done till the proposed residence is erected. Mr. Inspector Chisholm is at present having a plan for the buildings on this reserve made, and the Department hopes to undertake the erection next spring.\n\nIn your letter proposing the transfer of Mrs. Godfrey to this reserve you do not state whether you had in mind the appointment of the Rev. Mr. McDougall and his\n\nJ. Macarthur, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nwife to the James Smith's reserve. Be good enough to let the Department know as to this.\n\nI have also to ask you to request Mr. McCloy, the farmer, on the James Smith's reserve, to withdraw his resignation until the whole matter can be carefully considered by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Signed) S. Stewart\nAsst. Secretary.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of 7th instant\n\nNo. II7084/I., I have the honour to state that in my letter of 28th ultimo, I suggested the transfer of Mrs. Sedfrey thinking that the Rev. Mr. McDougall was not going to the John Smith's Reserve. I had no thought of him going to the La Cerne south school as I do not consider that school of sufficient importance to warrant the expenditure.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nPrince Albert, Saskatchewan\nMarch 1st, 1910\n\nReferring to previous correspondence regarding an improved day school on John Smith's Reserve, and the appointment of the Rev. R. T. Macdonald to the charge there, I should be greatly obliged if you will let us know definitely when Rev. Macdonald's services will be secured. As Rev. Macdonald is in charge at present, if important work in connection with the church you will easily understand that we should like to know some time beforehand in order to make arrangements for his removal and for the appointment of a successor to his present work.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJ.

R. F. MacDougall as teacher of the John Smith's day school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that plans and specifications for a commodious teacher's dwelling and pupils' dining-room for this reserve are now being completed at Prince Albert, and it is trusted that the erection of this building will be proceeded with early next season.\n\nAs you will recollect the Department offered in October last, to provide the salary for Mr. and Mrs. MacDougall from that date, if temporary accommodation could be found for them, but on the 29th of that month you stated that it was impossible to make any arrangements for quarters for them. The Department is not aware of any change in the situation and presumably there is nothing to be gained by renewing this offer; however, it will be pleased to pay the salaries to Mr. and Mrs. MacDougall from any date on which they take up the work, if quarters suitable to them can be found.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nVen.

Macdougall, in which he states that he and Mrs. Macdougall will take up their work on the John Smith's reserve at an early date.\n\nMr. Macdougall has been asked to communicate with you and told that you will give him necessary instructions as to their duties. Knowing the interest that you take in school work, the Department feels disposed to leave the matter in your hands.\n\nIn reference to the mid-day meal I desire to say that it is the wish of the Department to furnish only a very simple lunch to supplement that brought from home by the children. I would ask you, therefore, to have Mrs. Macdougall report monthly, shewing the cost of supplies used in the meal and the number of meals served.\n\nIt is hoped that Mr. and Mrs. Macdougall will be enabled to attain a large measure of success and, with your cooperation, which the Department is confident they will receive, good results are looked for.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ. Macarthur, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of\n\nNo. I have the honour to inform you that, from a letter received from Inspector Chisholm, I understand that the Rev. Mr. McDougald will move to the John Smith's Reserve on December 4th. As the school there is still being taught by R. Bear, Mr. Chisholm thought it would be as well for Mr. McDougald not to start teaching until 3rd. of January.\n\nMr. McDougald inquired of Mr. Chisholm if he (Mr. McDougald) was to be supplied with light and firewood. I have no instructions to this effect. As a certain quantity of wood and coal oil will be required for the dining-room, it might be as well to allow, say 12 gallons of coal oil and 20 cords of wood for all purposes.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 21, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th instant, and in reply I beg to say that when the appointment of Rev. Mr. McDougall and his wife as teacher and matron respectively on this reserve was under consideration it was finally decided to set a fixed rate of pay without rations, if a convenient residence were provided. The Department has erected a suitable building and it is thought that the rate of pay granted to Mr. and Mrs. McDougall is very fair. In view of this fact it is not considered advisable to allow any rations whatever, not even in the way of wood or coal oil.\n\nYou will be good enough to advise Mr. McDougall accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

It seems to me a most unsatisfactory letter. I thought of going to Radisson to talk the matter over with Mr. McDougall, but on more consideration, I decided that it was hardly worth the expense when he candidly states that he is merely moving to the John Smith's Reserve to ascertain whether the day school with the mid-day meal is a solution of the great problem of Indian Education; and again, \"If there is friction of any kind, I shall immediately place my resignation in the hands of the Department\". Regarding his remarks about coal oil and wood: I do not understand them, but think that he implies that they must be supplied or there will be friction. It seems to me that Mr. McDougall does not want to go, and that if he does he will be prepared to give day schools a black eye. It is all very well for Mr. McDougall to realize that we must work together, but when he lays down the law that there must be no friction, why, it means that my part of the work will be a farce.\n\nIf not too late, I would suggest that an effort be\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nbe made to secure a suitable teacher for the La Corne South School and move Mrs. Godfrey to the John Smith's Reserve.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nThe Rectory,\nHoly Trinity Church,\nRadisson, Sask.\n\nDec. 7, 1910.\n\nJ.

Mr. McDougall, whose appointment as teacher of the John Smith's school was approved.\n\nOn September 8th Mr. McDougall wrote the Department stating that he expected to take up his duties at an early date. The letter above referred to shows that he is still at Radison and it may reasonably be inferred that the transfer to the reserve is not altogether to his liking.\n\nMr. McDougall's attitude towards the school and the work he will be called upon to perform as shown by his correspondence is such as to lead the Department to the conclusion that it would be undesirable to place him in charge on this reserve, and Mr. Macarthur has been advised by wire to inform him that other arrangements to fill the vacancy at John Smiths will be made.\n\nIt has been decided to offer Mr. and Mrs. Godfrey, of South Port a la Corne, the positions of teacher and matron respectively and, in view of Your Lordship's previous representations on behalf of Mrs. Godfrey, the Department has no doubt that you will concur in this action.\n\nMrs. Godfrey is being written to by this mail.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRight Rev.

Mr. Godfrey with his wife's assistance will take charge of the school work and of course his retention in the position will be dependent upon the success with which he meets.

Good house, stables &c., and my purpose in going to John Smith's Reserve is solely to associate whether the day school with mid-day meal is a solution of the great problem of Indian education.\n\nI look to you for support and if there is friction of any kind, which I do not anticipate, I shall immediately place my resignation in the hands of the Department.\"\n\nWhile in the close of his letter Mr. McDougall stated that he really wished to give John Smith's a fair trial, it appeared unlikely that he would face the many difficulties to be met with in the path of an Indian day school teacher if he approached them in the spirit of the paragraphs just quoted. There was nothing to show in Mr. McDougall's letter that he had broken up house, but he seemed to be as firmly fixed as ever at Radison.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Your letter of Dec. 16. and telegram of Dec. 20, 1910. Reference 117084/1.\n\nYour letter to me (just received) re. Rev. R. Macdougall and John Smith's Reserve, and Mr. MacArthur's telegram to him, are inexplicable to me without knowing the previous correspondence to which you refer and I cannot possibly let the matter rest as it is. I am writing to Agent MacArthur, and also to Mrs. Godfrey telling her not to consider the offer to her till she hears from me that I consent. I am obliged to act in this manner, for your action, or Mr. MacArthur's has created a most difficult position. The I.D. has hitherto always consulted me in appointments and changes most courteously and I have always done the same by them. It is not to be accepted that the Agent shall step in between us and upset all arrangements. The appointment of Mr. MacDougall has been made for over a year, the delay until the last three months came from the I.D., not from us, there was never a hint given that you were not satisfied with his views and aims, or thought of reconsidering the appointment. Then, when he has resigned his parish and broken up his home, comes a wire from MacArthur, not from you, saying, \"You can stay at Radisson; other arrangements made for John Smith's.\" You surely can see, Sir, that not only is this change an unfair one, but the wording of the telegram is very nearly insolent. What has MacArthur to do with Radisson? I can make arrangements for my parishes without the advice of an Indian Agent.\n\nLet me recall the circumstances:-\n\n1. The I.D. notified us that John Smith's was to have an \"improved day school\"\n\"improved day school\" of the most perfect kind. This was early in 1909. The I.D. suggested, or else welcomed our suggestion, that Mr. and Mrs. MacDougall should have the appointment.\n\nThen followed a disheartening delay. My Indian teacher left, and I had difficulty in securing him again. Mr. MacDougall was kept in anxiety; he did not know what to tell his parishioners; the rumour got out that he was leaving them. If Mr. MacDougall betrayed a little irritation in his letters (as you seem to say, if I understand) it was natural. Archdeacon MacKay and myself wrote to the I.D. at times, only to be assured that Mr. MacDougall was desired and all would be ready as soon as possible. Mr. MacDougall offered to go at once and superintend the building, this was declined. I finally wrote that I must have the appointment confirmed or I must withdraw MacDougall's name. The appointment was confirmed. After some twelve or eighteen months we were told all would be ready in September 1910. Unfortunately Mrs MacDougall was in England, very ill (in hospital), and Mr. MacDougall overworked and he could not face the change singlehanded. So permission was obtained for some delay. Finally it was settled that he should go just before Christmas, but Inspector Chisholm kindly advised Christmas at Radisson, and that the work should begin on January 3rd.; and he said he would so advise MacArthur and the I.D. There had never been a hint given that the I.D. was not satisfied. Then followed a short correspondence between MacDougall and MacArthur faults, I daresay on both sides; MacDougall very foolishly said he would rather not accept if there was going to be friction over small matters (or some such expression). But he resigned his Church, broke up his home, sold his horse and made all preparations to go to John Smith's. Then came MacArthur's wire conveying your decision, too hastily made, but conveying it in an unnecessarily rude manner. I think the I.D. should have at least consulted with myself or Arch-Deacon MacKay after all the correspond-\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6286, file 610-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\ncorrespondence and after the way in which we had waited on the I.D., and not acted on the Agent's side of the story; Please note the following important points:\n\n1. Whether the Indian Agent or the Bishop is to have the appointment or the most influence over the appointment; if it is the agent I wash my hands of the affair. If has always been left to me, and my nominations have been courteously received, I have had to refuse to accept unworthy men nominated by the Agents from unworthy influences. I have always tried to meet the views of the I.D. headquarters.\n\n2. Up to just the last no doubt has been cast by the I.D. on the question of Mr. MacDougall's fitness. He and we have been told to prepare for his taking up the work at once. Then on the strength of friction between him and the Agent, he is suddenly and without any hearing or notice, thrown out.\n\n3. He has been arranging his work for twelve months past with a view to John Smith's; he has as I say, given up home and parish. If not appointed he is at great personal loss.\n\n4. (The appointment of Mrs. Godfrey). Without any consultation with me, any notification even that my nominee was not acceptable, simply on the suggestion of the local Agent, an appointment was made. This is contrary to the whole procedure in the past and to courtesy. In your letter of the 16th you tell me this refer to my past commendation of Mrs. Godfrey, and you anticipate my approval. I cannot approve. Big Head Reserve and John Smith's Improved School are very different propositions.\n\n5. I consider that the MacDougalls are far more suitable than the Godfreys. Your reference to my previous representations is hardly fair. Mrs. Godfrey is a splendid teacher but not a nurse and Mr. Godfrey is as yet, no teacher. You propose to make her Nurse and Matron and him the teacher. MacDougall you know is a formenst\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6286, file 610-1, part 1)\nForemost teacher, Mrs. MacDougall was a trained Nurse. I recommended them as the best I could hear of for Sturgeon Lake, or Sandy Lake, where you did not then propose as great things as for John Smith's. I pointed out that Mrs. Godfrey was the teacher, but that Mr. Godfrey might learn from her and set her free as Matron, etc. Mrs. Godfrey is a splendid woman and deserves well. Together, they may do fairly well, better than some, but not equal to the MacDougalls and I must object to their being placed at John Smith's in place of the MacDougalls.\n\nIn conclusion, I regret the disagreement between us and must ask that you will reverse your decision. I blame no one - though I have my opinion - but I deplore the hasty decision. I have always tried to work in cooperation and alliance with the I.D., especially as represented at Ottawa; but I cannot consent to be at the orders of the Indian Agent.\n\nI am sincerely desirous of the best welfare of the Indians and I have learned by experience that this is not always so with the local Indian Officials. Correspondence takes time. The School is suffering by being closed, and our plans are at a standstill. I therefore ask for a speedy decision and notification by telegram.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ. A. Saskatchewan\n\nP.S. Mr. Archibald MacKay tells me that Inspector Christie is going into the whole matter carefully, is viewing the letters, interviewing Mr. Macartney. He will doubtless write you fully.\nTo the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 18th inst., I beg to say that Mr. Godfrey and myself will accept the positions you offer to us as John Smith's secretaries, and we will enter upon our duties there as early as possible in the New Year.

In a letter recently received from His Lordship he advises the Department that he informed you not to consider the offer pending the receipt of his consent. Under the circumstances the Department must, therefore, withdraw its offer at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

(RG 10, Volume 6286, file 610-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of\n\nI have the honour to inform you that I received your telegram of the 15th instant on the evening of the 19th. I at once wired Rev. Mr. Macdougall that other arrangements were being made for teacher at the John Smith's Reserve and that he may remain at Radisson. I had arranged to leave here for La Corne on the 19th., but in case Mr. Macdougall should reply, I waited until the 20th. On reaching Prince Albert on the 23rd. inst., I found that I had unintentionally raised a hornet's nest about my ears; that Inspector Chisholm, Rev. Dr. McKay and Mr. Macdougall had been to call upon me at the Agency. Inspector Chisholm asked Clerk Campbell to have copy of my correspondence with Mr. Macdougall sent to Prince Albert so that we could discuss the matter when I reached there. This was done.\n\nAs it may be thought that something said or done by me caused Mr. Macdougall to write his letter of 7th. instant, in justice to myself, I attach a copy of our correspondence.\n\nOn my return here on the 24th., I received a letter from the Bishop of Saskatchewan. I acknowledged receipt of same without comment other than that it should have been\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nbeen addressed to you, and that to put it in its proper place, I was forwarding to Ottawa.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nNov. 24, 1910.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI was informed some time ago by Inspector Chisholm that you would move to the John Smith's Reserve, this Agency, about the 5th of December. I expect to visit this reserve between the 4th and the 14th of December. I trust that you will find the house suitable and comfortable and that your coming to the reserve will mark a great advance in educational work.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.) J?

Accept my thanks for good wishes. And I sincerely hope that I shall be able to repeat my successes elsewhere in your Agency. I have a letter from the Bishop telling me that it might be as well for me to remain here until after Xmas, and begin my duties on Jan. 3. I may say that this was after an interview he had with Inspector Chisholm, who suggested this. I shall be there as quickly as possible, in time to open school for the New Year. In the meantime I would like to hear from you and ascertain full particulars re- equipment of school, &c.&c.\n\nWith very kind regards,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(Sgd.) R.F. Macdougall.\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nDec. 3, 1910.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to yours of last instant\u2014\n\nI expect to be at the John Smith's Reserve next week and again in the last week of the year or the first of the New Year.\n\nI do not understand what you want to know about the equipment of school. The school is now open and has been for years. Any equipment that may be short, and that you will consider necessary, will no doubt be supplied by the Department. For preparing and serving the mid-day meal for the children, some equipment will be required, but I thought that could be got after your arrival and after discussion with Mrs. Macdougall and yourself.\n\nInspector Chisholm informed me that you expect to be supplied with wood firewood and coal oil and I wrote the Department for instructions. The reply is as follows:\n\n\"I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th instant, and in reply I beg to say that when the appointment of Mr. Macdougall and his wife as teacher and matron respectively on this reserve was under consideration it was finally decided to set a fixed rate of pay without rations, if a convenient residence were provided. The Department has erected the building and it is thought that the rate of pay granted to Mr. and Mrs. Macdougall is very fair. In view of this fact it is not considered advisable to allow any rations whatever, not even in the way of wood or coal oil.\n\nYou will be good enough to advise Mr. Macdougall accordingly.\"\n\nOf course, such wood as will be used in cooking the mid-day meal will be supplied by the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.)

I have not a copy of my last letter here, and consequently cannot refer to it as intelligently as I would wish, but permit me to state: That I really had no intention of offending anyone, particularly you.\n\nThat I had not thought of resigning and would not have done so under any circumstances as I had given up everything here to accept the position at John Smith's.\n\nRegarding the word \"friction\" what I meant was that if the Department and myself could not work amicably I would resign, and I think you would honor me for it, but I would of course give no cause for complaint nor do I anticipate friction.\n\nAnd I may add, particularly with you, as I know that you are interested in the education of the Indian and would go far to help one who has the same interest as yourself.\n\nRe- oil and wood. I never made it an issue- I spoke to Mr. Chisholm, and do not know whether he recommended it or not. He, I think, referred it to you. Re- anything I said respecting salary. I had accepted all the Dept's terms, and I wished to convey the idea that my motives were not entirely mercenary- And they were not- . I love the Indian work and in consequence, I threw up my position here and broke up my home to go to John Smith's.\n\nI trust that you will do what you can to rectify matters. If not, you a great injury will be done one whom I know you would never have trouble or friction with.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\n(Sgd.) R.F.

Mr. Macdougall in reference to his appointment on the John Smith's reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that as you have no doubt already been informed through Mr. Inspector Chisholm the Department has finally consented to this transfer. It is hoped that Mr. and Mrs. Macdougall will meet with a large measure of success and the Department trusts that you will, as you have in the past with other day schools, afford them every assistance in your power. The matter of proper accommodation for serving the mid-day meal, etc., should be taken up as soon as possible.

One of the expressed reasons for asking for this assistance is that Mrs. Macdougall should be put on an equal footing with the other teachers.\n\nIt must be remembered that the other teachers to whom you refer are engaged in the class-room work and that the preparation of the mid-day meal was an additional duty assigned to them. Having this in view the appointment of some help to prepare the meal was necessary. On the other hand Mrs. Macdougall is not engaged in the classroom class-room work and her appointment was as field matron, one of her duties being the preparation of the mid-day meal. The Department, however, recognizes that there is a large attendance and in view of the satisfactory reports that have been received is disposed to make a small allowance for some help in this work. It is thought, however, that $5.00 should be sufficient to meet the expenses.

Mr. McDougall and his wife receive respectively $600.00 and $300.00 for educational work on John Smith's Reserve. This is a total of $900.00.\n\nSince we dispensed with the services of Instructor Campbell, we have no Farm Instructor on the Reserve. It was thought at the time this action was taken that we did not require a Farm Instructor on this Reserve, and Mr. McDougall could perform any services that were necessary, and as a matter of fact he has been acting under the instructions of Agent MacArthur, or looking after any general business for the Reserve. I think we could well afford to pay him $200.00 or $300.00 from Vote II. I think the matter should be referred to Agent MacArthur and the Inspector.\n\n[Signature]\n\nChief Accountant.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6286, file 610-1, part 1)\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6286, file 610-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, September 19th, 1913.\n\nSIR:\n\nThe Department desires to receive from you, at your early convenience, a report with regard to the manner with which Mr. McDougall the school teacher on John Smith's Reserve performs his duties not only with regard to the school but also in connection with the farm work which it is understood he attends to on behalf of the Indians, giving them necessary instruction in the absence of a farm instructor. He has made a request to Mr. [illegible] for the work he performs as Farming Instructor. The Department will be pleased to have a recommendation from you as to what extent, if at all, he should be continued Your obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEA\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. J. Chisholm, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nReferring to departmental letter of the 19th ult., relative to the application of Rev. R. F. McDougall, of John Smith's reserve, for increased remuneration for his duties, I have the honour to report as follows:\n\nMr. McDougall continues to discharge his duties as teacher on the whole with marked success. It is true his methods in some subjects could be improved, and he devotes a large share of attention to drills and other physical exercises intended for display in the presence of visitors; but he has also kept in view the educational value of these exercises and the advantage to be gained from their use in drawing out timid and self-conscious Indian children and leading them to forget themselves. By these and similar means, too, the daily routine of the school is so varied as to become thoroughly enjoyable to the pupils; and as a consequence they come to school cheerfully and regularly, and with remarkable punctuality at the hour for opening, 9 o'clock.\n\nA new school building was not by any means indispensable here, as the old one is fairly comfortable, in good repair, was provided with a new and well-constructed porch within the past few months, and affords something above the minimum floor-space and air-space. It is, of course, heated by a large box stove; and in winter, when this is in use to its full capacity it is clear that the work cannot be conducted with the same convenience and advantage that will be\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nafforded in the new and up-to-date building that is now in course of construction; and with such guarantee as the Department has in this instance of the improved facilities being utilized to full advantage the expenditure cannot be deemed unwarranted.\n\nAs for the work of the reserve, it is necessarily directed by the teacher mainly from home, as he has but a limited time after 4 p.m. and on Saturdays to go abroad, which is especially true during the short days of Fall and Winter. I found Mr. McDougall, however, fairly well informed regarding the work of the Indians and the state of affairs generally throughout the reserve; and his counsel to the Indians in connection with their industries has certainly been more effective thus far than that of any farmer on this reserve for many years past. In the matter of grain growing there is this season a considerable increase in acreage; and during the summer more plowing has been done than in any other season for some years. Mr. McDougall does not attempt to direct the farming and live stock industries in detail; but he keeps a general supervision, and for the most part the Indians listen to his advice and encouragement and follow it cheerfully.\n\nIn his capacity as farmer, teacher and missionary Mr. McDougall has exercised a noticeable influence over the younger and middle-aged Indians in regard to temperance, which it is to be hoped may be lasting.\n\nI may mention, though not directly connected with the present question, that as matron and nurse Mrs. McDougall is constant in her attention to duty, and a great help to Mr. McDougall in his management of the school and the reserve. Both Mr. and Mrs. McDougall are now well tried in Indian work, and there is little room to fear any decrease in their efficiency; and I accordingly consider the conditions would justify some allowance to Mr. McDougall for his duties in the supervision of the reserve.\nI inspected the reserve and school in the beginning of September; but owing to the fact that my time has been completely occupied with fresh work arising from day to day which had to be attended to at once I have not as yet been able to prepare a report on my inspection.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\n422520\nMEMORANDUM -\n\nMr. Pedley:\n\nIn connection with Inspector's Chisholm's letter of the 21st October in which he recommends the payment of some allowance to Rev. R. F. McDougall, who is stationed on John Smith's Reserve as School Teacher, I would refer you to my memorandum of August 16th, last. There I stated that we could afford to pay him $200.00 or $300.00. The Inspector has given a favourable report, and it is my opinion that we should grant Mr. McDougall something for his services and the general management of the Reserve. We have him alone to depend on to make returns and to give the Indians needed advice. We do not require a farm instructor at this reserve but someone who will represent the Department. As Mr. McDougall has performed this duty satisfactorily, I think we should recognize it by paying $200.00 a year from the 1st of September, 1912.\n\nYou will notice that James McKay, M. P., recommended this increase in his letter of the 8th August last.\n\nChief Accountant.\nOttawa, 31st October, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nwith reference to the case of the Rev. R. F. McDougall, who has acted as overseer at John Smith's Reserve in addition to teaching in the Indian School, I beg to say that the Department is prepared to pay him at the rate of $200.00 a year from the 1st September last for his services as overseer. You may advise him to this effect and also place his name on future pay-lists as overseer at the salary named.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nP. L. Schmidt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No 117,084, dated October 31st, respecting the allowance of $200.00 a year to the Rev. R.F. Macdonald at John Smith's Reserve, and in reply I have to say that I am advising him to this effect, also a note has been made on the pay-list.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.P. Schmidt\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nWhen at John Smith's Reserve last week, Rev. R.F. Macdonald brought the matter of conveying the children to school during the winter months, to my attention.\n\nI have the honour to state that Geo. Crane (Treaty) agrees to drive the children, with his own team for $2.00, but Mr. Macdonald who has only one horse, suggest that another be given him, which I believe I can find on the Agency, which would make him a team, and that Gilbert Bear to use this team for driving the children, which he agrees to do for $1.50 a day, or 50\u00a2 less than the first offer, which allowing 120 days as the average number of school days the children have to be driven would mean $60.00 gain. This amount saved would be more than sufficient to pay for feeding the second horse.\n\nMr. Macdonald also says that he could have the freighting for this reserve, done with this team & ploughing etc., which amounts to a large sum in the year.\n\nI think this suggestion of Mr. Macdonald is quite good and would recommend it to you, though I must say while dealing with the question that we will have to purchase Mr. Macdonald a set of double harness, the cost of which will be about $45.00 or $50.00, should you decide to give him another horse.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6286, file 610-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, December 3, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo in reference to the transport of children on the John Smith's Reserve to school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this is the first intimation the Department has had that it will be necessary to make provision of this kind on the John Smith's Reserve and, before taking any action, full details will be necessary. I am enclosing herewith a plan of the reserve, on which you will be good enough to locate the position of the school and also of the homes of the Indians from which children are attending, showing the number of children and the approximate distance in each case. You should also state whether there is any reason why the Indians living at a considerable distance from the school should not be expected to convey their own children during the bad weather in the winter months, bearing in mind that the Department provides a warm mid-day meal for them. I may say in conclusion that the Department is not disposed to incur the comparatively large expenditure necessary to carry a plan like this into execution unless there are good and sufficient reasons for adopting it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. P. Schmidt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst., Deputy and Secretary.\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No 117084/1, dated December 3rd, respecting the conveying the children to school at the John Smith's reserve.\n\nIn reply, I have the honour to state, that when in conversation with the Rev. Mr Macdougall on this matter I understood, & have been informed that this was a practice of the Department which has been in force during the past two winters. And as it seems to be considered by all, a success, it became a foregone conclusion that the Department would continue this work, both at John Smith's & James Smith's.\n\nIn the case of James Smith's, I have already received an account for drawing the children to the north school, although this is a matter which I have not issued any instructions upon, it would seem as if it is necessary.\n\nI am unable to give, at the present moment, the distance & details of the plan, as I understood that it had been well worked out last winter, & of course considered that Mr Macdougall would direct the work done, in what has already been found the most suitable way, I am however communicating with Mr Macdougall obtaining the information that is required.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department will await further information, as called for, before considering the matter and, as you have already been informed, unless there are good and sufficient reasons the Department will not be prepared to incur the expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

As soon as the Department is advised as to your location as teacher you will be again communicated with.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nP. H.

Mr. McDougall and Mrs. McDougall at John Smith's, which the Department regrets he insists in adhering to, it is considered that it would be well for Mr. and Mrs. Gentleman to go to John Smith's, where the accommodation is much more suitable. I would ask Your Lordship to communicate at once with the Agent and if this is satisfactory to so advise him. For Your Lordship's information I am sending you a copy of a letter addressed to Mr. Schmidt.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst.

Gentleman.\n\n507p\nDuck Lake,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nMay, 18, 1915.\n\nMy Dear Sirs,\n\nYour letter of the 12th inst. reached me this afternoon, and I must explain the reason of my wire. Mr Schmidt desired us to leave as soon as possible, and in the absence of instructions proposed to wire for same; as the Department were not aware of the circumstances I thought it best to explain.\n\nI will remain in the office this week, Mr Campbell will arrive on Tuesday, and we will move next week. As John Smiths is half way to La Corne, by the time we reach the former place Mr Macdougalls arrangements will be completed.\n\nI must thank you for the detailed instructions forwarded to the Agent. I regret the circumstances that have made this change necessary, and desire to express appreciation in the manner the officers have dealt with the different matters in connection with the Agency during the past winter. At times it has been exceedingly difficult, but I have endeavored to keep matters running correctly to the best of my ability, and I believe the Dept have been anxious to assist.\n\nEither at La Corne, or John Smiths being more on my own, I will have interest in my work, and I trust results satisfactory to the Department will result.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have to inform the Department that according to the recent instructions, I left the Duck Lake Agency on the 27th ultimo and reached John Smith's two days later. Mr Schmidt gave me the use of two teams, and hired an ox team for the transfer.\n\nMr Macdougall tells me that he wishes to remain until the end of the present quarter, he came into Prince Albert with me, and we discussed the matter over with Mr Chisholm in the latter's office and it was decided that it would be best for us to remain in the old schoolhouse until Mr Macdougall's arrangements could be completed. This will give me a month's holiday and I desire to know if the Department could consider the matter of salary during this period. I have been working since February 1912, and as the John Smith's school children have had a couple of months enforced holiday during the recent small-pox, I would like to start work about a week after Mr Macdougall leaves. Of course I understand that it is not correct to work the school during the hot summer, but under the present circumstances I think it might be allowed. If the Department could make me an allowance of salary for June I would be willing to pay the transfer expenses, also remain at John Smith's during the month during which Mr Macdougall would I expect be able to give me a good idea of the different matters in connection with the reserve. I would have stayed longer at Duck Lake, but Mr Campbell required the house, also neither he or the Agent did not consider it necessary. I will not send in an account of the transfer expenses until I have word from the Department. The letter should be addressed to Puckahn, P.O.\n\nI have consulted Mr Chisholm respecting the Overseers work on the reserve, and he will communicate with you regards this matter. I would be glad if you could forward instructions to him on this matter. He could communicate them to Mr Schmidt, and it is a matter which I would like carried on through his office as he understands the situation better.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6286, file 610-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, June 14, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department considers that it would be advisable for Mr. Macdougall to remain at the John Smith's School till the end of the current quarter and will grant you a months leave. The Department will arrange to pay your salary for the month of June and your duties as teacher and overseer on the reserve will then commence on the first of July. Owing to the fact that this school was closed so long during the epidemic of smallpox the Department wishes that you would arrange to open school at least on the first of August. This would be allowing you June and July as holidays, the usual two months granted teachers.\n\nThe Department also will pay your removal expenses upon presentation of accounts through the office of the Indian Agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

P.H. Gentleman,\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to inform you that I am in receipt of a letter from Mr. P.H. Gentleman, late clerk at this office and now of John Smith's Reserve, informing me that he has received a letter from the Department dated June 14th, No. 118086-1, which states that the Department is allowing his salary for the month of June; also that his transfer expenses will be paid, and that his work as overseer and teacher will be as from July 1st, 1913, and that school will be opened on August 1st.\n\nI am awaiting the Department's instructions with regard to his salary before sending in a voucher for same, as I do not know in what capacity or the amount he is to be paid. If Mr. Gentleman acts as Overseer, is he to receive $200.00 per annum, as was paid Mr. Macdougall, besides his $600.00 per annum for teaching school.\n\nI am enclosing herewith his transfer account with receipts attached. Three teams were needed; two of which were Agency teams, one driven by Mr. F. Bruce, Interpreter, and the other by Charlie, a man engaged for that purpose. The other, Walter Littlepine, is an Indian of Beardy's Reserve.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\u2014 With reference to that part of your letter of May 12th., No.118088/b which reads \"If Mr. Gentleman goes to John Smith's Reserve he will be paid the same salary as Mr. Macdougall, viz., $600.00 per annum and his wife will be allowed $300.00 per annum provided she continues the field matron work as at present being performed by Mrs. Macdougall\". I have the honour to inform you that when at John Smith's reserve last Monday, while conversing with Mrs. Gentleman she informed me that she was willing to assist the doctor and issue cough medicines, castor oil, salts and other ordinary medicines, but did not wish to dispense drugs or fill doctor's prescriptions, as has been done in the past by Mrs. Macdougall who is a graduate nurse and, I believe, a druggist.\n\nI would be greatly obliged if the Department would inform me what the duties of a field matron are.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nWith reference to your letter No 118088/5 of May 13th to Agent Schmidt, a copy of which was forwarded to me, and the paragraph at the end \"My wife will be allowed $300.00 per year provided she continues the field matron work as at present performed by Mrs Macdougall, I wish to call the Department's attention to the fact that Mrs Macdougall is a qualified nurse with considerable hospital experience, and since she has been here appears to have carried on a very considerable amount of hospital work that only a person of considerable experience could undertake.\n\nWhen I made an application for a transfer to a reserve I was aware of this condition of my wife's duties, and am prepared that she should undertake a general oversight of the sickness on the reserve the same as that done while we were at La Corne, and I think that this must be the intention of the Department, the fact Mrs Macdougall, being fond of work of this nature and has given it more time than the Department are aware of, should not require us to continue same as being performed by her. I mention doing more work than the Department are aware of because the allowance of $300.00 is the same as that allowed at La Corne. Of course I am allowing for the larger number of people here than at La Corne, but even so Mrs Macdougall seems to have attended to all kinds of cases such as Typhoid etc, not only giving out medicine but going to their houses and staying with them nursing, providing eggs and milk, also on one or two occasions washing the feet of those infected with...\nwith consumption. Mrs Macdougall has also made up the Doctor's prescriptions. My wife is not able to do this, and I fancy that this is more than the Department require. Both my wife and I are able to attend to ordinary ailments, simple accidents, in order to keep good health on the reserve, and know when the Doctor is necessary, and gathered in the past that such, with good common sense came up to the requirements of the Department.\n\nAgent Schmidt visited the reserve yesterday and this matter was mentioned, the Department's paragraph in the letter quoted, was called to my attention by him; and he will be asking the Department to give a ruling to what extent the matrons duties go.\n\nWhile on this subject I would like to refer to the recent circular sent to the Agent respecting the Indians paying for their own Doctors visits, also the large number of drugs, with heavy accounts supplied for this band by Mr J. Stewart the druggist of Prince Albert, and say that it appears to me that some of this expense could be cut out, if the Indians were given to understand that it is necessary. The more it is encouraged the worse it will be and the band should not need it, they are better off than most bands and are close to town, and if instructions are given to the Agent to such effect I think I can, at least lower the drug bill.\n\nWe will, of course, see that there is no suffering of any kind, and the Doctor sent for when required, etc., and such, with the management of the children's midday meal will cover the matrons duties at the rate of salary named. Mrs Macdougall appears to be under the impression that her salary for this work would have been $500.00, and if I might say so, the amount of work she has done along this line, would call for that amount.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

She should, however, attend to the preparation of the mid-day meal and should do a certain amount of work among the homes of the Indians, giving where possible practical instruction in plain cooking, washing, sewing, mending and making over of garments, ventilation, cleanliness, home treatment of common diseases and rules for the treatment of emergency cases, as well as other branches of knowledge essential to the proper management of the home.

I trust all that both my wife and I have been here than they from daylight until dark.\n\nI must refer to the Dept. Letter No. 118088/17 June 4th in which it was stated that arrangements would be made in connection with my time salary. I regret to say that this has not yet reached me and as my expenses during the past two months have been so heavy, expenses that we cannot very well charge up to the Dept. Such as spoiled clothes & damaged furniture, etc., being trips into town, etc., that I have an overdraft at the bank, by a cheque has not been already mailed I would be glad if it could be forwarded.\n\nThe Inspector Graham arrived yesterday a few minutes before noon. As he did not wish, nor have time to go into details, I informed him that \"the Dept. had already seen of my correspondence with regard to views on the suitability of the Agent to whom I had nothing to add or withdraw\". I beg to learn to make a correction. On 15 May letters addressed to the Prime Minister on the subject brought an answer from that gentleman's office, and another brought an answer from Mr. Roch\u00e9's Office. These letters no doubt the Dept. can obtain if necessary.\nI may add that it was not until any disrespect to the officials of the Department that I addressed the Prime Minister, but an effort to draw the Government attention to a clearly political appointment of an unsuitable man, in face of the recently published report of Sir George Henry on the civil service. The Department will understand and take into consideration the circumstances at Buckingham between October 1st March 24th.\n\nI am afraid that Mr. Graham was not very well satisfied that he had been away without other information. The thing would take two or three days to look into properly, it is foolish to expect things like this can be done in an hour, let alone five or seven miles down the river in - even in a motor.\n\nI do not think a house and land title could have been chosen.

Paul Schmidt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nSir:\n\nIn connection with the school work at this reserve I have to report that it was impossible to reopen school until Aug 11th owing to non arrival of supplies from Sack Lake, also the horsepower did not come the house until the latter part of July which only came in a few days to get straight. The bacon etc. was shipped from Sack Lake but was stolen from the C.N.R. cars on the way.\n\nThe average attendance during the month has been 20, this will be higher after the boys have finished laying. We are still without suitable range pans etc. for cooking the midday meal expecting when I shall ask for instructions to be sent to Sack Lake so soon as possible.\n\nSincerely\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Deputy and Secretary,\n\nP. H. Gentleman, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nJohn Smith's School,\nPuckahn, Sask.\nRapid City, Man.,\nSept 8/13,\n\nThe Deputy Minister\nIndian Lands Dept.,\nOttawa.\n\nRef: 445107\n\nDear Sir,\n\nCan you kindly furnish me with the address of Percy H. Gentleman who I believe is employed at least on one of the Indian Reserves, as an agent or clerk of your department? He is a relative of mine and I've lost all trace of him for some time.\n\nYours truly,\nChas. Cleavwell.\nOttawa, 17th September, 1915.\n\nSir:\n\nIn reply to enquiry in your letter of the 8th instant, I beg to say that Mr. P.H. Gentleman is in the employ of this Department. His address is John Smith's Reserve, Puckahn, Sask.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMr. Chas. Crosswell,\nRapid City, Man.\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter No. 117084/1 of the 9th inst., respecting the opening of the school here on August 11, and in reply I must state that I regret that the Department should have gathered from my report that the classroom work is dependent on the mid-day meal, as this is not so.\n\nAt the same time, in reporting the matter I may not have made the circumstances quite clear, and I beg to submit a further note on the matter. As the Department are aware, at the beginning of July also on the first of August I issued a much reduced ration to the widows and destitute which in itself caused much discussion on the reserve, at the same time I refused entirely to ration the working Indians that were putting up hay which was the cause of more difficulty and I had quite a hard job to convince these people that they must not expect the Department to provide for them, so much in this way.\n\nNow, the children's dinner was not expected to be reduced, and it did not seem to me to be wise to cause further dissatisfaction among the people by not providing the usual meal, and as I could not do this I thought the matter best overcome by allowing them another weeks holiday, as the only provisions on hand was flour. Now we could not have made a satisfactory meal out of flour alone, and in taking the course I did, I did not lay myself open to more disputes on reduced rations. The children would have noticed the better meal the following week which would have given the impression that a point had been gained, and this was not necessary.\n\nI would add that Mr Macdougall would have purchased fresh beef in Prince Albert under similar conditions, but I had no\nauthority to do such, and if I had done so, the Duck Lake office would have returned the account to me asking why such a thing had been done, and the extra weeks holiday did not appear to me to be of sufficient importance to give cause for this. It was not as if I did not put in an appearance at the reserve until that date, our time was more or less occupied all June and July here, and as Mr Macdougall did not leave this house until the latter part of July we were in somewhat of a muddled position, still on Aug. 1st.\n\nI would also like to add, if I may be permitted, that I had several talks with Mr Macdougall on this subject, the non arrival of supplies. He considered that the school work was quite important to warrant him purchasing on his own account without authority. The subject interested me as on several occasions while at the Duck Lake office it fell to me to write a reasonable letter of explanation in an effort to get an account of this kind passed. Mr Macdougall also remarked that if the Agent could not, or would not see that supplies were on hand when required, after having good notice, it was up to the man in charge to go ahead on his own account.\n\nOn the other hand, Mr Inspector Graham when here, informed me that if the Government saw fit to appoint a man who was not onto the job, I was not in any way to exceed his authority or instructions no matter what they might be, otherwise if this was not satisfactory to myself, I was quite at liberty to leave the service.\n\nHowever on matters of this kind, I must assure the Department I will use very careful judgement, giving full consideration to the circumstances at the time, I have no desire to act against Mr Schmidt's wishes in anything, but I think if the Department more fully understood the conditions they would see that sometimes it is not wise to carry out instructions exactly to the letter, when such are given from so great a distance.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6286, file 610-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, October 1, 1923.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 19th ultimo in reference to the purchase of supplies for the mid-day meal on the John Smith's Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department wishes you to notify the Agent in good time in advance say a month as to the supplies needed, but on some occasions should you run short of provisions there will be no objection to your buying a very limited quantity. Should this action be found necessary at any time you should at once inform the Agent.\n\nI may say that the Department approves of your action in refusing a ration to working Indians.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. STEWART\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nP. H. Gentleman, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nJohn Smith's School,\nPuckahn, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI desire to bring to your notice a remark made by Mr Chisholm on his recent visit, in which it was stated that the children did not seem to come to school so punctually as when Mr Macdougall was here. I do not think there is any difference myself, as I observed them very carefully during June while living in the old schoolhouse.\n\nThey are not however as punctual as I would like, & I think if we had a clock in the schoolhouse so that they could see the time it would help to overcome this difficulty. A suitable wall clock could be purchased for $6. or $7, or a \"Big Ben\" for half that amount, either of which would be in keeping with the rest of the building, and I would be glad to know if one might be purchased.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI beg leave to submit herewith a report on the affairs of this reserve in general, and more particularly in connection with the school, also the work of ex-pupils.\n\nAs the Department is aware the reserve is about eighteen miles from the city of Prince Albert on the South Saskatchewan and is splendid farming land. Most of the men who are farming are ex-pupils of the Battleford school, or the recent Emmanuel College in Prince Albert, also the half-breed element being very strong make the people here, in my opinion, somewhat in advance of those of James Smiths or Beardys band, but while they have cultivated a good deal of the white mans ways for their good, they have also learned much in the opposite direction which makes them a difficult people to deal with.\n\nIn the school, most of the childrens parents are ex-pupils of the Battleford school, or have had some connection with the Boarding schools and the result is very encouraging. The children come to school clean and tidy, nor do they have the odour of skins & fur that is general among the Indian. I find however that they are not so advanced as I expected, but they readily respond to direct teaching with the blackboard and large pictures. I have a large class of young children between six and eight years of age whom I am successfully teaching to read with the aid of very large beautifully coloured posters; the third and fourth grades also making headway with the aid of the London Daily Mirror, the illustrations therein being much looked for each week.\n\nIn Arithmetic I have largely confined myself to Addition, subtraction, multiplication and division for the whole school, but the elder children will advance in this from now on. I find them all backward in Arithmetic.\nWith regards the attendance, the girls are very regular, but the boys have often been kept at home to assist with the haying. This is a difficult matter to deal with, no doubt the elder boys are a help but I am endeavouring to impress upon the parents that this is not approved of. I would suggest that with a reserve of this kind that some form of Application for admission, also discharge be put in force and let the parents well understand that no assistance in the way of a grant would be given to a pupil of the reserve school unless the attendance is satisfactory, also such grants should be made as soon after the pupil leaves school, as possible. At present the boys casually drop out at about thirteen or fourteen, then hang around doing very little for four or five years, whereas if it was possible to keep them for a proper discharge at sixteen, they could have a year or so at home, and then settle them down a little.\n\nThe question of ex-pupils assistance and advancement is a very difficult one, and I would mention two instances of what has been done here this summer. One man George Crain who must be twenty-six or seven this spring received sufficient seed wheat for five or six acres. This was sown, but never fenced, and no thought seems to have been given to this. The man put up a little hay for the loan oxen he has, also has the Department waggon on loan most of the summer, but his whole seasons work does not amount to a row of beans. Certainly his wife has been slowly going blind, I sent the man to Dr Strong with her but he went several times to an Eye Doctor in town paying from $2. to $3. a visit, but afterwards coming to me for rations being quite destitute for the time being, and appealing to Mr Chisholm for cash in town. I might also add that a local harness man approached me for information as regards Georges crop as he had a note of $50.00 against him of some years standing. The Bank of Ottawa, I am told by their accountant advanced Crain an amount on his note, also some years back.\nbut I was not informed of the amount. The man now says that it will be necessary for him to go out and hunt this winter, and is going to Cumberland. Who is to take care of the loan oxen, it is difficult to say, also there are two bright little children that should be at school, and who will quite likely not survive a hard winter's hunt.\n\nAnother case of an ex-pupil's work is Harry Badger. This man put in a small crop, and left it to go to the Pas. One of the old widows hedged it with brush, and rails tied with string. The man returned a month ago. The oxen provided for him were very old and slow, and the excuse was that they were too slow. The Agent sold them at the sale, and bought a fine pair of steers from Robert Bear H.M., raising three, for him, which he now claims he cannot break. This might throw another yoke on our hands to see through the winter, as Badger also finds it necessary to go hunting.\n\nThere are six or eight young men around between the age of sixteen and twenty whom applications for grants will come from within the next few years, whom, if the Department approves, I would like to help as follows. If a couple of $50.00 grants are to be made next spring, could I get these young men to attend a night school twice a week during the winter, and let them understand that the grants would be made to the man making the best showing. I would give them some careful talking, and advance their Arithmetic etc., and talk plans for the summer work. Perhaps the Department might be able to offer a bridle, or tools as a prize outright, I feel sure that there is good material to work on, and that one of the mistakes is that an assistance grant is made without showing the Indian that some interest is taken in the manner he makes use of it, other than getting the repayments made. I fancy I could reach these young men in the way mentioned if allowed, and the grants made next spring in this way.\nRespecting the work of the other men, they have had a very fair summer. The grain has ripened good, and the hay has been fairly plentiful on the high land, but this year is the first that the working Indians have not received rations; and they have sold a large amount of same in Prince Albert. It is possible that some of them have not provided sufficient for their cattle for the coming winter, but I have got hem to understand that the Department will not ration able-bodied men. The recent visit of Mr Chisholm was very successful in this matter as the younger men reminded the Chief of the treaty, who informed them that rations were promised for three years which had long since past.\n\nUp till now there has been no case of serious illness among the people. The Doctor has been out two or three times, and my wife has visited most of the houses, and endeavored to impress upon them the importance of keeping things clean and tidy etc., etc.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 13, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Agent is being written to and authorized to purchase a \"Big Ben\" clock for use at the John Smith's School.\n\nYour other communication of the 1st instant in reference to ex-pupils has also been received and the contents noted.\n\nWith regard to Crane's oxen you should report the circumstances to the Agent so that arrangements can be made for the care of these also of the yoke of steers provided for Harry Badger.\n\nI may say that the Department is not prepared to adopt your suggestion to issue applications for admission to and discharge from the day school, as is done at boarding schools.\n\nWith regard to the young men for whom application will probably be made for advances for assistance next year, I beg to say that the Department approves of your suggestion in regard to the night school, but is not prepared to say that only those making the best showing should receive assistance, as this alone could not be considered.\n\nP. H. Gentleman, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nJohn Smith's School,\nPuckahn, Sask.\nconsidered a fair criterion of the usefulness of an Indian as a farmer afterwards. The Department would be prepared to allow a small amount for the purchase of prizes in the way that you suggest for the pupils attending this night school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Stewart\n\nAssistant Secretary.\nOttawa, October 13, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. P. H. Gentleman, teacher of the John Smiths School, has asked that a clock be purchased for the school-house. You are hereby authorized to purchase a \"Big Ben.\"\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nC. F. Schmidt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nSir,\n\nIn connection with the quarterly return of the John Smith's day-school, enclosed herewith, I have the honour to inform you that the teacher, Mr. Gentleman, states that his reason for not opening school until 11th of August was that \"he had no bacon on hand for the mid-day meal. On July 23rd, I shipped a case of bacon for this reserve, part to be used for the mid-day meal. This was stolen from the case while in transit. I was advised of this by the C.N.Ry. Agent here, when I immediately shipped another case on the 29th of July. It is evident that the second case did not reach the reserve until the 8th of August.\n\nIn speaking with Mr. Gentleman re-the delay in opening school, he said that he expected that the Department would take exception to the fact, that having only flour, and being a new teacher, he did not wish to commence by giving a poor meal.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nUnder these circumstances I would be glad if the Department would take up with the Agent the question of conveying the children to school during the winter months, as it is possible that the Agent will not think of this until quite late, and it is a matter that very much depends upon the weather. I gather from the Rev. Archdeacon McKay who was here last week with the Bishop of Montreal & Saskatchewan that \"the Department would continue to undertake this as far as the 'improved' Day School was concerned.\n\nIn writing the Agent, it would be well to instruct him to arrange with an Indian willing to bring all the children, there is only one family that live up on the hill 3\u00bd miles from the school, that in the past have not been driven as it means a third trip, but there are three children from this house and they deserve to be driven as much as the others. Their father is old, on the ration list, and is anxious for them to attend during the winter.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature] P.W. Gentleman.\n\nThe Secretary.\nOttawa, October 29, 1913.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to call your attention to official letter of the 5th of March, last, in which you were asked to take into consideration the question of transporting the children on the John Smith's Reserve during the coming winter to school. In that letter you were informed that the Department considered that the Indians themselves, in view of what had been done for the children of this school by the Department, should undertake to see that they are driven to the school. The Department would like to have a report from you as to what arrangements, if any, are being made for having this work done. You will be good enough to attend to this matter as soon as possible as the winter is fast approaching.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nC.F. Schmidt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nOttawa, October 29, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to that portion of your letter of the 22nd instant in reference to the transporting of the children to the John Smith's School during the winter months I beg to say that the Agent is being communicated with in regard to this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nP. H. Gentleman, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nJohn Smith's School,\nPickahm, Sask.\nSir,\u2014 In reply to your letter of 29th ultimo, No. 117084-1, relative to the conveying of the children of John Smith's Reserve to school during the winter, I have the honour to inform you that while at this reserve the other day the matter was taken up and looked into by Mr. Inspector Chisholm, Mr. Gentleman the teacher and myself.\n\nMr. Gentleman is very anxious that the children be conveyed to school in order to keep up the attendance. However, in discussing the matter it was proven that only three families lived at any great distance from the school, one, Robert Bear H.M., about two miles east, another, Gilbert Bear, about one and a half miles south and the other, Francis Dreaver, about two miles north-west. This means that it would keep a team very busy in the morning getting the children to school by nine o'clock on account of the distance between the houses.\n\nIt appears that in the past when the children were conveyed, those of Robert Bear H.M. and Francis Dreaver were not driven; the driver claiming, it is said, that he was not paid sufficient for the work, which was $1.50 a day.\n\nThe children attending this school are mostly young, and it is certain that they will be absent in cold weather and progress will be slow.\n\nOf the families living far from the school only Robert\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nonly Robert Bear H.M. could drive his children. The others have no horses.\n\nOne thing to be considered is that they have been driven in the past, this the parents and children expect will be repeated.\n\nA good, reliable man, with team, can be got for $2.00 per day.\n\nAnother thing to be considered is that both the north and south schools are to be opened on James Smith's Reserve, which makes three day schools among the same class of people. It would be unfair to both teacher and children, to convey the children of the one school and not those of the others, and to convey them at the three places would mean rather heavy expense. Therefore, unless the Department is prepared to grant conveyance at all three schools, I would suggest that none be granted at all.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, November 17, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant relative to the conveying of children of the John Smith's Reserve to school during the winter.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department considers, in view of all that has been done for the people on this reserve in the matter of education, that they should undertake to see that their children are sent regularly to school, as they have facilities for doing so. The Department would not be inclined to pay for having them conveyed. This will apply to the other two schools in your agency.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLEAN\n\nAsst., Deputy and Secretary.\n\nG. F. Schmidt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nDiary note for October from John Smith's Reserve.\n\nI regret to say that I have not kept my diary up to date. On receiving instructions from Mr. Chsiholm to the effect that my duties only went as far as attending to the old people etc., I did not know if a diary was required to be sent in or not. My time has been fully occupied with the school, and other matters in connection with the reserve during the month & I have not been to town, or away except for the mail & to Fenton for school supplies and coal oil.\n\nIt may be of interest to the Department to have a detailed account of today's doings, (November 3rd)\n\nRose at 6.20 a.m. Lit two fires & finished breakfast by 7.5, when I went to the stable. Milked, watered & fed horse & cows, and in the middle of cleaning stable about 7.35, Chief arrived for rations. Same having arrived late on Saturday night, had to open case of bacon & tea, to ration Chief which took about 20 minutes, also open dry goods to get him a blanket.\n\nAt 8.15 I lit the schoolhouse furnace, carried in wood and water for my own use & children's midday meal. At 8.50 Mrs Dreaver arrived for rations which I issued. At 9.10 I went into school with seven children, the rest arriving between that & 9.25. At 10.45 I rationed Mrs Smith & Mink. School 11 till 12. With the children while they had dinner 12 till 12.30. Had my own lunch 12.30 till 12.50 at which time I blew up a football for the boys, and played with them until 1.5. I then hitched up the horse first having to catch him in the field, as it was necessary for my wife to visit two sick people. At 1.15, I went into school. At 1.40 I advised an Indian respecting a hay matter, at 2.5 another Indian respecting the threshing machine. At 2.50 the Agent called in for a couple of minutes & at 2.45, I rationed. Mrs E. Smith. Mrs Batt issuing blankets also.\n\nSchool from 3 till 4.5, when I had tea. My wife having returned from the north end & we went at 4.20 to the south end, taking Mrs Badgers rations, and visiting another sick person. We reached home at 5.20, when I watered & fed the animals, and finished cleaning out the stable, which\nkept me busy until 6.15, talking to an Indian part of the time whom I got rid of about 6.30. At 6.55 I got into my office, checked over three accounts, receipts etc., also wrote five letters on the Departments business, filed some vouchers, & copies, and looked through the matters that had been left by the Inspector requiring attention.\n\nIt is now 9.5.p.m. and another Indian is waiting to see me about something. I have yet to make up the following,\n\nFarmers report, Ration sheet, earnings report, part of which cannot be done until I enter up the amount of provisions received during the month in the warehouse book. To catch to-morrow's mail I should do these to night, but I am afraid they will really have to go till Saturday. As soon as I have finished with the man waiting I purpose Dinner & retiring.\n\n[Signature]\n\nOverseer & Teacher.\nthe new threshing machine, I met an Indian, Gilbert Bear, going to town with a load of hay; and there are Indians going to town every day. When we arrived at the reserve I went to Mr. Gentleman's and stayed with him. He complained of being out of provisions, saying that those I had shipped were still in Prince Albert. Asked why he had not had these freighted out, he complained that the Indians were unwilling to freight.\n\nNow, this is a very poor excuse. The first Indian I met that evening, Gilbert Bear whom I had met on the road, said that he would have brought them out if he had known they were there, that 25\u00a2 per cwt. was good pay. Asked when he would go back to town, he said \"Saturday\", and agreed with pleasure to bring the provisions out.\n\nFreighting to this reserve happens once a month, and I am satisfied that Mr. Gentleman could find someone to freight if he cared to.\n\nMr. Gentleman writes of having to go in the field to catch his horse. This is not necessary as he has tons of feed at his stable door. Why does he not keep his horse in the stable? If he accompanies Mrs. Gentleman on her visits, he does so at his own good will.\n\nRegarding the checking of three accounts: One was for freighting the above mentioned provisions and dry goods, one for oils supplied the band and the other was an account of $10.00 from the Union Trading Co. of Prince Albert, for sheets, stockings, wrapperette, etc., which I returned to him for explanations, viz., who the goods were for and the authority to purchase, as I had never heard of, nor authorized the expenditure.\n\nWhat the five letters on Department business were I do not know. They have not been received at this office.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs.

Gentleman's \"Diary Note\" as he calls it, for the month of October.\n\nWith reference to the statement \"On receiving instructions from Mr. Chisholm that my duties only went as far as attending to the old people, etc.\", I have yet to learn what the word \"etcetera\" covers in this case.\n\nMr. Gentleman then writes \"It may be of interest to the Department to have a detailed statement of today's doings, Nov. 3rd.\"\n\nI must remark that he takes exception to that one day, Monday, November 3rd, the day on which, it appears, he issued rations to the destitute. This could as easily be done on a Saturday when the school is closed, seeing that he is paid extra for this work. He complains of having had to open a box of bacon, chest of tea, and dry goods, these having arrived late Saturday night, November 1st. Now, these goods were shipped from here on October 18th, and Mr. Gentleman was notified of the shipment, by mail, on the same day.

It is a small one, & last year the people here decided to obtain a larger organ for the church and dispose of the old one, the money from which was to be placed towards the new one. Meanwhile until they found a customer they placed the old organ in the schoolhouse where it has remained. A few weeks after they obtained the new organ a wandering musician who understood organs, happened to come along, and Mr Macdougall at his own expense had him overhaul the old organ, so that it is now in good condition, in fact quite good enough to go back in the church if necessary.\n\nThe new church organ cost somewhere about $90.00 of which $35.00 still remains to be paid. I hope to raise $10.00 from the children's Christmas Tree Concert, & the old organ can be kept for the school if the Department could manage the balance. The people are anxious to pay off their debt and I have no doubt they will raise the $10.00 if this could be done.\n\nI, of course, must say that having same in the school I am using it to teach them singing, as well as musical drill, marching, etc. I play myself, it is a great help to the school especially with the musical exercises, and as the instrument is well worth double, I trust the matter may be considered.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department considers that it would be suitable to raise funds for the purchase of this organ by giving entertainments and asking for assistance from the Indians, who should be able to contribute something.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Gentleman, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nJohn Smith's Indian School,\nPuckahn, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit herewith a report on the work of the school children attending the Day school here, also the reserve in general during the quarter ending this week. The detailed information respecting the school is also enclosed.\n\nWith the exception of the very small children, I consider they have all made advancement in the different branches of study. I have given considerable time to Arithmetic, the elder girls having mastered Long Division & just beginning multiplication etc of weights & measures, while the three eldest girls have got as far as fractions. The boys all of them, are working at Long Division at the present time, while the small children are still at addition.\n\nReading exercises etc are carried out daily, the elder girls using the fourth reader & Geography books, which I sometimes use to combine a reading & Geography lesson together. The boys are using the second & third readers, while the younger children are reading from the blackboard. The whole school read one or two verses each every morning from the bible.\n\nAll the children write well, and every lesson at which the exercise books are used is made a writing lesson.\n\nThe girls also have regular Grammar & Composition lessons twice a week, also Geography which is studied with the boys with the aid of the large wall maps. I give the boys composition lesson in connection with spelling on the blackboard. The elder girls have during the quarter learnt how to draw maps, and the boys have studied house and stable plans each one drawing his idea of the best house, and writing down his reasons for same. All the children have received Nature Study lessons, which\nI am able to make very attractive. The children look forward to a weekly Nature Study Drawing lesson. Twenty minutes drill with music has been given each day, also some eight or ten songs were learnt during the quarter, the latter mainly on account of the Christmas tree concert.\n\nIn connection with the younger children of whom there are eight or ten who are almost unable to do anything I found that this class caused me considerably difficulty while teaching the elder children, insomuch that it was difficult to keep them busy for any length of time. To overcome this I obtained from London at my own expense an entire outfit of Kindergarten materials, of which I have had experience, & instead of setting them lessons while teaching the elder children, I am using the Kindergarten things; with I think a fair amount of success. They have only been in use a short while, & it is something that has never been done here before. This, with the reading from the board with the big posters will be the work of the little ones for some time to come.\n\nThe school term was closed by a Christmas tree Concert last Tuesday at which the entire programme was made up of the childrens songs & recitations, some eighteen items in all. A collection taken up during the evening amounted to $9.46, and one or two parents expressed their satisfaction, in Cree & English, of the childrens work. All my lessons are marked, and at my own expense I gave prizes to the six highest; the marks being totalled weekly, and at the end of the year.\n\nIn connection with the attendance I find that the average works out at 28, which I consider fair. The decision of the Department not to drive the children to school has something to do with this & I cannot refrain from making one or two comments on this subject. I must say however that this winter has been most exceptionally warm with very little snow, a condition of affairs I believe prevailing throughout the west at present. Had the weather been cold the average attendance would have been very much lower, and it is a great pity, that having provided an excellent\nSchool building etc., that nothing is done to see or enable the children to make a regular attendance. There is excellent material here to work on, & I would call attention to the late Agent Macarthur's report of a year or so ago in which he stated that the John Smiths school hardly justified its existence at that time, and compare it with now. From my experience with other Indian Day schools which I have taught & visited I can say that the Department have something here that is considerably above the average in every way. The children are neat and tidy, and come to school clean, and I believe I am getting as full attendance as is possible. I would point out that the John Smiths people are considerably advanced in their ways being very much like the white settlers off the reserve, and as it is general in the west the boys are often kept at home during the summer months to help with the work, whereas this could be overcome a good deal if they could be driven during the winter. I would also say that there is only one family attending whom might be called hunters, the others all being Farmers, and the children helping with the chores morning and evening, with short days, makes it very difficult for the children to get to school on time. This should receive consideration.\n\nI must also report that during two weeks of December, in order to ascertain the distance & time etc., I drove the children myself in the morning, on which days I picked up every child of school age on the reserve. The experiment was not made without difficulty, I had to use the buggy and of course a single horse, I found that by leaving the house at eight o'clock I could get every child by 9:30 in three journeys, but of course it meant a great deal of extra work for myself. This could however be worked with the school as a starting center.\n\nIn concluding the matter of attendance I would remark that at three white schools within ten miles or so, I am informed that the average attendance is $7 & 8 respectively, with an enrollment of 9,11, & 12.\nI must say that it is with no small amount of difficulty that I can give the school the attention that it should have. There is a great deal of difference between \"putting in time\" and actual teaching, & while I endeavour to teach the whole of schoolhours I often find that I get very tired towards the end of the week. It should be considered that the daily \"chores\" here mean no small amount of work. The morning work of cleaning the horse & stable, watering, feeding & milking, & four fires to light, with wood to carry to each of them and water to get into the house for the children's midday meal etc., means something. There is an hour and a half of this daily before I can get into school, and similar in the evening. Had the winter been a hard one, it would be impossible to do all this alone, and at the same time do justice to the school.\n\nI would point out the granting of authority to the Agent to hire a man here when required is really of little assistance, as there are often times that a man is needed when it would be impossible to obtain permission from Duck Lake, & this throws a lot of work on myself. Also, I am quite alone, while Mr Macdougall had two boys of his own, who did a great deal of stable cleaning etc., also who could take a message to one of the Indians while if I need anyone it is necessary for me to leave school, or go after schoolhours and find someone.\n\nI cannot understand the Department refusing some kind of assistance, I notice from the Bluebook reports that some of the Boarding school staffs seem to be extensive, notably the Sarcee Boarding School that appears to have an enrollment of sixteen, that needs a staff of four.\n\nHere it is impossible to do much reading on one's own account, and unlike various other teachers, Agents & Inspectors, I have nothing in the shape of a cattle ranch as a sideline, $600, or $800, is not an extensive salary when there is no promotion to look forward to, and absolutely no time for study. Of course it has been pointed out that the Department...\nare allowing $15.00 per quarter for help in the house, but I would ask what kind of help can one get from an Indian at $5.00 per month. I have to pay Mrs Badger another $15.00 per quarter out of my own salary for doing a considerable amount of the Departments work. The statement made by Mr Chisholm that the fire for the children's midday meal does not need to be started until eleven o'clock is quite a mistake, & if my wife & I finish breakfast later than eight, the whole day is thrown late. Mrs Badger arrives at the house about 8.30, and starts work at once.\n\nIt is also necessary for me to see that beef, flour etc is placed in a handy place in the kitchen, and I bring this from the old schoolhouse which is now used as a warehouse myself.\n\nIn making this report I would like to request that the reason for the Departments desire for a monthly diary from me, could be sent. It seems as if someone is endeavouring to find as many reports, forms etc, to fill up at the end of the month as is possible to get. I have no less than six reports to write out at the end of each month, and the Diary I think is one that I might be relieved of. I am in school daily except Saturdays, so what can I put in it. I will submit a diary of the Saturday work with an expense account, as Saturdays are the only day on which I can get into town to make any purchase that is necessary. This would make a little less work at the end of the month. It could be observed that Farmer Lepine of One Arrows whose diary I have often had to read over while at Duck Lake take the first, or last day of the month to write his monthly report, while in my case I have various accounts and correspondence to attend to besides a day in school.\n\nIn order to obtain the Tuesday mail without being out after dark my wife has been teaching the girls sewing and knitting during the\nThe health of the people has been good, & my wife & I generally manage to get around to visit each house about once a month, while more frequent visits have been made when necessary to those sick.\n\nAn accident occurred to a young girl, Nina Smith by name, some six weeks ago hurting her knee by falling out of a rig. Dr Strong visited her, and at first could not locate the difficulty, some three weeks later his partner Dr MacMillan came out, and said at once it would be necessary for the girl to go to the hospital for an operation. At first I would not allow this until authority had been obtained, and it was only on the strict understanding that the Doctor should go at once to Mr Chisholm and wire for authority that I allowed him to take the girl in. I am informed by the Agent that this was not done, but what could I do at the time. The Doctor said it was necessary that the girl should go at once, and by promising to take the matter up with Mr Chisholm I thought that this would be the most satisfactory way out of the difficulty. I may add that the girl has since undergone a serious operation on the knee joint. I called at the Hospital last time I was in town, & found her making fair progress.\n\nThe threshing outfit recently purchased worked very well, and completed threshing operations in good time. The people are now using the engine with the circular saw loaned them from the Agency Headquarters so that the gasoline engine and circular saw are in competition against the old Hudson Bay axe.\n\nI also enclose some photographs of the school etc., taken by myself, that may be of interest.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to my recent report on the school in which I stated that in was with no small amount of difficulty that I am able to give same the attention it should have on account of the morning chores I think I have found a way to overcome this, which I would ask for the Departments approval.\n\nMy statement may be misunderstood. I like to be fresh when going into school in the morning, I am sure I could do better work, but this at present is impossible on account to the chores. Milking, feeding & watering, carrying in wood & water besides cleaning the stable take a little over an hour, and I cannot teach in stable clothes.\n\nTo get over this, I am desirious of giving half my rations to an Indian, Francis Dreaver, by name who is willing to do an hours work here in the mornings, if the Department can do something in connection with the old Farmers house. Dreaver is an old man at present on the monthly ration list, I think just about able to do what I need. He has three children attending school, this family being the longest distance away, quite four miles. Now if Dreaver could be permitted to occupy the old Farm house he could assist me, and at the same time have his children quite close to school which would be a very excellent arrangement.\n\nUnfortunately the farmhouse is occupied by another man, by name Alfred Smith, who moved in there this fall with the permission of the Agent and who promptly left the big gate always open causing myself & the Agent a whole lot of work in connection with the cattle getting into our stacks.\n\nThis man is married, but has no family, and I notice is often away for several days at the time. He had a house of his own, but I am\ninformed that when he was allowed to move into the Farmhouse, he sold his own building to a half-breed, Willie Umpherville, who has lived for some time on the reserve.\n\nIf the Department could see fit to instruct the Agent to move out Smith, and allow Dreaver to live there, it would be of a very great assistance to myself, & I am sure benefit the school, also help Dreaver, besides being at no cost to the Head office.\n\nThere are plenty of empty houses in fair condition that Smith could use, also it might be used as a means of getting rid of the halfbreed Umpherville. Of course I know that this man has no right to live on the reserve, but the fact remains, that having done so for a good many years now, to turn him out is liable to cause unpleasantness for myself & Agent with Chief John Smith & his family to whom the man is related. I cannot say that Umpherville causes trouble by bringing whiskey onto the reserve, but he farms a field, sells hay & wood, used the Threshing outfit, all of which are resented by the Phillip Bear & Crain families.\n\nUnder these circumstances I trust that my suggestion may have consideration and some instructions may be forwarded to the Agent. I would add that it is only during the winter, the dark mornings I feel the rush, also Dreaver complains of the distance & cold for his children to attend school during the short days.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, 19th January, 1914.\n\nSir:\u2014\n\nI beg to say that the Department has been informed that you have allowed Alfred Smith to occupy the farm house on John Smith's Reserve. If the fact is as stated an explanation is required from you as you should not have granted the permission to the man to reside in the house without authority from the Department. This house should be available for Francis Breaver's use in order that he may be near at hand to assist Mr. Gentleman when required. You should give Alfred Smith notice to vacate the house at once. I may add that you have not, at any time, authority to allow any man other than an Indian to reside on a reserve without permission from Head-Quarters.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nP.H. Gentleman Esq.,\nJohn Smith's Reserve,\nPuckahn, B.O.L. Sask.\nDear Mr Scott,\n\nI regret that it appears necessary to appeal to you personally to do something which will assure us getting more satisfactory attention from the Agent.\n\nBy Saturdays mail I received a mass of foolish letters from Duck Lake which I have a mind to forward, but would be far too long to comment on in detail. Also I received the third copy of the September school report, which is in response to a request made in November & December. Kindly observe the date, January 18, this is a week longer than it takes to get replies from your own office. A request for potatoes made in November & again in December has not yet brought a reply. I must also say that the School has not been closed on Tuesday afternoons. My wife has been teaching sewing from 2.30 till 3.45 while I go for the mail, which I have done in order to send off replies to Saturdays correspondence. It is more a desire to attend to business quickly, than my own mail. I will however discontinue the sewing class and let the mail go.\n\nCould this reserve be made like \"White Caps\" under Mr Chisholm's inspection? It is most trying to work under Mr Schmidt. If some different arrangement cannot be made, I suppose we will have to give up the position.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6286, file 610-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of 19th ultimo, No. 117084-1, with reference to Alfred Smith occupying the old farmhouse on John Smith's reserve, I have the honour to inform you that the said Alfred Smith is an Indian, and a son of Chief John Smith of that reserve.\n\nWhen visiting the reserve last fall with Mr. Inspector Chisholm, Chief John Smith asked me permission to allow his son, Alfred, who has no house of his own, to spend the winter in the old farmhouse which was unoccupied. The same evening we saw Alfred, who made the request personally. I asked Mr. Inspector Chisholm what his opinion was. He replied that he saw no reason why the young man could not spend the winter in the house, seeing that it was unoccupied. I remarked at the time that the house had already been occupied by Indians, namely, Gilbert Bear, carpenter, who was living in the house when I took office, and spent the winter 1912-13 there. I then told Alfred Smith that he could winter there, but that he was to give it up at any time should we need it for someone else, or for other purposes. I have written Smith telling him to\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nto vacate the house at once in order that it may be available for Francis Dreaver's use.\n\nRegarding the last paragraph of your letter I beg to say that I have never allowed anyone who is not an Indian to live on any of the reserves. On the contrary, I have strictly forbidden half-breeds from living on the reserves, and have sent some away, and told others who have lived on reserves for years to move off.\n\nI trust this explanation will be satisfactory.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir,\n\nWill you allow me to write you again personally, as in so doing, I feel more assured that my letter will have proper consideration.\n\nI regret to state that I have been laid up in bed for the past two weeks with a sharp attack of Peritonitis, & have only this morning got up for the first time. On account of this I had to close the school on the 9th instant, & hire a man to go to Birch Hills for Dr Giles whom I had to send for again last Sunday. I have also had to hire a man to do the outside chores, feeding the animals, etc., or rather I had to get the eldest schoolboy as most of the men are away hunting. When I hired the lad on the 9th, I promised him $1.25 per day with dinner, as I did not think I would need him more than three days at the very most, otherwise it would have been cheaper and more satisfactory to have got a man for a couple of weeks. I am very sorry that it was quite impossible to ask permission from Duck Lake to hire anyone, and I am now at a loss to know if I might be permitted to put this expense in my monthly expenses account, or not. It will come to $16. or $18. that is if I can get out by next Monday which I hope to do.\n\nI would like to inform you the direct cause of this attack. For the past six weeks I have been plagued with a dozen pigs from the nearest Indians house, who have lived on the Departments Cat stacks they have been here all time, I have chased & chased, and fixed gates and fixed gates, I have spoken to the Indian when he has been at home, which is not often, and I have shown the damage to the Indian Agent, I have repaired the gate the Indian gent made me at\nthe time the cattle got into the stacks several times, & it has been impossible to keep them out. Altogether I consider the cattle destroyed one stack, and the pigs another.\n\nNow, on the 6th inst., I had to go to Prince Albert and while there called on Mr Chisholm to see what could be done in the matter of fencing the whole of the buildings with proper fencing this spring and this matter of the pigs in the stacks came up. He showed me a way which I might fix to keep them out for the present. On my return I found my wife had been chasing these pigs again, and on Saturday I worked all day at the job. It was a bitter cold day somewhere round about 30 below with a keen wind, and I caught cold. I am certain of this, I felt at the time I would feel the effects of that days work. I was not, either successful, in keeping the pigs out, and on Sunday I asked the Carpenter to come a fix a proper gate which he did at a cost of $2.50. This could have been done last fall, and the oats as well as a lot of work to myself saved.\n\nUnder these circumstances I feel I am justified in asking the Department to pay the expense of having a man also for the one who went for Dr Giles. The Doctor will, I expect send me an account of $15.00 or $20.00 at least which I suppose I will have to stand although I feel this also is something that the Department have let me in for.\n\nI must also say that if the Department expect one man to do all the work here it is absolutely necessary to have everything arranged as conveniently as possible. If the Department cannot fence the buildings with proper suitable fencing to keep out the animals this spring, then I must decline to be responsible for the stacks.\n\nI cannot refrain from remarking that it seems to be most foolish to grow anything here under the present circumstances. Last year I called attention to this matter of fencing both to Mr Chisholm.\nand Mr Schmidt. The Department went to a large expense putting in and harvesting the oat crop, and also a big expense was incurred in growing potatoes for the school. The cattle of the reserve are allowed all over the field, and the stacks built in a place where the cattle can feed at. The potatoes are planted where the cattle and pigs can tramp them and eat off the young plants, and in consequence the Department have to buy potatoes now, and will shortly have to buy oats.\n\nI trust you will be able to grant authority for the expenditure incurred during the past ten days, and I do hope that the Department will see that it would save a great deal of work and worry, and be more satisfactory in every way to have proper fences made.\n\nYours truly,\n\nD.C. Scott, Esq.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\nPlease file\n\nfreedom to me\n\nL.V.T.\n\nOttawa,\n\n191\nOttawa, February 26th., 1914.\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th. instant, asking that the Department defray the expenses of a man to attend to various work around the school during your illness. In reply I am directed to state that it is regretted that the Department is unable to meet your wishes in this respect.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAest. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nP. H. Gentleman, Esq.,\nJohn Smith's Reserve,\nPuskwah P. O.,\nSask.\nJohn Smith's Reserve, Puckahn,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nMarch 7, 1914\n\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your favour of the 28th ultimo No 117384-1 with reference to the employment of a man here during my recent illness. In reply, I cannot refrain from stating that your letter more than astonishes me, more especially as I understood from the Agent that he had authority to employ a man here whenever it was necessary.\n\nIt would appear from your letter that I am desirous of getting the Department to pay for a man who has been doing some work for myself personally, such as keeping my own furnace fired, and it may have been considered that if the school was closed there would have been no need of a labourer. If this is the case I beg to point out that the Departments conclusions are wrong, and to say that the man was employed feeding the Departments horse, watering, twice a day, cleaning the stable & drawing out to the field, and the same respecting my own cow. I own the cow I must say, but the Department own a \"Farmers' cow here which with the Agents permission has been loaned to one of the best Indians, as I do not need two.\n\nI also wish to say, that I was taken ill on Monday Feb. 9th, but thinking that same would only be a passing cold which would only last a couple of days, I did not employ a man until Thursday the 13th. I fed, watered & cleaned the stable myself on the Tuesday morning while feeling very sick. On the Wednesday my wife, & the girl employed to help with the childrens meal attended to the stack as I could not get up. On the Thursday I sent the girl out to find\nman as my wife had been up all night, and I might add from that day till the following Sunday she did not sleep at all, and could hardly leave my room.\n\nAs the Department is aware, or should be aware, I have the horse here in connection with the Farmers work, & I would like to ask, under such circumstances as these, who was expected to look after the animal. Do you think that my wife should have done the chores morning and evening, and nurse myself at the same time because if this is so I beg to state that under no circumstances will I have my wife feeding animals & cleaning stables. Would it have been satisfactory if no attention had been paid to the stable at all. What attitude would the Department have taken if the animals had been left tied in the stable for ten days? also if the matter of obtaining authority from the Agent before hand is held to, I must point out that from Tuesday until the following Saturday there is no way of communicating with Duck Lake, and then the reply would take four days to come back. What would the Department have me do in the meantime?\n\nI also wish to again draw attention to the fact that my illness was caused by attending to the Departments work & not my own. I have several times commented on the fact that the present arrangements respecting the fencing here is most unsatisfactory, I have shown Mr Chisholm how the Indians cattle get into the stacks, & Mr Schmidt has seen a dozen pigs feeding on the Departments oats. All the winter I have had all my spare time occupied in trying to save the feed provided, last summer it was impossible to have a garden. Both the Agent and Inspector have been here and seen how difficult the arrangements are for a man alone, & surely I have written the Head Office enough on the subject.\n\nI may also point out that the Department have never spent a cent in making proper outdoor arrangements for one\nJohn Smith's Reserve, Puckahn,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nman to do the work of the farmer, and the school at the same time.\n\nMr Agent Macarthur just before he left, had the stable moved over here from the Farmhouse for which the Department paid for, but this is all. The fencing and stackyard & garden have only been of a makeshift nature made by Mr Macdougalls boys, as both the Agent & Inspector can see. I also wish to say that one of the difficulties that arose between the Agent & Mr Macdougall was the fact that the latter employed an Indian on every possible occasion with, or without authority, when rough work had to be done, and to point out that I have not yet employed a man without permission, doing a great deal of the labour myself. I have daily drawn the manure from the stable into the field, while last year it was piled outside, and a man & team employed a couple of days in the spring to take it away. I have broken up bacon boxes to fix the stable walls, while in the past a man has been employed plastering. I have fixed fences & gates till I am tired, and in every way, when I have been able to make a repair myself, I have done so.\n\nI must also add that the man employed recently was not kept one day longer than necessary. I was able to get up on Thursday the 19th, and was out on Sunday the 22nd, and I require the matter to have further consideration, also while I am able to teach and get around I do not yet feel fully recovered, and in event of my falling sick again I would be glad if the Department would inform me, by returning mail, how to proceed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nN.B. The Department may like to know that on Wednesday, the 11th of February, my wife wrote a note to Mr Chisholm and sent it to Prince Albert with an Indian, stating that I had had to close the school. I have seen received a reply from the Inspector who says he told the man to call again at his office for a reply, but the man left town without doing so.\n\nAlso on Saturday the 14th I was able to write a line to the Agent saying that school was closed, and a man was looking after things outside. I have had no communication from the Agent on the subject whatever.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to request that the undermentioned returns, said to have been forwarded to the Department by Mr. P.H. Gentleman of John Smith's Reserve, be returned to me to be recorded at this office, viz:\n\n- School reports for quarters ended September, 30th. and Dec. 31st; Overseers' Diary, and Field Matrons' Reports.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa March 16th, 1914\n\nSir,\n\nIn future, kindly forward all your reports and the field matron's report through the agent's office as the agent has to keep the duplicate copies on record in his office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

He is continually grumbling at the Department, the Inspector and, I dare say, at myself; and is certainly unreserved and sarcastic in his language and remarks.\n\nThe man is lazy and simply will not work, and until such time as he takes a tumble and realizes that he is on an Indian reserve in Western Canada and not in a confectionery store in England will he be able to succeed as an overseer or advisor to Indians.\n\nIf an energetic, practical good willing man were in charge there he could teach school and have an oversight of the reserve without being overworked, and thereby earn the liberal salary paid by the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n[Date]\n\nIndian Affairs.

S. G. I. A.\nOttawa, 1st May, 1914.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to that portion of your report of the 18th April which refers to Mr. P.H. Gentleman, Indian School teacher, who also acts as over seer at John Smith's Reserve, I beg to say that if there is not a decided improvement in his work on the said Reserve, the Department will take into consideration the question of placing someone else in charge of both the school and over-seer work, and you should advise him to this effect, without delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nG.P. Schmidt Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nDear Sir,\n\nOn January 20th last you forwarded me a communication numbered 117084 with reference to the old Farm house close by, the result of which I was able to hire an old Indian to help me during the winter months. I regret to say that this man recently left me claiming that the farm house was impossible to keep warm during the cold weather, which is probably correct.\n\nWith the short days I find that it is necessary to have someone, and I beg to submit a brief account of an arrangement made to overcome this difficulty which I hope the Department will approve of, also if possible allow something towards the expense.\n\nI have hired a young Indian, one of the hunters, about 22 years of age who would have hunted this winter if the fur market had been satisfactory for the sum of $16.00 per month, half my rations, one room with a big stove in the farmhouse & dinners five days a week, for which, I am having the stable attended too night & morning, wood drawn up & placed in position for four stoves, schoolroom swept, fire lighted, furnaces cleaned & kept full with water, and various other jobs of such a nature, which I count as being my own chores, that task would occupy me upward of a couple of hours night & morning.\n\nIn addition to these things I am also having the man convey the children to and from school, the expense of which is included in the above mentioned sum. I will undertake for the time being.\n\nI would like to point out however that my chores alone are hardly enough to warrant me keeping a man on my own account the whole day, while on the other hand if the man drives the children morning & evening, the middle part of the day would be well occupied. At present...\nJohn Smith's Reserve, Puckahn, Saskatchewan.\n\npresent his day is occupied in the following manner.\n\nHe feeds and waters the horse & my cow at 8 o'clock, lights the schoolhouse fire & sweeps, then goes for the children about 20 minutes past eight, arriving with the first lot about ten past nine, then he goes to the north end of the reserve getting back about a quarter to ten. He then splits wood, and draws same up to my own house & schoolhouse, cleans the stable which occupies him till noon.\n\nThis afternoon he put part of a hay stack that had tumbled over into the loft, and one afternoon a week I can send him for the mail which will receive me of two hours, & have also a quantity of beef to cut up & I can keep him well occupied during the next month from 1st till 3rd at which time he takes the first lot of children home.\n\nHe finishes his day about 5.30, and I would like the Department to consider the matter of the expense. I think the man's time could be fairly divided evenly between driving the children to school and chores, and I am anxious to pay my share, half, if the Department will pay the other half, or the sum of $32.00 for drawing the children to school from the present date till March 18th of next year.\n\nSuch an arrangement, is in every way most satisfactory. I am able to give better attention to the school, and the other business of the reserve. The school attendance will be more satisfactory, and there will be times that instead of hiring outside labour I can use this man without additional expense. The horse will have to be kept here in any case, and he may as well do this as not, also it is in a manner providing for one of the Indians who would have a hard living during the winter. If I am not clearly understood I would be glad to send more details if necessary. I trust you will be able to give the matter favourable consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nP.H. Gentleman Esq.,\nTeacher,\nJohn Smith's Indian School,\nPuckham, Sask.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to my letter of the 19th ultimo, regarding the school children I regret to find that I omitted to draw attention to the very satisfactory attendance that has been made during the year, more particularly by three of them, which I would like the Department to take some note of.\n\nLawrence Bear and Gladys Bear have not been absent for any cause whatever since the first of January. These children are two miles and a half away.\n\nAlbert Badger has only missed eight days during the year, and several others have been less than 14 days away. The ages of the above mentioned are 10, 12 & 14.\n\nI will reward the two who have not missed at Christmas time, but perhaps the Department could send me a communication of approval which I could read to the children & their parents at the Christmas concert, as I find a little encouragement from those in authority very satisfactory.\n\nThe Bishop of Saskatchewan recently visited the school and by chance picked out a boy who has not attended regular. The Bishop gave the boy a message for his Father, in Cree, & I have since heard that the boy will not be out of school again until he can read, and the boy has not been absent since.\n\nI would add that during the past two weeks I have had every child of school age in school, the youngest attending while being driven, & I also find, by having a man for my chores, I can do better work in school as well as having more time to get out among the Indians.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6286, file 610-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, December 16, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant calling attention to the very satisfactory attendance of some of the pupils at the John Smith's School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is pleased to note that two of your pupils, Florence and Gladys Bear, have not missed a day during the year and that several of the other pupils have been most regular in their attendance. I should be glad if you would tell these pupils that the Department appreciates the interest they take in their school work and, as a slight reward for their exemplary conduct, you are hereby authorized to expend the sum of $10.00 in the purchase of suitable prizes for these children, which should be given them at the Christmas entertainment you propose holding. You should see that the most deserving pupils receive the best prizes. The accounts for this expenditure should be forwarded to the Department through the office of the Indian Agent, who has been asked to certify them. I may add for your information that the prizes given at this time of the year will take the place of the summer rewards.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. H. Gentleman, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nJohn Smith's Day School,\nPuckash, Sask.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, December 16, 1924.\n\nSir,\n\nAs an appreciation of the regular attendance of some of the pupils of the John Smith's School the Department has decided to make a grant for prizes now instead of before the summer holidays and Mr. Gentleman, the teacher, has been authorized to expend the sum of $10.00 for this purpose. You will be good enough to certify accounts to that amount when presented to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Molchan\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. P. Schmidt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have to submit herewith a report on the work of the children attending the Day School here, also the reserve in general, during the past year.\n\nWith a smaller number of children of schoolage I find that the average attendance has been well maintained during the year, in fact it is slightly higher than last year, and seeing that all the children are small, I think this can be considered satisfactory.\n\nI consider the younger children have made the most marked progress during the year. They are able to read from the Primer also write, and do addition. I find that I have put in considerable time on this younger class, using a supply of Kindergarten materials but, in comparison with the elder children, I think their advancement will be more rapid in the future especially in Arithmetic and Reading.\n\nI find now that I have still a younger class, some eight little boys between the age of six and eight, whom it is difficult to keep busy, but I hope to do something with these during the coming year.\n\nRespecting the older children, these have been by no means neglected. Advancement has been made by the boys in Arithmetic & Reading, they write well, and have regular lessons in Geography Composition, & Canadian History, as also do the girls. One of the boys Leonard Bear is considerably in advance of the others, and there would be no difficulty for this boy to pass the Matriculation if I could give him the time. Unfortunately with such a number of small children, it is almost impossible to give ones time to one pupil to any great extent. The Department could make a splendid man\nout of this little fellow if he could be sent away from his home,\nwhich I regret to say cannot be considered satisfactory.\n\nA sample of the children's work is being forwarded, in which\nLeonard Bears' work will be noted. The samples are part of an\nexhibit shown during the summer in the school.\n\nOn November 4th Mr. Thibodeau and Mr. Schmidt inspected the\nschool, but as they were only in the room from 3:10 till 3:50 in\nthe afternoon, an extensive inspection was not made. These\ngentlemen caused me considerable annoyance at the time. They\narrived on a mail day, when I have a standing arrangement with\nthe clergyman to give a Scripture lesson during the last 30 minutes\nand although I explained this the evening before, this was\nupset, and in the end, the children had to be dismissed as it was\ntoo dark to see. However, both seemed satisfied with what was being\ndone.\n\nBefore dealing with my Overseers report, and the Matrons'\nreport, I must preface these with a note on the Whiskey Traffic,\nas the whole of the work, also ex-pupils is affected by the above.\n\nI cannot express myself strongly enough, over the seemingly\nindifference on the part of the Department to this business, &\nthe only excuse I can find must be in the fact that the harm\nand expense caused by this cannot be fully grasped, except by\nthe man in direct contact with the Indians. I know the matter is\na difficult one, but that should not allow these people to go on\nyear after year, pulling down everything done for them by the\nDepartment and Church in other directions, as the whiskey does.\n\nThe land is excellent, their health good, and this reserve\nwould be entirely self-supporting in a few years if the whiskey\nbusiness in the City of Prince Albert could be controlled as\nregards Indians, which it is not. During the year I have had\nbrought before me different cases, in detail, which for various\nreasons I have been directed to drop. The Hotels, Wholesale stores,\nThe Hudson Bay Co all sell, almost openly according to the Indians.\nI have reason to believe, speak truthfully. Recently the north part of Saskatchewan was placed under prohibition, the line being drawn three miles north of Prince Albert. One of my older Indians stated recently that considering that Prince Albert is a noted gathering place for Indians, it was a pity that the City was not included in the prohibition district.\n\nRespecting the farming operations of the people during the year, I must state that the crop was not so good as last year, a bad hail storm in July flattened the grain over one half of the reserve, and the whole potato crop was badly frozen. I have been able several times to visit the fields, and as stated, if the money did not go in drinking these people would have all the machinery they needed. Hay has been plentiful and commands a good price, while the cattle sold during the first week of the war brought them record prices. This annual cattle sale is not considered by some very satisfactory.\n\nTwo days before the cattle sale Mr N. Russell, a cattle buyer of Prince Albert, visited some of the houses telling the people that he had received permission from the Agent to buy all he could, as no other buyers would be coming, and in consequence of this several of them sold to Mr Russell, which resulted in a great deal of confusion and trouble. One of the results being a dispute between one of the Indians regarding the ownership of an animal, which is being looked into at the present time. Mr Schmidt maintains that no permission was given to Mr Russell, who on the other hand maintains that he was in the right. However, the whole affair was most unsatisfactory, & it is to be hoped, will not occur again.\n\nThe breakdown of the threshing outfit was caused by some of the Indians refusing to pay the men who can run the outfit, and getting all the young men of the reserve around the engine with wrenches trying to make it go. As I have no authority to prevent this, or settle the dispute that had arisen over wages, the outfit had to be laid up until the Agent could visit the reserve.\nDuring the latter part of the year, an offer of seed grain for the coming season was made, but owing to a misunderstanding the Indians did not hear of same until after freeze up. I hope some seed grain can be issued. (On the other hand there is money for Whiskey to-morrow but seed grain will be wanted).\n\nIn common with other reserves the fur market is low, but I do not see any suffering on account of this.\n\nIn connection with the Farm work I must call attention to a unsatisfactory state of affairs that occurs with the ex-pupils between the ages of 16 and 22. We have several young men of this age well able to read & write etc., anxious to make a start, but who seem to have no location. I have heard of cases when some of these young fellows wanted to plow the dispute of land has arisen so strong that they have given up the idea. A large amount of land is being held idle in this way, by the older men, and something should be done to decide on locations for these young men. At present I cannot urge them to do much, as they say at once that don't know where they can make a start. They work out, or drop into idle ways, & start drinking, and on this account a good deal of money spent on education is wasted. Some kind of control over these ex-pupils for five years after they leave school is very desirable.\n\nIn dealing with the Patrons work, regarding which a complaint was received last week I must point out that the monthly reports submitted have been the same as those sent in by Mrs Macdougall, and also by ourselves while at La Corne in 1912. Reports of this nature also passed through my hands while at Duck Lake, and it is somewhat out of the way to request detailed information on this subject monthly before the actual requirements of the Department have been made known. The Circular for our guidance shows a lack of experience on the part of the writer, and it must be remembered I cannot compel the Indians to do everything the Department desires, also many of the instructions contained therein are not carried out.\nin many homes of the surrounding settlers whom the Indians meet\nand it cannot be expected that the Indians will go more along these\nlines than their neighbours. I would refer for instance to\nthe use of the river water for drinking. Halfbreed & white settlers\nup and down the river have always used river water without boiling\noften drawing same from the same place at which the cattle drink, and\nit would be exceeding difficult to get them to do otherwise. The\nrule respecting the placing a clean sheet on the floor for the baby\nto play on would not be done except I remained in the houses. They\nwould scrub their floors more often rather than do this. The matter\nof ventilation is always a difficult subject, not only with Indians\nbut with Canadians, during the winter. Double windows on without being\nmade to open as a general rule throughout Western Canada is also\nnoticed by the Indians, who, when building fix their windows solid.\n\nThere can be no ventilation through the schoolhouse windows\nfor instance, with the double windows on. To overcome this I have\nkept off the centre double window, so that it is possible to get\nfresh air.\n\nOn the other hand these people are much more advanced than\nother reserves. They are clean, and have proper outhouses, and most\nof them can get me a decent meal if I call, with a table cloth\nand clean knives etc. The work of the women on the farms is creditable;\nthey make good butter, etc., etc., and many of them can pluck and clean\na chicken much better than one sees displayed for sale in the Prince\nAlbert stores today. Poultry keeping is made to pay by several.\nThe manner in which the midday meal for the children is served is in itself a lesson for them, everything being kept clean and in proper order as it should be, while this house is always spotless, and an example which does not fail to impress them. The influence of the school also reflects in their homes, the difference being easily noted between those families whom have children attending, and those in which the children are too young. I find that all the children change their clothes after school, and they are always clean and tidy.\n\nRegarding the note requiring instruction to be given in cooking and sewing I must say it would be almost impossible for my wife to undertake the former during the morning, but frequent instruction is given when visiting the sick, along these lines. With regard to the sewing it will be interesting to note that on Wednesday afternoons since August a number of the women have met in the dinning room sewing or rather knitting socks for the Red Cross Society, several of them providing their own materials. Previous to this they met under my wife's guidance for the purpose of making children's clothes which they sold among themselves for the Church funds. The women's weekly sewing meetings has been a long established thing, and a small control over the young women & girls who have left school is thus retained.\n\nThere seems to have been a misunderstanding with the agent over the supply of drugs, but I would point out that the accounts submitted are much smaller than in former years. There is however a case of expenditure which I would like to draw attention to, in\nwhich I can show might have been saved, had I been consulted.\n\nMina Smith, a schoolgirl between fifteen & sixteen years of age in October of 1913 had an accident which resulted in her being in the hospital all last winter. The result of being in company with an elder sister mixed up in a drunken brawl north of the river at Prince Albert this spring she had to go again to the hospital and have a leg taken off. The Department then provided her with a cork leg, which she did not want, and does not use. The Agent tells me he knows nothing of this case, and I have no correspondence upon the subject beyond reporting the accident in the first place to Duck Lake. Whoever authorised this expenditure did not give the matter much thought, which seems strange to us, when such a fuss is made over the smallest unauthorised accounts.\n\nIn the future, however the Matrons report will be more detailed.\n\nI find that I have gone to considerable expense during the year in connection with different things that should not have been a call on my pocket. School materials, kindergarten, reading books & music have cost upward of ten Dollars; the clay from the cellar of this house was still in the yard making the place a regular mudhole between the house and stable, I have had removed at a cost of eight dollars, hay & oats provided in small amounts, & different small payments made to Indians which I have had to make being without authority at the time. These however with the exception of the school material, have enabled me to considerably improve the appearance.\nI must add, however, these small items are not so extensive as to request repayment, but some might have been carried out by the Agent had they been noticed.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa,\nTROPHY SHIELDS\n\nTRADE\nSTERLING 925 SILVER\nMARK\n\nIllustrations Half Actual Size\n\nNo. 1335 1 SHIELD\n\nAntique Brass or Bronze ............ each $5.00\nSterling Silver ...................... each 10.50\nGrey Silver Plated .................. each 6.00\nAdditional Small Shields, extra Silver Plate, each .75\nAdditional Small Shields, Sterling .......... each 1.50\n\nIn place of Plain Shield at bottom we can supply\nEmblems as any of our No. 1274-2 at 1800\nline of Metals on Page 124.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I promised the small shields, that have been given, last Christmas, and I think that a large shield which they can hang on the walls will still further improve the attendance during the coming year.\n\nAt the Christmas Tree Concert held on the 23rd, the children collected from their parents the sum of $7.35, which they desire to give you with a request that same should be sent to the Red Cross Societies Fund for wounded Canadian Soldiers, etc., etc., and postal notes for this amount is enclosed herewith.\n\nI trust both these matters will be satisfactory,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6286, file 610-1, part 1)\nI have the honour to inform you that Mr. P.H. Gentleman, teacher at John Smith's reserve is again asking for a man to assist him during the coming winter, on arrangements similar to those of the winter 1914-15.\n\nThe man does Mr. Gentleman's chores, which consist of attending to one horse and cow, splitting and carrying in wood which is already cut in stove lengths, and drives the children living along the River road to and from the school with the Department horse and rig.\n\nI do not recommend this expenditure, as I do not consider it necessary.\n\nRegarding the conveying of the children, I do not see that the average attendance is any larger when driven. The children who are driven are well able to walk as the road along the river is always good, and the farthest away are only about one and a half miles, with houses every quarter mile along the road where they can warm, if cold.\n\nThe Department horse, which is on the reserve for the use of the Overseer, is an old one, and will not stand the driving all winter; he is very quiet and suitable for Mr. Gentleman, who does very little driving other than going for the mail four miles away, and making a few calls with Mrs. Gentleman when she goes out as Field Matron.\n\nIf the children have to be driven with the Department horse and\u2014\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nhorse and rig a new outfit will have to be provided.\n\nWhen visiting the reserve during the fall of 1913 with Inspector Chisholm, this matter was discussed thoroughly by the Inspector, Mr. Gentleman and myself, and reported upon by me on Nov. 5th, 1913, file No. 115, which brought me in reply letter No. 117084/1 dated Nov. 17th of the same year.\n\nLast fall when visiting the reserve with the Inspector the question again came up, Mr. Gentleman asking for a man to do his chores, go for the mail and drive the children with the Department outfit. This was not approved of by the Inspector nor myself as we did not see the necessity for conveying the children any more than winter than the previous winters, and the engaging of a labourer to do Mr. Gentleman's chores was not considered at all necessary.\n\nMr. Gentleman, according to his own statement to me, then took the matter up with the Bishop of Saskatchewan, telling his Lordship that he must get him a man or get someone else on the job; the result being, he claims, Department letter No. 117084-1, dated Nov. 30th, 1914, informing me that $32.00 would be paid to an Indian for driving the children to and from school until the 18th of March, 1915.\n\nIn my opinion, and I feel certain that I am right, it is not the conveying of the children that interests Mr. Gentleman, but the doing of his chores; and when it comes to that point I cannot recommend the engaging of a man to do same.\n\nI am informing Mr. Gentleman that I am not recommending the employment of a man to help him, and would ask the Department to consider the whole matter should he correspond direct to headquarters.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nExtract from Agent's Report on the John Smith Day School for the month of November, 1915. Original on file 117084-7\n\nNon-treaty pupils, two boys one girl. One of these boys Julius Crain and one girl Bloomfield are living with relatives on the reserve and attend school. The other boy, C. Price, lives with his grandfather or Uncle near the reserve. The John Smith Day School is the nearest school for him to attend. There is a public school in that district but it is rather far away for him as his grandfathers house is on the north east corner of the school district.\n\nShould these children be allowed to attend our school? If not, they will probably never see the inside of a school again. The teacher does not complain of these children attending but finds his work heavy. With these pupils attending he has found his average as high as 30 for one week. Of these 30, twelve are very young beginners who will not attend regularly this winter. Next spring they will be able to do so but on the other hand I expect 7 of the older pupils will stop going to school as they will be 16 years or over. I would like to know the Department's regulations in regard to these non-treaty children. If granted the privilege of attending our day schools, it will also mean allowing them to live and grow up on the reserve where they will expect to make a home in future. It may also cause numbers of others to do so at the Butler, Coxby and Glen Mary settlements, situated between John and James Smith Reserves, and mostly settled by half-breeds who are relatives of the Indians on the said reserves. If it is going to make a precedent, which will be followed immediately on the James Smith reserve, I would not recommend that they be allowed to attend.\n\nSgd. C. Paul Schmidt,\nIndian Agent,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6286, file 610-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of Nov. 4th., and other envelopes enclosing receipts, accounts, and reports.\n\nAs regards the employing of a man to help you during the winter, I am not recommending same, as to equip a proper outfit to convey the children will necessitate some considerable expense, and I think it is up to the Indians to see that their children attend school.\n\nInspector Chishelm and I were to have started on Monday last, 8th, on his inspection tour, but that morning he phoned me saying he could not get away for a week and perhaps longer.\n\nI have not yet received Adam Charlie's cheque for $5.00, which I left with you to be endorsed by him, and returned here to be applied on his account; kindly forward same by return mail.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.H. Gentleman, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nJohn Smith's reserve,\nPuckahn, Sask.\nDear Sir,\n\nI very much regret to find that I must ask the Department to give me some consideration with regards the question of having a man to help me during the winter months.\n\nI assure you that if I could possibly manage without one, or even undertake to pay a man out of my salary, I would do so, as I have no desire to make expense, but I think if the Department knew the many things one has to do between daylight & dark in the short days, there would be no objection to an allowance of a small amount.\n\nMight I be allowed to submit the following for consideration, but beforehand I may add that if an allowance for this purpose has not been estimated for, etc., etc., I will try to do the best I can during the winter. The Department seem to manage as much as they are able, & with these very expensive times, one must be prepared to work harder.\n\nFrom the attached letter from Duck Lake, you will notice that I have already had some correspondence upon the subject with the Agent, who has not seen fit to recommend same. Early in October I asked the Agent to take up this matter with you, and gave him the details of the children attending school etc., and I was under the impression that he intended to do so. My reason for dealing\nwith the subject of having the children conveyed to school and a man to help me under the same heading is that by having the one man for both purposes seems to be the most satisfactory, and certainly cheaper. The Department will remember that last year a man was employed for this, and that he was paid $16.00 a month, of which I paid half, and greater part of my own rations. I hoped that this arrangement might have been made this winter, although I must say that it would have been somewhat of a difficulty for me to pay half, and I trusted a good deal upon an increased attendance of young children hoping on account of this that you could undertake the whole amount. On the 16th of November the Agent was here, and on that day he told me that you had not replied to his request for a man, in spite of his letter being written on the 11th, which I did not receive until the 20th. I had in mind some previous instructions from the Department to the effect that I should take up these matters with the Agent, which I did, allowing plenty of time for consideration, but which you will see has resulted in considerable delay, making things very difficult for me just at the time a man is needed.\n\nIn October I was able to point out to the Agent that there are five or six young children who have been coming to school during the summer, one or two of which attended a few days last winter, while driven, but which could not be expected to attend during this winter if they had to walk in the deep snow.\nI find that the total attendance during November has been 462 compared with 555 during October. It may be partly accounted for by a form of Chicken-pox which Dr Giles tells me some of the children have (he has ordered them kept at home on account of this) but on looking over the register I notice that nearly all the young children are away, and I account for this owing to a big fall of snow we had in the middle of the month, since which the younger children have not attended. The statement of the Agent to the effect that it is up to the Indians to see that their children attend school can hardly be said to apply to the little ones, also they do see that the elder ones attend, and they want to send the little ones, but they say they are so long on the road, under the present arrangement, and some of them have already asked me to take up this matter with you, one man going as far as to say that he would have no difficulty in getting a partition signed by the parents for the Department's consideration on this subject.\n\nIt seems to me, that while the Indians are anxious to send the younger children, it is a pity not to do something for them. They state that years ago when other children were not so young they were driven, also they appear to think that it is done in the Carlton Agency. Of course I do not know if they are right or wrong in this respect. I notice however that the driving of the children has a very good effect on the reserve in general, in other ways than one might expect. I fancy that when they know there will\nrig along the road at a certain time everyone is up earlier. These people would not care for their neighbours to say that such and such a child could not go to school because they got up too late, and thus in a way, the matter may have other points of advantage which we have not considered.\n\nAs regards the outfit for this work, as the Agent says it may necessitate some expense. It is too much for the single horse I have now; there are too many children, but it could be managed if desired. I have in mind that throughout the Agency some of the Farm Instructors have two teams, if not more. Mr McCloy recently at La Corne, told me a short while ago that when he left there, there were six or seven horses there, but in any case it cannot be possible that all these teams are working during the winter, and I don't think it would be a matter of great difficulty to transfer me a team, sleigh & double harness from another reserve, for the winter months. Oats would be an outlay, but these horses have to be fed in any case. The only employment the teams can be put to during the winter months by Instructors largely consists of hauling rations from town about once in two months, and I am sure one of them one of them would haul in enough to last over the winter, and release a team if required to do so beforehand.\n\nIn this manner I think the outfit could be found without purchasing anything, and by having a man employed the children can be convoyed, & I can have the remainder of his time during the day. He would be\nemployed cleaning stable, drawing in wood for two furnaces & two stoves, and taking away ashes. Cutting up winter beef for rations which I receive in quarters & have to cut into twenty pound joints. Drawing in water for house & school furnace, which with a pump that needs priming several times daily, is several minutes work. My oat bin is in the old schoolhouse, and once a week oats have to be carried to the stable. He could have placed the storm windows & doors on the house & schoolhouse, and in numerous other ways his time could be occupied. Wood will shortly have to be sawn & split and I really don't know who I can get to do it.\n\nAll this I have to do before and after school hours, & when you consider that it is not light before seven & is beginning to get dark soon after four, it can be seen that it is difficult to manage everything without working after dark. This is labourers work & with a large school, I think these things might be considered. During the summer months when the days are long, I do not mind, but at this time of the year when many extra things have to be done it is very hard.\n\nI would add that when the Agent has requested the regular estimates in the summer months I have included this allowance, but I do not know if same has been passed or not.\n\nI am sorry that this letter is so lengthy, but I have gone into details fully, as I think same would be required for consideration, which I trust it may receive,\n\nIndian Affairs.

Gentlemen, Esq.,\nJohn Smith's Reserve,\nPuckahn, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to our conversation regarding your request for the services of a man to assist you during the winter and drive the children to school. As requested I have gone into this matter and I do not feel justified in recommending to the Department that the children be driven to school. Apparently the Department had given the matter consideration prior to this date when they gave you their decision regarding this in their letter of December 14th, 1915, which you no doubt have on your file.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nInspector.\nSir,\n\nA request has been made to me by Mr. Gentlemen, teacher of John Smith's, for assistance during the winter months by way of hiring a man to assist him and also to drive the children to school. After visiting the Reserve and also going into this matter with the Agent I have written Mr. Gentlemen as per copy of letter enclosed herewith.\n\nI note that the Department has already given this party their decision in this matter in letter No. 117084-1 of December 14, 1915 and I now write you regarding this as this party is likely to take the matter up with you direct. He apparently in the past has been in the habit of communicating with the Department direct instead of referring matters of this nature to his Agent or Inspector.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 5, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo stating that a request has been made to you by Mr. Gentlemen, teacher of the John Smith's School, for assistance during the winter months by way of hiring a man to assist him and also to drive the children to school and enclosing a copy of a communication which you have written to Mr. Gentlemen informing him that you have gone into this matter and do not feel justified in recommending to the Department that the children be driven to school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the action taken by you in this matter is approved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. B. Crombie, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nDear Sir;\n\nI would be glad if you would ask the Department without delay, if they will allow the school to be closed for the first two weeks in January next; reopening of the 16th of that month and going on until July, 13th. This will give us two weeks of the summer holidays during the winter.\n\nI gather from the Indians that they would rather have a longer holiday for the children just after Christmas, and shorter in the summer, on account of the very cold weather that we usually have at that time. The little boys cannot, or do not come well in the cold weather, and with two months holiday in the summer they miss a good many days. The days also are short, and two weeks in January will give me some time to draw up the rest of the wood, and cut up the beef, and besides this there would be a small saving on wood.\n\nI also wish to be allowed to arrange the Easter holidays according to the weather. Easter comes just about the time the snow is going and I notice that school has to continue while the road is almost impossible to travel for about a week, for water. Several of the children miss these days, then perhaps during the Easter holiday the road will be dry. It would be better if their Easter holiday could be given them just while the snow is going. They get wet feet causing colds, etc., and I think we should arrange this better. Of course this Easter Holiday would depend upon the weather entirely, but the children would not miss so many days if I could be allowed to arrange it as desired.\n\nNeither of these requests would make any difference to the total number of school days in the year.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) P.H. Gentleman.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to attach hereto, copy of a letter received today from Mr. P.H. Gentleman, teacher on the John Smith's Reserve, and would ask the Department's decision in the matter.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 20, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant enclosing a copy of a communication from Mr. F. H. Gentleman, teacher of the John Smith's Day School, in regard to the holidays for his school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that when forwarding this communication you should have made a recommendation in regard to the matter. The Department will, however, approve of this school remaining closed for the Christmas holidays until the 15th of January, next, and going on until July 13th, in order to make up the two weeks.\n\nIn regard to the Easter holidays I beg to say that these may be taken when the snow is going and the roads are bad.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. F. Schmidt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nSir,\n\nRegarding the supplies purchased for the Day schools in this Agency, viz., those used for the preparation of the pupil's Mid-day meal, such as Sugar, Beans, Peas, Baking Powder, etc. I have the honour to ask for authority to be allowed to purchase these in future in 100 lb. lots, instead of a few pounds monthly, usually requisitioned for. A quantity sufficient to tide each school over four or six months could be purchased at a time, the supplies, when purchased, being held by the farmers in their ration house, and issued to the schools on their reserves when required. By following this course, the usual monthly requisition for such supplies, by the teachers would be dispensed with, and much more convenience experienced all round.\n\nThe three schools in this Agency use approximately the following amount of such supplies annually; - Sugar 500 lbs., Beans 300 lbs., Salt 150, and Baking Powder 50.\n\nAuthority to purchase these amounts, for the current fiscal year, is therefore asked.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I understand that parts of British Columbia have a much warmer climate, and as the Department would know when vacancies occur, you might see fit to recommend us to the Arodecon in charge, or perhaps inform us of same in order that we may get in touch with the Bishop direct.\n\nIf such a promotion could be made, we would be willing to pay the entire cost of the transfer.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nP.H. Gentleman, Esq.,\nJohn Smith's Reserve,\nPuckahn, Sask.\nRef. your letter No. 117084/1 of the 27th July, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the letter quoted above regarding a communication received from a number of Indians on John Smith's Reserve stating that they wish to have a change of teacher for their school and in reply beg to report as follows:\n\nAmongst some of the better educated Indians on this reserve there is a feeling that their children are not making the progress they consider they have a right to expect and from my report of inspection on this school just submitted I trust will enable you to judge for yourself in this regard.\n\nMy opinion, however, of the reasons for the request made by the Indians of this reserve is that there is more objection to Mr. Gentleman as Overseer of the Reserve than as a teacher. There appears to be several factions amongst the Indians of this reserve part of whom are loyal to the Overseer while those who consider they have a grievance against him have, no doubt, signed the petition mentioned.\n\nIn so far as Mr. Gentleman is concerned I believe he is a conscientious and trying to do what he considers is the proper thing for the Indians on this reserve. He is, however, most unfortunate in that he appears to have the faculty of \"getting in wrong.\" From correspondence on file at Duck Lake Agency office it is evident...\nthat Mr. Agent Schmidt has had considerable trouble with Mr. Gentleman over matters pertaining to the reserve. Mr. Gentleman is very positive in his views and at times makes unreasonable criticism of his Agent, the Agency and Department methods. I may say, however, that of late there does not appear to have been the same trouble in this respect. Taking everything into consideration I would consider that it would be in the interests of the Department if Mr. Gentleman could be transferred to some other school where he can devote his whole time to school work. I may say that Mrs. Gentleman appears to be rendering good service as matron on this reserve and her work appears to be appreciated by the members of the Band.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn making out my school report for the September quarter I have to report that two children have not attended since the holidays, and as their absence has arisen out of certain circumstances I wish the Department to have the full details of the matter, and also to ask that some instructions be given dealing with matters that have arisen regarding these absences.\n\nThe two children are Sophia Crain, 14\u00bd, daughter of Geo. Crain, and Kate Crain, 12\u00bd, daughter of James Crain.\n\nAs you know, some of the people recently asked for a change of teacher, a request that they also made of the Bishop of Saskatchewan, while I was away in B.C. On my return the Bishop and I went into the matter, and I found that the list of names sent to him was mainly not those of parents of children attending school.\n\nThe Bishop suggested that I see the parents, and that if they wished for a change, or if there was any decided opinion that a change was desired on the parents part, then some arrangements might be made, otherwise it would be better for us to remain.\n\nThis I did. I saw all the parents, and asked them to meet me in the schoolhouse, and I told them that if they wished for a change I had no particular desire to remain, as the children would make no progress whatever under such conditions. I found that the objections to my work came from James and George Crain. Three other parents who had signed the request to the Bishop said that they had done so, after being requested several times by James Crain. The majority of the parents objected to a change, and gave their opinions freely upon the matter, and it was clear that the difficulties had\nbeen brought about by James Crain. The same day, I received in the mail the Department's letter on the same subject addressed to the Chief, who was present that evening at my request, with the other councillor. I gave the Chief his letter, of course not knowing its contents, and on its being interpreted, there arose considerable discussion in Cree. To quieten matters down, I suggested that if the Chief would give me the letter I might be able to explain it, for which he thanked me, as he could not understand same himself.\n\nI saw at once that a request for a change had been made, but the discussion had arisen over the fact that the Chief, and James Crain, and apparently the north end of the reserve had written you without consulting the other Councillor, or the rest of the band. I then explained to them that, as the Chief, and some of them had made this request to the Department, that as stated, enquiries would now most certainly be made, and that probably the Agent, or Inspector or both, would shortly pay us a visit, at which time they would have an opportunity to go fully into the subject. Of course, this might have been a mistake on my part, but at the time, I could see no other way out of the difficulty, and I certainly expected this to happen. However, everyone was satisfied to let it remain at this.\n\nSomewhat to my surprise, no further notice has been taken, although the Department tell the Chief, that he would be informed later upon the subject. During the last week in August, I visited all the houses, and told the people to return the children to school on the third of September, which they have done with the two exceptions mentioned. After two weeks of school, I heard that James and Geo Crain had sent their children to one of the public schools in Prince Albert, and not know what attitude would be taken on the matter, or if the attendance of these children at school in Prince Albert was a fact or not, I reported the above details to Mr Crombie.\nwith a request that he should pay us a visit, or ask Mr Schmidt to do so in order that the people might, at least, have the satisfaction of knowing that the matter had, or would be enquired into. Mr Crombie writes me that he has already given his views upon the subject, but whatever these might be, it is hardly satisfactory to the parents, as from their point of view nothing has been done, either one way or the other.\n\nA few days after this Mr Schmidt arrived, and on going into these matters with him, I found that he had had no correspondence upon the matter and regarding the Crain children going to school in town, we decided that I should see the Crains and tell them that this could not be allowed, and that the children must return to school as soon as possible. The next day I saw the mother of Kate Crain, a halfbreed woman, who told me that her daughter Kate was attending one of the town schools, but she would not tell me which, and also refused to attempt to get the girl back from town.\n\nAs it is impossible to believe them, the following Saturday, I met Mr G.A. Brown, the Superintendent of the Prince Albert schools, who told me that he would enquire if Kate Crain was attending any of the town schools, and he now writes that he cannot trace her. I gathered from him that the town schools would not be anxious for her, but as she might be working in the town, it would be difficult to refuse her admission unless requested to do so by the Department.\n\nOn the other hand, James Crain has told everyone that his daughter is attending a town school, and he tells Gilbert Bear H.M. that he intends to keep her there. I reported my interview with Mr Brown to Mr Crombie, with a request that some steps be taken, but at the time of writing I have not had his reply.\n\nDuring the past two weeks James Crain has endeavored to have the parents of three other girls, aged between ten and twelve, send their children into town, and in this way seems to be anxious to create disfaction among the parents, but so far he has not met with\nsuccess. At the same time, such proceedings do not tend to help\nthe school in anyway. James Crain has also a boy of nine who attends,\nbut whom I think does so with the express intention of making as much\ntrouble as possible; and as all the people are aware of these circumstances, it causes an entirely unsatisfactory tone to our work.\n\nI hope you will see fit to back me up in some shape or form; either\ninsist that James Crain returns his children, or dismiss them entirely.\nI believe you are aware that this band have in the past given various\ntroubles and difficulties to whoever has been in charge. Former Agent\nMacArthur told me in 1913 that I would stay with them six months, and he\nknew them well, but with tact I have managed them since that time, and\nI trust the Crains can be informed that such things as these cannot be\nallowed. If no notice is taken, it reflects upon a whole host of\nother things, such as killing of cattle, and selling without a permit,\nthus making other rules and regulations most difficult to enforce.\n\nI might also take this opportunity to thank you for your letter\nNo 117084-1 dated August 18th, and while these people have little, if\nany cause to complain and most of them would be satisfied if a firm\nstand is taken upon the matter, my interest in the school is not what it\nwas, a change into a Boarding school when a vacancy occurs, is something\nto look forward to.\n\nYours very truly\n\nD.C.

To which the Department has replied that, if he is able and willing to send his daughter there, without any expense to the Department, no objection would be raised to his doing so, but it is to be distinctly understood that she is to attend there regularly, or she will come under the provisions of Section 1 of the Regulations relating to the Education of Indian Children and have to attend your school.\n\nGrain is also being informed in regard to the petition sent in by him and some other Indians for a change of teacher that the Department is not prepared to grant their request and that it disapproves of the constant bickering.\n\nWhile the Department recognizes that you and your wife are working in the interests of the Indians, it would be well if you would use a little more diplomacy in dealing with them.\n\nMr. Inspector Crombie and Mr. Agent Schmidt will also be written to.\n\nF.

H. Crombie, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nDear Sir,\n\nI find, with considerable regret, that you do not appear to have issued any instructions with respect to my letter of September 29th, in which I called attention to some school difficulties that have arisen recently.\n\nHowever I find, that my report of the 29th ultimo did not cover circumstances that was unknown to me on that date, and I wish to supply same without further delay.\n\nJames Crain sent his girl into Prince Albert after the summer holidays, and was said to be attending one of the town schools. I reported this fact to Mr G.A.Brown, also Mr Crombie, but both these gentlemen informed me that this was not so, also that no attempt had been made to enter an Indian girl. As Crain made known that his girl was in attendance at a town school, I visited the schools and found that he was correct; the girl being in attendance for the past six weeks, full particulars being found on the card index of the Central school, regarding name, age, home, and boarding place. The girl is working in town for her board.\n\nI placed this information before Mr Crombie, and this week week Mr Schmidt, has visited us, and will submit a full report upon the subject.\n\nI must say that I want the Department to back me up, and have this girl sent back. I do not object to the child attending a town school, and am willing to work through the whole eight grades of the provincial course with the girl, but I do strongly object to the manner that Crain has taken the matter in his own hands, for if he allowed to do so, others will want to follow his example, and I do not feel that it is correct that I should do the elementary work\nin this manner. Crain has another boy attending here, but just as soon as I have got him on a little, he is liable to take him away. Crain's girl has made a regular attendance during the past four years, and the man is in a position to keep her at home. At the Central school the Class teacher gave me a good account of the girls' work, which has given an opportunity of showing that she is not so backward as her parents wish to make out.\n\nI am sorry that this matter has not been settled before this. I do not like the influence she will bring back with her, but in order that the rest of the band may know that they cannot take matters entirely in their own hands, her return is necessary.\n\nGilbert Bear H.M. also Robert Bear H.M./ tell me that that it would be satisfactory if a firm hand is shown; the Chief is indifferent. Crain sent his two elder girls, here, some years ago, removed them to Battleford, removed them from Battleford in less than a year, and kept them at home, until I came here when they made an attendance for about a year, and the man is known as a kicker among the other people.\n\nI therefore wish to know what attitude the Department will take upon the matter, without delay. I might add that the Central School Prince Albert is well known to be overcrowded. I do not think the town schoolboard would approve, particularly if they knew that other parents might follow Crain's example.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary.\nOttawa, November 5, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo in regard to James Grain sending his daughter to school at Prince Albert.\n\nIn reply I beg to refer you to official letter of the 23rd ultimo, in which you were advised that Grain has been informed that, if he is able and willing to send his daughter to the public school in Prince Albert, without any expense to the Department, no objection would be raised to his doing so.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Gentleman, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nJohn Smith's Indian School,\nPuckahn, Sask.\nMEMO\n\nAs regards Mr. Gentleman being a good teacher, I am satisfied with his discipline and management of the School; but when it comes to making progress well in his studies or class work, I am doubtful if he really is qualified. But on this point I am unable to form an opinion.\n\nIn my opinion Mr. Gentleman's position as bursar has something to do with this trouble. As bursar he is of service to me, with the exception that he issues Rations and does what I can see he is not friendly with the Indians who hope to benefit from his influence. I believe a change on this score would be beneficial to all concerned.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nIndian Affairs.

She went to this Kate attended the Reserve Day School and was one of the brightest and most advanced pupils.\n\nThe girl is living with the family of Mr. J.E. Horne an employee of the Goodwill Co. Wholesale Grocer. I do not know the family but Ervine and his wife assure me that they are good people, have a comfortable house and that they take good care of the girl. In return for her board and lodging the girl helps in doing with the work of the house.\n\nMr. Smithman the leader on the reserve strongly objects to the girl leaving the school and going to town. He has written me regarding same, and has also written Ervine.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6286, file 610-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMEMO\n\nOn the 24th I went to visit the school and took the matter up with Mr. Gentleman asking him his reasons for objecting. There was no cause to send the child to town. I am afraid she will follow his example.\n\nShould Kate come back to my school, I fear she will bring back with her, I am not sure to do primary work for the town schools and I want the Department to know this. They want a decision on this matter quite soon & I wish to find out whether she will remain in town or not.\n\nIn any way, I am on the 25th. I called on Kate and asked him his reasons for sending his girl to town. His reply was that he felt it was not making satisfactory progress, and that the district thinks she would be much better off at Grade VIII under Mr. Gentleman in Prince Albert where close to the school.\nMEMO.\n\nAnd therefore her attendance will be more regular. Storms and bad weather will not prevent her from attending. Living with people who do not speak a word of Cree she will learn to speak good English, and I want my child to be educated therefore. Cannot put her where there is a qualified teacher, and where she can make progress. Craig also informed me that last summer land owner Indians had petitioned the Department asking for a change of teacher, and that a qualified teacher be placed on the reserve.\n\nCraig is a bright, intelligent man and he desires to see his children make progress so I am satisfied since he has always taken an interest in the School by visiting same, and has always sent his children regularly.\n\nI will not make any recommendation regarding the child attending school or not, or sending her back to the reserve. The Department no doubt have had similar cases before.\nMEMO:\n\nAs regards Mr. Eastman being a good teacher,\nI am satisfied with his discipline and manage-\nment of the school; but when it comes to\nmaking proper use of his teaching as I have\ndone, I am doubtful if he really does justifi-\nably so. On this point I am unable to form judgment.\n\nIn my opinion Mr. Eastman's position as\noverseer has something to do with the trouble\nhe overcomes less of success to me, with the\nexception that he seems rather anxious\nwhat I can do to assist him in his difficulties\nwith the Indians who seem to resent this interference\nof his.

(RG 10, Volume 6286, file 610-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Teacher,\n\nI am writing to you to tell you all about the circus. They had a circus in Prince Albert on the 5th of July and we all went too; we had a great time. We went in the big show. First we saw the play actors they were doing everything, and we saw big elephants; they were five of them. We saw them dancing on barrels and one elephant was lifting a man with his trunk. And I saw a Hippopotamus he was eating hay. He has a big mouth he was in a cage. I saw camels with two humps they didn't act we only saw them eating. And we saw lions they were jumping and climbing in the cage. I saw Seals or Sea Lions they were very clever first they played balls they...\nwere throwing the ball to each other with their noses, and then a man gave them sticks with fire at each side of it and they threw it round and round. One seal played God save the king on the beagle and one was beating the drum with both paws. We saw buff riders and little ponies. They were very small, one of the buff riders looked like Jackanapes his hair was flying. I saw red and white horses dance with ladies on their backs. And I saw a zebra and a bear and deer and two little monkeys and tigers. They all didn't act. We lost our dogs for a while out there but they got home in the morning. Scotty was lame and he had sore eyes perhaps he was so tired. I think I'll close I can't tell you all I've\nYours Faithful\n\nKate Cram\nDear Sir;\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 23rd ultimo, No 117084/1 regarding James Crains daughter, I must say that I did not know until last week that the Departments regulations allowed the attendance of Indian children at any school, otherwise I would have only reported this matter in the usual way.\n\nI am sorry that Crain has been replied to, as it is possible that his telegram may have given the impression that I have been attempting to use some force to have him return his girl here. All I have done, is simply to give Crains the Agents message in September i.e., \"that the Agent wished to have these children back at school.\" Crains answer was \"we will see about that\" given in a most insolent manner, and I have not spoken to the man on the subject since.\n\nI certainly reported this to the Agent, also informed Mr Crombie that the girl was in attendance at Prince Albert, but the delay on the subject has been caused by Mr G.A.Brown of the City schools saying that the girl was not in attendance, which was not correct. Crain entered his girl on the 3rd of September, and the Central school have all details card indexed from that date.\n\nThe main objection to the arrangement is that Crain is not likely to keep his girl in town for any length of time. I have noticed that most of the people will not leave home for more than a month, and I am informed that already the girl wished to return home. Crains are visiting the other people with the object of getting other children into town, but I am sure that this is only for company for his own girl, and it was to prevent this situation from arising that I asked Mr Crombie to come out, or to send Mr Schmidt to deal with\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6286, file 610-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nthe matter in September. I would also add that I had no idea that Crain was dissatisfied until last July. He took the opportunity of the annual gathering for treaty money to circulate his petition for a change of teacher, and at the same time assisted with the school sports which was held that day. About a year ago he told me that he objected to the use of the blackboard in school, and since then his brother George has objected to Nature Study. This man took his family to Cumberland House three months after I came here in 1913 and kept them there until eighteen months ago, without sending them to school, and they are in consequence behind the others. This man's action has given me a great deal of work, I have tried to get them up, but they are still a grade behind.\n\nJames Crain's girl has made as much progress as any in the school. She was one of the best pupils, and has read through four readers, and his man has no cause whatever to find complaint. She was one of the girls whom Bishop Gray of Edmonton considered the brightest pupil; the Bishop visiting us in January last; and the enclosed letter written by the girl to myself of her own accord after school closed for the holidays, seems satisfactory. She makes no less than seven references to lessons given in the geography and readers. In 1913 she was reading in the first reader and is the only pupil who has written me a letter from her home.\n\nI think in justice to myself these things should be brought to your attention. I have been careful with the people, but I do not like the manner in which Crain seems to have taken the matter entirely in his own hands. Nothing would have given me greater pleasure than to prepare his girl for a provincial High school had he made his desire known, either to the Agent or myself.\n\nYours truly\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This is over half a pound for each meal and it is considered that this is too much. You will be good enough to inform the teacher of this school that in future the children should not be allowed so much bacon for a meal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP. D. MOLAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. F. Schmidt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nDear Sir;\n\nFor upward of a year or so, I have been thinking of writing to ask the Department if any consideration could be given to an application for an advance in salary.\n\nMy salary is the same as we received in 1913, while our work in one way or another seems to have increased. In addition to this prices on almost everything have greatly advanced within the past six months. Looking over lists of school material recently I find that these also have gone up. I make use of many little helps in the school at my own expense; footballs, baseballs etc all of which have taken an advance.\n\nI also find that when I have occasion to employ an Indian that I have to pay them double that of two years ago. They are getting very high wages for outside farmers, which makes help both difficult and expensive to obtain. I have to get a man at times, more often during the winter months. In the past, I have often issued my own rations for help during the short days, but with the much higher price of flour and bacon, we are not able to afford to do this.\n\nI also have to send part of my salary to England & I am told things are very high at home. In nearby schools salaries have almost doubled in the past two years, and in some cases houses for teachers have been built. Trusting the application will receive consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Gentleman.\n\nMr. Gentleman is also teacher at the day school on the reserve. As overseer he is of very little assistance to me apart from the issuing of rations once a month to the destitute, seven in number and occasionally to some sick person. He is not handy with machinery and knows very little about cattle or horses. To the work of the Indians he gives very little attention, and none whatever to their cattle.\n\nBUILDINGS.- The teacher's residence, schoolhouse and other buildings are convenient, and are kept in good repair.\n\nYARDS and GARDEN,- The yards are kept clean and tidy, and the small garden in the school yard is growing nicely, and is kept clean.\n\nMACHINERY,- There being no home farm on this reserve, we have no machinery. The Indians purchase their own implements and care for same at their homes. The band threshing machine is kept at the Teacher's home. This is a 12 horse Gasoline Engine and an Eclipse Separator. The engine is kept in an open shed and the separator is left outside, there being no room for same.\n\nDEPARTMENT STOCK,- A driving horse for the use of the Overseer and two Hereford bulls are the only Department stock kept on this reserve; the bulls are wintered by the Indians. The overseer has a cow which is his personal property.\n\nPaul Schmidt, I.Agent.\nAugust 26, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 15th instant, asking for an increase of salary, I regret to have to inform you that under existing conditions the Department is unable to comply with your request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP. H. Gentleman, Esq.,\nOverseer in Charge,\nJohn Smith's Reserve,\nPuckalm, Sask.\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nAugust 29, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from Mr. P. H. Gentleman, teacher of the John Smith's Day School, in which he refers to the poor attendance of some of the pupils and suggests that, when you next visit the school, the parents of children not attending be called before you in a formal way.\n\nThe Department approves of this suggestion and when you next visit this reserve you will be good enough to inform the parents that they must send their children to school regularly and, if they fail to do this, you should see that the Regulations are put in force.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nG. P. Schmidt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nSir,\n\nJohn Smith's Reserve,\n\nI visited this reserve on Friday, 4th, October, I was no more fortunate herethan I was at Jas. Smith's Reserve. I found the school closed and the teacher away in Prince Albert. Mr. J.H. Gentleman is the teacher. He also acts in the capacity of Overseer of the reserve, which I think is a great mistake, as he is not qualified to fill such a position. If there ever was a reserve that required competent and constant oversight, it seems to me this is one. The Indians here are capable of doing good work, judging from the class of men I saw, but what they need is advice and someone to lead them and this they have not got. To me it looked as if the Indians were living under better conditions years ago, as I saw quite a number of commodious houses that were not kept up and what appeared to be good fields which were allowed to go back. There is no doubt in my mind that if we are to get results from the present day Indians, we must be prepared to furnish competent oversight, men who will lead them and take the same interest in them and their farms, that they would if they were managing their own personal property. I know it is hard to get the right kind of men for the inducements we have to offer. Foremen looking after one section farms situated in white communities, with all the advantages in the way of schools, etc., are getting from $1200.00 to $1500.00 per year, in addition to house, fuel, light, and other perquisites such as food, etc. This being the case you can readily understand that good men will isolate themselves and their families for the wages we are offering. It is true that the class of men we have on many of the Reserves, are not worth more than we are giving them, but it is just this class of man that is holding up the work. All success depends on their leadership.\n\nW. M. Graham,\nCommissioner.\nMEMO.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 29th August last No. 17084, instructing me at the suggestion of Mr. P. H. Scott, teacher in John Smith's school, to inform the parents of children who do not attend school regularly, that their children must cease and if they fail to do this, that I shall see that the Regulations are put in force. I have the honour to ask that a copy of Mr. Scott's communication be sent me for my personal use.\n\nNow that the Indians are returning from their harvest work, it is my intention of taking up matters up.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\n\n[Signature]\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\nOttawa, October 31, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 25th instant I beg to say that I am sending you herewith, as requested, a copy of the letter from Mr. Gentleman, teacher of the John Smith's school, of the 19th of August, last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAest. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. P. Schmidt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nExtract from Teacher's Report on the John Smith Indian Day School for the year ended December 31, 1918. Original on 160370-25F.\n\nSASKATCHEWAN\n\nREMARKS.\n\nATTENDANCE is not nearly as good as it used to be. Since the Dept. allowed one man to take his girl away the parents have the idea that they can do more or less as they please in the matter. When enquiry is made for absent children the stock answer seems to be that the child is sick or has to work. But sick children are taken to funerals and dances and there is no means of having attendance enforced. As they now kill and sell their cattle just as they like, as well as hay and grain, these things react on the school. The attendance could be improved by having Saskatchewan police visit all houses once a quarter, same as is done in white and halfbreed schools, on request of trustees and in this case Dept. stand as trustees. Apparently the Department wants me to be truant officer. Having called attention to attendance, would consider that it is up to someone higher than I to deal with Indians on the matter. As it is at present they merely think it is an idea of mine when I tell them they should attend better and it does not matter anyway.

I asked him by whom \"and he supposed \"the Crains.\" I wanted to find out if it had been the action of Mrs. Colin Bear (Sophia Crain) but I do not think he knew. He then told me that he wanted her back at school, but did not know how to act, as the girl had likely hired for a month at the hotel. So I told him that I would write you on the subject as soon as possible.\n\nIn the past I have often told this man that he should have his girl to live with him for short periods during the year, but she has always been at the Chas. Crains. I now understand that the girl was \"given\" to Sophia by her sister Mrs. Robbie Bear (nee Laura Crain) but her Father has never consented to this entirely, that is he has allowed the child to live at the Crains, but would have liked her at home, and I know he always supported the child with clothes. The man, as you know, is somewhat of a quiet disposition, and the Crain family seemed to have taken an advantage of this.\n\nI am of the opinion that James Crain is at the bottom of the whole matter, and perhaps the Department will see how that this man defies all order, event to the extent of taking no notice of the Father of this girl.\n\nI would like to see the Department look into the arrangement of Frances always living at the Chas Crain, and if necessary issue instructions that she should live at her Fathers six months of the year.\n\nAt present Robbie Bear is somewhat concerned over his girl, owing to Henry Bears girl Rose, who also worked at the Empress Hotel having married a man three times her age, after an acquaintance-ship of a very few days.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd. P.H. Gentlemen.\n\nC.P. Schmidt, Esq.,\nDuck Lake.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn making up the annual school report for 1918, that the Dept. ask for direct mail and mailed today, I find it is again necessary to call attention to indifferent attendance, and I would be glad if you would reopen at once the question of a truant officer.\n\nThis poor attendance continues, and I am convinced that there is a certain amount of \"don't have to\" idea among parents, and there is a lack of authority to show otherwise. I spent a recent Saturday looking for children, and met with various excuses, cold, lack of shoes, waiting on sick people, as in the case of Mrs. Albert Smith, whom the Doctor says there is nothing the matter with, but who has to keep a child home to wait upon her.\n\nIt is difficult to deal with these matters alone. Doubtless at times such reasons are good, but I am afraid, some of the parents make little effort to overcome them, and are satisfied to dig up some passable excuse, and just let it go at that, as they see that little can be done on our part.\n\nInstances of this nature have recently come to my notice. Most of the children have had bad coughs lately, the Alfred Smith's girl began coughing badly in school. We gave the child several doses of cough mixture and also a large bottle to take home. Absent the following day, but the next day I had to bury the child of Gilbert Crain, and Mrs. Alfred Smith took her girl along to the churchyard and spent most of the afternoon in and out of the church. Colds or coughs wont prevent parents taking children to funerals or dances, and it is just a loss of cough syrup. On the other hand, if they \"had to attend,\" they might make an effort to get them better.\n\nBlacksmith's wife called last week early in the morning saying both her boys were sick, one of school age. Provided with cough syrup and mustard, and pills that seemed necessary, and told to go home and put the children to bed. Appears to have spent most of the day visiting, and the boy of school age who certainly had a very bad cold, had to be sent to look for his mother by Blacksmith who was nursing the youngest child. Samuel, the child in this case who should be at school has got very little attention from his mother.\n\nGeorge Crains Alex, boy of 12 or 13; attendance very bad indeed. Father being sick, boy is made to work, not only doing their own chores, but draws hay from across the river for other people. No reason whatever why this boy should not do all the chores around their own home, and get to school by ten o'clock. Since Jan. 1st 6 days out of 40 in this case.\n\nFrances Jane Mary Bear, sent by her Aunt, or Chas. Crains people to work at Empress Hotel in Prince Albert. Girl of about 14, just in the middle of 6th reader, and taken away in the middle of the quarter, which I very much object to. I had told this people that Francis should finish the reader, and leave at the end of the quarter, and they seem to be willing enough to recognize this at the time, but without saying a word the child is sent to work, and there is no reason; they are not hard up, the girl is too young to work, and hotels are not suitable places.\n\nHenry Bears Terrance, boy of 13. In this case I surmise that Henry has to let the boy have his own way. Henry does not admit this, and speaks of having hay from across the river to draw, but Master Terrance is inclined to want his own way, and having found out that there is nothing to compel attendance, does as he likes.\nAll these cases might suddenly take a notice to attend again, and in any case, it makes broken classes, and repeated work in school, and repeated work is not fair to those who do attend.\n\nFrom these instances perhaps the Dept. can gather some of the difficulties that I have to contend with, and I maintain that it is difficult for myself to compel a satisfactory attendance without an independent authority coming from the Dept., as law. A member of the band as truant officer would not be satisfactory, and an arrangement should be arrived at with the Saskatchewan Police to handle the subject in the same manner as is done with white rural schools which our Indians are fully aware of. A standing request with the C.C Prince Albert for a constable to go through the Reserve twice a year to take the names of children not at school, visiting every house, is all that is necessary. Reports of non-attendance could be asked for, but I am convinced that a warning of this kind would have a very desirable effect; in fact I doubt if it would have to be repeated twice. If this could be arranged I feel sure that sick children would have a little more attention, and the \"don't have to idea\" towards leaving age, would not be so manifest.\n\nAt the present time I can do little myself to overcome this difficulty, as the parents take the stand that it is just an idea of mine, and as long as they can find a reasonable excuse, they make little effort. By showing them in this manner that a better attendance is required it would save me a great deal of unpleasant and unsatisfactory work, and be of vast benefit to the Dept. in the future.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd. P.H. Gentlemen.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to forward you, attached hereto, copies of two letters received from P.H. Gentlemen, Teacher of John Smith's Reserve Day School, regarding attendance of the children.\n\nRegarding the appointment of a truant officer I have Departmental letter No. 117,084-1 of July 29th, last which says: \"...That the Department considers that it would be well to appoint a truant officer\" and asking that I state the name of an Indian who would be suitable for the position etc. I took the matter up with Mr. Gentlemen last summer, but he would not hear of having a truant officer on the Reserve. As regards the appointing of one now I do not consider same is necessary.\n\nThe attendance was small during the March quarter it is true, but this was on account of the children being unwell, as is stated in Mr. Gentlemen's remarks on his Quarterly Return. A number of them were suffering from after effects of the Influenza.\n\nIf Mr. and Mrs. Gentlemen exerted themselves more, I am satisfied the attendance would improve.\n\nRe Frances Bear referred to in Mr. Gentlemen's letters, this girl was quite young when her mother died and she was given to, or taken by her grandparents to Charles Crain, where she has been living ever since; she was well cared for and has a good home. Her father Robbie Bear, No. 97, married a second time to Widow Ed. Smith but Frances was never taken back to her father's home, and he, Robert, has never mentioned to me his desire or intention to take her from her Grandparents. When I visited the...\nReserve on March 28th last, Frances had returned home from Prince Albert to stay.\n\nThere are three factions on this Reserve, the Bears, Crains, and Smiths. Mr. Gentleman gets along well with some of the Bears, but his relations/the others are strained, and in some cases badly so; there are sometimes he will not enter at times.\n\nI consider Mr. Gentleman's usefulness, which never was great, finished on this Reserve, and I recommend that a change be made of teacher and Overseer, and that a practical and competent person be appointed.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"G.Paul Schmidt.\"\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nC.P.S./A.M.\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing herewith a letter received from Mr. Agent Schmidt, of the Duck Lake Agency, with regard to the appointment of a Truant Officer on the John Smith's Reserve.\n\nThe question of Schools on this Reserve is a farce, and I have already reported fully on this matter. I do not think having an Indian Truant Officer would be to any advantage at all. My recommendation is that the School be closed and that an industrial school be built, by the Anglican Church in the City of Prince Albert. Mr. Gentleman, so far as I can see, is not the man to be working with Indians.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEnc.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to Mr. Commissioner Graham's letter of the 26th ultimo enclosing a letter received from Mr. Agent Schmidt with regard to the appointment of a truant officer on the John Smith's Reserve I beg to say that the irregular attendance at this school was brought to the Department's attention by Mr. Gentleman, the teacher, in July last, and the Agent was asked, on the 27th of that month, to be good enough to state the name of an Indian who would be suitable for the position of truant officer and also what remuneration he would expect for the work, his duties to commence on the re-opening of the school after the summer holidays. No reply was received from Mr. Schmidt until the receipt of his letter of the 19th ultimo, forwarded under cover of the Commissioner's letter. The Department had no intimation as to what had been done in regard to carrying out these instructions.\n\nMr. Schmidt states that he took the matter up with Mr. Gentleman last summer, but that he would not hear of having a truant officer on the reserve and, with the regard to the appointment of one now, the Agent does not consider that the same is necessary. Mr. Schmidt also states that if Mr. and Mrs. Gentleman exerted themselves more he is satisfied that the attendance would improve. The Regulations provide for the appointment of a truant officer, and the teacher is not expected to act in that capacity.\n\nMr. Schmidt, in the concluding paragraph of his letter, says \"I consider Mr. Gentleman's usefulness, which never was great, finished on this reserve, and I recommend that a change be made of teacher and overseer, and that a practical and competent person be appointed\".\n\nThe Commissioner, in his letter, states that the question of schools on this reserve is a farce and that he has already reported fully on this matter. If he has done so I fail to find his reports on the school file.\n\nMr. Graham agrees with Mr. Schmidt that a truant officer would not be of any advantage, and his recommendation is that the school be closed and that an industrial school be built by the Anglican Church in the city of Prince Albert. He also concurs in Mr. Schmidt's estimate of Mr. Gentleman, and is not the man to be working with the Indians, as far as he can see.\n\nWe have only had one report on this school from Mr. Inspector Crombie, which was made in June, 1917, nearly two years ago. While he considered that the progress of the pupils was not as good as might be expected under a teacher who had been in charge as long as Mr. Gentleman, he stated...\nstated that the pupils in the higher grades were doing well. A lack of progress was noted in the lower grades. I would be loathe to condemn Mr. Gentleman on any of the reports received on his work.\n\nThe trouble with Mr. Gentleman seems to be that he and the Agent have failed to get on together.\n\nMr. Inspector Crombie, who was asked for a special report in regard to a change of teacher, states that in his opinion the reason for the request made by the Indians is that there is more objection to Mr. Gentleman as overseer on the reserve than as teacher. He says that there are several factions amongst the Indians, part of whom are loyal to the overseer while those who consider they have a grievance against him most doubt signed the petition. The Inspector states that he considers Mr. Gentleman conscientious and trying to do his best for the Indians. He is, however, most unfortunate in that he appears to have the faculty of \"getting in wrong\" and the Agent has had considerable trouble with him over matters pertaining to the reserve. Mr. Gentleman is positive in his views, and at times makes unreasonable criticisms of the Agent, the Agency and Departmental methods. Mr. Crombie's letter by saying that of late there does not appear to have been the same trouble in this respect, but, taking everything into consideration, he considers that it would be in the interests of the Department if Mr. Gentleman could be transferred to some other school, where he could devote his whole time to the school work.\n\nThe Inspector also states that Mrs. Gentleman appears to be rendering good service as matron on this reserve, and her work appears to be appreciated by the members of the Band.\n\nAn Indian named James Crain, one of the chief movers for the dismissal of Mr. Gentleman, was written to and told that from information received the Department is of the opinion that some of the Indians on the reserve have failed to give Mr. Gentleman any encouragement or assistance in his work; and that it is hoped that this constant fault finding with the teacher would cease, and that the Department is not prepared to accede to their request.\n\nMy experience is that that few, if any, teachers can remain for any length of time on an Indian reserve and avoid trouble, as they are uncertain, coy and hard to please.\n\nIn my opinion there are not sufficient grounds to call for Mr. Gentleman's dismissal, but, if he could be given another field, it might be in the best interests of all concerned.\n\nThe Commissioner recommends that the school be closed and an industrial school built by the Anglican church in the city of Prince Albert. This is hardly feasible, as the Anglican Church have no funds available for this purpose and the Department has gone to considerable expense by providing suitable day school accommodation. Judging by the photographs of the buildings Mr. Gentleman has kept them in good condition, and there is no reason why a day school there should not be a success.\nMay 16th, 1919.\n\nDear Mr. Graham -\n\nI have given consideration to your letter of the 26th ultimo, enclosing a communication addressed to you by Mr. Agent Schmidt, regarding conditions on the John Smith's Reserve, having special reference to Mr. Gentleman.\n\nI am inclined to believe that there is more objection to Mr. Gentleman as overseer than as teacher of the school. As you are aware he is granted an allowance of $200.00 as overseer, and if we are not getting value for this, I would propose that we withdraw the grant and have him devote all his time to the school.\n\nIt is out of the question to consider the erection of an industrial school at Prince Albert by the Church of England or even by the Government at the present time. You may recollect that the Church of England conducted a school there, Emmanuel College, which had to be closed some years ago. If Mr. Gentleman were relieved of his duties as overseer he could continue as teacher of the day school until such time as we could make other arrangements for him.\n\nI know of no position at the present time to which he might be transferred, and I would hesitate to discharge him without more evidence. I would like you to take the first opportunity to personally make enquiry regarding his methods and work on the reserve.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDuck Lake, Nov 19th, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the position of Overseer on John Smith's Reserve, this Agency. I beg to inform you that I find that the occupant of the position, Mr. F. H. Gentlemen, is not capable of filling the same.\n\nI find he lacks in initiative, executive ability and good-will. He is not practical in farm work or stock-raising. I therefore ask that a change of Overseer be made on this Reserve.\n\nUnless a change is made I will ask that I be not held to strictly responsible if the affairs of this reserve go backward and trouble arises.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.) C. F. Schmidt,\nIndian Agent.\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nYour letter of the 20th ultimo regarding conditions upon John Smith's Reserve and relative to Mr. Gentleman as Overseer and Teacher was duly received. I enclose herewith copy of a letter received from Agent Schmidt in reference to Mr. Gentleman as Overseer.\n\nIn my report to you of October 17th last, I mentioned that Mr. Gentleman was not qualified to fill the position of Overseer and I agree with everything Mr. Schmidt now says in this regard. A reference to correspondence on the Department files from Mr. Gentleman will I think disclose the fact that he does not get along very well with the Indians and that in the capacity of Overseer he has displayed lack of ability to handle even minor matters on the Reserve. One interview with this man is sufficient to convince anyone that he is not competent to carry on the affairs of such an important agricultural and Stock Reserve as the John Smith's Reserve undoubtedly is. I would strongly recommend that he be relieved at once of his duties as Overseer, and until such time as other arrangements are made the Agent can handle this work. I am still of the opinion that Mr. Gentleman is not and never will be a success as a teacher and am for using him in any other capacity it is altogether out of the question.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncer C.

Your tenure of that office will be terminated from August 1st next.\n\nI may also inform you that your services as teacher are not considered satisfactory and it is doubtful that the Department can continue to employ you in that capacity. I would suggest that it might be advantageous for you to seek other employment.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nP. H. Gentleman, Esq.,\nJohn Smith's Reserve,\nPuckah, Sask.\nDear Sir;\n\nYour letter of June 23rd No 117084-14 14-99 regarding the Overseership of the reserve, and the suggestion that I should seek other employment respecting the school is before me.\n\nIn reply I would say that for the past two years and upward I have been made fully aware that Messrs Graham, Crombie and Schmidt have not agreed with my position here, and have placed every possible difficulty in my carrying out my work, and it appears clear that they have at last prevailed upon the Department to endeavour to have a change made.\n\nI will not enter into the merits of my work among these people, for unless the Department could obtain an unbiased report by a competent authority, nothing would be gained.\n\nRegarding the school work, it is of course within some means of the Department to decide if same has been a success, but I cannot refrain from pointing out that the school has not been inspected by a proper school Inspector since Mr W.J. Chisholm left.\n\nHowever, I may also say that I have just returned from a visit to Archdeacon Tims at the Sarcee, who very much wishes me to take charge of the Old Sun school at the Blackfoot, and I left him on Friday on the understanding that as soon I could decide upon giving up this position he would communicate with Canon Gould of the M.S.C.C. asking for my appointment to be made to the M.S.C.C. staff. Archdeacon Tims has been in correspondence with me for eighteen months regarding the Old Sun, and it has been largely out of respect for the Bishop of Saskatchewan that I have carried on my present school so long as this.\n\nI do not feel however that the Department have any great grounds in seeking my dismissal from the school work, and under the circumstances I feel that I can ask for a transfer.\nto the Old Sun school. I would ask the Department to continue my salary here as schoolteacher at $50.00 monthly for the holidays which I am entitled to, July and August, and also an additional allowance of $50.00 towards a car from Prince Albert to Gleichen, which I may say is in the neighbourhood of $95.00.\n\nI visited Old Sun with Archdeacon Tims, also his own school. I went carefully into the details of the management and carrying on of these schools in every possible way. The children at these schools are far behind in their school work compared with the pupils here, and I feel that I could fully come up to the Department's needs as well as the M.S.C.C.\n\nI also had the pleasure of meeting Mr Gordon, and I was given to understand by Canon Stocken that Mr Gooderham, the Blackfoot Agent gives every assistance towards the successful carrying on the schoolwork of his Agency, which are points that make a vast difference to ones work.\n\nI would ask for a communication by return, for after seven years among the Indians, outside of the Hudson Bay Co, the field is limited somewhat, in which I could seek employment, in which I could reap any benefits of my experience among the Indian people.\n\nTrusting the Department may be able to give me this consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6286, file 610-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nJuly 14th, 1919\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your letter of July 6th. If you are accepted as principal of the Old Suns school I think I could allow you transportation and expenses for yourself and family from Prince Albert to Gleichen, as it might be considered as a transfer within the Department. Under those circumstances I could not allow the pay for July and August. I think you might find the work congenial in the Old Suns school. There is certainly scope for administrative ability at that point and it should not take you long to prove whether you have it or not.\n\nI wish you every success.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nP. W. Gentleman, Esq.,\nJohn Smith's Reserve,\nPuckahn, Sask.\nRecords\nTo File\nRegistris\nI am not a returned soldier. My work here has more than doubled. But my three unmarried brothers are still in service, two since 1914, and one from Canada since 1915, while my salary has supported my mother in England all through the East coast raids, and I have rebuilt the front of my old home, without asking the Government one cent, and which no advances have been made to cover the higher cost of things other than the bonus which was brought about by the Post Office strike last year, and not by requests from us. We have carried on, and carried on well, and got it in the neck.\n\nI would therefore ask you Sir, to interview the Department on our behalf; and ask them to withdraw their letter of the 23rd of June, and instead of this to give me a transfer to the Old Sun School at Gleichen Alberta. The salary at this school is $600 yearly paid by the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada. The Government are paying less than one half towards the expenses of this school, and as I can see no reason for my dismissal on school grounds, I do not think it out of the way to ask them to make me a special grant of $100 yearly to make that salary up to half my present one, and also to allow me $50.00 towards the cost of a car from Prince Albert to Gleichen which I may say would cost about $95.00. I would add that the Old Sun school is badly in need of someone to take charge, and I have given every satisfaction.\nTo the Church authorities as to my ability to undertake the work, who for the past eighteen months have had a standing request for workers from the returned soldiers organisations, without success.\n\nAfter seven years work among the Indians the field is somewhat limited for other work, and as there has been nothing in my conduct that would warrant my dismissal, if the Department do not see fit to grant me a transfer and its cost, I would ask if the fullest investigation into the whole affair could not be made possible. I shall of course go into the subject with the Bishop of Saskatchewan, but I must say I fail entirely to see why such an action should be taken on the part of a commissioner said to be after greater production, after I have got these people producing more than any other farm instructor has ever done.\n\nYours truly\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Committee we will be appointed to the Old Sun school.\n\nMeanwhile, while I was with Archdeacon Time, the man in charge of the Peigan School wrote resigning on account of sickness, same to take effect on August first, and as the Archdeacon is somewhat at a loss to put a man in charge, we have arranged to go to the Peigan school temporarily for a month or five weeks, until the appointment can be made, to the Old Sun. This arrangement will give me employment for the month of August; and we will therefore leave here as soon as possible after the first.\n\nI will submit receipted accounts of the transfer from Prince Albert to Gleichen in due course, but they will not reach the Department until some time in September. I shall send our things to Gleichen, but the temporarily work at Peigan will make a break in our journey at Calgary, but the expenses from Calgary to Brocket I will undertake myself.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nD.J.

I note what you say, am sorry that conditions do not allow you to give me more hope, & shall hope for better things in the near future. Meanwhile I write to ask if you will consent to the transfer of Mr. Low, Teacher at Big Head's Reserve School, La Corne, to John Smith's Reserve, vice Mr Gentleman leaving. I have no one in sight to propose, & Mr. Low would much like to transfer. Mr. Low is not a certified teacher, but he is painstaking, & I believe he & his wife have done fairly well, & have the progress of the Indian children at heart. While speaking of that I may add that I much doubt if I can get any teacher worth while for Big Head's unless the teacher's house is attended to & put in repair.\n\nMr. Low says he could not stay in it another winter. He has done what he could for it, but it needs overhauling & making weather-proof; & he complains also that there is a great difficulty in getting water. There is no well near. He can not get Mr. Schmidt to do anything for it. We shall never have peace or progress till Mr. Schmidt is removed.\n\nI beg to remain yours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I may say that on the 29th July I received a communication from Mr. C.C., saying that they were not prepared to appoint a man to Gleichen, etc. That this place was without a man in charge and it was desired that I proceed here.\n\nI consulted with C.N.R. freight agent in Prince Albert and found that a direct shipment of goods here was cheaper than making a shipment from Prince Albert to Calgary, and then on again either to this place or Gleichen.\n\nIf the M.S.C.C. require me to go to Gleichen, I will of course do so at my own expense.\n\nOn the 31st of July I spoke to Agent Salmon over the telephone and in response to his inquiry as to when I would be leaving, he took it for granted that I was leaving. I told him that I wanted to get away by the afternoon 31st and he informed me that he would come down on the 29th and check over the department property, etc.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Gentleman, I would be glad if you would let me have a copy of his letter to you.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nThe Secretary,\nCivil Service Commission,\nOttawa.\nVictoria Home,\nBrocket, Alta.\nAug. 19, 1919.\n\nCivil Service Commission,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSirs:\n\nFor a period of six years from July 1913 - 1919 I was employed by the Indian Dept. at John Smith's Reserve, Prince Albert, Sask., as Overseer and Teacher with my wife as matron of the reserve, under the direction of Mr. C. P. Schmidt, Indian Agent at Duck Lake.\n\nIn July last the Indian Dept. informed me that conditions had rendered it unnecessary for me to continue in that position, also that my school was not considered satisfactory and that I had better seek other employment.\n\nI wish to know upon whose recommendation my dismissal was made. I have correspondence from the Indian Dept. not six months old that they were well satisfied with the children under my direction on the occasion of their gaining several prizes at the Prince Albert Fair judged by Provincial School Inspectors in competition with white schools, and the Indian Dept. cannot form any charge against my work in any shape or form which cannot be accounted for, a statement which will be supported on my behalf by W. Know, M. P. for Prince Albert, also the Bishop of Saskatchewan.\n\nFor some time past I have been made fully aware by Agent C. P. Schmidt, Inspector Crombie, as well as Commissioner Graham.\nGraham that they have personally objected to my work and have placed every difficulty in my way. Agent C. P. Schmidt, a German half-breed has made himself particularly objectionable, and I can place direct charges of many occasions of neglect of his duties that has been the cause of a great deal of trouble among the Indians, also considerable expense to the Indian Department.\n\nThe Indian Dept. have agreed to pay the expenses of our move to this school, an Indian Boarding School, but I would like to point out that the salary in my last position came altogether to $1700.00 including that of my wife. This position while carrying with it greater responsibility holds a salary of $600.00 under the arrangements with the Church for the Indian Dept. to pay the grant for the children.\n\nI therefore wish to know, how it is that a man who has put in six years faithful work, who unlike the higher officials of the Indian Dept. has not occupied his time with farms of their own, is liable to treatment of this kind, and in support of my statement of faithful work I can refer to Mr. Knox, the Bishop of Saskatchewan, Professor Bate, any business man in Prince Albert, or any farmer within a radius of ten miles of John Smith's Reserve.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(SGD) P. W. Gentleman.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn compliance with your request of the 30th ult., I am enclosing, herewith, copy of a letter addressed to this office by Mr. P. W.

W. Gentleman from the John Smith Reserve, in order that the Commission may be in a position to reply to Mr. Gentleman's letter of the 19th ultimo.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSECRETARY.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\n\nWill you kindly let me have a reply to my letters of the 28th of August and the 20th of September, regarding the removal of Mr. P. W. Gentleman from the John Smith Reserve.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSECRETARY.\n\nDuncan G. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nRegarding my recent letter respecting my removal by the Indian Department from the John Smith's School in Saskatchewan to this establishment, I may inform you that I have now been able to look over the work of these children, and I find that the statement of the Indian Department in their letter No 117084-14 of June 23rd last that my services as a teacher are not satisfactory simply has no grounds whatever to stand upon, when it comes to compare the work of these children with those whom I have just taught.\n\nThe state of this schoolroom is simply a disgrace to the Government of Canada. I find that big boys sixteen and seventeen years of age who have been in the school for upward of ten years or more, are only reading out of the second reader, and cannot do a simple multiplication sum. Pen and Ink appears never to have been used. They can copy a piece of writing out of a readingbook onto a slate, but they cannot take a piece of dictation of any kind. These children have boarded here, and have just been neglected, and if any Inspector had come into this place and found fault, there might have been grounds, and I would just like to have Mr Inspector Crombie come along here and compare the two places, for as that party inspected the John Smith's School, it would give me the greatest pleasure to ask him his grounds for fault finding and have the work of the two schools compared. The schoolroom is small, and twelve seats out of thirty broken.\n\nIn addition to the neglected state of the schoolroom work, as I intimated in my letter, the whole building, and outfit is about\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6286, file 610-1, part 1)\nthe most difficult to adopt oneself to schoolwork that I have ever seen in the course of fifteen years of school work. An open drain runs down the middle of the yard into which is placed the contents of three outside closets, not 12 yards from the back door, and this under the nose of the Indian Departments Commissioner, Inspector and Agent.\n\nI am well aware of the fact that this is a Church Mission school, for which the Church is responsible, and that a good deal of the neglect will doubtless be laid upon the church, but there is no getting away from the fact that the Government of Canada are breaking their treaty obligations with the Indians by not giving a grant large enough to carry on the church schools as they should be carried on. If this establishment, and the Roman Catholic School on the Peigan reserve closed up, the Indian Dept/ would either have to open up on their own, or start a Dayschool which would cost them a great deal more than the Educational work among these people is now doing.\n\nHowever to refer again to our removal from the John Smiths School. Indian Department letters No 117684/1 Aug 29th, 1918 also No 281922 Oct 15th, 1918 both lead me to believe that they are well satisfied with the progress of those children, when their work gained prizes judged by the Provincial Inspectors, who at least are school teachers and know their work, and not Political wire pullers, and I fail entirely to see how the Indian Department could change their attitude within so short a time, unless it is that Messrs Graham, Crombie and Schmidt have taken a great dislike to myself for the simple reason that I endeavored to get them to carry out the Indian Act, and regulations which the Department speak of in their letters.\nIt seems clear to my mind that I have been made a victim of some kind of humbug, and it is my intention to get to the bottom of it.\n\nI have given nearly seven years satisfaction in my old work, and if the Government will employ rascals like Schmidt, who when appointed Indian Agent had to ask me what the Indian Department meant by the word \"Surname\" at the top of bond, there is no reason why they should have the power to dismiss a man on personal grounds alone.\n\nI have had a nice home; certainly Indian Department buildings, but I kept them well in repair at my own expense. My total salary was $1700, and I gave my whole attention to my work.\n\nWithout any grounds whatever, Messrs Graham, Crombie & Schmidt, all three of them Political appointees, and only Graham with more experience with Indians than I have had, have handed me something so that I have had to take $600 a year, move into a dirty unsuitable home in a disgraceful condition, destroy my two pet animals, and have my household goods smashed up in the transfer.\n\nSuch is the treatment the Government of Canada can hand out to a man who has given them seven years straight honest endeavour.\n\nIS THIS CANADA IN WHICH WE CAN LOOK FOR JUSTICE, or HAS THE GOVERNMENT TURNED BOLSHEVE? for I can say that the treatment my wife and I have received go along way to turn decent citizens into Bolshevics.\n\nThe statement I have made will be backed up by the Bishop of Saskatchewan, The Bishop of Edmonton, Archdeacon McKay, Mr W. Knocks Member for Prince Albert. Any business man or otherwise in Prince Albert, Inspector Tomlinson, or Professor Bate in connection with that part of my letter regarding the work of the John Smith School, and Archdeacon Time of Calgary. Agent Graham Rev Haynes of this\nthis place, regarding the condition of this establishment.\n\nIt is greatly to my regret that I cannot take Mr D.C. Scott to the John Smith's Reserve, in company with Messrs Graham, Crombie & Schmidt, and then bring them to this place, and have them place on record their reasons for the change.\n\nI will thank you for the fullest investigation. also\n\nfor a special grant to bring up our salary to the $1700.00. I am not in Indian Mission work for what I can make out of it, like other officials I can name, but I need it to put this place into some kind of decent repair.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Chairman,\nCivil Service Commissioners,\nOttawa.\nCIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION OF CANADA\n\nOFFICE OF W.J.

Sack\nSept. 23rd 1919\n\nW.D.C. Scott Esq.\nSuperintendent, Dept.\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have taken up duties of teaching here having been transferred to this reserve from James Smiths. I wrote you asking for a transfer but did not get a reply direct, but was notified through Duck Lake Agency.\n\nThe reason I am writing is this. In connection with the duties of teaching, previous teachers have had other duties which was or is to oversee, and to attend to the issuing of rations to the destitute, and school, and directing affairs on the reserve.\n\nThe Indian Agent, Mr. Schmidt asked me today if I had received word from you as to my position on the reserve, had I heard whether I had the overseeing of the reserve, as he had not heard. What made him put the question was that I asked him what my duties were, he said he did not know himself.\n\nIf it is the Department's wish that I do the overseeing of the reserve, I will do it to my best ability. I have had nearly six years on James Smiths reserve, and I think I could combine the two duties. I would like to know if I am to hold the position of overseer.\n\nI remain,\nYour obedient servant,\nJohn Leonard Lowe.\nOctober 7, 1919.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Mr. J. L. Lowe, Teacher on the John Smith's reserve, in which he asks whether he is to act as overseer as well as teacher, as his predecessor, Mr. Gentleman, did.\n\nI know nothing of Mr. Lowe's capabilities, and I note that in your letter of October 17, last, you expressed the opinion that it was a mistake to combine the positions under Mr. Gentleman. Mr. Lowe might not be any more capable of managing the farming than his predecessor was.\n\nWill you kindly give this matter your best consideration, and make a recommendation. It seems to me that it might be better for us to separate the school work from the farming activities.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. H.

Lowe, Teacher on the John Smith's Reserve, in which he asks whether he is to act as overseer as well as teacher, as did his predecessor, Mr. Gentleman.\n\nI might observe at the outset that Mr. Lowe is adopting a line of procedure for which Mr. Gentleman was frequently blamed and cautioned, that is, writing to the Department in Ottawa over the head of his Agent.\n\nI am satisfied that Mr. Lowe would not make a capable overseer, and the two appointments of teacher and overseer should be kept entirely separate.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nD.G. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOctober 17, 1918.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 23rd ultimo, I may say that after careful consideration the department has decided not to combine the positions of teacher and overseer at the John Smith's reserve in future.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nJohn Leonard Love, Esq.,\nJohn Smith's Reserve,\nPuckahn P.O.,\nSask.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I beg now to lay the following requests and comments before you. I shall repeat some points discussed and dropped as impossible at present, because I want to have them on your files, as a reminder of what is desired and what I fully believe is due to your Indian work:\n\nX X X\n\nNo.7. As to Mr. Graham's suggestion for John Smith's Reserve, to remove the boys and appoint a married farm instructor and a woman teacher, I am writing to him that I greatly depurate it, at least for the present. It would not be fair to the boys who have only lately removed there, and are doing good work. I have no other reserve with a decent house for the teacher. A woman Teacher would not do so well there, these children require a man. Mrs. Low can look after mid-day meals, and if necessary the dispensing, far better than could a farm instructor and wife. There is a good house for the farm instructor but not near the school. I should strongly suspect any such move as long as Mr. Schmidt remains Indian Agent. It would be contrary to the expressed intention of the I.D. to stop the old scandals of corrupt Indian Agents and farmers and to give us a better class. I hope you will not sanction it.\n\nX X X\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ.A.

Perhaps I was not told verbally but I inferred so.\n\nI had been here about six weeks when I received your letter which said that the Dept. did not consider the combined position to be advisable.\n\nI am quite satisfied that it is not advisable, and from my own opinion it is advisable to have a farm instructor here too.\n\nThe reason I am writing to you is to ask if you would transfer me back to my old position at South Port a la Boine.\n\nThe reason is this: During the time of the Rev. Mr. Dougal and Mr. Glattman, the Dept. furnished hay, oats, for the horses, and rations for the employees, which were supposed to be fed to the school and family and also for the overseer.\n\nThe rations have been dropped off; I have to buy my own hay and oats, and $140 has been disallowed. The Dept. paying me $5.00 per month.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6286, file 610-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nfor carrying the destitute relations.\n\nI have had to pay fifteen dollars per load for hay, till today, and I have got to pay from twenty-five to thirty dollars a load for hay tomorrow. That is, if it's possible to get it, I do not expect to get any at all.\n\nNow it is not possible for a man to do this and live reasonably on the money the Dept. pays for Teacher and Field Matron. It is necessary for anyone who lives so far away from town to keep horses and one cow.\n\nThe Indians have been spoiled by previous teachers who have given them quite a lot of goods, and have spent a good sum of money on them in the way of presents until these Indians have become greedy and unreasonable. I do not believe in doing this, as it does not tend to make the Indian the best he can be. I can give an example.\n\nThis writer the minister, who makes a journey from Prince Albert every Sunday, was being paid by the Indians fifteen dollars per month towards his stipend and then they charge him fifteen dollars for his hay.\n\nI have tried to make them see that it is only fair that they should let me have the hay at reasonable price, but when refused to pay fifteen dollars for a poor load of hay, they took it away.\n\nI could do better at James Smith's even if I do have to put up with poor condition of house and water, but how can a man live reasonable and pay this price for hay.\nI would like to go back to the James Smith's Reserve, as I always had a good attendance and feel that they appreciate the teacher and school more than here. They do not want me to go from there, and asked me to show how I could to get the school open again. But you know the reason I wanted to leave and that was because of the poor conditions.

I return herewith your account from the C. P. R. Company.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nP. H. Gentleman, Esq.,\nOld Sun School,\nGleichen, Alta.\nMarch 4th, 1920\n\nDear Sir;\n\nIn 1918 in order to get around the John Smith's reserve quicker I purchased a roadster Mitchell car, which on the first of August last I left in Prince Albert to be sold.\n\nIn December I found that the party I left the machine with had disposed of his garage, and the man who took it over sent me a bill for $70.00 for storage, which I have had to pay. I endeavored to sell the outfit at Prince Albert, also to have it stored, but was not successful, and had had to have the machine shipped down to me, and I have now a freight bill of $100.00 to pay, making a total account of $170.00. I feel this is pretty hard, and I would like to know if you can grant me something towards the freight. The fellow I left it with gave me no notice of his intention of leaving Prince Albert; I could not dispose of it and I did not want to give it away. I used it round John Smith's and supplied my own gasoline, and as this place has no rig at all it will be useful to go into town with.\n\nI might add that to keep my transportation costs as low as possible I disposed at a loss more than half of our household goods and with the cost of our move from the Pelicans, and replacing many things, and this account will finish my savings over $300.00.\n\nTaking in all things into consideration, I think something might be done, and I hope you will be able to give it your best consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Alec Brain has attended school a little this quarter but is helping his father, who claims he cannot do without him. Allen Smith. This boy was insolent so I told him not to come again. I took him back again on trial. He behaved himself for a time. Then I had complaints from one of the eldest girls. She had acted in a very indecent manner. I also had complaints from parents of two other girls, who said Allen had acted indecently to them on the way home and tried to enter them into the bush. I thrashed the boy and expelled him from school.\nREPORT of Provisions used at John Smith's Day School\non John Smith Reserve, for Month ended March 1920\n\nAggregate Attendance: 231\nMeals Served: 253\n\n| Item     | On hand at end of month | Received during Month | Used during Month | On hand at end of Month | REMARKS |\n|----------|-------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|---------|\n| FLOUR    | 50 lbs                  | 25 lbs                | 75 lbs            | none                    |         |\n| BACON    | none                    | none                  | none              | none                    | two dinners given |\n| BEEF     | 5 lbs                   | 84 lbs                | 29 lbs            | none                    | to woman scrubbing |\n| TEA      | none                    | 3 lbs                 | 3 lbs             | none                    |         |\n| RICE     | none                    | 5 lbs                 | 5 lbs             | none                    |         |\n| SOAP     | none                    | 3 bars                | 3 bars            | none                    |         |\n| SUGAR    | none                    | none                  | none              | none                    |         |\n| SALT     | 11 1/2 lbs              | none                  | 15 lbs            | 10 lbs                  |         |\n| POTATOES |                         |                       |                   |                         |         |\n| BISCUITS | none                    | none                  | none              | none                    |         |\n| BEANS    | 2 lbs                   | none                  | 2 lbs             | none                    |         |\n| OATMEAL  | none                    | none                  | none              | none                    |         |\n| PEAS     | none                    | none                  | none              | none                    |         |\n| Yeast Baker | 5 bars                  |                       |                   |                         |         |\n| Baking Powder | 6 lbs                  |                       |                   |                         |         |\n\nCertified Correct,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.
