Elford, teacher, has requested that some interior alterations and repairs be performed at the St. Clair Indian Day School on Sarnia Reserve during summer holidays. At present there are several poorly constructed, old and more or less useless cupboards and boxes in various places in the classroom. Some of these are movable but others have been fastened to the walls in inconvenient places. These boxes, shelves, etc., are directly below and in front of side blackboards which prevent pupils from making use of the blackboard space. The teacher wishes to have these removed and replaced with one compact cupboard and one wall case complete with shelving. If this were done it would improve the general appearance of the class room, make more floor space available and be more satisfactory in every way.\n\nThe teacher states that quite a number of new pupils will be starting to school next September. For these beginners she wishes us to provide a large kindergarten work table. The younger pupils would receive their instruction at this table which should have drawers to hold their individual books, seatwork, pencils, crayons, plasticine and other primary materials. Miss Elford expects that there will be about 55 pupils next Fall and considers that such a large number of pupils cannot be handled properly unless a kindergarten table is supplied complete with drawers and benches to accommodate about twelve primary pupils.\n\nMiss Elford also asks that small platforms about 10\" high and 30\" wide be built in front of all blackboards so that younger pupils may be able to reach all blackboards without stretching\n\n(Over)\nor standing on tip-toe. At present all immovable blackboards are quite high on the wall and only the older and taller children can use them. This teacher also wishes us to do something regarding the blackboard across the front of the class room. Portions of its surface are rough and worn and the teacher thinks that an entirely new board is necessary. The front blackboard has an area of 79 1/3 square feet. Rather than buy a new board I suggest that some blackboard paint for resurfacing could be purchased which would perhaps renew the board satisfactorily.\n\nThe materials for all of the above mentioned repairs and alterations would cost approximately $40.00. All labour could be performed by a capable Indian carpenter, James B. Williams, at an estimated cost of $25.00. This would make a total estimated expenditure of $65.00. Materials could be purchased locally and accounts for them as well as labour could be submitted under cover of vouchers to the Department for payment.\n\nI recommend that this work be done as I believe it is necessary in the best interests of the teacher and pupils at St. Clair Indian Day School.\n\nKindly advise if expenditures as detailed above will be approved by the Department.\n\nM. W. McCracken,\n\nMWM: FM\n\nM. W. McCracken,\nINDIAN AGENT.\nOttawa, July 4, 1944.\n\nMr. M.W. McCracken, Indian Agent, Sarnia, Ontario,\n\nWith reference to yours of the 29th ultimo, the Department approves an expenditure of $65.00 for material and labour in making interior alterations and repairs to the St. Clair Indian Day School.\n\nWe are ordering from the Government Stationery Office the blackboard paint which you state is needed.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nSarnia, July 8th, 1944\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nSome of the Indians of the Sarnia Band have considered that warning signs should be placed at a dangerous intersection of roads on their Reserve. The St. Clair Indian Day School is situated on a corner of the intersection where there is considerable traffic in both directions. As a protection to the children it has been suggested that two \"Stop Signs\" be placed on one road, two \"Slow Down Signs\" on the other road, and four \"School-Go Slow Signs\". Kindly advise if these are procurable from the Indian Affairs Branch. If so, I would appreciate if they could be forwarded to this office. Signs appearing on the King's Highway throughout the Province of Ontario would be suitable.\n\nM. W. McCracken,\n\nMWM:FM\n\nM. W. McCracken,\nINDIAN AGENT.\nOttawa, July 12, 1944.\n\nMr. H.W.

McCracken,\nIndian Agent.\nSarnia, October 11, 1944.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nThe question of supplying hot lunches to pupils attending Day School in the Sarnia Agency has been discussed with the teachers. Miss Elford, teacher of the St. Clair School considers that the Department should supply 8 quarts of fresh milk each day for the period December 1, 1944 to March 31, 1945. This is an increased amount over previous years as there is now a larger attendance at the St. Clair School. The teacher does not think it necessary for the Department to buy canned soup, cocoa or sugar as much of this could be brought by the children themselves. I recommend that the Department approve of supplying milk to this school during the winter months.\n\nThe two teachers at Kettle Point consider that fresh milk as well as canned soup, cocoa and sugar should be supplied by the Department. I am in favour of purchasing the milk but see little necessity for any additional expenditures for soup or cocoa. I think the children could bring potatoes, beans, peas, corn and cocoa which would enable them to make their own soup and hot drinks. In practically every case the parents are working and it would be no hardship on them to furnish the above at their own expense. I am in favour of supplying four quarts of milk to the senior room and four quarts to the junior room at Kettle Point School. If the Department thinks that soup should also be purchased for these schools I shall be glad to list the quantities needed.\n\nM. W. McCracken\n\nMWM: FM\n\nM. W.

It seems to the officials here highly desirable that the lunches provided at our schools should be measurably uniform.

If this action is necessary, I suggest that those living closest to Sarnia should be enrolled in the Sarnia Public School. However, it should be distinctly understood with the Sarnia School Board that the Department will not be responsible for payment of tuition grants for these children unless the Board has received a letter from you authorizing the admission.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| April | To payment for 1 broom supplied the St. Clair Indian Day School, as per attached account; | $1.35 |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

Roberts,\nActing Indian Agent,\nSarnia, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of May 21st, inquiring if arrangements can be made to admit sixteen additional pupils from the Sarnia Reserve to the Sarnia Public Schools next school year, was presented to the members of the Board of Education at the regular meeting held Monday evening last and the following resolution was adopted:\n\n\"That the Department of Indian Affairs be informed that, due to overcrowding in the City schools, there is no room for children coming in from the Reserve.\"\n\nThis means that all pupils from outside the city limits who are already in attendance and paying fees will not be permitted to return to Sarnia schools in the fall and the parents of these pupils are being so advised.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Mrs.) M. B. Beasley\nSecretary-Treasurer.\nSecy-Treas. & School Supt.,\nBoard of Education,\n275 Wellington Street,\nSarnia, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOwing to crowded conditions in the St. Clair Indian Day School on the Sarnia Reserve, Departmental authority has been obtained for the admission of a number of pupils in Sarnia Public Schools if such can be arranged. Present estimates indicate accommodation will be required for approximately sixteen additional Indian pupils, as follows:\n\n| Grade | Number |\n|-------|--------|\n| IV    | 6      |\n| V     | 4      |\n| VI    | 5      |\n| VII   | 1      |\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch of the Department of Mines & Resources will be responsible for tuition fees of pupils so enrolled - although it should be clearly understood that the Department will not be responsible for payment of tuition grants for others than those for whom the Board has received a letter of authorization from this office.\n\nWould you kindly advise me at your convenience as to the likelihood of accommodation for the pupils referred to, being available.\n\nI should be pleased to discuss the foregoing with you personally - or with the Board - at any time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC. Roberts,\nActing Indian Agent.\nSarnia, Ont., June 7, 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nOn receipt of Departmental letter dated May 11th, file 29-1-5, a letter was written to the Sarnia Board of Education - copy of which is attached - enquiring into the possibility of accommodating additional Indian pupils.\n\nA reply has been received today - copy of which is also attached - and which is self-explanatory.\n\nThere will be approximately 70 pupils of school age on the Sarnia reserve next September - and, the present class room having a seating capacity of 40, there will be a surplus of 30 pupils. (There are 52 pupils now on the roll but the present teacher informs me she could not possibly carry on under present conditions for another year).\n\nThe foregoing facts are submitted for your consideration.\n\nIt is obvious additional class room space is essential before the beginning of the new term.\n\nC. Roberts,\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nEncs. 2.\nOttawa, June 12, 1945.\n\nMr. C. Roberts,\nActing Indian Agent, Sarnia, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to the situation at the St. Clair School. It is noted that the Sarnia Public School Board will not be able to accommodate any of the Indian children.\n\nI have just discussed your letter very fully with the Acting Director, and frankly we do not know what we can do in the matter. No funds were specifically provided in the current year's appropriation for the erection of an addition to the St. Clair School. We have included this new addition in the first year of our post-war program, but exactly when that will commence, it is impossible for me to say. The only other possible solution is that, if there is a building on the St. Clair Reserve, it could be rented for school purposes, temporarily, for a year or so. It is quite possible that you have already considered this suggestion.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDuplicate\n\nNo. 645\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\n\nESTABLISHED 1852\n\nBOUGHT OF THE KINGAN HARDWARE CO.

I have discussed this with the Chief and Council and they appear to be agreeable to such arrangements. However, this will be discussed further, and the necessary Band Resolution passed at the next regular Council meeting. At that time the question of an appropriate rental will also be discussed, and your comments as to what would be a fair amount from the Department's point of view would be appreciated. The next regular Council meeting will be held on Tuesday, July 3rd, and the last mentioned information should be on hand here prior to that date if possible. As soon as possible after approval has been granted by the Council a requisition will be submitted covering the necessary desks, etc.\n\nIn the meantime, might I suggest, that the necessity of an additional teacher, preferably one experienced in teaching higher grades, be kept in mind.\n\nG.

Roberts, Acting Indian Agent, Sarnia, Ont.,\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of July 16th and my reply of July 19th, with reference to supplies required for the new classroom on the St. Clair Reserve. No mention was made in my letter of the two blackboard easels or the two fibrebacked cork bulletin boards.\n\nWould it not be possible to have the pupils make the easels on the reserve? I do not think that they would cost more than if they were purchased from Moyers and certainly they would be stronger. We think that the purchased easels are inclined to be flimsy.\n\nWhat has been said about the easels applies also for the wood required for the bulletin boards. You may purchase these locally.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, July 25th, 1945.\n\nMr. C.

To date (January 15) we are still confronted with this problem. Throughout October, November and December the anger and resentment of the Indians towards the Secretary of the Company steadily increased as they blamed him for delaying the project unnecessarily. The Indians openly advocated taking court action against the Company for breach of contract but this feeling has subsided since Inspector Arnell explained the whole matter to the Indians at a meeting early in January 1946. The Sarnia Band feel that this building must be completed at an early date so that it may be used as a classroom for school children. Mr. McCreath is endeavouring to get bricklayers and if successful the building should be completed in about five weeks. A water main to provide the Council Hall, Mission House, and proposed church was installed and Sarnia Township will supply the water. The residence of the United Church Minister was also supposed to have been moved by the Steel Company and, although the minister vacated the house early last summer, the building was not moved and in October the minister moved back into the house. He is very angry at Mr. McCreath, Secretary of the Company, on account of the above. As this house is owned by the United Church, it is a matter to be settled between the Company and United Church authorities at Toronto.\n\nM.W.

In their opinion this unsatisfactory state of affairs with regard to school accommodation has existed on the Sarnia Reserve for many years. After a prolonged discussion on the subject they passed the following resolution:\n\n\"Moved by Jas. B.

I feel confident that he could make similar arrangements to those just completed by him for the Indian Day School in the Caradoc Agency. This might of course mean the construction of a one-room school directly adjacent to the present school rather than the addition of a room to the present school. However, in view of the present urgent need for class-room facilities, I would further recommend that, if necessary, such a one-room plant be erected.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nJune 28, 1946.\n\nDear Mr. Gray:\n\nThis Branch would like to erect a day school on the St. Clair Reserve this summer, but, from enquiries we have made, it appears that we will have to proceed by using day labour and not on a contract basis.\n\nThe Director, Mr. Hoey, has asked me to go to Sarnia with a view to making enquiries regarding labour and materials. I expect to be in Sarnia about Wednesday July 3 and will call on you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRoss Gray, Esq., ex-M.P.,\nBarrister,\nSarnia, Ontario.\nJune 28, 1946.\n\nDear Mr. McCracken:\n\nMr. Hoey has asked me to go to Sarnia next week with a view to ascertaining if labour and material can be secured for the erection of a day school on the St. Clair Reserve, by day labour. I expect to be in Sarnia on Wednesday July 3.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. M. W. McCracken,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ontario.\nSend the following message, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to:\n\nPhilip Nelson\nGore of M F McCRACKEN\nIndian Agent\nSARNIA Ontario\n\nUNABLE OFF PLANS UNTIL WEDNESDAY -stop-\nTHEY SHOULD REACH YOU THURSDAY\n\nFORM 6102\n50 feet from the proposed new school.\n\nOrdinary Indian labour can be secured for 65 to 70 cents an hour.\n\nBrick-layers will be available within the next two or three weeks, as the building on which they are now working will be completed by the end of the current month.\n\nNatural gas can be obtained to heat the building. This would involve the installation of a force-draught furnace.\n\nIn conversation with Indian Agent McCracken he expressed the opinion that it was not absolutely essential to have living accommodation for the teachers, as there is quite a community within a short distance of the proposed school, where teachers can obtain boarding accommodation. In view of the number of children who will require school accommodation next year, I believe that it would be in the best interests of all parties concerned if we built a two-room school. The estimated cost would be approximately fifteen to sixteen thousand dollars, and, while this amount was not specifically provided in the current year's appropriation, I feel that there will be sufficient funds on hand to handle the cost of a two-room school on the St. Clair Reserve.\n\nIn view of the above, I submit, for your approval, a memorandum to the Acting Deputy Minister, requesting the Minister's approval for this building.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMemorandum:\n\nSUPERINTENDENT OF WELFARE and TRAINING\n\nAs instructed, I spent Wednesday and Thursday, July 3 and 4, at the Sarnia Agency with a view to ascertaining the prospects of erecting a new school on the St. Clair Reserve.\n\nIt is likely that there will be from 90 to 105 children who will wish to attend the day school on this reserve during the academic year 1946-47.\n\nThe present school is very old and it might be repaired. When preparing our estimates for the current fiscal year we included an amount for the erection of a one-room school and teacher's residence attached.\n\nI discussed the whole situation both with Indian Agent McCracken and all the members of the St. Clair Band, including the new Chief, Nicholas Plain.\n\nThey are very anxious to have a two-room school erected, and, as lumber is scarce, they suggested that we erect a brick veneer building.\n\nOne of the members of the Council, namely, Mr. Williams, has acted as foreman on several buildings, the latest being the new council hall. At present he is employed at Detroit and expects to be finished within the next two or three weeks. Indian Agent McCracken expressed the opinion that we could not secure a better foreman than Williams if we decide to proceed with the erection of a new building.\n\nFurther enquiries showed that material is available as follows:\n\n| Item       | Supplier                                      |\n|------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Bar joist  | Sarnia Bridge Company                         |\n| Lumber     | Leidlaw Brothers, Sarnia                      |\n| Brick      | Howlett's Brick Yard, Petrolia, or Cornbill & Sons, Chatham |\n| Excavating | Shaw Construction Company                     |\n| Cement and Gravel | Easily obtainable, or Shaw Construction Co. is prepared to supply ready mixed cement. |\n\nHydro power is on the road in front of the school.\n\nWater can be obtained from a new well which has just been dug at the council hall, which would be approximately\nOttawa, July 5, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nACTING DEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: St. Clair Indian Reserve -\n\nEX'D.\n\nOn this reserve we have a small day school with accommodation for approximately 40 children. During the academic year 1945-46 approximately 80 children were enrolled, and, as a result, we had to work on the half day system, namely, the children in the junior class attending in the morning and those in the senior classes attending in the afternoon.\n\nWe have received very strong representations, both from the Indian Agent and the Council, for the erection of a new school. I thought it necessary to send Mr. Phelan to Sarnia this week to investigate the situation fully, and he spent July 3 and 4 on the reserve and also interviewed the Indian Council. There are prospects of 90 to 106 children requiring educational facilities for the academic year 1946-47, and, under the circumstances, the Indian Agent and the Council feel that we should erect a two-room school. Funds for the purpose will be available in our current year's appropriation. As a matter of fact, we provided the amount required for the erection of a one-room school on this reserve in our 1946-47 appropriation. The additional amount required for the erection of a two-room school will be available.\n\nOwing to the scarcity of lumber, it has been suggested that construction be brick veneer. Brick are easily available.\n\nThe services of a competent Indian foreman can also be\nsecured and most of the labourers employed would be Indians. Materials are available in Sarnia and vicinity but would have to be secured wherever available.\n\nI would appreciate it if the Minister would approve the erection of a two-room school on the St. Clair Reserve and also authorize the purchase of materials required where and when available.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, July 5, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nACTING DEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: St. Clair Indian Reserve -\n\nOn this reserve we have a small day school with accommodation for approximately 40 children.

Gardner:jm\nSarnia, July 22nd, 1946.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nAttention: Mr. Philip Phelan.\n\nWith reference to the building of a two-room school on the Sarnia Reserve I am enclosing list of materials taken from the plans. This list was prepared by Shaw Construction Company of Sarnia at a cost of $45.00. If we desire, this Company is prepared to provide a white foreman to erect the building. Mr. Shaw informs me that white foremen of this nature usually charge from $60.00 to $95.00 per week. He would be willing to use as much Indian labour as possible. When you were at Sarnia we discussed the possibility of placing James B. Williams, an Indian, as foreman on this job but I am now doubtful if he would be quite capable. He states that he would not work for less than $.50 an hour. The Shaw Construction Company is well equipped to handle this job, although there may be others just as efficient. However, this phase of the matter can be investigated when you visit Sarnia before the work is commenced.\n\nI trust that the enclosed list of materials is what you require and I shall await further instructions.\n\nM.

It appears to be quite definite that this teacher will be unable to continue and we shall have to try to get another teacher. In this connection I would advise that I advertised in London and Toronto papers to secure a teacher for St. Clair School but no applications were received. At the present time the Sarnia Agency requires one Senior teacher for Kettle Point and one for St. Clair.\n\nWith reference to the new school building at Sarnia I would advise that I had difficulty in getting a contractor to prepare a bill of materials from the plans. I eventually got the Shaw Construction Company of Sarnia to do this work. They started at it on July 16th, but it is not expected that the list will be ready until Tuesday, July 23rd. When Mr. Shaw finishes the work I shall wire you as instructed in our recent telephone conversation.\n\nM. W. McCracken\n\nM. W.

He believes we should plan on using lumber as he is having some success in procuring it and is of the opinion he can get enough to do the school.\n\nThe basis proposed in the Company's letter is cost plus 15% or 15\u00bd of the cost which amounts to the same thing. The 15% would include supervision of construction and wages of a foreman. I doubt if Mr. Shaw will take on the job for less than 15%.\n\nMr. Shaw estimates that the building will cost approximately $20,000.00 plus his 15% which would be $3,000.00 making a total estimate of $23,000.00. He pointed out that the cost of materials is very uncertain these days and total expenditure for the school may go as high as $25,000.00.\n\nI consider that the Department should have Mr. Shaw's proposition in writing and therefore instructed him to submit details direct to Mr. Phelan.

He told me of the letter he received from you stating that the 15% might be a tiny bit high. I might say the reason I put this at 15% is that we are located so close to the job that we can give a great deal of assistance without putting through an extra for little things which we are in a position to furnish and do to keep one of these jobs in progress.\n\nI might illustrate just what I mean. We have a number of projects under progress at the present time in different cities. We find ourselves paying through the nose for any small favour we might require. I believe when this job is completed that you and your department will be satisfied, at least it is our desire to try and put this job through on this basis.\n\nHoping that we might be able to do some business with you, we remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSHAW CONSTRUCTION COMPANY.\n\nFES:BG\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Proposed St. Clair School.\n\nMr. Shaw, building contractor of Sarnia, who has offered to erect the above-mentioned school states that he is now engaged in constructing a $200,000.00 addition for Imperial Oil in this city. They are temporarily held up for lack of steel on the project with the result that most of Mr. Shaw's equipment, men and materials are available for other construction such as our school. This means that the erecting of the St. Clair School could be completed in short order if Mr. Shaw's tender is accepted.\n\nI thought I should advise the Department regarding the above so that it might be taken into consideration.\n\nM.

He definitely refuses to proceed on a contract basis. The $24,000.00 figure mentioned in his letter of August 16th was an estimate only. He points out that the cost might go as high as $30,000.00 or be as low as $20,000.00. In these uncertain times prices change from day to day and he is therefore not prepared to take a contract. If he were to do so he would be obliged to quote a figure of $30,000.00 which is, of course, too high.\n\nIn my letter of August 16th I informed you that Mr. Shaw would proceed on a cost plus 15% basis and that the 15% would include the foremen's wages and supervision of construction. I regret to inform you that Mr. Shaw has now changed his mind. The only basis on which he is willing to proceed is cost plus 15% which does not include supervision of construction or wages of the foremen.\n\nI might add that this contractor still thinks he can procure sufficient lumber for the school and he suggests that it be built of lumber rather than cinder block or brick.\n\nI trust that the above is the information which Mr. Phelan requires.\n\nM.

This amount is available in Vote 182, Indian Affairs Branch of the Department of Mines and Resources.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nMinister of Mines and Resources.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Date]\nOttawa, September 7, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: St. Clair Indian Day School,\nSarnia Indian Agency,\nElectoral District of Lambton West\n\nAt the present time we have a one-room school on this reserve, which will accommodate approximately forty pupils. In view of the closing of the Mount Elgin Residential School, a number of children from the St. Clair Reserve who formerly attended that school are now living on the reserve. Enquiries show that within the last two years an additional number of pupils have reached school age. The Indian Agent informs us that school accommodation is urgently required for approximately ninety pupils.\n\nThe present building is in poor condition and is not sufficiently large to accommodate the number mentioned above. In the current year's appropriation we provided funds for the erection of a one-room school, but in view of the number of children and the prospects of an increased number in 1947-48, it is considered that a two-room school is absolutely essential. However, due to present conditions, we have not been able to arrange for the erection of other schools provided in this year's appropriation, and consequently funds are available for the erection of the two-room school on the St. Clair Reserve.\n\nI sent the Chief of the Training Division on two occasions during the past four or five weeks in an endeavour to ascertain if the school could be erected by day labour. After making extensive enquiries, both Mr. Phelan and Indian Agent McCracken advised me that owing to present conditions it\nis not possible to proceed by day labour and that only one firm in Sarnia was willing to consider the erection of the building. We received a letter from the Shaw Construction Company, dated August 16, which I enclose. It might be inferred from that letter that the company was prepared to erect the school for an amount of $24,000.00. However, to make certain, we phoned to the Indian Agent and requested him to interview the Shaw Construction Company in order to obtain a firm quotation.\n\nMr. McCracken has written under date of September 4 and, for your information, I enclose a copy of this letter.\n\nIn the opinion of our officials, with which I concur, the immediate erection of a two-room school on the St. Clair Reserve is urgently required, and, as the Shaw Construction Company evidently have the materials available and can proceed with the work at once, I enclose Memorandum to Council, which I hope will receive the favourable consideration of the Acting Minister.\n\nDirector.\n\nEnc.\nCertified to be a true copy of a Minute of a Meeting of the Committee of the Privy Council, approved by His Excellency the Governor General on the 12 SEPTEMBER 1946.\n\nThe Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a report, dated 7th September, 1946, from the Acting Minister of Mines and Resources, representing:\n\nThat there are approximately ninety Indian children on the St. Clair Reserve for whom educational facilities are not available;\n\nThat under Vote 182 of the 1946-47 Estimates, Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, funds are available for the erection of a two-room school on the St. Clair Reserve, in the Sarnia Indian Agency, Province of Ontario;\n\nThat the Shaw Construction Company, of Sarnia, Ontario, is prepared to erect this building on the basis of cost plus fifteen per cent;\n\nThat the Shaw Construction Company estimates that the total expenditure will vary between twenty and thirty thousand dollars; and\n\nThat the Shaw Construction Company is in a favourable position to furnish materials, equipment and labour and that this company is prepared to proceed at once with the construction of the building and have it completed as quickly as possible.\n\nThe Committee, therefore, on the recommendation of the Acting Minister of Mines and Resources, advise that authority be granted to engage the Shaw Construction Company to erect a two-room school on the understanding that the total expenditure will not exceed thirty thousand dollars, for which funds are available in Vote 182, Indian Affairs Branch of the Department of Mines and Resources.\n\n[Signature]\n\nClerk of the Privy Council.\n\nThe Honourable\nthe Minister of Mines and Resources.\nOttawa, 19 September 1946.\n\nMr. M. W. McCracken, Indian Agent,\nSARNIA, Ontario.\n\nAs you were informed by telephone, an Order-in-Council has been secured authorizing us to engage the Shaw Construction Company of Sarnia to erect a 2-room School on the St. Clair Reserve on the basis of cost plus 15 per cent. It is understood from your letter of September 4th that the total cost will vary between $20,000 and $30,000.\n\nWe also understood from your letter of the 4th instant, that the Shaw Construction Company was prepared to begin work immediately and it is hoped that they will be able to do so. Accounts covering the cost of the materials and also receipted pay lists should be forwarded to this office as the work progresses. Please let us know when the construction of this building will commence.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter 29-1-5 (W.T. 1) of September 19th regarding the erection of a new St. Clair School by Shaw Construction Company.\n\nI contacted Mr. Shaw and handed him the plans for the building. At the moment he cannot state the exact date upon which construction will commence as this will depend on how soon he can get materials. He is now engaged in lining up materials and when all or a major portion of same are on the site he will proceed. There is a possibility that he can get most of the materials in Sarnia but if not he believes he can get them in London or Ridgetown.\n\nMr. Shaw requested me to inform you that he expects to be able to begin actual construction in about one week.\n\nM.

They state that they have been fairly successful in lining up the required materials. The foreman on this job and myself intend to stake out the new site for the school this afternoon.\n\nThe above information is being submitted as requested in the final paragraph of your letter of September 19th, 1946.\n\nM.

This phase of the project will be completed within the next few hours.\n\nMr. Shaw also stated that the Laidlaw-Belton Company of Sarnia has promised to supply the required lumber within the course of a few days and it is expected that pouring of cement for the basement will be under way in the very near future.\n\nI shall submit a report at the end of this week regarding any further progress that has been made.\n\nM.

However, repairs have now been completed and Mr. Shaw will be finishing the excavation work the early part of next week. He expects to commence pouring cement for the basement as soon as the excavation work has been finished.\n\nThe furnace which is in the present St. Clair School will not be suitable for the new two-room building. I suggest that an order for one be placed now so that it will be on hand when required. The type and size of furnace which would be most suitable for the new building could be determined by officials of the Department.\n\nM. W.

They also stated that the prospects of securing the necessary materials are encouraging.\n\nM. W. McCracken,\n\nM. W.

Front Street, Sarnia for books and paper supplied for Sr. pupils at St. Clair Indian Day School.\n\nMrs. Shipley was appointed as Sr. teacher in Departmental letter 29-1-1 (W.T.) of October 29th, 1946 and commenced duties on October 21st. She informed me that three books (Junior History of England) and copy paper were urgently required. The Public School Inspector advised her to get these books and paper immediately and she requested me to authorize her to purchase same locally rather than wait several weeks which would result if ordered by requisition through the Department.\n\nIn view of the teacher's and Public School Inspector's recommendation and also taking into consideration the fact that the pupils have already missed so much time through no fault of their own I authorized the purchase.\n\nA requisition will be submitted to the Department when further supplies of this nature are required, but in this instance it was an emergency and I recommend the Department approve of payment of the enclosed voucher.\n\nM.

However, the foreman is practically certain that sufficient materials will be available to enable them to start the footings, etc. on or about November 12th. I pointed out the urgency of commencing this work immediately and I believe the company really intends to do so next week.\n\nM. W. McCracken,\n\nM. W.

The foreman states that the footings for the building will be completed by tonight. The cement for the foundation will be poured next week. He also advises that they have most of the materials which will be required and these have been set aside so that they will be available as the work progresses.\n\nM. W. McCracken\n\nM. W.

The footings have been completed. Forms for the walls are almost finished in preparation for pouring cement next week. The Company appears to be in earnest and there will not likely be any lagging from now on insofar as completion of basement is concerned. The foreman suggested that a night watchman be put on the job and I agreed as theft of materials has occurred on other projects in this area.\n\nI think this building should be wired for electricity. The Shaw Construction Company will arrange to do the wiring as part of their contract if it meets with Departmental approval. I think we should let the Company attend to the wiring as they have access to materials. If we did the wiring independently it would be difficult to get materials as they are very scarce.\n\nPlease advise in the event that the above suggestions re wiring and night watchman do not meet with your approval.\n\nM. W. McCracken\n\nM. W. McCracken,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 26 November 1946.\n\nMr. M.W.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: New School, Sarnia Reserve, Your File 29-1-5 (W.T.I).\n\nThe forms for the walls have been practically completed and the company states that the pouring of cement will be commenced next Tuesday, December 3rd.\n\nThe foreman advises me that a few changes relative to water system, drainage, septic tank, etc. will have to be made as the plans which we are using were for a school in a different locality and in some respects are not suitable for this particular job. We intend to have a water pressure system in the school in accordance with the plans but the foreman is of the opinion that installing water facilities in the basement is not feasible. I have an appointment with the foreman on Monday, December 2nd at which time changes of the above nature will be discussed and if any major deviation from the plan is necessary I shall write for Departmental instructions.\n\nM. W. McCracken,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: New School, Sarnia Reserve, Your File 29-1-5 (W.T.I).\n\nThe plans for the new school show the girls' and boys' toilets to be in the basement with chemical tanks for waste being underneath the floor. These tanks would be cleaned out on either side of the main entrance at the front.\n\nIn the opinion of the contractor this arrangement would not be very satisfactory due to the nature of the site which is flat and affords little opportunity for proper drainage. He states that these containers would, in all probability, be inadequate as well as unsanitary.\n\nSome time ago a water pressure line to serve buildings such as the new Council Hall and Mission House was installed. This line traverses the school property and a hook up to serve the school is possible. The water is supplied by Sarnia Township. The line was laid under authority of Departmental letter 31029-1 of October 11th, 1945.\n\nThe contractor suggests that flush toilets and a septic tank be installed instead of the arrangement as shown in the plans. If this is done he thinks that the girls' and boys' toilets should be placed in the cloakrooms on the first floor rather than in the basement as this would provide additional elevation. The spaces in the basement originally intended for washrooms could be used as cloakrooms.\n\nKindly advise at the earliest possible date as to whether the Department approves of the contractor's suggestions or not. In my opinion they sound logical and I recommend that we take his advice.\n\nAn immediate reply would be appreciated as the cement for the walls was poured and the contractor will be starting on the basement floor in the near future. As the chemical tanks shown on the plan are under the basement floor it is imperative that we decide what system is to be installed.\n\nM. W. McCracken,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 9 December 1946.\n\nMr. M.W. McCracken, Indian Agent,\nSARNIA, Ontario.\n\nWe have your letter of the 4th instant regarding the erection of the new school on the St. Clair Reserve.\n\nWe wish to confirm our telephone conversation of Nov. 7th authorizing the installation of flush toilets and a septic tank. It is noted that the toilets will be placed on the ground floor and that the cloakrooms will be placed in the basement.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: New School, Sarnia Reserve, Your File 29-1-5 (W.T.I.).\n\nSatisfactory progress is being made on the erection of this building. The foreman reports that the laying of the sub floor and installing windows in the basement has been commenced. He expects the basement will be completed by the end of next week and is optimistic re procuring materials as and when required. He does not anticipate any delay for lack of supplies.\n\nThe plans call for cedar shingles for the roof but the foreman recommends using asphalt shingles which are fireproof and more generally used in this locality. He states that asphalt will be a little more expensive. He wanted an immediate decision re this to enable him to place the order so I authorized him to use asphalt shingles and trust this meets with Departmental approval.\n\nThe contractor is submitting a statement of cost re the basement and requests that 75 or 80% of it be paid at this time. I shall forward the statement when received.\n\nM. W. McCracken,\n\nM. W. McCracken,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 20 December 1946.\n\nMr. M.W.

The contractor seems to be able to get materials when required and I do not anticipate any long delay waiting for supplies. I think we were fortunate and wise in engaging a large concern such as the Shaw Construction Company as they have access to materials.\n\nOn the plan no provision was made for insulation. The foreman strongly recommends that the building be insulated. The total cost of material and labour for insulating the walls and ceiling would be $400.00. In four or five years the insulating would pay for itself and I think it should be done. Kindly advise as to whether the Department approves of insulation or not by return mail.\n\nIn my letter of October 19th, 1946 I suggested that an order be placed for a suitable furnace. In this connection I think a stoker-equipped heating unit would be most satisfactory. I trust that the ordering of the furnace is receiving Departmental attention.\n\nM. W.

Today the contractor requested information as to what action had been taken in this regard. He states that they will soon be ready to instal air ducts which should be done as the carpentry progresses. Until the type and size of furnace is known no definite plans for the ducts can be made. The contractor thinks it would be more suitable if the order for the furnace were placed with a local concern who would then be able to instal the furnace in conjunction with the carpenters. The foreman suggests that a stoker-equipped furnace with thermostatic control be installed. Would you kindly advise within the next few days as to what should be done regarding the above. At present the work is not delayed, but it will be if definite information as to the furnace is not obtained in the near future. In my opinion it would be more suitable to everyone concerned if authority were granted to purchase the furnace locally leaving the type and size up to the contractor.\n\nM. W.

They consider that this building should be insured at once and I authorized them to take out an adequate policy. I presume that the Company will include the cost of the insurance on our account. If this arrangement is not satisfactory please advise. I understand that the policy will cover any loss by fire up to the time the building is completed and turned over to us.\n\nM. W.

We are preparing this and it will be taken to Sarnia by Mr. Doucet of this Division who expects to visit you about Jan. 22 or 23. He will wire you from London and it would be appreciated if you would reserve a room for him at the Colonial Hotel.\n\n(2) Your letter Dec. 31. - The Department approves insulating the walls and ceiling at a cost of $400.00 for material and labour.\n\n(3) Your letter Jan. 6. - As we will probably be obliged to employ an Indian as janitor on a part-time basis, we doubt the advisability of installing a stoker as extreme care has to be exercised so that the stoker will operate efficiently. However, you should consult the contractor and have him obtain prices on an ordinary furnace and also on a furnace with stoker attached. These prices should be submitted to us for our consideration.\n\n(4) Your letter Jan. 4. - The Department approves the action that you have taken in approving the placing of fire insurance on the building while it is under construction. The insurance policy should be made payable as the interests of the Contractor and His Majesty may respectively appear and the original insurance policy together with certified copies thereof should be forwarded to this office.\nMr. M.W. McCracken, Indian Agent - 2  \n10 January 1947.\n\nThe Contractor shall maintain such insurance as will protect him from claims under Workmen's Compensation Acts and from any other claims for damages for personal injury, including death, which may arise from his operations under the contract. Certificates of such insurance shall be forwarded to this office and shall be subject to our approval as to adequacy of protection; and the Contractor shall indemnify and save harmless His Majesty from and against all claims and demands, loss, costs, damages, actions, suits or other proceedings by whomsoever made, brought or prosecuted in any manner based upon, occasioned by, or attributable to any such death, or injury, or any damage to, or infringement of, any property or right.\n\nBernard F.

McCracken,\nIndian Agent,\nSARNIA, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Doucet:\n\nAttached are duplicate copies of the contract which should be signed by Shaw Construction Company and returned to Ottawa for the signature of our officials.\n\nWe have delayed forwarding this to you due to the fact that we were awaiting a wage schedule from the Labour Dept. We hope to have this either tonight or tomorrow morning and will forward it to you immediately. It is quite likely that the wages actually being paid are higher than what will show on the scale.\n\nOf course it is understood that the blank spaces will be filled in as required.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard F.

At that time the Company proposed that the original cost plus fifteen per cent basis be changed to a contract for $25,400.00. Since Mr. Touret's visit we have had no indication as to whether the Department will approve of a contract but in any event the Shaw Construction Company are entitled to payment. They require some money almost immediately and I strongly recommend that arrangements be made to pay the $13,760.32 covered by my vouchers nos. 330 and 56.\n\nWith regard to progress at the school I would advise that ninety-five per cent of the electric wiring has been completed. To date nothing has been done regarding installation of the heating unit. The brick chimney has been erected and gyproc has been placed on the upper story. They are now engaged in putting gyproc on the walls and ceiling in the basement. Insulating has been completed. Generally speaking good progress is being made and it is now estimated that the building should be completed in about six weeks.\n\nM. W.

A. Hoey, Esq.,\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAn Order in Council of September 12th, 1946, (P.C. 3849) grants authority to engage the Shaw Construction Company of Sarnia, Ontario, to erect a two-room school on the St. Clair Reserve, in the Sarnia Indian Agency, on the understanding that the total expenditure will not exceed $30,000.\n\nI understand that it is now proposed to vary the basis of contract from that of a cost plus fifteen per cent. basis, as originally agreed upon, to that of a firm price of $25,400.\n\nAs you are aware, an Order in Council dated February 23rd, 1926, passed under the authority of Sec. 35 of the Public Works Act, transfers to Indian Affairs the power, duty and function of erecting and maintaining buildings required in the service of that branch. It is obvious that in the exercise of this power the Indian Affairs Branch is required to have due regard to all provisions of the Public Works Act which condition such functions.\n\nAn examination of the file relating to the above-mentioned undertaking discloses that certain provisions of the Public Works Act were not observed. The following are instances:\n\n(a) Sec. 36 of the said Act provides that tenders shall be invited by public advertisement except under certain conditions, none of which would appear to apply in this case. There is no evidence that this was done.\n(b) Sec. 17 provides that no work shall be commenced until a contract has been signed by all parties and the requisite security has been given. At the date of our examination of the fyle, no contract had been signed, nor security provided.\n\nI might observe, too, that the necessary steps to ensure payments for work done also appear to have been neglected as no encumbrance has been raised by your Branch.\n\nAs, from the instances cited, the whole procedure in the prosecution of this undertaking would appear to be somewhat irregular, I would appreciate an explanation from you as to why it was considered necessary to depart from standard practice in this particular case.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. G. Hamlyn,\nAudit Supervisor, \"H\" Branch.\nIRA468 COLLECT=SARNIA ONT 19 938A\nCOLONEL B F NEARY, SUPT=\nWELFARE AND TRAINING INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH OTTAWA=\nSHAW CONSTRUCTION CO HAS NO OFFICIAL SEAL=\nM W MCCRACKEN INDIAN AGENT.\n\nFEB 19 1947\n\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nRegistered\nOttawa, February 21st, 1947.\n\nMr. M.W.

This can be done through your office by registered mail. This security will receive interest while deposited here. This security can be either a certificated cheque for the amount, a deposit receipt or in Dominion Bonds.\n\n(2) The claim must be supported by two copies of all pay lists, vouchers and invoices making up the amount.\n\n(3) It will be necessary for you to prepare a certificate that the work has been performed.\n\nUpon receipt of such certificate and the other documents described above, we are prepared to allow advances on this construction.\n\nWe will make every effort to forward these\nadvance as soon as possible in order that the construction company will suffer no inconvenience.\n\nIt is suggested that 80% of the claim be allowed.\n\nDirector.\nSarnia, February 24th, 1947.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nI wish to refer to your letter 29-1-5 (WT 1) of February 21st, 1947 enclosing duplicate copies of the Agreement regarding erection of the St. Clair School.\n\nThese Agreements have been signed by the Shaw Construction Company and are returned herewith as requested.\n\nM.

In this instance it will not be necessary for the Shaw Construction Company to make a security deposit. It will be necessary of course for a cost accountant to verify the accounts, invoices, payrolls, etc., as detailed in the terms of the contract.\n\nIt is understood from Mr. Sones that this building will be nearing completion at an early date, so that, if you concur, arrangements will be made with our Chief Treasury Officer to have a cost accountant sent down to Sarnia to begin work by March 10 and that the conclusion of his duties will coincide with the completion and turnover of the building. If there is any possibility that the completion of the building will be delayed, you should so inform the Department so that the arrival of the cost accountant can be accordingly postponed.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector\nOttawa, March 1, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. W.

If it arrives the installation should not take more than three days. Most of the pipes for plumbing have been installed but wash basins and toilets have not arrived.\n\n(2) Painting both interior and exterior. The exterior cannot be painted till warm weather, possibly six weeks hence, but the company intends to proceed with the interior painting immediately. The tenders which they received re the painting were considered far too high ($1450.00) and the company is endeavouring to secure other tenders as they think not more than $850.00 or $900.00 should be paid for this work.\n\n(3) A drain has to be dug from the basement to the open ditch on the road. This can be done immediately with a compressor, etc., but at greater cost than if it were done at a later date when the frost is out of the ground.\n\n(4) A small portion (about 250 sq. ft.) of flooring remains to be purchased and laid. The company foreman states that this will be completed this week. There is also a small amount of sheet rock to be installed on walls in the basement but this will be completed by the end of the week.\n\n(5) The placing of insul brick siding on the outside. This siding material is on the site and workmen would have started putting it on this morning had the weather been favourable. The company expect it will be completed by the end of the present week.\n\n(6) The blackboards cannot be installed until same are received from the Department. (These were ordered on my requisition of February 3rd, 1947).\n\nThe company would like you to send a cost accountant on Monday, March 10th although they readily admit that all work at this school cannot be completed at the same time as the accountant finishes his audit. However they suggest that a reasonable sum be withheld to cover any work not completed at the time of the audit. If the sending of the cost accountant is postponed until all phases of the work have been completed it will definitely not meet with the company's approval.\nas they want a substantial progress payment immediately and in this connection I do not think their request unreasonable.\n\nI might add that I will be on vacation from March 10th to March 22nd but I do not expect to leave the city for a few days and I will be available if my services are required by either the accountant or the company.\n\nAfter reading this report I would appreciate immediate advice as to your decision re sending the accountant. Also please advise if you wish me to reserve hotel accommodation for him.\n\nM. W. McCracken,\nIndian Agent.\n\nDiscussed with Mr. Beach 5 Mar 46. Cost Accountant will proceed to Sania as planned and will present figures on return. Then we will have to approach Comptroller of Treasury to ascertain if he will make payment withholding $3,000 or more for final payment.\n375 Wellington St.,\nOttawa, Ontario,\n5th March, 1947.\n\nShaw Construction Co.,\nP.O.

Fryer,\nDistrict Supervisor,\nCost Inspection & Audit Division,\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Treasury,\nRoom 1214, New Wellington Building,\n137 Wellington Street W.,\nToronto, Ontario.\n\nHe will be in contact with you shortly for the purpose of advising you in detail as to the procedures to be followed by you in accounting and billing for your costs. In the meantime, we give you the following broad outline of essential requirements:\n\nBillings\n\nRecovery of your expenditures will be made by means of a \"Progress Certificate\", and supporting documents, as per the attached samples. The number of copies required with each submission are as follows:\nBillings cont'd.\n\n5 copies of the Progress Claim form 1064\n5 copies of Summary of Charges\n1 copy of all Payrolls, Suppliers' Invoices and Vouchers\n5 copies of Plant Rental Statement\n3 copies of Statutory Declaration with final claim.\n\nA supply of form 1064 is being forwarded under separate cover.\n\nApprovals\n\nPurchase requisitions and sub-contracts should be approved by the Indian Agent before purchase or award. All sub-contracts will, in addition to the Indian Agent's approval, also require that of the Director of the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nWages and Salaries\n\nApproval will also be required of both the above parties of all wage and salary rates as prevail, or as set, for the particular area in which the construction is being done.\n\nIt is our understanding that this work was undertaken when the Regional War Labour Board was functioning and all matters pertaining to wages and salaries paid the rank of foreman, or under, came under their jurisdiction as to remuneration that was to be paid in the various districts or localities throughout the Dominion; therefore, any payments in excess of rates as established by the Board would of necessity require their further approval.\n\nTravelling Expenses\n\nSuch claims listing hotel, railway sleeper or parlor car service, should be properly supported by receipts. Expense accounts should show the date of travelling and breakdown of individual meals, viz: breakfast, lunch and dinner. Car mileage or living allowances will also require formal approval of the Indian Agent and the Director of the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nPlant Rental\n\nApplication for approval is required for all plant rental and must also show the name of supplier, description of equipment, rental rate, and whether or not the operator's wages, fuel, and\nRunning repairs are included in the rental rate. In the case of contractor-owned equipment, make, size or capacity, and its replacement value must also be stated. Such applications for approval will require approval of both parties previously mentioned.\n\nWe might state that all applications for approvals should be submitted in five copies through the Indian Agent.\n\nInventories\n\nUpon completion of the contract, an inventory in five copies is required of all surplus materials, small tools, etc., at laid down prices. Inventories should indicate the date and the disposition of the items, that is, if they were taken over by your firm, sold to other parties, or left in the possession of the Department of Mines and Resources, Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nThis Division will be only too pleased to offer cooperation and assistance in every way possible. However, your contract, in delegating responsibility, also imposes upon you certain obligations in relation to the work to be done and the manner of doing it. Your compliance with the foregoing suggestions will result in your progress claims being paid promptly and without difficulty. Please feel free to consult us or our representative at all times.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nChief, Construction & Prefinanced Section.\nOttawa, March 6, 1947.\n\nMr. M. W. McCracken,\nIndian Agent, Sarnia, Ontario.\n\nConstruction of St. Clair School\n\nReference - your 225-15 of March 3\n\nThe contents of your letter have been discussed with our Chief Treasury Officer. As previously planned, a Cost Accountant will proceed to Sarnia and will probably be phoning you concerning hotel reservations.\n\nAttached for your information is a copy of a letter from the Chief, Construction & Prefinanced Section, to the Shaw Construction Company. You will note that approvals of sub-contracts are required from you.\n\nSub-contracts also require the approval of the Director of the Indian Affairs Branch. If you will forward details of these sub-contracts, this approval can be arranged.\n\nBernard F.

Upon such notice being given, the Contractor shall cease work (including the procuring of materials for the fulfilment of the contract) in accordance with and to the extent specified in such notice but shall proceed with all reasonable speed to complete such part or parts (if any) of the work or works as are by the terms of such notice to be completed and shall also proceed with all reasonable speed to complete up to such time and/or stage as may be specified in the notice any part or parts of the work or works as required by such notice.

LTD.\n\nShipping Dept.\n\nEJM/r\nOttawa, April 10th, 1947.\n\nMr. M.W. McCracken, Indian Agent,\nSarnia, Ontario.\n\nWe are advised by the Globe Furniture Company that desks, kindergarten tables and chairs for the Saint Clair School were shipped on the first instant. The Firm also state that they sent the account to you.\n\nAs soon as the desks arrive, please certify the account and forward it immediately as funds were provided in the 1946-47 appropriation and we can pay the account if we receive it within the next week.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter 29-1-5 (WT 1) of April 10th making enquiries regarding the desks, tables and chairs to be supplied by the Globe Furniture Company for St. Clair School.\n\nPlease be advised that the account from the Globe Furniture Company was received several days ago and I was waiting for advice from the C.N.R. Freight as to the arrival of the shipment. Upon receipt of your letter this morning I telephoned and found out that the shipment arrived at the freight sheds in Sarnia two or three days ago. They will be delivered to the school by the railway some time next week and until this is done I cannot actually check the shipment. However, I shall do so at the earliest possible date and if there are any shortages I will notify you and I feel sure any necessary adjustments could be made. I am therefore certifying this account so that it may be paid from funds provided in the 1946-47 appropriation. Voucher #152 in this connection is enclosed.\n\nM. W. McCracken,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Construction of St. Clair School,\nDepartmental file 29-1-5.\n\nWith reference to cost accountant auditing records of Shaw Construction Company I would advise that Mr. J. Turley from Treasury Branch, Toronto commenced the audit on April 9th and completed same as far as was possible on April 12th.\n\nMr. Turley gave detailed instructions to the Company with regard to preparation of statement of claim, approval of subcontractors, etc. The Company is now assembling these documents and will be forwarding them to me for examination and approval after which I shall send same to the Department for final approval.\n\nThe cost accountant is returning to Sarnia on April 21st to complete audit of expenditures up to March 31st and the Company expect their claim up to March 31st will then be paid. When all work has been completed a further claim will be submitted. I might mention that Mr. Turley was very co-operative with this office and the Shaw Construction Company.\n\nThe furnace is expected daily but to date it has not arrived. The septic tank has not been installed and the small drain from the school to the road remains to be dug. Interior painting is nearly finished, but exterior painting cannot be done until the weather is more favourable. Blackboards ordered on my requisition of February 3rd, 1947 have not arrived and it might be advisable to make some inquiry to ascertain if the order is being filled. Minor work such as levelling or grounds, etc. will have to be done when conditions permit.\n\nI suggest that an official from the Training Branch arrange to come to Sarnia when the school is being turned over to us. At that time various details regarding equipment for the manual training and domestic science rooms could be dealt with. Actual teaching of vocational training might be delayed until September to enable us to order and install the necessary equipment.\n\nM. W. McCracken,\nIndian Agent.\n| QUANTITY | DESCRIPTION                                                                 | UNIT | TOTAL   |\n|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|---------|\n| 12       | single portable chair desks, red, size #8, equivalent of Globe #3565, birch, brown finish | 15.68 | 199.60  |\n| 8        | Kindergarten tables, top scored in 1\" squares - Globe No.3466 or equal - size 30\"x35\"x30\" high, birch - finished natural color | 7.75  | 62.00   |\n| 8        | Kindergarten chairs, 18\" Globe No.3016 or equal, birch - finished golden color | 8.65  | 73.00   |\n\n**TOTAL:** $334.60\n\n**NOTE:** CERTIFIED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 23 OF THE CONSOLIDATED REVENUE AND AUDIT ACT 1921.\n\n**TO BE RETURNED TO HEAD OF BRANCH**\n\n**PURCHASING AGENT**\n\n**DELIVERY REQUIRED BY**\n\n**AS SOON AS POSSIBLE**\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**TREASURY ONLY**\n\n| Date | Service                                                                 | Amount |\n|------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Apr 1 | To payment for chair desks, kindergarten tables and chairs for use in the new St. Clair Indian Day School on the Sarnia Indian Reserve, as per attached account. | 222.00 |\n\n**AUDITED FOR PAYMENT**\n\n**APR 18 1947**\n\n**Treasury Office**\n\n**I.

This sub-contract was overlooked by the company when previous ones were forwarded under date of my letter of April 19th. It is submitted herewith for Departmental approval and signature. The auditor states that the original and three copies of sub-contract No. 10 should be returned to this office and the remaining copy is for Departmental file. In this connection I am returning one copy of sub-contracts Nos. 1 to 9 inclusive also for Departmental file.\n\nThe audit was completed at 4 p.m. today and Mr. Turley, the auditor, is forwarding the claim direct from his office in Toronto to our Department at Ottawa. He assured me that it would be received by our Treasury in Ottawa on Saturday, April 26th. The claim which amounts to about $26,000.00 represents expenditures up to March 31st, 1947. Since then further work has been performed and the Shaw Company will be submitting an additional claim at a later date.\n\nSome painting, installation of the furnace, septic tank, eavestroughing, gravel fill and levelling of the site still must be completed and it is expected that practically all of the $30,000.00 will be required to complete the building. The date when it will be finished is still in doubt as the furnace has not arrived and it may be three or four weeks until the building is actually ready for use.\n\nM. W.

The furnace arrived and has been installed.\n\nI regret to report that when the furnace was lighted one of the pipes leading to the teachers' room became overheated with the result that the building caught fire. Fortunately the fire appeared when workmen were present and it was extinguished. About $100.00 worth of damage was done, but this is covered by insurance and is being repaired.

This has been on order for some time. Shaw Construction Company has now decided to have this fitting made locally in Sarnia to avoid further delay. It will cost $25.00 or $30.00 more but there seems to be no alternative. We expect the fitting will be ready early next week and then the concrete may be poured and septic tank completed within a few days.\n\nEavestroughing has also been ordered but has not arrived. The lock for the main door is on order but date of delivery is indefinite. Levelling of the site and laying of a sidewalk from the front gate to the main entrance still has to be completed but this could be done in short order. Obstacles preventing completion of the building are mainly the lack of the septic tank fitting and hardware.\n\nAll damage which resulted from the fire has been repaired at the expense of the Insurance Company.\n\nThe Shaw Construction Company advise that all of the $30,000.00 will be required to complete the building satisfactorily.\n\nA further report will be submitted with regard to date for final inspection by an official of the Training Branch.\n\nM. W. McCracken,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Construction of St. Clair School,\nYour file 29-1-5.\n\nRecently the Shaw Construction Company informed me that expenditures already made on the new St. Clair School have exceeded $32,000.00. On numerous occasions during the past two or three months I reminded them that under no circumstances should the $30,000.00 be exceeded. When any decision regarding expenditures was necessary I always pointed out to them that such would be in order providing it would not bring the total cost of the building, when completed, over $30,000.00. This company's bookkeeping system leaves much to be desired and the company itself did not know the amount had been exceeded until very recently.\n\nAt the present time the septic tank has been completed and only levelling of the site, erecting flag-pole, building cement steps, and installation of locks in doors remains to be done. The lock for the front door has not yet arrived but a temporary lock is being installed pending delivery of the permanent one. I had intended having eavestroughing and a cement sidewalk from the road to the building but due to the over-expenditure already I do not propose to proceed with these unless approved by the Department.\n\nAs the school is practically completed I suggested to the company that they allow the Sr. teacher and Sr. pupils to commence using one of the classrooms. They readily agreed so the Sr. teacher, Mr. Ball, is going to transfer his books, desks, equipment, etc., and begin teaching a full day as from tomorrow, June 12th. This will leave the old St. Clair School available for the Jr. teacher to teach Jr. pupils a full day also. I have instructed the janitor, Basil Grey, to commence duties at the new school as from today. The Jr. teacher is very eager to move into the new building but I am not authorizing same pending final inspection by an official from the Training Branch.\n\nThe company is now assembling its records and summarizing expenditures so that Mr. Turley, the Treasury Official from Toronto, may come to complete the audit. In my opinion the proposed final inspection by an official of the Training Branch should be delayed until the audit is finished and a further report re this will be submitted.\n\nM. W.

They informed me that they had already written to Mr. Turley in Toronto asking him to come to Sarnia to complete the audit. On Wednesday, July 2nd, Mr. Turley arrived. He found that records of the company were far from complete. This auditor worked from Wednesday till Friday P.M., doing a great deal of work which the company really should have done themselves. He prepared a list of instructions as to what is required to enable him to complete the audit and when the company has complied they are to notify him. Therefore the date of the final audit depends upon the company. The auditor estimates that the $30,000.00 has been exceeded by about $1500.00 or $2000.00.\n\nI think the final inspection by an official of the Treasury Branch could be made at any time convenient to the Department without awaiting the final audit. In my opinion it should be arranged as soon as possible as a number of details such as landscaping, ordering of equipment for manual training and sewing rooms, janitor services, etc. have to be decided. The school is completed as far as actual construction is concerned with the exception of installation of lock on front door and cement step. Delivery of the lock is expected daily.\n\nWould you please advise as to when an official of the Training Branch can come to Sarnia and if you wish me to reserve hotel accommodation I shall do so.\n\nM.

McCracken,\nIndian Agent.\nSarnia, Sept. 24th, 1947.\n\nRe: New St. Clair School\u2014Sarnia Reserve.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI wish to refer to clause (4) in your letter 29-1-5 (W.T. 1) of Jan. 10/47 re fire insurance on the above mentioned building while it was under construction. Under date of January 27th I forwarded original fire insurance policy # 789677 as requested.\n\nThis building was officially turned over to the Department on Sept. 15 and a refund of approximately $34.34 on the policy is forthcoming. Before final adjustment may be made the insurance company must have the original policy to enable them to complete the cancellation document attached thereto.\n\nWould you please return original policy # 789677 to this office so that the cancellation may be completed. The Company wishes me or some one at the Department to sign a release. I intend to sign providing it meets with your approval.\n\nThe refund of $34.34 is being paid by cheque to the Shaw Construction Co. as they paid the premium. The auditor from Toronto who arrived in Sarnia yesterday has assured me that he will make the necessary adjustment regarding the rebate and that it will be deducted from the amount which we still owe the contractor.\n\nM.

The furnace became very hot and it looked as though there was great danger of fire. Sniers Sheet Metal who installed the furnace were called to repair it but could find nothing wrong. Their repair man believed that the trouble was somewhere in the electric wiring. It was necessary for me to have Chambers Electric Company come to the school but after two hours inspection work they could not locate the trouble. While the furnace and electric people were at the school the fan started up voluntarily and has been working more or less satisfactorily since that time.\n\nThere is a great deal of electric wiring and many fuse and switch boxes in the St. Clair School and teachers' residence. Occasionally some of the cartridge fuses or small fuse plugs blow out so I purchased a number of these so that they would be available when trouble arose.\n\nPayment of these two accounts from Chambers Electric Company is recommended.\n\nM.

Williams, c/o Indian Office, Sarnia, Ontario in payment for repair work performed at the new St. Clair Indian Day School on Sarnia Reserve.\n\nThere is a large open drain along the roadside in front of the school. The wooden foot bridge which had been built many years ago was completely rotten and had been repaired on numerous occasions. When the new St. Clair School was being built I suggested to the Shaw Construction Company that they erect a new bridge across this drain but when we found that the estimate had been exceeded this work was not performed. Early in the Fall it became very urgent that the bridge be repaired and I authorized James R. Williams, an Indian carpenter of the Sarnia Band, to supply materials and do necessary labour in replacing it. Some materials for the bridge were procured from Belton Lumber Company and have already been submitted to the Department for payment. Mr. Williams supplied two pine stringers 8\" x 8\" x 14' for which he is charging $4.00 each. The labour amounted to $12.00 at $1.00 per hour. We now have a safe, substantial foot bridge in front of the school.\n\nOn or about October 20th, 1947 the third classroom was opened in the domestic science room in the new St. Clair School. The walls in this room are of cement and it was a difficult and tedious job to install blackboards for the junior teacher who is using this room. Two large slate blackboards were placed on the cement wall at the front of the room and one fibre blackboard was fastened to the side wall. A number of holes had to be drilled by hand through the cement to hold the boards securely. Mr. Williams did this work. While there the teacher requested him to repair some book cases.\n\nInspector H. B. Galpin made an unofficial visit to this school in December and seemed quite disappointed that there were no sand tables.\nin the junior and intermediate rooms. The teachers were very anxious to have the sand tables so I authorized Mr. Williams to build one for each room. He supplied all the materials and labour and each table cost $6.00.\n\nWhen Colonel Neary visited this school in October he suggested that I hire an Indian to place loose desks in the junior room on wooden runners. Mr. Williams did this work. When Mr. Doucet visited St. Clair School in December he verbally authorized me to place a Yale lock on the furnace room door of the school so that children could not tamper with the furnace, switches, etc. James B. Williams installed this lock during the Christmas holiday.\n\nThis $64.00 account is possibly a trifle excessive but it is very difficult to persuade any competent Indian to do this type of work at the present time. Mr. Williams' work is quite satisfactory and I recommend that his account be approved by the Department.\n\nM. W. McCracken\n\nM. W.

Apparently much of the fault lies in the fact that inexperienced janitors have been operating the furnace with the result that it becomes overheated and the fan, which is operated by a motor, refuses to work. I have had electricians and the furnace repair men inspect the entire system with a view to locating the trouble. Recently I had occasion to go to the school late one Sunday night and found that the pulley and belt connecting the motor to the fan had flown off. It was urgent that repairs be made so I called Spiers Sheet Metals as they installed the system originally. They point out that a very dangerous condition with respect to fire exists at this school due to inexperienced firing. This company is of the opinion that someone tampered with the motor and fan with the result that it had to be overhauled.\n\nNo doubt you are aware that I have had great difficulty in procuring a janitor for this school as no Indian is anxious for the job. I have a new night lock on the furnace room door so that children and unauthorized persons cannot gain entry and am hoping that the furnace will operate satisfactorily in future. I am not optimistic in this respect as I do not believe any Indian on the Reserve understands the forced draft system of heating. I believe the electricians once again checked the wiring and connections but to date their account has not been received. It will be forwarded at a later date.\n\nI recommend Departmental approval and payment of the enclosed account.\n\nM. W.

The fire was evidently caused by an overheated furnace and failure of the forced draft system to operate efficiently.\n\nEarly in May of 1947 a fire occurred in this building when it was still under construction. At that time two painters were painting the interior of the building and had started a fire in the furnace to help dry the paint. Apparently an area where the hot air pipes pass through the partitions directly above the furnace caught fire and $200.00 damage was done before the two painters put the fire out.\n\nAs a result of the above-mentioned fire I had Spiers Sheet Metal of Sarnia check the furnace for defects. I also insisted that one of their men be present when the caretaker started the first fire in the furnace in the Fall. At that time the controls, etc., on the furnace were fully explained to the Indian caretaker, S. F. Rogers. On a few occasions from September to November 18th the classrooms were cold due mostly to inexperienced firing of the furnace by two of the Indian caretaker's boys and the pupils had to be sent home. During this time minor repairs to the furnace and adjustments to the electric motor, fan and controls were performed by Spiers Sheet Metal Company of Sarnia and Chambers Electric Company, also of Sarnia as these were the two companies who had made the original heating and electrical installations. On November 18th Rogers became peevved and resigned as caretaker and Mrs. Basil Gray was appointed. In December and January the classrooms were sometimes too cold to hold classes and the children had to be sent home.\n\nThere appeared to be some defect in either the furnace or its electrical connections as on several occasions when a hot fire was put...\non the motor and fan would cease to operate. The teachers would detect an odour of scorched wood and paint and would immediately close drafts etc. When the furnace cooled down the fan would commence normal operation. In December and January Spiers Sheet Metal and Chambers Electric inspected the entire system but they could find nothing wrong. Spiers Sheet Metal and myself suspected that children and unauthorized persons might be tampering with the motor and fan. I mentioned this to Mr. Doucet when he visited St. Clair School on December 10th and he instructed me to install a Yale lock on the furnace room door. This was done in the Christmas holiday period by James R. Williams. The caretaker, Basil Gray, the school principal, Mrs. Williamson and the Intermediate teacher, Mrs. McBracken were given keys to the furnace room. One Sunday night in January I had occasion to go to the school and on inspecting the furnace I found that the belt and pulley on the fan had fallen off. I tried to make emergency repairs and on Monday morning I again had Spiers Sheet Metal Company perform the necessary repairs which entailed a thorough overhauling of the entire heating unit.\n\nOn Monday morning, January 26th, 1948 the Intermediate teacher entered her room at 8:45 A.M. and found the temperature to be 38\u00b0 in her classroom. She and the other two teachers kept the children till 10:30 A.M., but as the temperature had risen to only 42\u00b0 in one and one-half hours I instructed that the children were to be sent home. At 11:00 A.M. I went to the school. All pupils had gone. I looked at the furnace and a normal fire was burning in the furnace and the fan was operating. I found the bottom draft open about one-quarter of an inch so I closed it and left the school. That afternoon I went to Petrolia re an Indian patient in a nursing home there and then continued on to London to ascertain if a teacher whom I knew there would accept a teaching position in the senior room of St. Clair School. At approximately 11:00 P.M. I arrived home to find the school had burned.\n\nThe caretaker stated that about 11:30 A.M. after the children had been sent home she visited the school and put more coal on the furnace, being slightly embarrassed about the rooms being cold. No doubt she opened the drafts at that time, although she denies doing so. In all probability the furnace became overheated and likely the fan ceased operating. Thus the heat was confined, resulting in the gyproc and partitions directly above catching on fire. There was faulty construction and installation as less than eighteen inches existed between the top of the furnace and the gyproc ceiling and walls. At 2:40 P.M. Basil Gray went to the school to tend the furnace and found the school full of smoke which prevented him from entering. He immediately telephoned the fire department in Sarnia as well as Blue...\nWater, Polymer and Dow Chemical requesting fire-fighting equipment. The efforts of all of these were to no avail, although they did succeed in saving the teachers' residence which is only a few feet to the rear of the school. Only thirty desks and a few miscellaneous items of school equipment were saved. With the exception of the cement foundation the school is a total loss. Practically all of the credit for saving the residence should go to the Blue Water volunteer brigade. I think they should be reimbursed for their chemicals, coats, rubber boots, etc., used or damaged in the fire and believe Sarnia Indian Council is willing to pay for same from their Band funds.\n\nIn my opinion it was very fortunate that the pupils had been sent home as the fire may have gone unnoticed by teachers and some pupils might have been burned to death. If the pupils and teachers had been there they might have detected the overheated furnace as they had on several occasions in the past, but with inexperienced firing and lack of attention on the part of the janitor a disaster would likely have occurred sooner or later. In any case it was undesirable from the standpoint of health to keep pupils inactive in a room 38\u00b0 to 42\u00b0 and there was no alternative except to send them home.\n\nI am enclosing picture and clipping taken from the local Sarnia paper in connection with the fire.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, January 27th I telephoned the Ontario Provincial Fire Marshall's office in Toronto and requested an investigation as instructed in Departmental telegram. Mr. R. Simmons from the Fire Marshall's office arrived Wednesday morning and conducted an investigation. His report will be forwarded direct to the Indian Affairs Branch at Ottawa.\n\nThe loss of this modern, completely equipped four-room school is deeply regretted by myself, teachers, Indian parents and children of Sarnia Reserve. I might mention that our agitating friends, led by Rev. McKenzie and Telford Adams, are doing a great deal of underhand gossiping and have convinced many Indians that the loss of the school was due to the Indian Agent's neglect in not correcting the fire hazard at the school. They also accuse Mrs. McCracken of sending the children home so she could have a holiday. This is very unreasonable as Rev. McKenzie's daughter is one of the teachers and she definitely complained about the cold classrooms and was as ready to go home as anyone else. When Rev. McKenzie visited the school for religious instruction on Friday afternoon, January 23rd, he found the classrooms 61\u00b0 and instructed that the children should be sent home as it was too cold for classes. The teachers did not comply as he has no jurisdiction.\nIn the school and they kept the pupils till 4:00 o'clock that day to avoid criticism by Rev. McKenzie.\n\nAll matters connected with the fire were discussed in detail with Mr. M. McCrimmon when he visited this Agency on Thursday, January 20th and 30th. At a Band meeting on January 30th the Sarnia Band of Indians passed a resolution agreeing to turn over the basement of their Council Hall for school purposes for an indefinite period at a rental of $15.00 per month. The Department is to supply fuel and pay all expenses re conversion of the basement into two classrooms. Mr. McCrimmon took back with him the estimate of the cost as prepared by James B. Williams, an Indian carpenter of Sarnia Reserve. He states that he can procure all materials and complete the partitioning, etc., in from one to two weeks if authorized by the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nI understand that all of the twenty-eight pupils in grade one formerly enrolled in Miss McKenzie's room are to remain at home when and if classes are resumed, but would prefer written instructions from the Department on this subject. I strongly recommend that Miss McKenzie be placed in charge of senior pupils, grades five to eight (about twenty pupils) and that Mrs. McCracken teach grades two to four (thirty-one pupils). To lighten Miss McKenzie's teaching duties she might even be relieved of the seven pupils in grade five if the Department considers it advisable. This would leave her only thirteen pupils in grades six to eight. In this connection Mrs. McCracken sent a letter back with Mr. McCrimmon which explains the above more fully.\n\nIf two classrooms are to be opened in the basement of the Council Hall we could obtain a sufficient number of used desks (screw down type) from the Sarnia Board of Education at a cost of $1.00 each plus delivery charges.\n\nFour pieces of blackboard each eight feet long and four feet high are required immediately. Three or four broken pieces which were saved from the fire will be used until new ones arrive. With the exception of supplies of grade one pupils all scribblers, books, etc., were destroyed and if it meets with your approval I shall ask the two teachers to submit requisitions for necessary supplies. For this reason an early decision as to the grades to be taught by each teacher is desired.\n\nM. W. McCracken\n\nM. W. McCracken,\nSuperintendent, Sarnia Indian Agency.\nCoal Company so that it would be available. I trust that this action will meet with your approval and the account will be submitted when received.\n\nWhen Mr. McCrimmon visited this Agency last week he authorized me to purchase up to $30.00 worth of books, scribblers, pencils, etc., so that classes might be resumed. I intend to comply with the above instructions and submit the accounts to the Department for payment. This should be enough to get the classes started and the teachers could then forward requisitions for additional supplies when their exact needs have been determined.\n\nAs mentioned in my previous letter we can purchase used desks from the Sarnia Board of Education at $1.00 each. I believe about thirty-five desks will be required and an immediate reply authorizing the purchase of same will be appreciated.\n\nM. W. McCracker,\nSuperintendent, Sarnia Indian Agency.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nSarnia, February 4th, 1948.\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of telegram dated February 3rd regarding the remodelling of the basement of the Council Hall to provide two classrooms for St. Clair Indian Day School pupils.\n\nJames B. Williams was immediately notified to commence work and he expects to have it completed within a few days, possibly by Saturday, February 7th.\n\nWould you please forward an accountable advance cheque for $262.00 at the earliest possible date so that Williams and the men working on the job can be paid?\n\nOnly two small pieces of blackboard were salvaged from the fire. These will be entirely inadequate for two classrooms. Mr. Williams suggests that sixty-four square feet of masonite be purchased and painted with black Duco paint. He is of the opinion that the painted masonite would serve for blackboards. The masonite would cost about $30.00 and the labour of painting and installing same would be about $10.00, making a total expenditure of $40.00 for blackboards. This $40.00 was not included in Williams' tender which Mr. McCrimmon took back to Ottawa with him. If the blackboards are ordered through the stationery office in the regular way there might be a long delay and as they are urgently needed I recommend that authority be granted to purchase the masonite locally and have Mr. Williams paint and install the boards as suggested above.\n\nWhen the fire occurred on January 26th there was about two tons of coal in the St. Clair School. In the process of fighting the fire the coal became wet and frozen. A considerable quantity of it is embedded in ice in the basement. Eventually most of it will be salvaged and can be used in the teachers' residence. It was impracticable to shovel this coal from the basement of the school to a truck and transport it to the Council House and as coal is needed in the Council House when school starts next week I ordered two tons from the Century...\nREQUISITION FOR CHEQUE\nTO BE USED FOR ADVANCES OR AUTHORIZED PAYMENTS FOR WHICH THERE ARE NO ACCOUNTS\n\nDEPARTMENT: Mines and Resources\nBRANCH: Indian Affairs\nDATE: February 10, 1946\n\nAPPLICATION IS HEREBY MADE FOR THE ISSUE OF THE FOLLOWING CHEQUE OR CHEQUES:\n\n| CHEQUE No. | IN FAVOUR OF | AMOUNT |\n|------------|--------------|--------|\n|            | Sarnia Indian Agency Trust Account | $262.00 |\n\nSend cheque to:\nMr. M.W.

Williams commenced the alterations on February 5th. They are now practically completed and it would be possible to open the classrooms on Wednesday if we had desks and blackboards. About sixteen desks were salvaged from the senior room, and we have located four others which will be suitable for the larger pupils. Therefore no additional desks are required for the senior classroom. All desks in the intermediate room, grades two to four inclusive, were destroyed by fire but a number were saved from the junior classroom which are large enough for small grade two pupils. Approximately twenty medium sized desks for pupils in grades two to four are required at the moment. I have already written requesting authority to purchase used desks from the Board of Education in the city of Sarnia. I have also written regarding purchasing of Masonite and painting it as a substitute for blackboards. If authority to purchase the desks and blackboards is received we could resume classes the next day.\n\nImmediate advice as to which teacher is to have charge of the senior classroom is requested. If we knew this the senior room could be opened immediately as we have enough desks and pieces of blackboard to proceed on a temporary basis. I might mention that the senior teacher, Mrs. M. Williamson, submitted her resignation to take effect on January 31st and no further salary cheques should be issued in her favour.\n\nMrs. McCracken has submitted a requisition covering supplies for the two classrooms, but an immediate supply of scribblers, etc., will have to be obtained and I intend to purchase these locally up to a maximum of $30.00. I may find it necessary to borrow some supplies.\nfrom Kettle Point School and trust that this will meet with your approval.\n\nIn connection with using the Council Hall for school purposes I would advise that at a Band meeting held on January 30th Sarnia Indians passed the following resolutions:\n\n\"Moved by Alfred Rodd, seconded by Fred Rogers that the basement of the Council Hall be made available for school purposes, for an indefinite period.\" Carried.\n\n\"Moved by Telford Adams, seconded by Leonard Plain that the Band accept Fifteen Dollars ($15.00) per month for rental of the Hall to the Indian Department.\" Carried.\n\nM.

W. McCracken Our Order No. 324\n\nFeb. 23 1 Superior Electric Heater $14.75\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nEnclosed please find voucher #136 amounting to $14.75 in favour of Chambers Electric Company, Sarnia, Ontario for one electric heater supplied for use in the intermediate classroom of St. Clair Indian Day School.\n\nTwo temporary classrooms were set up in the basement of the Sarnia Indian Council House. There were three registers in the basement and when partitions were installed it meant that one classroom would have two registers with the other having just one. The one hot air register in the ceiling of the intermediate room did not provide sufficient heat even when the furnace was properly fired. Before the electric heater was purchased the temperature in the intermediate classroom seldom got above 55\u00b0. I therefore purchased an electric heater for the intermediate room and recommend that it be made a charge against the $30.00 provided for emergency equipment in your letter 29-1-5 of February 10th, 1948.\n\nThe senior classroom has two registers and is also adjacent to the kitchen and furnace room.

Randle, Indian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ontario.\n\nMr. Doucet recently visited the Sarnia Agency and had an opportunity of looking over the buildings at the former Ipperwash Camp. We can obtain several of these buildings and we are especially interested in the Dental Clinic building. We would like to move this from its present location to the St. Clair Reserve to replace the building that we lost by fire.\n\nThe approximate distance is 50 miles. There would not be any great trouble with electric lines as practically all the villages could be missed with the exception of Forest.\n\nWould it be possible to obtain a quotation on moving this building from the man whom you employed to move the building from the Camp to the Six Nations Reserve?\n\nPlease let me hear from you.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/EGD\nFebruary 25, 1948.\n\nRE: Ipperwash Camp\n\nI have noted on the plan lent me by the Trust Branch the number of the buildings available to the Indian Affairs. They are Nos. 11, 12, 13, 14, 41, 44, 45 and 46. No. 11 is a salvage shed, well constructed on a cement floor, it is 20' x 60'. Nos. 12, 13 and 14 are H. Huts. No. 12 is intact but Nos. 13 and 14 have been partly dismantled.\n\nThe inside Gyprock and insulation have been removed. The hot water heating system and plumbing are intact. There is very good material left in 13 and 14 which could be used to advantage. These huts are 24' x 120'.\n\nNo. 41 is the Dental Clinic and would be very practical as classrooms. It is 24' x 70'.\n\nThe problem is to find out if these buildings can economically be transported. If so, one might be set on the present foundation of the burnt school.\n\nA second plan would be to rebuild the school from material available from the camp. Considerable material of the school is usable in its present shape. The beams appear sound as well as the joists, the sub floor and some walls.\n\nI would suggest that immediate steps be taken to investigate the cost of transporting these buildings should it prove to be feasible.\nI would also suggest that Mr. McCracken be notified to put up posters forbidding any person entering the burnt school as considerable danger exists. Decision on what is to be done is urgent as special attention is necessary to the conditions of the salvage.\n\nA.J.

Plain\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter 29-1-5 (E.1) of March 24th, 1948 re cost of dismantling and salvaging St. Clair School.\n\nThe two white men interviewed by Mr. Doucet recently when he visited Sarnia were Mr. Jack Verbeem, 108 Alfred Street, Point Edward, Ontario and Mr. Tracy Torrance, Errol Road, Sarnia, Ontario.\n\nI have discussed the matter with Mr. Verbeem. He states that when his tender for $600.00 was submitted late in February there was about eight inches of ice in the basement. He intended to commence work early in March before the ice melted. At that time the ice could have been chopped with an axe and thrown out with a shovel which would not have cost very much. Now the ice has melted and with Spring rains, etc., there is twenty inches of water in the basement. When dismantling begins this water will have to be pumped out and once the basement is free of water it should be kept dry by a sump pump or else it will simply fill up again as there is very poor drainage on the school site.\n\nWhen the school was built a sump pump operated by a three horse power electric motor was installed. This pump was damaged by firemen and the pump as well as the electric motor were frozen in the ice in the pit. They are still there. The condition of the motor cannot be determined until it is disconnected and examined. There is a possibility that a new motor will be required or extensive repairs made to the old one. A power line from the electric wires presently serving the teachers' residence will have to be built and switches, etc., installed to operate the sump pump.\n\nMr. Verbeem estimates that the cost of pumping out water presently in the basement and repairs to the pump and electric motor, hydro line, switches, etc., will be about $100.00. This will bring his tender up to $700.00 rather than the previously quoted figure of $600.00.\nI have also discussed the dismantling of the school with James B. Williams, an Indian, who previously submitted a tender for $1120.00. I told him that white men were willing to take a contract at $700.00. He is not interested in doing the work for this amount. He maintains that his figure of $1120.00 is reasonable if the Department wishes a careful and satisfactory salvage job performed. He states that the remains of the building could be wrecked in short order if no particular care is taken re salvage. He expressed the opinion that very little would be salvaged by white men at the $700.00 figure. Williams seemed a bit peeved when I informed him that other members had been invited to tender. First of all he said he would withdraw his tender entirely, but later reconsidered and is now willing to do it for $972.00 as per the enclosed tender.\n\nTwo other members of the Band were interviewed re dismantling the school. One of them, Albert Oliver, would have been competent to do the work but he finally decided not to submit a tender. The other Indian, Leonard Plain, has submitted the enclosed tender for $1100.00. I am doubtful as to whether or not this man is quite capable of doing the work satisfactorily and furthermore he does not appear to be particularly anxious for the job. He is a veteran of the 1939 war and a bricklayer by trade, but has not had much experience.\n\nIn my opinion James B. Williams would do a satisfactory dismantling and salvaging job. He dismantled and salvaged materials from the Indian Church on Sarnia Reserve in 1945 and everyone was satisfied with his work on that project.\n\nJames B. Williams is one of the present Councillors of Sarnia Band. He intends to use the Band granary adjacent to the site to store materials salvaged from the school, but if the two white men are given the contract Williams will likely persuade the Sarnia Council to refuse to allow the white men the same privilege, yet if the salvage remains outside it will gradually disappear. In his original tender Williams included $50.00 to be paid to the Band for the use of the granary to store school materials. This fact will give you some idea of the greed and hostile attitude of most of the Sarnia Indians who expect payment from the Training Branch for everything connected with the school when it is being provided, at no expense to the Band, to teach their children.\n\nWith the above information I trust that the Department will be able to make a decision re dismantling and salvaging what remains of the St. Clair School.\n\nM.

McCracken,\nSuperintendent, Sarnia Indian Agency.\n\nMWM/D\nEncs. 4\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Water Supply,\nSt. Clair School and Teachers' Residence.\n\nUnder authority of Departmental letter 31029-1 of September 11th, 1946 a contract was approved whereby Sarnia Township agreed to supply water to public buildings on Sarnia Reserve. The St. Clair Indian Day School, St. Clair Teachers' Residence, Sarnia Indian Council Hall and United Church buildings have been provided with city water.\n\nLast January the new St. Clair School was destroyed by fire. At that time there was only one shut-off to serve the new school and teachers' residence. Emergency arrangements had to be made to shut the water off after the fire in the new school and considerable inconvenience resulted as water was still necessary in the St. Clair Teachers' Residence.\n\nSarnia Township Water Commissioner decided that separate shut-offs were required for the new St. Clair School and the St. Clair Residence. They overlooked notifying me that this work was necessary until after it was performed and the account in the amount of $29.27 was received. Their employees had to excavate down to the water main and install the two shut-offs. In my opinion this work was necessary to avoid confusion in the water supply to these two buildings in future years. The Water Commissioner regretted that he did not inform us that he intended to do this work but I recommend that it be considered an emergency and that the Department approve of payment.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Building - St. Clair Indian Day School.\n\nUpon receipt of your letter of June 4th, your file 29-1-5, I would advise that I wrote to Colonel Randle at Brantford with the object of arranging an inspection of the military building at Camp Ipperwash which it is proposed to move to Sarnia to be used as a school.\n\nWhen Colonel Randle received my letter he telephoned me to state that he would endeavour to come to Sarnia with Mr. Rispin, the mover, as soon as possible. Colonel Randle thought he and the mover would be able to make the trip early in the week of June 19th, but apparently the mover is busy as they have not arrived up to the present.\n\nI thought I should advise you of the above and I feel certain that Colonel Randle will come as soon as he can make the necessary arrangements with the mover.\n\nM. W. McCracken,\nSuperintendent, Sarnia Indian Agency.\nwith me to inspect the remnants of St. Clair School, the military building to be moved and the proposed route. It is quite possible that he may consent to dismantle the burned school, move the military building and set it on the foundation at St. Clair. I am hoping he will be prepared to take a contract covering practically all phases of the project on much the same basis as Mr. Rispin did at Brantford.\n\nEventually, if the building is moved, the extent of plumbing to be installed in the new building as well as type of heating will have to be decided and no doubt numerous other problems will arise. In my opinion we should keep the plumbing to a minimum. Possibly an official from the Education Division can arrange to come to Sarnia to advise re these matters when the work is in progress.\n\nColonel Randle and the mover, Mr. Rispin, think that the tenders of $700.00, $972.00 and $1100.00 to dismantle the burned out school are ridiculously high (see Departmental letter 29-1-5 (E.l) of March 24th, 1948 and my reply of March 31st, 1948). They think a reasonable figure would be $200.00. I agree with them and possibly Mr. Hagen, the mover, will do the dismantling at a reasonable price which would be included in the contract for moving.\n\nTo date I have not been informed as to whether military building #41 has been released by the Department of National Defence. If this building is available I would appreciate being advised.\n\nAs soon as Mr. Hagen appraises the work to be done and gives us an estimate I shall submit a further report.\n\nM. W. McCracken,\nSuperintendent, Sarnia Indian Agency.\nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDepartment of Mines and Resources,  \nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Building - St. Clair Indian Day School.\n\nI wish to refer to your letter 29-1-5 of June 4th, 1948 regarding the feasibility of moving a military building from the Ipperwash Army Camp to Sarnia Reserve for St. Clair school purposes.\n\nPlease be advised that Colonel Randle and the mover, Mr. Rispin, visited Sarnia on June 25th and we inspected the St. Clair School as well as the military buildings at Camp Ipperwash and the route over which the building would travel.\n\nColonel Randle and his mover believed that the moving of military building #41 from Camp Ipperwash to Sarnia is quite feasible. Military building #41 could be moved and converted to provide suitable school accommodation at much less cost than rebuilding. This dental building is preferable to other military structures such as army huts, etc. It would have to be cut, moved in two sections and placed on the existing foundation at St. Clair. Of course the remains of the St. Clair School will have to be dismantled first and a false cement wall built as the military building is wider than the St. Clair foundation.\n\nMr. Rispin, the mover, cannot see his way clear to undertake the project, nor would he give any estimate of cost. After fully discussing the entire project with the mover and Colonel Randle I think we should proceed. Yesterday I contacted an experienced mover from Wallaceburg named Mr. Hagen. He has excellent equipment, a good record locally and would be quite capable of doing the job satisfactorily. About the latter part of this week Mr. Hagen promised to get in touch.\nexperience at Brantford, would not cost more than $300.00, while new insul-brick siding and labour would only cost around $350.00. Actually most of the insul-brick siding on the burned school is in first rate condition, and it is not a difficult matter to take it off and re-use it.\n\nIf it was not considered necessary at the moment to put back the elaborate heating and other arrangements, - which it is understood were in the burned building, you could use stoves such as you supplied us at Brantford, - which have most satisfactorily heated our 42-foot rooms, built from army buildings.\n\nYou will appreciate the most essential thing at the moment is to clean up the burned-out building, as any Contractor would throw up his hands and quit if he moved on to the site with a building ready to hoist and wanting plenty of clear space for manoeuvering, and then found himself impeded in all directions.\n\nWhile in Rispin's and my opinion most of what was the teachers' room could be left to attach to the new building, - all the rest of the burned building should be taken down immediately and piled out of the way for use, or disposed of, as circumstances warrant, - and the basement cleared of water and given an opportunity to dry out.\n\nThese comments may or may not be of use to you, but as you wished Rispin and I to look over the problem, I thought you might like a report, and in any case I think Mr. McCracken gained a good deal of knowledge and understanding from the discussion which would assist him in having the work carried out.\n\nLt.-Col.E.F.Randle,\nEPR/MH\n\nIndian Superintendent.\nThough the distance to be covered in moving the building is about forty miles, - a survey of the route disclosed no particular difficulties in the way of wires or bridges. There was one bridge that would cause some delay, - but nothing difficult in Rispin's opinion, and generally speaking the building would pass under most wires, if the equipment is as low as we have been using at Brantford.\n\nMost of the Highway to be traversed is particularly favourable, as it only has pole wires on one side, and is blessed with wide shoulders on both sides, with no ditches, - so traffic would not be held up in passing the moving building until reaching cross-roads, but could pass it comfortably on either side.\n\nIn Rispin's opinion, the most trying and difficult operation of the whole move would be on arrival at the site, getting each piece hoisted up and on to the existing walls (four feet) of the burned-out building. While not too difficult if you have the equipment and know the game, it would take time and care.\n\nWhile Rispin is too busy as you already know, at Brantford, to do this work, - he expressed the opinion that it would take one week to move each of the two pieces. That means, - cutting, jacking up, moving on to the hauling equipment, movement along roads, and hoisting on to existing foundations. He estimates three days' road travel, though with everything particularly favourable it might take less.\n\nWhile not definitely expressing an opinion as to cost, - as there was not time for him to weigh up all factors, - he did have the notion that the work outlined in the previous paragraph would be worth $1,000.00 per building, - or a total of $2,000.00.\n\nYou will appreciate even if it costs that, plus what it will cost to put the building into shape for school use, - it would still be a cheap building, and would last many years.\n\nSay it costs another $1,000.00 to join the two ends to the rebuilt centre, - using some of the salvaged material, and pitting in cupboards and blackboards etc. The painting (labour and paint) judging from\nBrantford, Ontario\n30th June, 1948.\n\nP.M.\n\nColonel B. F. Neary, Superintendent Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nAs requested by you, - accompanied by T.J. Rispin a trip was made to Sarnia and Camp Ipperwash to look over the feasibility of moving a building from the Camp to the Sarnia Reserve.\n\nThe following comment is forwarded for your information.\n\nThe dental building which apparently has been selected to replace the burned-out school building, is considered most suitable in every way for the purpose intended, as it is in first class shape.\n\nWith the exception of the removal of a few partitions, it can readily be made into two excellent school-rooms.\n\nIt is about six feet shorter than the burned-out building, but fortunately the centre of that building, having the teachers' room on one side and the main entrance on the other, was not too badly damaged, and could easily be rebuilt from what is salvaged.\n\nConsequently, as the Camp building will almost certainly have to be cut in two to permit removal, - as, as a single unit it is too long to permit making necessary road turns, - the two cut ends could be hoisted on to the existing walls and joined to the aforementioned centre, and thus make a complete two-roomed school, along the lines it was before the fire.\n\nIn addition, the Camp building has an outside measurement of 24 feet, whereas the burned building was only 23 feet. This factor will be an advantage in most ways, but will entail a false wall and the extension of the windows on the side farthest from the road.\n\nIn Rispin's opinion the building of the false wall and the extension of the windows was not a difficult task using lumber, and was preferable to thickening the present wall with concrete, or the forcing of it out a foot, - which also is apparently possible, but not easy.\nsame I shall immediately forward it to the Department for consideration.\n\nOn inspecting military building #41 last night we discovered that the boiler and heating jacket had been removed from this particular building. The radiators are still in the building, however, and to make use of them a boiler and heating jacket are required. Heating units consisting of a boiler and jacket are available in several other buildings at the Camp. When we are negotiating for the release of military building #41 I think it extremely important that we procure a boiler and heating jacket from one of the other army huts. In my opinion the Department of National Defence would agree to this proposition if we request it of them.\n\nWould you please advise at the earliest possible date if military building #41 has been released to us, and also if we can procure a boiler and heating jacket from one of the other army huts.\n\nM. W. McCracken,\nSuperintendent, Sarnia Indian Agency.\nSarnia, July 6th, 1948.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Building - St. Clair Indian Day School.\n\nUnder date of June 29th, 1948 I reported re possibilities of moving a military building from the Ipperwash Army Camp to Sarnia Reserve for St. Clair School purposes. I mentioned that I had contacted an experienced mover from Wallaceburg who promised to come to the office to go over the project with me. To date Mr. Hagen has not appeared, which leads me to believe that he has much work ahead of him and is not particularly interested in additional jobs.\n\nWhen Mr. Doucet was at Sarnia last February he and I interviewed two white men who were at that time interested in dismantling the remnants of the St. Clair School. One of these men was Mr. Torrance. He is very interested in taking a contract to dismantle the burned building, move military building #41 from Camp Ipperwash to St. Clair, set it on the existing foundation and remodel it. He is prepared to submit a figure covering practically all phases of the project including wiring, plumbing, etc. Last night I took Mr. Torrance to Camp Ipperwash and showed him the building and the route over which it would have to travel. He wants to visit the Camp again to thoroughly inspect the building. I intend to take him to Camp Ipperwash the first of next week and shortly thereafter he will be in a position to give me an estimate covering the entire project.\n\nMr. Torrance appears to be a reliable and efficient workman. He is a contractor and is presently building three houses in Sarnia. He is a good carpenter and I think we would be fortunate if we could procure him for our school moving project. Of course the matter of giving him the contract would depend upon his estimate of cost. When I have secured\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Erection of St. Clair Indian Day School.\n\nWhen the erection of the new St. Clair Indian Day School was proposed in 1946 it was necessary to prepare a list of materials. Shaw Construction Company, Sarnia, Ontario, did this work and under date of July 23rd, 1946 I submitted voucher #126 in their favour for $45.00 covering professional services rendered.\n\nToday the Company telephoned stating that they have no record of having received cheque in payment for the above. Would you please investigate and ascertain if a cheque were issued covering their account?\n\nShaw Construction Company telephoned Mr. Phelan recently requesting payment for work done in 1947 re conversion of the old St. Clair School into a teachers' residence. They are becoming very impatient and have once again asked me to bring this matter to the attention of the Department to expedite payment.\n\nEarly information with respect to the above will be appreciated.\n\nM. W. McCracken\n\nM. W. McCracken,\nSuperintendent, Sarnia Indian Agency.\nthe quantity and type of work to be done.\n\nAssuming that the contract is let and work commenced by the first week in August, Mr. Torrance hopes to be able to complete the entire project by September 15th, or in any event not later than September 30th. With the temporary classrooms dismantled this would mean that there would be no classes during most of September which is unfortunate, but nevertheless unavoidable.\n\nI think we should authorize Mr. Torrance to proceed at the earliest possible date and that an accountable advance cheque for $7200.00 be forwarded immediately. If this is not possible at least $3000.00 should be sent as Mr. Torrance will need $1200.00 to pay Mr. Hagen. He will require the balance to finance the project as he, himself, will have performed a great deal of labour the first week dismantling and getting the site ready to receive the military building.\n\nTo date I am awaiting a reply as to whether or not military building #41, as well as a boiler and heating jacket, have been turned over to us by the Department of National Defense. The whole project is dependent upon the release of these by the military.\n\nIt takes time to secure moving permits, hire men, locate materials, etc., and for this reason we should be notified at the earliest possible date so that Mr. Hagen and Mr. Torrance will not accept other jobs while waiting for a decision on this one.\n\nM. W. McCracken\n\nM. W. McCracken,\nSuperintendent, Sarnia Indian Agency.\nReserve appears to have the ability to handle this project and if they did their charges would be out of all reason. For instance James B. Williams, the Indian carpenter, asked $1120.00 just to dismantle the burned-out building whereas the previous figure quoted by Mr. Torrance last March was $700.00. Mr. Torrance is prepared to commence early in August and he would start dismantling while Mr. Hagen was engaged in the moving. In this way the foundation would be ready when the military building is landed at the site in Sarnia.\n\nThere is about two feet of stagnant water in the basement of the burned-out school at the present time. Mr. Torrance would pump this out and install a new sump pump with electric motor to keep it dry. He would then dismantle the burned-out building and salvage everything of value to be used in remodelling. While doing this Mr. Hagen would be attending to the moving. When the military building arrives at Sarnia one-half would be placed on each end of the existing foundation and then Mr. Torrance would build a centre portion being halls, teachers' room, washrooms, etc. to join the two. We propose to remodel so that when completed the result would be a school with much the same design as the first one which burned. The plumbing and electrical expenses would be kept to a minimum with both labour and materials being supplied by Mr. Torrance.\n\nYou will note that Mr. Torrance does not agree to supply the boiler, heating jacket and radiators. We plan on securing a complete heating unit from one of the other army huts as previously reported in my letter of July 6th. His estimate includes all labour costs re installation of heating unit and we would have to provide the unit and all accessories. Temporary classrooms in the basement of the Sarnia Council Hall will not be required and Mr. Torrance will dismantle same so that the materials can be used in remodelling. His estimate is based on the assumption that these materials will be available.\n\nI am reasonably certain that this project will be completed by Mr. Torrance for $7200.00 and that his work will be satisfactory. The result will be a nice school much the same as the other building before it was burned. I think that $7200.00 is a reasonable figure considering\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: St. Clair Indian Day School,\nDepartmental file 29-1-5.\n\nI wish to refer to your letter of June 4th, 1948 and my replies of June 29th and July 6th with regard to moving military building #41 from Camp Ipperwash to Sarnia Reserve and remodelling it to serve as a school.\n\nMr. Hagen, a reliable, experienced and well-equipped mover from Wallaceburg, Ontario, is willing to cut the military building into two parts and move same forty miles to Sarnia Reserve where he would place them on the existing cement foundation. His contract price for this is $1200.00, which includes cost of permit, expenses re removal of telephone and hydro wires, railway crossing permits, etc. He is prepared to do this work early in August and estimates that it will take about one week.\n\nMr. Tracy Torrance, R.R. #2, Sarnia, is prepared to take a contract for the entire project for $7200.00. In other words he would do the dismantling of the burned-out building and remodel the new structure for $6000.00 and sublet the moving contract to Mr. Hagen for $1200.00, which would make the total contract $7200.00.\n\nI believe Mr. Torrance is quite reliable, capable and efficient. Mr. Doucet met him last February in this office. He is a first class carpenter who accepts building contracts on a comparatively small scale. In my opinion he would be much more interested in and more apt to make a success of this project than would larger building contractors such as Shaw Construction Company.

That a competent building contractor, namely, Mr. Tracy Terrance, M.H., 2, Sarnia, Ontario, is to undertake the moving of this surplus Army building, to build in the centre section required, to remodel the building to provide three classrooms, a teachers' room, and wash rooms for the sum of $7,200.00.\n\nTHAT it is considered that the provision of this school is a pressing emergency and within the exception provided in Section 36 above recited and further, it is considered that the work can be more expeditiously and economically executed as suggested herein.\n\nThe undersigned, therefore, recommends that authority be granted for the acceptance of this tender in the amount of $7,200.00 which after making provision for contingencies would involve an expenditure of $5,000.00.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nMinister of Mines and Resources.\n\nRPN/HEM.\n29-1-5 (E)\nSeptember 9, 1948.\n\nPRIVY COUNCIL OFFICE\n\nRequesting authority for the provision of a three-room Indian Day School on the St. Clair Indian Reserve, Sarnia Indian Agency in the Province of Ontario for which funds are being provided by transfer in the 1948-49 estimates.\n\nTwo extra copies of Order-in-Council are required.\nOttawa, September 9, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nSt. Clair Indian Day School.\n\nAs you will recall, the two-room school on this Reserve near Sarnia was partially destroyed by fire last winter.\n\nShortly after that time, one of our officials visited Sarnia and also the Ipperwash Army Camp situated some forty miles away.\n\nIt was found that Building 41 at this Army Camp would fit almost exactly on the cement foundation of the old school. Since that time we have carried on negotiations with the Department of National Defence for the release of this building. Two days ago we were informed by telephone that they were prepared to declare this building surplus and to make it available for use by this Department.\n\nIn anticipation of obtaining this surplus Army building, we had obtained a tender from Mr. Tracy Torrance, R.R. #2, Sarnia. For the sum of $7,200, he is prepared to move this building and to place it on the existing school basement walls. He will also build in the centre section and will clear away and clean up the remains of the former school. He will remodel the building to make two classrooms and two wash rooms complete with basins, toilets, etc., on the main floor. He will also rebuild the teachers' room. In the basement, he will finish one classroom in\ngypros, a coal room and a Manual Training room. The only other expenditure required will be the installation of the heating system.\n\nIt will be necessary to cut the Army building in half, jack up the half, move it onto the hauling equipment, pull it some forty miles when the necessary permission is obtained for the lifting of hydro wires, etc., and then hoist it onto the existing foundation. Each half will take approximately three days road travel. It is understood that a sub-contractor from Wallaceburg will handle this part of the job.\n\nOne of our Officials has discussed this contract with Mr. Torrance and reports him to be reliable and efficient. Mr. Indian Superintendent McCracken advises that he is a first class contractor who accepts building contracts on a comparatively small scale. We are informed that he would be much more interested in and more apt to make a success of the project than would larger building contractors in Sarnia.\n\nThe attached Order-in-Council is, therefore, recommended for your approval.

I had a personal interview with Mr. Hagen, the mover, this afternoon. He has been moving buildings in this locality for many years and assured me that he could get the necessary permit in a few hours and at no time has there been a delay of more than forty-eight hours in obtaining moving permits. He also stated that the cost would certainly not exceed $30.00. Mr. Hagen will possibly be ready to start preparing the building at Ipperwash for moving about September 29th. In any event he promises to commence work on the building preparatory to moving not later than October 4th. He estimates that it will take from one to two days to load the building and therefore it will no doubt arrive at the St. Clair School site on Sarnia Reserve toward the latter part of the week commencing October 4th. I trust that the above is the information which Mr. Doucet requires.\n\nI also saw Mr. Torrance, the building contractor who submitted an estimate on the dismantling of the old school and remodelling the new one. His tender was submitted under cover of my letter of July 16th, at an estimated cost of $7200.00. I regret very much to inform you that Mr. Torrance made a very bad error when figuring the cost of this project. I only learned of it this afternoon. The $7200.00 does not include the cost of moving. In other words the total estimated expenditure should be $8400.00. Mr. Torrance explained the\nmatter by telling me that his wife compiled the cost and when totalling same she omitted to include $1200.00 for moving. Mr. Torrance discovered his error last Sunday, September 19th. He hesitated to mention it to me as he realized the seriousness of his error. I advised him that a submission had already been made to the Minister for approval of the contract at $7200.00. We discussed the matter at length and decided that now is the proper time to bring it to your attention rather than have a dangerous misunderstanding later on. This builder did not definitely refuse to sign a contract at the $7200.00 figure but if forced to proceed for this sum we would no doubt be confronted with an unfinished or very poorly constructed building. I had a long talk with Mr. Torrance and I believe he is quite honest when he says that his wife forgot to include the $1200.00. He is sincere and is greatly perturbed over the whole affair. He does not want to proceed on the basis of doing the work for $7200.00 as he frankly admits that he could not do anything but a cheap job for this figure. As above-stated I deeply regret the circumstances leading to this perplexing situation. I mentioned to Mr. Torrance that it might be possible to make an adjustment when Mr. Doucet arrives. However, in my opinion, it would be wise to request a further $1200.00 to cover the moving contract as I consider that even at $8400.00 we would get a good school at a reasonable price.\n\nI have told Mr. Torrance to continue dismantling the burned-out school so that it will be ready for the military building when it arrives at Sarnia. I also instructed Mr. Hagen to proceed with his part of the work. If you wish Mr. Torrance and Mr. Hagen to cease all work until the money complications mentioned above have been clarified kindly wire me to this effect.\n\nM. W.

Elgin Indian School, he thought it very doubtful that the Dept would approve of buying a refrigerator owing to the cost of it. We purchased an ice box, unfortunately there is only one door (front) in the house and ice cannot be carried all through the house so no glasses or milk can be used.\n\nI am wondering if a personal recommendation from you would secure an electric refrigerator for us. Mr. Dewett had one and he says we think one is really needed.\n\nWe are looking forward to a happy time here.\n\nI hope you can help us. This does not need a reply.\n\nSincerely\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

At the same time I was advised by the military officials that the building could be moved from the camp immediately.\n\nI have contacted Mr. Tracy Torrance and advised him that the building now belongs to the Indian Affairs Branch and the project of moving it to Sarnia can be undertaken. Mr. Hagen, the mover whom Mr. Torrance is engaging will be prepared to move the building in approximately two weeks from this date. Mr. Torrance has commenced preparing the site so that it will be ready to receive the building. He has pumped the water out of the basement and is now having the sump pump and electric motor repaired. He intends to commence dismantling what remains of the structure in the very near future. I cannot tell at the moment just when would be most opportune for Mr. Doucet to come to Sarnia but expect that the project will be commenced in about two weeks at which time I would appreciate his assistance. During the course of the next two weeks I shall write you regarding further progress which we expect will have been made so that Mr. Doucet may prepare to come to Sarnia.\n\nIn my letters of July 6th and July 16th I pointed out that the boiler and heating jacket had been removed from Military Building #41 and I suggested that an effort be made to persuade the Military to release a furnace boiler and jacket. The tender which Mr. Torrance submitted was on the basis of the heating unit being supplied by the Indian Affairs Branch and I think the matter of procuring same from the Department of National Defence should be given attention.\n\n(Sgd) M.W.

Mr. Morris apparently has definitely instructed Mr. McCracken to provide oil heating for the school.\n\nDue to the cost of the building and considering that the roofing is still good for several years yet, the present roof was to be repaired and retained. However, Mr. McCracken states that he was instructed to replace the present roof by asphalt shingles.\n\nThis information was given to me during a telephonic conversation with Indian Superintendent McCracken.\n\nA.J.

On many occasions we have taken his advice concerning small building problems and have always found it to be sound. Please find attached a report submitted to me by him concerning a telephone conversation which he had yesterday with Mr. Indian Superintendent McCracken, of the Sarnia Superintendency.\n\nMr. Phelan, Mr. Doucet and I discussed at some length the problem of heating this building. In view of a clearly stated government policy with regard to the use of oil burners and oil burning furnaces, it was decided to install a stoker type furnace. It would seem evident that Mr. Morris has decided to change our instructions in this regard.\n\nMr. Doucet also recommended that the roof on the Army building (which has been moved to Sarnia for use as a classroom) would be good for several years yet. Mr. McCracken now states that he has been instructed by Mr. Morris to replace the present roof by asphalt shingles.\n\nAn Order-in-Council has been passed providing for the acceptance of a tender by Mr. Terrance. If Mr. Morris is to be permitted to visit our school building projects in the field and to countermand the orders and instructions given by staff of this Division, then confusion and dissatisfaction is bound to result.\n\nIn conclusion, may I add that never during Mr. Arneil's tenure of office in Ontario was it necessary to draw to Mr. Hoey's attention any interference of this nature.\n\nBernard F.

E. Morris, Regional Supervisor, which changed the plans already made for heating the above-noted school and, in addition, that you have been instructed to have the roof of the building re-shingled, using asphalt shingles. It would appear from this that Mr. Morris was not fully aware of the arrangements made by the Education Division for improvements at this school, nor of the funds set aside for the purpose. Unless you have already proceeded with the changes suggested by Mr. Morris, the original arrangements should be adhered to, that is both with respect to the heating unit and repairs to the roof. Regarding the latter, the information we have is to the effect that the roof should be good for several years, and, unless there is evidence of deterioration which escaped the notice of Mr. Doucet when making his examination, re-shingling would not appear to be necessary. It might be, however, that some minor repairs to the roof are required and, if this is so, these may be carried out.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nM. W. McCracken, Esq.,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nSARNIA,\nOntario.\n\nActing Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nEnclosed please find voucher #608 amounting to $20.00 in favour of Samuel Walker, an Indian of Sarnia B and, for labour performed in moving, cleaning and repairing two outdoor toilets used by children of St. Clair Indian Day School.\n\nWhen the St. Clair Indian Day School was burned in January, 1948 you are aware that two temporary classrooms were arranged in the Sarnia Council House. St. Clair pupils used the toilets belonging to the Council House from February to June and from September up to the present time. In all probability they will be using these same toilets for another two months until the military building has been converted into a school.\n\nAs the toilets at the Council House have been used for school purposes the Chief and Council of the Band considered that the Education Division should assume responsibility for cleaning and repairing them. They were in very bad condition so I instructed Samuel Walker to move, clean and repair the buildings as per his enclosed account.\n\nI recommend that the Department approve of payment.\n\nM. W.

J. Dodson, has requested storm windows and a combination screen and storm door for the St. Clair Indian Day School teachers' residence. When Mr. Doucet visited Sarnia recently he instructed me to obtain an estimate of the cost and forward it to the Department for approval.\n\nA white carpenter named Tracy Torrance estimated the total cost to be $132.00. This includes cost of materials and installation. The labour would be $35.00 with $97.00 for materials. This would provide eight storm windows and one combination storm and screen door. I am enclosing Mr. Torrance's estimate.\n\nIf funds are available I recommend that this expenditure be approved.

If an oil burner were installed we are reasonably certain that an oil contract could be procured.\n\nIn the school which was destroyed by fire the heating unit was a hand fed forced draft hot air system. It was installed by Spiers Sheet Metal Company of Sarnia at a cost of $890.00, but the furnace was about 24\" whereas the Calcott Plumbing Company recommend a much larger furnace (about 35\") for $2000.00.\n\nThe Calcott Company is one of the best and largest heating and plumbing contractors in Sarnia. They are prepared to supply and completely install the heating unit in the school as per the enclosed tender, providing they are not bound down to any time limit. This is understandable in view of the present scarcity of heating units and furnace materials as well as experienced help.\n\nI am endeavouring to secure an estimate of cost of a completely installed heating unit from the Sarnia Heating & Electric Company and expect that it will be available the latter part of next week. It will be forwarded to the Department when received. I imagine their figure will be about the same as that of the Calcott Plumbing Company.\nThe contractor, Mr. Torrance, has made good progress in joining the two portions of the building. He has repaired the roof, put on the insul brick siding, altered the windows and painted the outside woodwork. In other words the project is sufficiently advanced to have another inspection by Mr. Doucet at which time he could give us further instructions regarding heating, plumbing and interior work.\n\nAs soon as possible arrangements should be made to pay Mr. Torrance, the contractor, the initial sum of $3000.00 as detailed in his tender. To date he has not signed any contract.\n\nI might add that the Chief and Council on the insistence of agitator Telford Adams and Reverend McKenzie are still demanding that rear or side exits for pupils in each classroom be provided. They are not satisfied to rely on children escaping through windows in case of fire and at a recent meeting of the Band the following resolution was passed:\n\n\"It was moved by Calvin Adams and seconded by Albert Oliver that the Band request the Department to install a rear exit or fire escape in the new school house now being erected on the Reserve.\"\n\nCarried.\n\nM. W. McCracken,\n\nSuperintendent, Sarnia Indian Agency.\n\nEnc.\nNovember 24, 1948.\n\nMr. M.W. McCracken,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nSarnia, Ontario.\n\nWe have your letter of the 20th instant regarding the heating unit in the St. Clair School.\n\nI enclose the estimated cost prepared by Calcott Plumbing Company. It is noted that this is directed to the general contractor.\n\nWe would appreciate it if you would have the firm prepare another estimate and the letter should be directed either to yourself or to The Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nIt is noted that the Calcott Plumbing Company state that their prices are approximate only. Is it possible to obtain from them a more definite estimate? We would also like their tender to include a statement indicating the length of time it will require for them to complete the contract if it was awarded to them.\n\nWe also note that you expect to obtain another tender from Sarnia Heating and Electric Company. Similar information should be obtained on this tender as requested in connection with the Calcott tender.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nPP/MGD\nChief, Education Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: St. Clair Indian Day School.\n\nI visited St. Clair Indian Day School this morning and found that the contractor, Mr. Torrance, has made good progress on the alterations. All of the outside work such as joining the two portions of the building, roofing, painting, cement work on the overhang, insul brick and cleaning up debris has been completed. The old partitions have been dismantled and a start has been made on the new partitions. Windows have been transferred and refitted to procure uniformity. Original windows on the ends and one side have been taken out and the openings recovered to form a solid wall. The sump pump has been repaired and is now being operated to keep the basement dry. All windows in the basement have been replaced with new ones. The existing hot water pipes have not been moved or disconnected pending a decision re the type of heating to be installed.\n\nMr. Torrance needs funds to enable him to finance the rest of the project which includes carpentry work, plumbing, electrical wiring and flooring, etc. He suggested that a payment of $6000.00 be made to him at the earliest possible date. It is imperative that he have same before Christmas. On the strength of the work which he has already done I think his request for $6000.00 is reasonable and should be given early attention. I pointed out to him that\nhe would likely have to sign a contract before any payment could be made so perhaps Mr. Doucet could bring the contract the next time he comes to Sarnia. It would appear advisable to have Mr. Doucet come to Sarnia in approximately two weeks from this date to go into matters pertaining to heating, plumbing, etc. as well as details re contract to be signed by Mr. Torrance.\n\nM.

I contacted the Calcott Plumbing Company and they are not very anxious to submit a more definite estimate, nor are they prepared to have any time limit set if they accept the contract. Mr. Calcott is endeavouring to obtain the exact price on the forced hot air heating unit. To do so he must communicate with the firm that supplies the furnace. He expects to hear from them in about one week. He has agreed to prepare a new tender addressed to me giving the exact cost for formed air heating with coal fired furnace. When this is received I shall forward it to the Department, but it may take some time as Mr. Calcott is very busy and is not particularly interested in getting the contract.\n\nEnclosed please find a tender complete with diagrams, etc., as submitted by Sarnia Heating and Electric Company for a forced air heating unit with hopper fed stoker at a cost of $2310.50. This company, if awarded the contract, is not prepared to agree to any time limit due to uncertain delivery.\n\nAs soon as the estimate is secured from the Calcott Plumbing Company it will be forwarded so that their tender and that of the Sarnia Heating and Electric may be compared.\n\nM.

Sarnia Heating and Electric Company, Sarnia, Ont., $2460.00\n\nPlease let us know at your convenience which of these companies is acceptable.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nAJD/HM.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nYou are aware that Miss Jean Morris commenced duties as intermediate teacher at St. Clair School in September, 1948. Miss Morris previously taught at Muncey where she enjoyed the use of the teachers' residence attached to the #1 Oneida School. When she transferred to Sarnia she was under the impression that the St. Clair teachers' residence would be available for her use. The Principal of the school, Mr. Dodson, took up residence in the St. Clair teacherage. He was not in favour of providing a room in the residence for Miss Morris and in a telephone conversation which I had with Colonel Neary I was advised that the St. Clair residence was for the Principal and Miss Morris had no claim respecting its use.\n\nMiss Morris secured accommodation with the local minister, Reverend C. W. McKenzie. He is charging her the ridiculous sum of $14.00 per week. Similar accommodation in the city of Sarnia could be procured for $10.00 to $12.00. Miss Morris would like to move from Mr. McKenzie's place as she finds him very difficult. She mentioned the matter of accommodation to Mr. Doucet and requested that the Department assume responsibility for payment of a portion of her housing expenses. I am in\nfavour of granting her a monthly allowance of possibly $25.00, but I do not think that the Department should pay anything as long as this teacher stays at Mr. McKenzie's place. In all probability he would increase her rate of board when he found out that the Department was giving her an allowance.\n\nMiss Morris is trying to locate a small apartment or rooms with kitchen privileges and if she is successful I recommend that she be granted up to $25.00 a month to defray rental costs.\n\nM. W. McCracken,\nSuperintendent, Sarnia Indian Agency.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: St. Clair School - Military Building,\nSarnia Reserve.\n\nAttention: Mr. A. J. Doucet,\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of \"Contract Agreement\" for $800.00 which you forwarded for signature of Mr. Tracy Torrance.\n\nOn December 13th I interviewed Mr. Torrance and he signed the Contract. He also gave me a certified cheque for $800.00, being the 10% deposit. It was with considerable hesitation that he agreed to sign as he did not entirely approve of article 1 on the bottom of page 1 in the Agreement. I gave him official receipt No. D76065 for the $800.00 payment. At 9:00 o'clock on the morning of December 14th Mr. Torrance appeared at this office and requested that the Contract be not forwarded to the Department as he was not entirely satisfied with it in its present form. He stated that he would be able to finance the project if I refunded the $800.00. It appeared advisable for me to do so and I returned the cheque to him and cancelled the receipt.\nMr. Torrance is now attending to the plumbing and electrical work. He expects to have same almost completed the latter part of January, 1949. He suggests that Mr. Doucet defer his visit until that time. I think Mr. Torrance will be quite willing to sign the Contract but before doing so he wishes to have Mr. Doucet inspect the building and discuss the matter personally with him. His original tender was for $7200.00 which did not include moving. The moving costs of $1200.00 along with an estimated $300.00 for permits brings the total to $8700.00. The mover, Mr. Hagen, is refusing to pay the cost of the permits which leaves a deficit of $700.00. To make up part of this Mr. Torrance would accept the twelve radiators which will not now be used in the school building. This contractor is sincere and is very anxious to do satisfactory work on the building. I do not anticipate any major complications, but as above stated Mr. Torrance would like a personal interview with Mr. Doucet before signing any Agreement. I therefore recommend that matters remain as they are until the latter part of January and suggest that Mr. Doucet endeavour to come to Sarnia at that time. I might add that as of this date Mr. Torrance and I estimate that 75% of his Contract has been completed.\n\nM. W. McCracken,\nSuperintendent, Sarnia Indian Agency.\nDecember 20, 1948.\n\nMr. M.W. McCracken,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nSarnia, Ontario.\n\nWe received your letter of December 7th with reference to living accommodation for Miss Jean Morris, teacher of the St. Clair School.\n\nOwing to present regulations, we cannot issue a cheque direct to Miss Morris for renting of living accommodation. However, if she is successful in securing a small apartment or rooms as mentioned in the last paragraph of your letter, we are prepared to allow for the balance of the current academic year, an amount of $25.00 a month.\n\nAs just stated, this cheque will have to be issued in favour of the person from whom the accommodation is rented.\n\nBernard F.

His contract price for this is $1,200, which includes cost of permit, expenses re removal of telephone and hydro wires, railway crossing permits, etc. He is prepared to do this work early in August and estimates that it will take about one week.\"\n\nDid you obtain a signed contract from Mr. Hagen along the lines quoted above?\n\nBernard F.

I was present when Mr. Hagen and Mr. Torrance\narrived at this figure. Both Mr. Torrance and myself\nbelieved that the $1200.00 figure included cost of all\npermits such as highway, railway and expenses re moving\nof telephone and hydro wires. Mr. Torrance and I considered\nrequesting the mover, Mr. Hagen, to sign an Agreement, but\nhe did not appear anxious for the job and we thought that\nhe might refuse to do the work if we insisted on having\nhim sign any papers. Therefore no signed contract between\nthis office and Mr. Hagen nor between Mr. Torrance and Mr.\nHagen was prepared.\n\nWhen the moving was completed Mr. Hagen requested\nMr. Torrance to pay the cost of all permits and wire moving\nin addition to the $1200.00 which makes a total of approx-\nimately $1500.00 rather than $1200.00. Mr. Torrance refused\nand nothing was done in the matter until about two weeks\nbefore Christmas. Mr. Hagen then visited this office and I\nwas successful in having him sign a document to the effect\nthat he would accept $1300.00 in full payment for moving the building.

In the same letter you will note that I forwarded a copy of a Council resolution in which they recommended that the Training Division at Ottawa pay the Blue Water Fire Department the sum of $200.00. I do not appear to have received a reply to my letter, although I think I recall mentioning it to Mr. Doucet on one of his trips to Sarnia Agency and as I remember he stated that the matter of paying the account was still under consideration.\n\nAt the regular monthly Council Meeting of Sarnia Band held on May 3rd, 1949 the Chief presented the enclosed letter which he had received from the Blue Water Rate Payers' Association. In this letter you will note that the Association is requesting a donation from Band funds to reimburse the Blue Water Fire Department. The Chief and Council are somewhat annoyed because the Training Division had not seen fit to pay the Blue Water Fire Department. In the course of the discussion they pointed\nout that if a fire occurred on the Reserve the Blue Water Fire Department would refuse to render any assistance because they had not been paid for fighting the school fire. Eventually the Council decided that it would be in the best interests of the Band if a donation were made from their funds and the following resolution was passed:\n\n\"Moved by James B. Williams, seconded by Albert Oliver that a contribution of One Hundred Dollars from Band funds be made to the Blue Water Volunteer Fire Department.\"\n\nCarried.\n\nThe Chief and Council pointed out that the recommendation to make a donation of $100.00 from Band funds should not be construed to mean that the $66.50 is to be ignored by the Training Division. In other words they expect the Training Division to pay $66.50 in addition to the $100.00 donation from Band funds.\n\nAs no provision for a grant of this nature from Band funds was made in the Sarnia budget for 1949 I presume that a Council resolution form I.A. 514 should be forwarded if the resolution is approved. Would you therefore kindly advise if the resolution meets with favourable consideration, and if so I will then procure and forward the necessary I.A. 514 form at the June meeting of the Council.\n\nM.

This brigade is maintained by voluntary contributions and entertainments.\n\nIn the effort to put out the fire at the school on the 26th January, 1948, 3 rubber raincoats & 3 pairs of rubber boots were destroyed. Also 12 fire extinguishers were used. Under the circumstances, we would be pleased if you would be kind enough to let us have a donation to help us pay our expenses.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBLUE WATER RATEPAYERS ASSOCIATION.\n\nH.

In lowering and raising it this company had bent the flag pole and had to heat it with electric torches to straighten the pole. It had not been painted for years, but the Shaw Construction Company nevertheless erected it. They also neglected to install a pulley at the top so that the flag could be raised and lowered.\n\nWhen the second St. Clair School was being officially opened it was necessary to take the flag pole down, scrape off the old paint, repaint it, purchase rope and pulleys and then raise the pole. It would have presented a very unsightly appearance if this work had not been done before the official opening. An Indian named James B. Williams quoted a price of $60.00 for the flag pole work. However, I got the contractor who built the school, Mr. Torrance, to perform the same satisfactorily for $45.00 which includes labour as well as rope, pulleys, etc.\n| DATE | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| May 27 | To payment for laying linoleum in front entrance of new St. Clair Indian Day School as per attached account: | 12.00  |\n\nAuthority - Verbal - Mr. Norris, May 19/49.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

Shortly after Mr. Doucet left Sarnia the contractor (Tracy Torrance) and Spiers Sheet Metals called me to find out who should bear the cost of doing this work. Each thought that the other should be responsible. Spiers Sheet Metals absolutely refused to install the pit with the result that installation of the furnace was at a standstill. I therefore instructed Mr. Torrance, the contractor, to do it and intended to discuss the matter of payment personally with Mr. Doucet when he came to Sarnia. It now appears that he will not be coming\nuntil late in July or early in August so I am forwarding the account for Departmental consideration.

Neary,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nRe grants for teacherage, Sarnia Reserve.\n\nDear Mr. Neary,\n\nSchool is over and partitions in hall are down. Hope to take up flooring next week. This material is to build garage and part of verandah for teacherage. You will recall the Dep't paid $100.00 for lumber for garage. I purchased the remainder from Mr. Morrance to get material for a verandah. This is much needed as a protection for the front door. The storm door has already been blown from our hands and broken. The verandah will be a saving on fuel as well. This was evidenced at Moraviantown when we enclosed the front open verandah.\n\nThis week we had 40 loads of top soil brot in for foundation of a garden on the West side of teacherage, on the driveway leading to garage and for foundation of a lawn on north side of house. We hope to level off for grass, leaving a sloping side on the north edge where we expect to have a rock garden. From this there will have to be soil brot in to finish to ditch. This can be done next year. This fall will see, I hope, the terrace completed. Some muck will have to be put on fill to ensure a catch of grass seed. We were able to get the 40 loads without cost when a ditch was being repaired.\n\nWhat I would like to know, now, is how much of a grant can we\nlook for this year.\n\nYou will recall, I think, that I said I would do the work on garage if it were framed. I can put siding and roof on after Mr. Torrence frames the building. A cement foundation seems to be the better one, a wall of about 8 feet including footing is sufficient. This will cost about $25.00 alone. I would very much like to know just how much money the Dep't will allow this year so that we can get going on the garage. I had thought of having a gravel floor in garage for the present. It had been suggested that a cement slab be put in to serve as floor and as a footing for the walls. I have not asked Mr. Torrence just how much his charge will be for framing the building. Some new timber will have to be bot for plates.\n\nThe windows from the Ipperwash building are the property of Mr. Torrence but I thought I would buy sufficient from him. The verandah will extend the full width of the building and just wide enough to make use of the cement entrance to door. A wider one would be better but it would entail much more expense. This would be glassed in and screened in. The ship-lap could be used for siding in the expectation that insul-brick be put on later to conform to the general type of buildings.\n\nThese are the plans for this year. More to come re grounds next year.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nFred J. Dodson.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nEnclosed please find a letter written by Principal Dodson of St. Clair Indian Day School on Sarnia Reserve in connection with building a garage and verandah for the teachers' residence and general improvements to the grounds.\n\nIn my opinion it would be advisable to make a further sum of $100.00 available so that at least some of the improvements mentioned in Mr. Dodson's letter may be carried out this year. I suggest that approximately $50.00 of the above-mentioned sum be authorized for the foundation and framing of the garage and the remaining $50.00 be used to purchase black loam and grass seed, etc. for the lawns.\n\nWould you please advise if the above grant can be made? If so, an accountable advance cheque for $100.00 for general improvements to the teachers' residence should be forwarded c/o Sarnia Indian Agency Trust Account.\n\nM. W.

Torrance, 853 E. Wellington Street, Sarnia, Ontario, being in payment for repair work performed at St. Clair Indian Day School.\n\nThe junior classroom in St. Clair School is located in the basement. It was opened on September 6th under a new teacher, Mrs. Omond. Blackboards in this room were destroyed in the fire and we had to have new ones installed on the concrete wall. We had blackboard material on hand, but other materials such as lumber for the frame and bolts, etc. were supplied by Mr. Torrance at a cost of $14.95. His labour in installing twenty-eight feet of blackboard in the junior room of this school amounted to $40.00 which is a reasonable amount for the work involved.\n\nThe coal bin at the school had to have a partition to separate the stoker coal from the egg size anthracite. The stoker coal is used in the furnace in the school and\nthe egg size anthracite is for the teacher's residence. An extra doorway had to be cut in as indicated on the account. The total cost of the materials and labour for alterations and partition in the coal bin amounted to $31.54.\n\nThe above-mentioned work was very necessary and I recommend that the account be paid. Mr. Torrance, the man who did the work, was the contractor who rebuilt the present school and converted it from a military building into four classrooms.\n\nM. W. McCracken,\nSuperintendent, Sarnia Indian Agency.\n\nEncs. 4\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: St. Clair Indian Day School.\n\nI wish to refer to your letter 436-5 of August 2nd, 1949 in connection with a proposed visit by Mr. Doucet and a heating engineer to inspect the heating unit which Spiers Sheet Metal Company installed in the above-mentioned building.\n\nOn two or three occasions I have been definitely instructed that a fire should not be started in the furnace until the unit had been inspected.

Dodson,\nSt.Clair Indian Day School,\nBlue Water, Ontario...........\n\n\"Ottawa's Most Popular Sports Centre\"\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nI wish to refer to Purchase Order #49354 dated October 13th, 1949 covering the purchase of 12 kindergarten chairs for use in the St. Clair Indian Day School. The purchase order was in favour of Henderson Furniture Company, St. Lambert, Quebec.\n\nThese kindergarten chairs have been received. However, the junior teacher and Principal have informed me that desks rather than kindergarten chairs were required. No requisition for kindergarten chairs was submitted through this office and I am rather mystified as to how they came to be ordered. Mrs. Omond, the junior teacher, states that she can use the chairs and that they will be more suitable than the small kindergarten chairs which are already on hand. Many of the pupils in Grade 1 who will be using these chairs are older and bigger than ordinary Grade 1 pupils. In view of the fact that the chairs have already been shipped, I suggest that we keep them for use in the St. Clair School.\nThe 18 large size chair desks ordered by the Principal on requisition dated October 15th, 1949 are still required. When Mr. A. J. Doucet visited Walpole Island recently the desk situation at St. Clair School was discussed and he suggested that I submit a requisition outlining our requirements.\n\nI have instructed the teachers at St. Clair School to leave the kindergarten chairs in the packing cases in the event that you wish them returned. It would be rather expensive to pay shipping charges if they were to be returned and after giving the matter careful consideration we believe that the chairs can be put to good use in the St. Clair School. Kindly advise at an early date as to your wishes with regard to keeping or returning the kindergarten chairs and also advise if you intend to approve of the purchase of an additional 18 large size chair desks as per requisition dated October 15th.\n\nM. W. McCracken\n\nM. W. McCracken,\nSuperintendent, Sarnia Indian Agency.\nNovember 4, 1949.\n\nMr. M.W. McCracken,\nSupt. of Indian Agency,\nSarnia, Ont.\n\nYour File 225-9 (29)\n\nYour letter of the 1st instant has been referred to me for attention.\n\nYou will recall the discussion that we had re the two activity tables that were sent to various schools on a experimental basis. The chairs that have been sent are to accompany these tables - six of the larger chairs for the senior room and six of the others for the junior room.

The living-room and two bed-rooms have not been painted or decorated since the school was built and they are very dirty and badly in need of fresh paint and calcimine. I would suggest that the floors have a coat of jap-a-lac. The windows have no curtains and I believe that it would only be right to furnish them. The floors are bare without any carpets of any kind and I would suggest buying two small floor mats for the rooms.\n\nThey also require:\n\n- 10 Geographies for classes 3 and 4.\n- 10 Arithmetics\n- 10 Histories\n- 1 large bottle of ink,\n- 1 large box of crayons.\n\nR.H. Abraham\n\nalso 8 yds curtain\nx 1 Mat for living Room\nOTTAWA, Sept. 16th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. R. H. Abraham, Agricultural Representative of this Department, who recently visited the Rama Reserve, states that the teachers' quarters have not been painted or decorated since the school was built, and that they are very dirty and badly in need of fresh paint and kalsomine. He also recommends that the floors receive a coat of Jap-a-lac, and that window curtains be supplied. He also recommends that 2 small floor mats for the bedrooms and a floor covering for the living room be supplied.\n\nI have to request that you will be good enough to furnish a report regarding the painting and kalsomining which you would recommend should be done. It is considered that if the woodwork was given one coat of paint and the walls and ceiling kalsomined that this would be sufficient. You should also furnish an estimate of the cost of supplying 2 small floor mats for the bedrooms and oilcloth or congoleum for the living room, and also the cost of the curtains required for the windows.\n\nI will be pleased if you will give this matter your prompt attention.\n\nMr. Abraham also recommended that a number of school books be furnished and these are being ordered from the Government Stationery Office here.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The material required for the painting and decorating should be purchased by you after first obtaining competitive prices, and the purchase should be made from the firm quoting the lowest price.\n\nYou should see that this work is undertaken at an early date and that the teachers are not put to any inconvenience other than absolutely necessary.\n\nWhen the work has been completed to your satisfaction, you should furnish properly receipted vouchers, in duplicates, covering the cost of the material and labour.

McLean Esq\nAsst Deputy and Secretary\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\n[Stamp]\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCHATHAM, ONT.\nNov. 3, 1922.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWhile at the Rama Reserve recently, Miss Bowman drew my attention to the fact that they have nothing but straight backed chairs in their living quarters and they would like very much being provided with a couple of rocking chairs. They also require tan window blinds the windows being without them at the present time.\n\nI beg to recommend that the above purchase be authorized. I think the least that we could do would be to provide an easy chair for the teachers.\n\nThey have also a bill for $4 for installation of a light in the hall of the school. They state that when they come in at night they have to walk through the dark hall to turn on the light in their living quarters. They also state that when there is an entertainment at the school that this light is very necessary. They paid for the installation of this light, $4, and I think that it should be refunded to them as it is a permanent fixture in the school and was quite necessary.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.D. McLean, Secy.,\nDept. of Ind. Aff.,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nR. H. ABRAHAM,\nAgr. Rep. Dept. of Ind.

D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nR. H. Abraham, Esq.,\nAgricultural Representative,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nChatham, Ont.\nOTTAWA, November 9th, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Abraham, Agricultural Representative of this Department, who recently visited the Rama Reserve, states that the teachers of the Rama Indian Day School requested that two rocking chairs be supplied for the use of the teachers' living quarters, and also that 10 window blinds be supplied, as the windows are without blinds at the present time.\n\nThe Department will approve of the two chairs and ten window blinds being supplied, and I have to request that you will arrange for the purchase and delivery of the same. If possible, competitive prices should be obtained and the purchase made from the firm quoting the lowest price. While serviceable articles should be obtained, it is not intended that any undue expenditure be incurred. Before making the purchase, you should consult the teachers as to their requirements.\n\nMr. Abraham further states that the teachers have an account for $4.00 for the installation of a light in the hall of the school. He states that, as this light was urgently required, the teachers paid for its installation, and they should be recouped for their outlay. You should forward a properly certified voucher, with receipt attached, covering the expenditure incurred in order that the account can be paid.\n\nYou should also furnish properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the two rocking chairs and the ten window blinds.\n\nYou should give these matters your prompt attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

STICKLE, TORONTO.\n\nOriginal on 24-1-1.\n\nIn reply to your questions, I may say that the residence is attached to the classrooms and accommodates both senior and junior teachers. It is furnished with the necessary furniture and equipment, with the exception of linens, etc. The building is heated by a furnace in the basement. There is a supplementary unit in the senior room and a cook stove in the kitchen. Fuel is supplied by the Department and a janitor employed.\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, with reference to the conditions of the engagement of Mrs. Stickle, newly appointed senior teacher at the Rama Indian Day School. It is true that the Department is particularly interested in household science, but I am not prepared to authorize the supplying of a sewing machine at the present time. Later, after the work is well under way, if this equipment appears to be urgently needed, you may again bring the matter to the attention of the Department.\n\nThere is no change of policy in connection with what should be supplied to the teachers at this school, but I wish to make Mrs. Stickle feel as comfortable as possible. In my offer to her, I stated that the necessary furniture and equipment, with the exception of linens, etc., was provided. I mentioned that fuel was supplied by the Department and a janitor employed. I consider that the teachers should continue to pay the electric light charges and supply the smallware, etc., necessary.\n\nWith reference to the time table and course of studies to be followed, you may inform Mrs. Stickle that the Department wishes her to be guided by the curriculum prescribed by the Ontario Department of Education. She should give the practical work particular emphasis and should endeavour to correlate classroom exercises with the activities of the children's homes and environment. You might refer Mrs. Stickle to the advice and instructions printed on the covers of the classroom register.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. S.

When replying to this letter, stating the minor repairs absolutely necessary to the plaster and outside steps, please furnish, also, an estimate of the cost of scraping the floors in the living quarters and painting same. Please indicate if you would recommend that the work be done, and, if so, give an estimate of the cost of all work which you consider absolutely necessary.\n\nYou should give this matter your prompt attention, in order that any work authorized can be carried out during the present summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. S. Anderson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLongford Mills,\nOnt.\nDear Sir,\n\nI know that money is very scarce but I also consider this a necessity. Our kitchen is the only room on the main floor. Of course every person who comes to the house passes through the kitchen. The walls look very dirty. They were redecorated about six years ago. Nothing has been done to them since as they were calculated.\nThis is my suggestion. Would you please pay for the papering of it if I paid for the paper? I am sure that it would only take half a day to do the work.\n\nI hope this meets with your approval. I did not suggest this to Mr. Anderson until only thought of the plan last evening.\n\nHoping to receive a favorable reply from you in the near future, and thanking you,\n\nI remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Name]\nOttawa, October 24, 1933.\n\nMadam:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 19th instant, with reference to the papering of the kitchen in the teacher's living quarters at the Rama Indian Day School, I have to inform you that this matter is being referred to Mr. Agent Anderson for a report.

She states that she will supply the paper if the Department will pay for the services of a paper hanger to do the work.\n\nThe teacher should have taken this matter up with you direct, instead of writing the Department. As you are aware, our funds are extremely limited. However, I would request that you report concerning the necessity for having the work done, and, if you recommend same, you should state the cost of having the papering done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

It was therefore moved by Chief Plain, seconded by Alfred Rodd; that we ask the Department for a grant to cover the cost of building a teacher's residence.\n\nCarried.\nSir:\n\nWith reference to Minute of Sarnia Reserve Council held on Sept. 1, regarding erection of a teacher's residence at St. Clair School, Sarnia Reserve, I would recommend approval of this resolution by the Department when funds are available for this purpose.\n\nThe people of the Reserve are showing much more interest in the school since a new teacher has been appointed and I believe with a teacher's residence on the Reserve there would be a great improvement in the benefits which the pupils and parents derive from the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Indian Agent\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes, Esq.\nSec'y, Dept. Mines & Resources\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOTTAWA, Canada\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRegarding my telephone conversation on Friday, July 18th with Col. Neary I beg to report further in connection with converting the old St. Clair School into a teacherage.\n\nI requested the Shaw Construction Company of Sarnia to explore the possibilities and give me a rough estimate of the cost.\n\nThis single classroom is $24'3\"$ x $31'9\"$. It is on a good cement foundation and the building is red brick. It has a good roof and good hardwood floor. Of course the floor would have to be sanded to make it suitable for a teacherage.\n\nThe present classroom could be partitioned to allow for the following rooms:\n\n- 2 bedrooms each $9' x 11'$\n- 1 front room $11' x 13'$\n- 1 dining room $13' x 16'$\n- 1 kitchen $13' x 16'$\n- 1 bathroom $9'11\" x 5'9\\frac{1}{2}\"\n\nWater pressure system is available by tapping the existing line now serving the new St. Clair School. The building could be wired for electricity as hydro is also available. This building could be heated by an oil heater. The large bell and turret presently on the roof could be removed.\n\nEstimated cost of conversion which would include everything except oil heater, septic tank, wiring and bathroom fixtures would be $1500.00. The total cost would probably be $2500.00 and if this amount were spent I think we would have a comfortable residence large enough to accommodate two teachers.\n\nShaw Construction Company are reasonably certain that they could procure the necessary materials as and when required and estimate that the entire conversion could be completed in three weeks. I think they are somewhat optimistic re the time element. Under existing conditions I think it might take possibly six weeks. The Shaw Construction Company could commence alterations almost at once.\n\nYour further comments with regard to advisability of spending $2500.00 or perhaps $3000.00 in reconverting this building into a teacherage will be awaited.\n\nM.

W. McCracken at Sarnia Agency and recorded in the Official Cash Book.\n\nAmount $747.00\n\nAgency Receipt No. 275\n\nPayer on account of unexpended balance advance Cheque No. S-58677 for conversion of old St. Clair Indian Day School into teacherage - 436-516-10-998.\n\nFor Treasury Branch\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nI wish to refer to telegram of August 13th, 1947 from Colonel Neary authorizing an expenditure not to exceed $3100.00 for conversion of the old St. Clair School into a teacher's residence.\n\nThe sum of $800.00 was forwarded to pay for labour out of which only $53.00 was spent (receipt #34257). The balance of $747.00 has already been returned to the Chief Treasury Officer under cover of Receiver General returns for period ending November 30th, 1947. The above-mentioned $53.00 was paid to an Indian bricklayer for building a new chimney. Shaw Construction Company paid all other accounts for materials and labour as the job progressed.\n\nFirst of all you will note that the total claimed by the company is $6800.54 which is more than double their estimated cost of $3100.00.\n\nThe mere fact that this company would not take a contract for this job (see my letter with enclosure from Shaw Construction Company dated July 30th) leads one to suspect that they intended to make a killing on the cost plus 15% basis, the same as they did on the new St. Clair School which cost $2000.00 rather than $24000.00, the original estimate.\n\nClose examination of the various accounts attached herewith reveals that the company is endeavouring to collect for a great amount of materials which were definitely not used on our building. This fact is quite obvious even to a layman as in this particular building all materials which were used are more or less in plain view and easily discernible. I am quite certain that much of the material for which we are being charged was used by the company on other jobs.\n\nWhen the St. Clair School was being built I heard the Superintendent of the company remark that the high cost of same was of\nsecondary importance as the Government has lots of money and could well afford to pay. I believe they proceeded on this basis when doing the new St. Clair School and continued the same policy when doing the conversion work on the St. Clair teachers' residence. On a cost plus basis it was definitely to the contractor's advantage to prolong the job so as to collect more fee on the time of the men employed and also to charge us for time of men who never worked the number of hours claimed. While the renovating of the residence was in progress I tried to check closely on the cost so as not to exceed the amount allotted and the last time just a week or two before completion their Superintendent told me the total cost was not likely to exceed $4000.00. It is, in my opinion, strange that the total cost jumped from $4000.00 to $6800.00 in so short a time.\n\nAt the present time Shaw is apparently in a law suit with the City of Sarnia. He is trying to collect $225.00 for a job which the city engineer claims would be amply paid for at $125.00. This, in itself, shows how exorbitant Shaw's charges are.\n\nAn example of overcharging on the new school and residence jobs is quite evident in the case of the foreman, E. Angeliski, who, you will note, was paid a weekly wage of $65.00 during the time these jobs were in progress. I can assure you that on the many occasions that I made trips to note the advancement of the jobs the carpenters repeatedly told me when I inquired for the foreman that he was doing another job for Imperial Oil. They said he usually dropped in for a few minutes between 9:00 and 10:00 A.M. and sometimes before closing time in the afternoon and I might see him then if I could wait. Even then, after waiting around he often times did not appear. In view of this example I am extremely skeptical of time spent on the job by all men on Shaw's paylists.\n\nThe company gave the heating and plumbing as a sub-contract to Spiers' Sheet Metal and you will note that Spiers' total bill for plumbing was $526.81 but this did not include two fixtures, i.e., kitchen sink ($35.20) and bathroom basin ($37.50) as the company obtained these themselves direct from Ace Plumbing Company. The total cost of plumbing was $619.51 whereas the plumbing estimate given us by Shaw was $515.00. I consider Spiers' account fairly reasonable although $14.30 should be deducted from Shaw's cheque as he paid them for a shower which was not ordered nor installed. Shaw can then recover the $14.30 from Spiers as he should not have paid them for a shower in the first place.\nOn or about October 21st when practically all of the work had been completed the Superintendent of Shaw Construction Company at my request sent their bulldozer to the site to level off the clay fill and gravel which they had placed in mounds around the new St. Clair School and residence. The foreman who had been in charge of the renovating of the residence was not present when the bulldozer arrived. However the driver of the bulldozer commenced levelling and ran into the septic tank serving the residence. This powerful machine crushed the septic tank and outlet tile like a leaf and loosened all the plumbing pipes attached thereto. Shaw instructed Spiers Sheet Metal to install another septic tank and repair the twisted and broken pipes. The expenses re this as per Spiers' invoice dated October 22nd were $62.44. In addition a number of Shaw's workmen were sent to dig up the crushed tank, pump water and replace broken tile. The labour for Shaw's men re this connection amounted to $315.50 (see week of October 20th to 25th). Charging us for this utter negligence on their part is ridiculous as their foreman should have been present to point out the location of the septic tank to the operator of the bulldozer.\n\nThe total expenses resulting from Shaw's error amount to $379.94 plus his fee of 15% or $457.65 which we should certainly not pay.\n\nThe only drainage that was performed to my knowledge was in laying a tile drain from the residence to the road ditch to serve as an outlet for the septic tank. This is seventy-five feet and as tile used were one foot in length it would require seventy-five 4\" tile. You will note that Shaw is charging us for seven hundred and eighty-five tile as per accounts from James Builders dated September 26th and September 29th at a cost of $39.68 instead of the actual cost of seventy-five tile used on this job at a cost of $3.75. A reduction of $35.93 from Shaw should be made re the above.\n\nWith regard to Spiers sub-contract for heating I would refer you to the original estimate of $950.00. When this estimate was prepared everyone assumed that a completely new heating unit would have to be installed. Later it was decided that the old coal furnace previously used in the St. Clair School would suffice rather than buy a new unit. The total expenditure for heating apparatus with the exception of the erection of the chimney was $355.91 and by using the old furnace a considerable saving over the original estimate was effected.\n\nThe estimate of $204.42 for wiring was exceeded as this figure covered a two wire service whereas I instructed Chambers Electric to install a three wire circuit. Light fixtures throughout the residence\ncosting $24.25 were not included in the original estimate and if they had been the original estimate would have been $228.67. In my opinion the work performed by Chambers Electric was quite satisfactory and his charges of $399.89 are justified as he also performed extra work in connection with installing a circuit for the forced draft heating system.\n\nThe painting would not have been required immediately and was omitted in the original estimate but gyproc partitions and ceiling were substituted for lath and plaster thus making painting essential. The painting price included the sanding of floors at a total cost of $693.66\u2014a sum which was agreed upon between the painter and myself after much dispute since the bill the painter, Stanley Angeliski, first submitted was $900.00. This painting and sanding was also done on an hourly basis and when I discovered the ridiculous bill the painter was running up I dismissed him and all his helpers before the job was finished, and my wife and I finished the painting and floors ourselves. It was obvious that the painter, Stanley Angeliski, brother of Shaw's foreman, Edward Angeliski, was copying Shaw's tactics in prolonging the job and running up a bill on the hourly basis. Shaw paid Stanley Angeliski the sum of $693.66 which I eventually authorized but this painter is drunk most of the time and we cannot locate him to sign a receipt although Shaw apparently has the cancelled cheque as proof of payment.\n\nA total of $454.00 is being charged by Shaw for clay fill and gravel. About 75% of this clay and gravel was for the new St. Clair School and the balance was for the residence. When Mr. P. Fhe'an visited Sarnia Agency last August we discussed the placing of cinders or crushed stone around the school. The Shaw Construction Company later convinced me that a quantity of clay fill and pit run gravel would be necessary to fill in huge mud holes which had resulted from trucks, etc., bringing materials on wet days when the school and residence were being built in the Fall of 1946 and Spring and Fall of 1947. I authorized a reasonable amount of clay and gravel to level the grounds and cover septic tanks and drains so they would not freeze but I had no idea that the cost had mounted to $454.00. I was misled by the company in the benefit to be derived from the clay fill and gravel as it has resulted in a muddy sticky mess around the school yard and residence. It may, however, pack down and provide a fairly good base by next year. I believe the company is trying to charge us for much more fill and gravel than was actually supplied. I consider it fair if they were to be allowed $200.00 instead of $454.00. This $454.00 is included in the company's claim against the residence whereas most of it should be a separate charge against the St. Clair School as pointed out to Colonel Neary when he visited Sarnia Agency last October.\nThe company has submitted a separate claim of $391.64 for laying sidewalk and I am enclosing his account under cover of voucher #577 in this connection. The sidewalk runs from the road to the new school where it joins and leads from there to the front steps of the residence. The cement steps in front of the residence are included in the sidewalk account. The contractor gave me a verbal estimate of $225.00 for this sidewalk which did not include the residence steps. The fact that the residence steps were also built at the same time increased the cost of the sidewalk but not to the extent of $166.64. I think $300.00 would be a fair amount to allow rather than $391.64.\n\nWhen the conversion work was actually commenced a few defects not previously taken into consideration were discovered. For instance window sash, frames, etc., were quite rotten and completely new ones with glass had to be purchased for all but one window. The old brick chimney could not be used with the new heating unit and a new one had to be built. The large bell and wooden tower on the residence had to be dismantled and the shingle roof patched where the turret had been attached. The wiring was changed from a two to a three wire service. Linoleum for kitchen and bathroom floors at a cost of $14.03 were necessary as well as blinds at $5.10. These were not figured in the original estimate but none of them increased the cost to any great degree and the extra expenditures were more than offset by utilizing the old furnace rather than purchasing a new one as originally planned.\n\nWe have a compact, comfortable and modern residence here now although it is not in any sense elaborate as Shaw's account would lead one to believe. It consists of two bedrooms, living-room, dining-room, kitchen, bath and furnace room all on one floor and will provide suitable sleeping and living quarters for two or possibly three single teachers if all were of the same sex. It is also large enough to accommodate a married teacher and his or her family if desired. We moved into this residence on October 4th as authorized in Departmental letter 29-1-1 of September 1st, 1947.\n\nOn an attached sheet I have listed the various items which were not used on the job and I have indicated reductions which I consider should be made in Shaw's claim. However, before Shaw is paid I think it would be wise to have a Departmental building engineer inspect the teachers' residence to confirm my statements re the contractor's exorbitant charges and claims for time and materials which were never spent or used on this building.\nI strongly recommend that this claim of Shaw Construction for $6800.54 under voucher #578 be paid at and that the amount for laying sidewalk under voucher #577 be paid at $300.00. If such action is taken the original estimate to convert the old school into a residence for two teachers will not have been exceeded to any great extent.\n\nI also wish to point out that one of the workmen purchased the old window frames at a cost of seventy-five cents each or a total of $6.00. The foreman, E. Angeliski, said he would deduct this from the time of the workman but the bookkeeper of Shaw's on being questioned regarding same admitted that no deduction had been made to his knowledge. Some small tools valued at $12.85, being two cold chisels and one lantern, were transferred from the new school job to the teachers' residence job. The auditor indicated that we should be allowed a credit of 50% of the cost. On the enclosed account no credit of this nature has been allowed.\n\nM. W. McCracken\n\nM. W.

Doughty\n\nAJD/MGD\n\nCopy sent to Melchior - see letter type 12/48\nRE: Ipperwash Camp\n\nI have noted on the plan lent me by the Trust Branch the number of the buildings available to the Indian Affairs. They are Nos. 11, 12, 13, 14, 41, 44, 45 and 46. No. 11 is a salvage shed, well constructed on a cement floor, it is 20' x 60'. Nos. 12, 13 and 14 are H. Huts. No. 12 is intact but Nos. 13 and 14 have been partly dismantled.\n\nThe inside Gyprock and insulation have been removed. The hot water heating system and plumbing are intact. There is very good material left in 13 and 14 which could be used to advantage. These huts are 24' x 120'.\n\nNo. 41 is the Dental Clinic and would be very practical as classrooms. It is 24' x 70'.\n\nThe problem is to find out if these buildings can economically be transported. If so, one might be set on the present foundation of the burnt school.\n\nA second plan would be to rebuild the school from material available from the camp. Considerable material of the school is usable in its present shape. The beams appear sound as well as the joists, the sub floor and some walls.\n\nI would suggest that immediate steps be taken to investigate the cost of transporting these buildings should it prove to be feasible.\nI would also suggest that Mr. McCracken be notified to put up posters forbidding any person entering the burnt school as considerable danger exists. Decision on what is to be done is urgent as special attention is necessary to the conditions of the salvage.\n\nA.J.

The bread box (52-L259) is not required. The arm chair (070-162) should be of wine shade to conform with the colour scheme in the residence. Kerosene and oil lamps are not required as this residence is wired for hydro. It is suggest that one lamp (electric Trilight) (077-217) at a cost of $1.95 be purchased, as well as one table lamp (077-187) at $3.15. An electric toaster (77-311) costing $2.95 is necessary. An electric iron (77-363) and cord (77-455) at a total cost of $4.60 should be purchased. If the electric iron is ordered the sad iron set (0353-137) should be eliminated. One set of blue plastic curtains (149-143) and one set of green plastic curtains are needed. Five pairs of curtains (dotted marquisette) (68-510) at $1.50 a pair are required in addition to the plastic curtains. The dish pan (52 L 186) is not necessary. As previously mentioned this building is wired for a hydro stove and I suggest that an electric rangette with automatic oven costing $79.95 be substituted for the Elgin kitchen range. Sink strainer (52-195) is not required. Linoleums are necessary in only the living room.\nand dining room. A runner for the hall should be purchased as well as mats for the bedrooms. I suggest that the following mats and linoleum rugs be supplied:\n\nMat:\n22\" x 36\" - Blue (72-244) $3.95\n22\" x 36\" - Rose (72-244) $3.95\n\nRug (Linoleum)\n9' x 12' - Pattern A (072-282) $9.50\n#23 - 7\u00bd\" x 9\" (53L830) $7.25\n36\" wide hall runner at 75\u00a2 running yard (072-304)\nPattern N - 3\u00bd yds. @ 75\u00a2 $2.65\n\nM.

McCracken,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nSarnia, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to the furnishings for the living quarters at the St. Clair School, the Purchasing Branch is being requested to order what we consider necessary.\n\nThe Department does not supply blankets or sheets and other linen.\n\nYou may purchase locally three window blinds so that you can secure the size required.\n\nRegarding the electric range, we are inclined to feel that it would not be satisfactory as you cannot use the oven at the same time as you are using the burners on the top. If you consider it essential to supply an electric stove, you should make further enquiries and let us know the type of stove you think would be suitable and at what cost it can be secured in Sarnia.

Some of the stores in this city did not have any for sale. Others had some stoves but salesmen pointed out that they had to be purchased almost immediately or else some other person buys them. For this reason it is impossible for me to state the name and address of any firm who would be in a position to supply a stove.

F.B. Neary,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nDear Mr. Neary,\n\nI wish to express our appreciation of the very helpful way Mr. Superintendent McCracken is striving to make things congenial for us. We enjoy working with him.\n\nThere seems to be some delay in furnishing the Teacherage. The Super't ordered these in July but few things have arrived. He was requested to get quotations on electric stoves which he sent on to Ottawa. So far no word of stoves have arrived. We are told there were a number of 4 burner stoves on the floor at Eaton's in Toronto. There was a 4 br. at $229 in London and a 2 br. at $129. These were sent in. The 4 br. would be better for a home. The 2 br. would be better than a rangette. We would like to have a stove of some kind before Christmas.\n\nThe bed-room furniture and kitchen table and chairs are at Station today. Cooking utensils have also arrived.\n\nIf the Department feels that the 4 br. is too expensive we hope the 2 br. will soon be along. We appreciate the fact that there is a lot of money being spent on this project but think that good material will last longer in the long run.\n\nI am hoping that there will be enough lumber left over for a garage. If the Dept. would give the material I would be glad to arrange to have the work done. I could do most of it myself. If the frame work was put up I would do the rest myself.\n\nI realize much money is being spent so I shall be glad to lessen amount by doing as much work as I can. There will be a great deal of levelling to be done and much fill to be brought in before we can attempt to get any grass around house or school. Over a period of years much can be accomplished, tho.\n\nI hope you will be able to get things moving a little faster re Teacherage.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nFred J.

It is simply impossible to secure certified teachers for these amounts, and hence I venture to request the Department, through you, to sanction the appointment, for these three schools, of teachers recommended by me as to ability and moral character, even though not furnished with the customary certificate from the school inspectors.\n\nMay I ask you to be good enough to endorse my request, if you feel that you can properly do so, under the circumstances, and to forward it to the Department as soon as possible.\n\nYours faithfully,\nE. Algoma.\n\nJ. C. Shipp, Esq.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose a communication from the Bishop of Algoma requesting the Department to sanction the appointment of Teachers for the Spanish River, White Fish River and Sucker Creek Schools, recommended by the Bishop as to ability and moral character, even if not furnished with a certificate from the School Inspector.\n\nAfter receipt of official letter dated 10th inst., I cannot recommend the Bishop's application being acceded to. I would however suggest that in cases where certified Teachers are not to be procured exceptions may sometimes be made, as for instance in the White Fish River School which has been closed for some time owing to inability to obtain a Teacher. The Spanish River School is likely to be closed also at the end of the current quarter, for a similar reason.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDepy Supt General of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa, Ont.\nSept 23 1891\n\nSir,\n\nI have been back the\nrect. of your letter of the\n14th Inst., enclosing a\ncommunication from\nHis Lordship the Bishop\nof Algoma, requesting\nthe Dept. to sanction\nthe appointment of\nTeachers for the Spanish\nRiver, White Fish\nRiver & Butten Creek\nSchools, who are\nrecommended by him\nas & ability & moral\ncharacter even if\nnot the possessors of\nregular Certificates.\n\nJ.

French, Esq.,\nLittle Current,\nOnt.\nEXAMINED\nSCHOOL BRANCH\n\nTHIS LETTER HAS BEEN SENT Ottawa 19th August 1905.\n\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your application addressed to the Honourable the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs for the position of teacher for the Sucker Creek Indian School, I have to say that the Department has had no intimation that the present teacher intends to resign his position.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nLouis French, Esq.\nLittle Current,\nOnt.\nSir,\n\nNaturally children with no exceptions resent confinement especially so with boys consequently they don't appreciate being kept in school-room during the best part of the day. They would sooner rebel the authority of the teacher if they dared to than to conform themselves to his rules and regulations. It seems to me it is just simply little less than wasting money in keeping up Indian schools that I have seen. The chief cause of the failure is that Indian children don't attend school regularly as they should, and punctuality is wanting in Indian schools on the part of the children and some times on the part of the teacher. It is very trying and discouraging to good, honest & faithful teachers to see Indian children wasting away their opportunities and privileges. There are also teachers who do not care whether their school is a success or failure as long as their quarterly payments come.\n\nAs I take great interest in education of the Indian children I would like to see the Indian Department take some remedial\nSteps to ward the failure of the Indian Day Schools. Entering into one of the houses at Sheguiandah Reserve last winter saw five or six boys spending the day there instead of spending their time in the School. \"This is the every day occurrence,\" said a woman that was there. Instead of these boys going to school when the bell rings they come here and remain around here during the school time. There is too much of this sort thing going on among the Indian Day Schools. Teachers cannot prevent it. Parents don't care or don't know any better. It is only the Dept. of Indian Affairs has authority to remedy this defect. I don't wish for a moment that Indian Department should exercise its authority tyrannically to ward the Indians about the schools.\n\nBut I believe it is for the advantage of the Indians that their children should attend the schools better or else send their children to Indian Homes or Institutions.\n\nTo the Deputy Dept. Gtth\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nJohn H. Esquimaux\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith copy of a letter from Mr John A. Esquimaux of Sucker Creek, relative to irregular attendance at Indian Day Schools; and in this connection I beg to say that the Department considers that it would be well, unless you know of grave reasons to the contrary, to enforce the Regulations regarding the compulsory education of Indian children, a copy of which was sent you on the 31st May last.

Ross as temporary teacher of the Sucker Creek School.\n\nI have the honor to report that under date 28th Ult I have received a letter from Rev Christopher C. Simpson at Little Current in which he advises me the Mr Ross failed to turn up and at the same time he nominated Mr Edwin R. Ward for the position. The letter above referred to was received at this Office on the 4th Inst. Under date 5th Inst. I receive a letter from Mr Edwin R. Ward from Little Current in which he informs me he is a candidate for the position of chief of Police for the Town of Little Current, that living is so expensive that he feels that a salary of $300. a year is quite inadequate as teacher at Sucker Creek. In view of the above I wrote The Rev Simpson and informed him that apparently his nominee did not want the position as teacher of Sucker Creek school, even before he had been recommended and approved of by the Department, and that I could not recommend the Department to confirm the appointment. At the same time I informed the Rev Gentleman where he could secure services of a qualified teacher for the position. This is how the matter stands at present. Your obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of date 7th Instant regarding the application of Mr Edwin Robert Ward for an increase in salary as teacher of the Sucker Creek School.\n\nI have the honor to refer you to my letter of 7th Instant in which I reported the nomination of this Gentleman for the position by the Rev Christopher C. Simpson of Little Current and my action in the matter.\n\nFurther I beg to report that I was at Little Current yesterday and in a conversation with the Reverend Mr Simpson I was informed by that Gentleman that he was of the opinion that Mr Ward was entirely unsuited for the position of teacher of the Sucker Creek School as his actions would lead to the opinion that he had \"rooms to let in his upper story\". He has applied for every position in sight around Little Current from Hotel Clerk to Chief of Police.\n\nMr Simpson informed me yesterday that he would inform Mr Ward today that he would not be required for the position and it is hoped that a duly qualified teacher will take charge of the school immediately after the holidays at Christmas.\n\nIn my letter of 7th Inst. I overlooked informing you that Mr Simpson in his letter of 28th Ult. stated that Mr Ward began his duties on the 23rd Inst.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 14, 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of the 7th and 10th inst. with reference to the appointment of Mr. Edwin Robert Ward as teacher of the Sucker Creek school, and in reply I beg to say that, in view of your remarks, the Department trusts that a suitable teacher can be secured to take Mr. Ward's place at once, to take charge after the Christmas holidays.\n\nA requisition for school supplies was received from Mr. Ward, but this will not be filled in the meantime.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.

The Rev Simpson told him I had been\nappointed School Teacher at Sucker Creek by the Board of\nEducation by himself as Lieutenant School Manager.\n\nMr. Smith replied he was going home to Manitoba and\nthat day (28 Nov) that he would advise why the Indian\nOffice officials at Ottawa of my appointment,\nthat I had commenced School Teaching on Monday 27 Nov/08,\nthe school having been closed since April last other\nMiss Ferguson left.\"\n\nThe Rev Simpson wrote the same day to Mr. Smith confirming\nthe above statement.\n\nI am exceedingly annoyed surprised to find that Mr.\nSmith has broken his word thus made me to know that he has\nfailed to his duty as Indian Agent & not notifying you\nof my appointment.\n\nYours, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRobert Ward\n\nSchool Teacher\nIndian Reserve, Sucker Creek\nOct. 17 Dec. 1908.\n\nI respectfully request an increase of salary from $300 to $400 per year:\n\n1. You have a sum of about $200 in hand unpaid salary since Miss Ferguson left in April. Our teacher was appointed till I opened the school on 23 Nov. 1908.\n\n2. Mr. Laughlin, Government School Inspector, paid a surprise visit on 15 Dec. He heard me teach examine the children on various subjects. He said he should report that certainly ought to have more salary as $300 per year was not enough for my work here.\n3. The Rev. C. Simpson has been offered an increase (in amount) at Little Current. 337935\n\nSalary + $100. This would make it less no doubt worth more than $300 a year.\n\n4. Cost of living is so expensive in Manitoulin Island that $300 a year here only equals $250 a year there. And there are 2nd Class country teachers are paid $400 but $300 a year.\n\n5. I am not offered a Country School at $400 a year instead with $50 only increase, but I love Indian children and would prefer to work here any till Aug. 1909, then go to Faculty of Education in the University of Toronto.\n\nHope for a favorable reply by return post.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEdwin Robert Ward K.C.L.\nSchool Teacher, Indian Reserve\nSucker Creek\nLittle Current, Ont.\nOttawa, December 31, 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to official letter of the 14th inst., I have to request that you will be good enough to advise the Department what steps, if any, have been taken by the Church authorities or yourself to obtain another teacher for the Sucker Creek school in the place of Mr. Ward.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nC.L.D.

He informs me that he has been offered $400.00 per annum from a school in the same township and in nearly as desirable a position as the Sucker Creek School, that the Missionary in charge of the Sucker Creek mission has urged him to stay and that he will be willing to do so if the salary is raised to $350.00 per annum as he would be willing to teach this school for $50. less than the white school offered him on account of it being nearer his home than the other one. Under date 14th inst., the Rev C. C. Simpson writes me that the work at Sucker Creek School has been progressing very favourably under the management of the present teacher and that the Indians like him very well, that other schools on the island are offering very much larger salaries than that paid at Sucker Creek and that an advance in salary would be heartily appreciated. In view of all the above circumstances and also the fact that it is almost impossible to secure the services of qualified teachers I would recommend that the question of a raise in salary for this school receive the favourable consideration of the Department.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nDepartment otherwise the school will, in all probability, remain closed for an indefinite period before the services of a teacher can be secured at such a low salary.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st inst., advising the Department that Mr. F.

I have the honor to report that I am advised by the teacher that there are four children of school age who did not put in an appearance at all during September quarter.\n\nOn the 12th ultimo I wrote the chief of the reserve calling his attention to the non-attendance of several children of school age on the reserve and asked him to notify the parents that unless they sent their children to school regularly that the attention of the Department would be called thereto and the Regulations enforced. Up till the time of writing the chief has not answered me neither has he made any apparent effort to have the children attend. I have written him again today and asked his reasons for not answering my letter and informed him that unless he complies with my request that I would be compelled to ask the Department to cancel his salary as chief and appoint a Truant Officer under salary.

Original on File 151 709-7.\n\nThe attendance at this school is very unsatisfactory and the parents apparently need waking up to the fact that they must send their children regularly to school. I have already taken up the matter with the chief of the band and requested him to notify all parents and guardians of the children resident near the school that their children must attend but so far the results have not been what should be. I am now sending a registered letter to each one of the parents who have children of school age and am informing them that unless the pupils are sent regularly the Regulations will be enforced and I am in hopes that this will have the desired effect, if not, I will ask for a truant officer and make an example of those who do not comply. This I trust will probably effect a cure.\n\nC.L.D.Sims\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, December 29, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your report on the Sucker Creek school I beg to say that the Department approves of your action in trying to stir up the parents to send their children more regularly.

Lyle Sims, teacher at the Sucker Creek School applies for leave of absence for one week on or about the 1st of May next. He states that he is willing to teach during the Easter holidays to make up the time or any other time the Department may see fit in order that the school may be kept open the required number of days in next quarter.\n\nIn regard to this I have the honor to recommend that the teacher be granted leave of absence for one week conditionally that he provides a competent substitute to take charge of the school during his absence. I have had considerable trouble with the parents of the pupils in getting them to send their children and under date 12th Inst the teacher informs me that the attendance is now all that can be expected and in view of this I do not think it would be well to have the school closed.\n\nWill you be good enough to let me know what are the recognized holidays at Easter in Indian schools, as some of the teachers take more than others.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 19, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant in reference to the application of Mr. Sims, teacher of the Sucker Creek School, for one week's holidays in the month of May.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the circumstances stated by you, the Department approves of your suggestion. If, however, it is not possible for Mr. Sims to obtain the services of a substitute, it is thought that he might be allowed to have a week's holidays upon condition that he teaches one week in July.\n\nWith regard to the holidays at Easter, I may say that the Department is preparing regulations governing this and other holidays, which it expects to send out to Agents and teachers shortly. In these regulations provision is made for a holiday on Good Friday, Easter Monday and the whole of the week following Easter Monday.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nG.

He also reports that he absented himself for two weeks in October after being refused leave by the Department, leaving a younger brother in charge. The agent recommends that he be asked for his resignation to take effect at the end of the present quarter.\n\nMr Sims has neglected his duties and should at least have his pay stepped for the unauthorized leave.

I think, however, that he should have due notice and be allowed to remain in charge till the Easter holidays.

C. Shultz\nTeacher.\nTo the Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI feel I must add a few words to my report which please find enclosed. I am asked to deal with the work on the Reserve beside that of the Schoolroom. I have only been here since April 1, 1914 and as I can find no place to board on the Reserve, must have to walk 1\u00bd miles to a farm. I see very little of the Indians. I attend the Church when possible, or for a time an Indian lent his American organ when played for the Service.\nI have always found the Indian men or women friendly & obliging in manners. Nearly all speak English well, and one especially is well educated & very intelligent. I have heard him translate promptly & excellently the Sermon of the Bishop of Algoma on his last visit to this part, it was at Sheguiandah last summer. The time he has been teacher at Silver Water, on this island. He now lives here.\n\nThe men, many of them, work at loading canoes at Little Current, the women find work there too, washing, cooking, housework which I am told they do well.\n\nIf there were a garden attached to the School the teacher could easily interest the children in vegetable growing, and poultry keeping. The land I am told is good soil, and the farming very productive. The stumps of the old burnt bush of 40 years ago are still standing in all their ugliness on the land in front of the School, which lies low, is swampy, and in summer a paradise for mosquitoes.\nWhen I first came here, I boarded with\nthe old Squaw Katherine Maygrath, a sensible\nold woman, with much knowledge of the world,\ngood manners and excellent English. She had\ngreat good influence on the Reserve, and was\nfamous all around for good nursing and\nother work. She is dead now, and the difference\nis perceptible in her house.\n\nI think a good residence on the\nSchool premises for a good teacher would\nbe a gain to both School & Reserve\n\nYours truly\nH. C. Schulz\nOttawa, Feb. 11, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that the teacher at the Sucker Creek Day School has informed the Department that he considers that a physician should visit the school periodically, to examine the eyes of some of the children and to make inspection with regard to the sanitary conditions. In view of this report, the Department desires that you will lose no time in going to the school, and ascertaining the condition of affairs, as reported. You should make a recommendation as to the course to be taken to remedy any difficulties in sanitation which may exist, and you should also furnish such medical aid as may be required by the children suffering from diseased eyes. The Department will expect a full report from you after your visit has been made.\n\nI may also state that the Department desires that you will arrange to visit the school at frequent intervals, in order that you may assure yourself that the health of the pupils is being safeguarded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nP. J. McDonald, Esq., M.D.,\nLittle Current,\nOnt.\nOttawa, Feb. 11, 1925.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose for your information a copy of a letter which the Department is writing to Dr. McDonald, Penetanguishene. You will observe that he is being instructed to visit at Sucker Creek Indian School and examine into sanitary conditions, and also that he is being asked to treat such children at the school as may be suffering from diseases of the eyes. The Department, as intimated in the letter in question, will expect the doctor to visit at the school at frequent intervals. You should ascertain whether the doctor visits the school as instructed, and advise the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nWm.

This I did but made the letters much larger than one usually does for the schoolroom. Indeed, I always place those two children as near as I can to accommodate their sight. The doctor brought no special test for the sight as is usually done. He also...\nThere was no short sight, asked what was the dear did I want them to read from? The other side of the road.\n\nFrom observation I feel sure these two children have defective sight.\n\nI had to complain of his bad behavior in that he sat about on the floor a number of times so that I sent for Sand to cover the nasty mess he made.\n\nI am enjoined to teach the Indians cleanliness & hygiene, which I do.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nM.

The children were all well dressed, clean & intelligent. You understand that if those children need glasses they will have to go to a specialist as I do not pretend to treat that kind of eye trouble. I think that the teacher is doing good work but she is very medlosome & wants to make complaints.\n\nI remain\nYours truly\nP.J McDonald\nSir:-\n\nWith reference to Official Letter No. 151,709/I dated the 11th ultimo, I have the honor to enclose herewith a report on the health of the children in the Sucker Creek Indian School by Dr. P.

Miss Wedgerfield states that she has attended the Anglican Church and has had four years' experience and she forwards a copy of a recommendation from Mr. Phillips, Public School Inspector.\n\nThe Department would like to be advised as to whether Your Grace would have any objection to Miss Wedgerfield's being placed in charge of this school.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour Grace's obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Marie\nJuly 17th 1916\n\nMy dear Mr. Scott,\n\nI have always understood that the Church has the right of nomination for the position of teachers in our Indian Day Schools and that all being satisfied our recommendations would be favourably considered. Am I right?\n\nI ask this because having recommended a young man for a certain School he has been informed by the local Indian Agent that he cannot be appointed because there are girls in the vicinity qualified for the position or he might enlist for overseas service or engage in some sphere of manual labour. Yet the man, though an efficient teacher, has been refused by the military authorities and is not qualified for a sphere of strenuous manual toil.\n\nMay I ask the favor you early reply. The man must seek work in a public\nSchool if the Department reject him, I cannot help thinking there must be some mistake. My recommendation has not been refused.\n\nAs for the girls referred to by the Agent I do not know of them nor have I recommended any one but the man in question. To the best of my knowledge and belief the same is true of the Clergyman on the spot who has written me that in his opinion a male teacher is needed for the school concerned.\n\nI am\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\nGeorge Algoma\n\nDuncan Campbell Scott,\nDeputy Sect.,\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa, O.\nJuly 26, 1916.\n\nMy dear Archbishop Theron,\n\nI have your communication of the 17th instant. You are quite right in your understanding that in the majority of cases, at least, the right to nominate teachers for the Indian day schools is accorded to the respective churches, and I am very sorry that you have had any trouble in this respect. I shall be glad if you will let me know the name of the school and the name of the Agent and place all the facts before me, so that action may be taken to carry out your wishes. I take it for granted, of course, that you will only nominate suitable and qualified persons for any of these positions.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nMost Rev. C. Theron, D.D., D.C.L.,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nI am greatly indebted to you for your kind and reassuring letter of the 20th.\n\nI naturally shrink from the course you suggest. Thinking it only right and courteous to uphold to the utmost possible limit the authority of the local Indian Agent. I may be driven to give you the details of the case referred to, but meantime I am writing the Agent in question. In doing so I am helped greatly by your definite assurance on the points raised.\n\nMay I ask that no appointment be made to any of our Schools in the Manitoulin Island until I write you again upon this subject.\nOf course I quite understand that it is my duty to refrain from naming any person for the position of teacher who is not, in the best way belief and knowledge, suitable & qualified. Yet it must be remembered that it is never easy to find a person so perfect that nothing whatever is left to be desired in respect to character or fitness. I conscientiously try to do my best.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nMost faithfully yours,\n\nGeorge Algoma\n\nDuncan C. Scott &\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa, O.\nIndian Office\nManitowaning\nJuly 18th 1916\n\nYour Grace,\n\nI am in receipt of your favour of the 13th inst., stating you were surprised to learn that there was a doubt about Mr. Roberts securing the position as teacher of Sucker Creek Indian School for the next term, and in reply, I beg to say that when I forwarded Mr. Roberts' application to the Department, I did not know that he had been rejected by the military authorities & the Department did not know the full facts, but took the same view in this matter as I did myself.\n\nThe Department is desirous of having the Indian girls in schools taught such industries as sewing, mending, knitting etc., these a male teacher could not accomplish.\n\nI might say that if I had known the full facts about Mr. Roberts at the time I sent in his application, I would have recommended him more strongly to the Department, but in the meantime have forwarded an application of one, Miss Bertha Wedgfield, for the position.\n\nShe is twenty-six years of age, attends the Anglican Church, and has four years experience teaching in public schools in the District of Manitoulin, and is recommended by Mr. Phillips, Inspector.\n\nRegret there may have been any misunderstanding & trust the appointment when made by the Department will be satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nR.J. Jarvis\nIndian Agent\nSault Ste. Marie, O.\nJuly 21st, 1916\n\nMy dear Mr. Lewis,\n\nIt is a standing rule which in my Episcopate of nearly 20 years I have not known to be ignored that the authorities of the Church are allowed to nominate or recommend teachers for our Indian Day Schools. When I learned that you had recommended someone else than Mr. Roberts and that he notwithstanding my recommendation had been rejected I must confess I was very much surprised.\n\nI immediately wrote to the Department at Ottawa (not of course giving any names) to ascertain whether the traditional rule had been altered. I am assured by the Deputy Superintendent General that it has not.\n\nI do not know Miss Bertha Wedgefield so far as I can remember. I have not heard her name before. You say she attends the Anglican Church; but you do not say whether she is a communicant or even a member of that communion.\n\nMany people attend our services who know very little about our principles & practices. I say nothing whatever against Miss Bertha Wedgefield nor do I question the excellence of her general qualifications. I know nothing about her. All I wish to do is to protest against the course you have pursued and to assert the traditional right of the Church to due consideration when appointments of this kind are to be made.\n\nIt is most important that the clergyman & the teacher should work in harmony. That can hardly be when our views & wishes are ignored in the appointment. I naturally shrink from\nappealing to Ottawa for it seems to me that\nfairness & courtesy demand that I recognize &\nuphold the authority of the Local Agent. But I\nfeel sure that the Department would take my\nview.\n\nI shall be glad to hear what you propose\nto do.\n\nFaithfully yours\n\n(signed) George Algoma\nSainte Marie, O.\nAug. 31, 1916\n\nMy dear Mr. Scott,\n\nIn your letter of the 20th July you asked me to let you know the name of the school and the name of the agent and to place all the facts before you in connection with my letters about the appointment of a day school teacher on the Manitoulin Islands.\n\nSince Mr. Maclean has definitely asked me about the appointment of Miss Wedgworth to the Sucker Creek School there is no longer any reason for withholding the information referred to. I have also written Mr. Maclean.\n\nThe enclosed copies of letters dealing with the subject explain everything.\n\nI am\nMost faithfully yours,\n\nGeorge Algoma\n\nW.C. Scott\nDept' Sup' Gen'\nIndian Department\nOttawa\nDear Mr. Dean,\n\nMr. Lewis, the Indian Agent at Manitowaning, puts me in a very awkward position indeed by recommending someone I never heard of, and antagonizing my nominee for the Sucker Creek School.\n\nI nominated Mr. Malcolm Roberts and so far as I know, no valid objection has been raised against him. The reasons Mr. Lewis gave him for the refusal of his application were simply that he ought to enlist or to engage in manual labour. Now setting aside the improbability of this mode of escape, there was absolutely no ground for it. Mr. Roberts had offered himself for military service more than once that been refused; and his strength is not equal to hard manual labour. There was no complaint made as to the adequacy of his technical qualifications.\n\nUnder the circumstances, therefore, I do not see any way to withdraw my recommendation of Mr. Roberts in favour of the young lady named who is a total stranger to me and whom not a member your communion.\n\nI am faithfully yours,\n\nGeorge Wilson\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt.

When the Band held their meeting in January, nineteen hundred and twenty, they asked to have my salary raised twenty-five dollars for the remaining part of the year.\n\nDuring the month of April, I received my quarter payment.

She should prepare and forward through your office a return showing the attendance and days taught for the current quarter ending the 30th instant and also, upon the termination of her services, she should prepare a return showing the attendance and days taught during the time she teaches in October, in order that payment of the salary due her can be made.

F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nIndian Office, Manitowaning,\nOctober 1st, 1920.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to Official Letter No. 19-4-I of the 17th of September last, in regard to the Department communicating with His Grace the Archbishop of Algoma to nominate a qualified teacher to succeed Miss Bertha Wedgerfield as teacher at the Sucker Creek Indian School, I have the honor to report that I have had a communication from His Grace the Archbishop stating that at the moment of writing the only available person in view was Miss Schultz to succeed Miss Wedgerfield and asked me to let him know whether I am averse to her appointment.\n\nI have informed His Grace the Archbishop that as Miss Schultz had taught at Sucker Creek previous to the appointment of Miss Wedgerfield and she did not prove satisfactory to some of the Indians, and as there are qualified teachers who have experience teaching in the district public schools that are willing to accept the position at Sucker Creek, therefore, I did not approve of the nomination of Miss Schultz.\n\nThe Archbishop is further informed that there is a Miss Janet McDonald of this village who is willing to accept the position. She is twenty years of age and has experience teaching on some of the district public schools. She has not yet become a member of any church but is willing to teach the principals of the Anglican Church in the Sucker Creek School if instructed by the Missionary in charge of the band.\n\nI might say that the Sucker Creek School is now one of the best conducted Indian school in the district and it is my wish to secure the services of a qualified teacher to succeed Miss Wedgerfield in order that its success may continue.\n\nMiss McDonald will accept the position at a salary at the rate of $500.00 per annum and the bonus which is being allowed to teachers in Indian school, and she is ready to take charge at any time.\n\nI would most respectfully recommend that Miss McDonald be appointed as successor to Miss Wedgerfield, as I have every reason to believe that she is a competent teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 6, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the last instant in reference to the appointment of a teacher for the Sucker Creek Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department could not approve of the appointment of Miss Schults, as her services were not satisfactory in the past.\n\nAs the nomination of a teacher for this school is in the hands of His Grace the Archbishop of Algoma, he is being informed of your recommendation that Miss Janet McDonald be appointed teacher and, if her appointment meets with his approval, the Department will be pleased to accept her services at a salary at the rate of $500.00 per annum and bonus additional. In order to save time, His Grace is being asked to communicate with you and, if he approves of Miss McDonald's appointment, you should instruct her to begin duties as soon as possible. You should inform the Department as to the decision communicated to you by His Grace as to the appointment of Miss McDonald.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nOttawa, October 6, 1920.\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nIn further reference to the securing of a teacher for the Sucker Creek Indian Day School I beg to inform you that a communication has been received from Mr. Agent Lewis, Manitowaning, regarding the matter. He states that he has a letter from recommending that Miss Schultz be appointed to succeed Miss Wedgworthfield. The Department, in view of her unsatisfactory services in the past, cannot approve of her appointment.\n\nThe Agent recommends that Miss Janet McDonald of Manitowaning be appointed. He states she is willing to accept the position. She is twenty years of age and has had experience teaching in the public schools and will accept the position at a salary of $500.00 per annum, with bonus additional. If Your Grace approves of the appointment of Miss McDonald, I should be pleased if you would communicate with Mr. R. J. Lewis, Indian Agent, Manitowaning, to that effect and, he is being informed that, if you approve of her appointment, he is to instruct her to begin duties as soon as possible. I shall be pleased to hear whether you agree to the appointment of Miss McDonald. In any event a teacher should be secured as early as possible, in order that the school will not remain closed. The Agent states that he has every reason to believe that Miss McDonald is a competent teacher and her services would, no doubt, be satisfactory.\n\nI have the honour to be, Most Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Marie, Ontario,\n8th October 1920.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMr. J. G. Lewis, the local Agent at Manitowaning, wrote to me a few days ago, recommending Miss McDonald as teacher for the Sucker Creek school, but saying that she is not an Anglican. I replied to him that it was hardly fair to a teacher to require her to give religious teaching of whose truth and value she was not herself convinced; and asked him to await my further letters, as I was trying to find a teacher qualified both from the Department's standpoint and also from my own. I have not yet completed those inquiries, and therefore beg you to await a further letter from me upon the subject.\n\nI understand that I am acting quite within my rights, since the Sucker Creek school is a Church of England school, and I am supposed to have the nomination of the teacher.\n\nI am,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nfor Dep. Supt. and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, October 12, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to the appointment of a teacher for the Sucker Creek Indian Day School I beg to inform you that a communication has been received from His Grace the Archbishop of Algoma, in which he objects to the appointment of Miss McDonald. His Grace states that he has communicated with you regarding this matter and that he is endeavouring to secure a qualified teacher, one who would be suitable to both himself and the Department. The Department will, therefore, await the nomination of a teacher by His Grace, and in the meantime the school will have to remain closed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nOttawa, October 12, 1920.\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Grace's letter of the 8th instant regarding the appointment of a teacher for the Sucker Creek Indian Day School and taking exception to the appointment of Miss McDonald.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is informing Mr. Agent Lewis to that effect and will await the nomination of a qualified teacher by Your Grace. It is hoped that you will be able to secure the services of a suitable teacher at an early date, in order that the school will not remain closed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMost Rev. Geo. Thorneles, D.D., D.C.L.,\nArchbishop of Algoma,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nLittle Current, Ont.,\nOct. 20, 1935.\n\nMr. W. C. Scott,\nSuperintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReceived the two cheques from my Indian Agent, Robt. Lewis, amounting to fifty-seven dollars and sixty-three cents. $55.63 being Teachers' Salary, $2.50 Carrying Salary.\n\nI have already written my Indian Agent about this fact. In consideration of the fact that I have taught by the year for four full years, receiving yearly salary for twelve months basis, divided into four equal quarterly payments, I find that I have received only one-third of what I should have received. If I were teaching on a term-month basis, my previous...\nquarterly payments during this year would have been much larger. Do you not think I am entitled to the remainder of my full quarterly pay of One Hundred and Thirteen Dollars, and sixty-two cents.\n\nNow the reason I resigned in September was because the Agent said, I would not be able to have a raise in Salary.\n\nThe Agent told my Chief \"Charles Obotossaway\", to tell me if I was not willing to stay for the same Salary as I had been receiving to resign at once. I did so.\n\nNow is this any reason why I should have a shortage of so large amount in my payment.\n\nKindly look into the matter and let me know\nat once, what you are willing to do about my September quarterly payments.\n\nI remain, yours truly,\n\nBertha A. Wedgenfield\nSucker Creek Teacher,\nLittle Current\nBox 268 Ontario\nLittle Current, Ont.,\nOct. 21, 1936.\n\nMr. W. A. Scott,\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI was down speaking to my minister, Rev. Mr. Montizambert, this afternoon, about my salary. He said there was sure some mistake, because I am entitled to my quarterly pay, when I made out my September quarter report.\n\nRev. Mr. Montizambert is writing you today about it. The minister said I should have told you, upon what basis, the Agent and Chief (Charles Abotosaway) had me come back particularly for. It was due to the school fair work. Now my school has always come out ahead of the ten schools that\nattends the Sheguindah Rural School Fair held for the children. I am glad today we won it again this year. I am having a certificate of Honour framed for Kathleen Fairbanks to be hung up in the school for one year.\n\nThis is the main reason the Agent and Band wanted me back for this term ending September the thirtieth.\n\nDo you not think I am entitled to the balance of my quarterly pay of One hundred and thirteen dollars and sixty-two cents.\n\nNow Mr. Scott, if such is the case that I will lose that amount, could I receive the balance of my money by taking the school on again for this year?\n\nKindly let me know by return mail as I cannot\nlose the balance of my quarterly pay.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBertha A. Wedgerfield,\nLittle Current,\nBox 268, Ontario.\nOttawa, October 25, 1920.\n\nMadam,\n\nI am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of the 20th and 21st instant with reference to the amount of salary you received for the period you taught the Sucker Creek Indian Day School during the month of September.\n\nIn connection with this matter I beg to say that each school year begins upon the re-opening of the schools after the summer holidays, on or about the first of September, and terminates at the close of the following June. You first began duties at this school on September 1st, 1916, and completed four school years on June 30th, 1920, and you received four years salary in full. At the beginning of last September you started another year, teaching during the month of September, and, as you had given notice of your intention to resign, salary could only be paid for the actual number of days you taught, payment being made for twenty-one days and the amount paid $55.13. A return has since been received for the nine days you taught during the present month and a cheque for $23.62 is being sent. The bonus was also paid you for the month of September and you have thus received the full amount due you for your services.\n\nPayment of salary is based on the number of teaching days in the year; all Indian schools are required to be kept open for not less than two hundred days in each year, in order that the full yearly salary can be paid. A copy of the Indian Day School Regulations is enclosed herewith, which will show the method adopted in the payment of teachers salaries.\n\nIf you continue as teacher until the 30th of June next, teaching the required number of days, you will be entitled to your full yearly salary. In this connection, however, I beg to say that His Grace the Archbishop of Algoma, under whose auspices the school is conducted, has been endeavouring to obtain a successor and, before the Department could approve of your remaining as teacher, it would be necessary for you to communicate with His Grace and obtain his consent. Your services have been satisfactory and your work in connection with the school fair is appreciated, but the Department cannot pay any salary in excess of the actual days taught.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

This will give us a little more time to secure a successor for her work. I hope that will be satisfactory to you.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nGeorge Algoma\n\nJ. D.

Sir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Grace's letter of the 27th instant, in which you advise that you have succeeded in securing Miss Wedgerfield's consent to remain in charge of the Sucker Creek Indian Day School until Christmas.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of Miss Wedgerfield's remaining as teacher, and would be pleased if she would consent to remain until the end of the school year, namely,- June 30th, next. I may add that she wrote the Department regarding this matter and was referred to Your Grace. Mr. Agent Lewis will be informed of her appointment until the Christmas holidays at least. Her salary will be at the same rate as was formerly paid her.\n\nIf Miss Wedgerfield will not remain after the Christmas holidays, I shall be pleased if Your Grace will endeavour to secure the services of a teacher to take charge when the school re-opens after the Christmas holidays.

F. Mackenzie, Esq.,\nAct. Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMr. W. C. Scott,\nSuperintendent General\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI received my June salary in July the 21st.\n\nI spoke to my Agent Mr. Lewis, when I was on my journey to Hamilton, and told him I did not receive my July salary and Bonus of 1920, which was promised me on my June salary of 1921, if I finished out the term of 1920 and the six months of 1921.\n\nMy September salary of 1920 was $31.25\nSeptember Bonus of 1920 - $37.50\n\nYou paid me for Sept. month $55.13\nBalance due me for Sept. Salary $46.12\nReceived as Bonus for Sept. $12.50\nBalance due me for Sept. Bonus $25.\nYou rather speak of the balance due me in September of 1920 as my July and August salary, which is $76.12.\n\nThen I only received in Sept. of 1920, my bonus of $12.50. So my July and August Bonus must amount to $25. In order to make the July, August and September Bonus equal to $37.50\n\nAgain look into my September salary of 1920.\n\nReceived $55.13\nBalance due me $76.12\n\nThe salary for September quarter is equal to $131.25.\n\nThen add $55.13 which was paid me for Sept. month teaching plus July and August pay which was supposed to be equal to $76.12 so ($55.13 plus $76.12) = $131.25\n\nLet me know by return mail if there is not a balance.\non my standard salary and bonus for July and August of 1925.\n\nI will make a note of the salary as it was paid to me during 1920 and 1921:\n\nSeptember Salary of 1920 \u2014 $55.13\nOctober Salary of 1920 \u2014 $23.62\nNov. & Dec. Salary of 1920 \u2014 $99.75\nApril Salary of 1921 \u2014 $131.25\nJune Salary of 1921 \u2014 $131.25\n\nTotal Amount paid me $441.00\n\nSept. Bonus of 1920 \u2014 $12.50\nNov. & Dec. Bonus of 1920 \u2014 $25.00\nApril Bonus of 1921 \u2014 $37.50\nJune Bonus of 1921 \u2014 $45.00\n\nThe yearly bonus was $150\nReceived during the year as bonus $120.00\nTherefore $441 plus $120 = $561\n\nThe yearly salary was $675.\nKindly let me know by return mail why I did not receive my July and August pay, plus my July and August Bonus when you sent me my June salary of 1921.\n\nI took the Sucker Creek School until June 1921, so I would not lose my July and August pay of 1920. Here I have received my June salary only.\n\nLook into the matter at once and see where the mistake is made. You can see for yourself, I only received $561 out of $675.\n\nI know I lost time in October month. But that has not got anything to do with what is due me for July and August 1920. I am sorry to have\nTo write you about my salary again, after so much trouble last fall & but I only want a clear understanding why this money was not sent to me in June.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours Truly\n\nBertha A. Wedgewood\n& Mrs J. M. McGill,\n84 Flatt Avenue,\nHamilton,\nOntario.\nOttawa, August 18, 1921.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, with reference to the amount of salary and bonus which you claim is still owing to you.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has checked the number of days you taught from September 1st to June 30, 1921, and finds that the school was open for 190 days as follows:- September 1920, 31 days; October 1920, 9 days; November and December, 1920, 47 days; March 1921, 59 days, and January, 1921, 54 days. You should, therefore, have been paid $190/200 x $525.00, or, $498.75. You have already been paid $441.00 and there is, therefore, a balance due you of $57.75, a cheque for which amount will be forwarded under separate cover.\n\nThe total amount of bonus allowed teachers for the fiscal year 1920-21, which began on April 1, 1920, and ends on March 31st, 1921, was $150.00.\n\nAs you only taught 9 days during the month of October, and as the bonus is not paid for teaching only part of the month, the Department is unable to allow you any bonus for the month of October last, during which the school was only open for 9 days. The total amount of bonus which can be allowed you for the fiscal year 1920-21, is $137.50. You have already been paid $112.50 as follows:- June quarter, 1920, $37.50; September quarter, 1920, $12.50; November and December, 1920, $25.00, and March quarter, 1921, $37.50.

The Department will recollect that she sent in her resignation which took effect on the 13th of October, last, and then took charge of the school again about November the 1st and taught through until the end of the school term. From the time she resigned until she took charge again she lost twelve teaching days. The total salary she received was $441.00 plus $120.00 of the bonus allowed, as follows:\n\n- September salary of 1920: $55.15\n- October salary of 1920: $28.68\n- Nov. & Dec. salary of 1920: $93.75\n- March quarter salary of 1921: $131.35\n- June quarter salary of 1921: $131.35\n\nTotal: $441.00\n\n- September bonus of 1920: $12.50\n- November & Dec. bonus 1920: $25.00\n- March quarter bonus 1921: $37.50\n- June quarter bonus 1921: $46.00\n\nTotal bonus: $120.00\n\nAs she taught the full term excepting the twelve days lost in October, therefore, I would recommend that she be paid for 188 teaching days at the rate of $525.00 per annum which would be $493.50 plus the balance of the bonus deducted for July and August 1920 which was $25.00.\n\nThe Balance still due her $77.50.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 29, 1921\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant, with reference to the claim of Miss Bertha Wedgerfield, former teacher of the Sucker Creek Indian Day School, for balance of salary due her.\n\nIn reply I enclose a copy of a letter written to Miss Wedgerfield on the 18th instant.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nA.

He is a little fellow of about nine years of age, who is lame, and will be quite impossible to place in any home or to have him live and grow up with white children. There is a fine school for Indian children at Little Current, which I visited, and the young man who is teaching there expressed the greatest interest. He suggested that the boy could be made a ward of The Ottawa Department and board with an Indian family nearby. He could attend the school there and be greatly benefitted. Do you think the departmental regulations could be stretched a little to include this boy whom we cannot deal with in the ordinary way?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst.

From the information furnished by you, it is considered that he is not a ward of this Department and that we are not responsible for his maintenance and education.

COLLTON,\nSECRETARY TO THE BISHOP OF ALGOMA, DATED JUNE 3, 1927,\nRE CLOSING SUCKER CREEK INDIAN DAY SCHOOL:\n\n\"I communicated the contents of your letter to the\nRev. Biwin Weeks of Little Current, our missionary in charge\nof the work on the Sucker Creek Reserve. Mr. Weeks writes:\n\n\"......There are 12 pupils on the roll, and\nonly one does not belong to the Reserve.\nThat leaves 11 children attending the school\nwho reside on the Reserve, and there are several\nlittle ones who will soon be attending. There\nis no other school within reach, and where would\nthese children go for an education? Of course,\nsome of these children may be illegitimate, but\nthat does not seem to matter on other reserves\nso far as school is concerned. These children\nshould in any case receive an education\".\n\nWhile the circumstances may not justify the building\nof a new school, it would seem that at least there should\nbe no thought of closing the present school.\"\n\nEXTRACT FROM DEPARTMENT'S REPLY DATED JUNE 8, 1927.\n\n\"In reply I beg to say that the Department will take\nno action at the present time to close this school.\"\nLittle Current Ont\nJuly 18th 1927\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAt a meeting of the\nSucker Creek Reservation\nIt was moved by Wm. Jack\nseconded by\nTom Altoosaway\nthat we ask the Dept. to\nclose the Sucker Creek school\nfor one year owning to\nso few real members\nattending the school.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nChief Chas Altoosaway\n\nR. J Lewis\nManitowaning\nInd. agent\nIndian Office, Manitowaning,\nJuly 27th, 1927.\n\nSir-\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith a resolution passed in council at Sucker Creek Reserve requesting the Department to close the school for one year on account of not sufficient Indian pupils to warrant the school to continue at the present time.\n\nAt the present time there are not many pupils which are members of the band to attend. When the school closed at the end of the June quarter there were twelve pupils enrolled as follows,- 6 treaty pupils as members of the band, 3 non-treaty, 3 who have received their enfranchisement and one Indian boy from the children's shelter who is residing with chief Obetossaway.\n\nFor the next term there will only be five member pupils of the band who will be able to attend, and as the band considers this is not sufficient to warrant the school to continue it was thought that it would be to the advantage of the band to close for the present.\n\nAs there will only be five members of the Sucker Creek Band to attend this school for the next year I would recommend that the band be granted their request, and the pupils be recruited for residential schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 3rd, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, enclosing a resolution passed by the council of the Sucker Creek Band requesting that the Indian day school on the Reserve be closed for one year on account of their not being a sufficient number of Indian pupils to warrant the school being conducted.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that we are referring this matter to His Lordship the Bishop of Algoma, under whose auspices this school is conducted. His Lordship is being informed of the small number of Indian pupils who would attend. When we have a report as to His Lordship's views regarding the closing of this school, you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nOttawa, August 3rd, 1927.\n\nRight Rev. Sir:\n\nThe Department has received a resolution passed by the council of the Sucker Creek Band requesting that the day school on the Reserve be closed on account of there not being sufficient Indian pupils to warrant the school being conducted. It is stated that for the next term there will be only five Indian pupils, members of the Band, who will be able to attend, besides three non-treaty and two who have received their enfranchisement.\n\nIt is considered that, in view of the small attendance, this school should be closed and the Indian children, members of the Sucker Creek Band, placed in residential schools. I shall be pleased to have Your Lordship's views as to the advisability of the closing of this school and the recruiting of the Indian children to residential schools, viz: Shingwauk Home or the Chapleau Indian Residential School.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Rev. Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRight Rev. R. R. Smith, D.D.,\nBishop of Algoma,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nDear Mr. Balfour,\n\nI have just returned from Sucker Creek Indian Mission where I administered Holy Communion to 11 members. Things are settling down nicely & the people are behaving well.\n\nI understand that Mr. Lewis, the Indian Agent, was at Sucker Creek last Friday again urged the Indians to hold a meeting for the purpose of getting the school closed.\n\nIt's hard to understand why the Agent should be persistently trying to get this school closed. He induced the Indians a short time ago, to call a meeting for the same purpose & the closing of the school was turned down. The Indians have stated clearly again again that they wish the school kept open & still the agent is urging keeping at them to have it closed. When he knows perfectly well that the Indians do not wish it closed. He must have reasons known only to himself for doing this.\nThere are six children attending the school who have Indian rights & five who have not, owing to children be illegitimate.\n\nThere is a total of eleven on the roll & several coming along (5 or 6) children who have Indian rights.\n\nRegarding the others, these must have schooling also, & the Dept. of Indian Affairs is responsible to a certain degree for these children. What is to be done unless they are allowed to attend the school?\n\nIf the school is closed where will the 11 children now attending go to school? There is no school within reasonable distance. Most of them absolutely refuse to let their children go away from home; it means no schooling for these 11 children if the school is closed.\n\nWe can only influence these people for good by keeping both the Church & the school going. Things are just settling down nicely. If the school is closed it will be fatal to the work.\n\nI will be glad if you would forward a copy of this letter to the Indian Dept. (to Mr. C. Scott Esq.) that he may\nlearn the true facts of the case.\n\nThe Inspector has continually urged a new school at Sucker Creek, but he told me himself that the agent had worked so persistently against him that he had given up trying.\n\nIf the Dept. of Indian Affairs do not build a new school, they should, at least, put a new floor & repaint the old building, especially inside.\n\nI had a talk with His Lordship, the Bishop, on this matter & he is perfectly in accord with me. He has visited the mission & learned the full facts.\n\nAs regards accepting these children into Shingwauk Home, first the parents are against doing so & some absolutely refuse. Secondly, it would be folly to accept any of them into the home at the present time for more reasons than one.\n\nI hope I have made the matter clear & I think the Agent should be told to let this matter alone.\n\nI remain, Dear Mr. Balfour,\n\nYours sincerely,\nC. Weeks.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have been requested by the Ven. Archdeacon Balfour, who is acting as Commissary for the Bishop during the latter's absence in England, to send for your information the accompanying letter from the Rev. Edwin Weeks, our missionary at Little Current, regarding the day school on the Reserve at Sucker Creek.\n\nThe letter speaks for itself, and the Archdeacon only wishes to remind the Department that we have an assurance, dated the 8th June last, that no action would be taken to close the school. The closing of this school would be a great hardship to the Indians on this Reserve.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nArchbishop's Secretary.\n\nDuncan Campbell Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, August 12, 1927.\n\nRev.

In a note on the quarterly return of the teacher for the March quarter, it is stated that Sampson Obtossaway was suspended on October 16th, 1928, and nothing has been done in the matter. She requests that the Department back the teacher in this matter and make an example of this refractory pupil.\n\nI have to request that you will enquire into the difficulty mentioned by the teacher and the Inspector and endeavour to arrange that all Indian children of school age will attend school regularly. The Department expects that the teacher will use tact in dealing with the parents. After making enquiry, you should furnish a report to the Department stating the reasons for the suspension of the pupils referred to by the Inspector.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

The teacher and one of these pupils, Sampson Obotossaway, had some small disagreement which closed with him being suspended from school until he would make an apology to the teacher. The father did not force the boy to return to school but arranged with the Howland Public School for the two children to attend as he thought that they would make better progress in the class room by mixing with White children.\n\nThese children are attending the White school and are making excellent progress; therefore, I believe that no change should be instituted on account of them getting along so well and the father is anxious that they should try their entrance to high school as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir: \u2014 In the absence of our Bishop I am writing to you as his Commissioner.

Marie, Ont.\nOttawa, September 2nd, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to official letter of the 23rd ultimo, informing you of the appointment of Miss Rosalind Weeks to carry on the teaching duties at the Sucker Creek Indian Day School during the absence of her sister, Miss Irene Weeks, I have now to inform you that the Department will allow Miss Rosalind Weeks salary at the rate of $75 per teaching month during the period she teaches this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF PUBLIC SCHOOL INSPECTOR HAGAN,\nDATED DECEMBER 1, 1930, ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE SUCKER\nCREEK INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on File 19-4-6.\n\nMiss Rosalind Weeks. Age 24.\n\nSeven Hundred and Fifty Dollars.\n\nHas Lower School Examination, having passed the eight\nDepartmental papers. No Professional training.\n\nSince the teacher has no previous teaching experience\nand no training, little can be expected for a year, at\nleast. Where there is a surplus of Normal Trained\nteachers, there seems to be little reason for engaging\na teacher without either experience or training.\n\nIt would be much better, if in selecting teachers, that\ncare be taken to secure properly qualified teacher, one\nwho has at least attended a Normal School.\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nOn the 28th ultimo, I visited the Sucker Creek Indian Day School and found about the most miserable excuse for a school that it has been my fortune to visit. The building is terrible - holes in the floor, etc., and the present teacher, Miss Rosalind Weeks, did not show any enthusiasm. There were four or five children there and one boy had his cap on. Two others were playing marbles in the corner. I was afraid to ask if it was supposed to be recess, because the door was shut and all were in the school. It was a bright, sunny day.\n\nI selected a new site and, as soon as funds are available, the Department will have to rebuild. In the meantime, there is no reason why some effort should not be made with the present equipment, and the first step will be to secure a new teacher.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Lewis is quite satisfied that the attendance would improve considerably if a good teacher were appointed. The Chief of the Band is supposed to be the truant officer, but he is evidently useless for this purpose. It may be necessary to use the services of the police from time to time.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJune 23, 1931.\nOttawa, June 24, 1931.\n\nVenerable Sir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Superintendent of Indian Education recently visited the Sucker Creek Indian Day School and that he believes there should be a change of teacher if any progress is to be made. At the present time, three factors militate against a successful school. The building is old and dilapidated and will have to be replaced as soon as funds can be provided for the purpose. Second, the attendance is poor and should show a considerable increase. Third, the teacher is not qualified and does not seem to have the faculty of making the instruction bright and attractive. Mr. Indian Agent Lewis, who knows the Indians of this reserve, believes that a qualified teacher, using suitable methods, would secure a worthwhile attendance without having recourse to the services of the police.\n\nThe Department would like to give this school a further trial during the coming academic year and will instruct the Indian Agent to bend every energy towards securing a good attendance. First, however, it will be necessary to secure the services of a properly qualified teacher. Will you please take steps to this end and let the Department have a nomination.\n\nOf course, if you concur in the proposed action, it will be necessary to immediately inform Miss R. Weeks, the present incumbent, that her services will not be required after the end of this month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nVen. C. W. Balfour,\nArchdeacon of Algoma,\nSt. Luke's Rectory,\nSAULT STE. MARIE, ONT.\nSir:\n\nThe Ven. Archdeacon Balfour, Archdeacon of Algoma, who acted as my Commissary last year during my absence in England, has handed me your letter No. 19-4-1 of June 24th regarding the teacher at Sucker Creek Indian day school.\n\nI quite agree with you that the building is old and dilapidated and you will realize that this makes it very difficult to secure a really good teacher. The Department has frequently spoken of re-building this school, but nothing has been done. I am aware that the teacher is not properly qualified and I should very much like to secure the services of a teacher with better qualifications, but I have very great hesitancy in asking any decent teacher to come and work in such a poor building in a place where lodgings are so difficult to get. The post is rendered possible for Miss Weeks because she can live at home with her father, the rector of Little Current, only about three miles away and can be driven in each day. If you could assure me that the school would soon be replaced I would not have much trouble in securing another teacher, although even then the difficulty with regard to lodgings would arise. I should be very glad to have your considered view on the matter.\n\nIt is impossible to inform Miss Weeks that her services will not be required at the end of June because your letter did not reach me until the very end of the month, and I am not accustomed to hurling dismissals at people in this inconsiderate way.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n+ Rockesborough R. Smith\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 7, 1931.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 3rd instant, with reference to the Susker Creek Indian Day School. It is the Department's intention to replace the school building and to add a teacher's residence, as soon as funds are provided by Parliament for the purpose. We should not consider a building programme, however, unless there is assurance that there will be a worthwhile attendance for an indefinite period. I consider the best way to give a fair trial to this school is to provide a properly qualified teacher. The past incumbent has not been successful in securing a good attendance. As I stated in my letter of the 24th ultimo, the Indian Agent will be instructed to make a special effort during the coming academic year at this school. We may have to use the services of the police in one or two cases.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary\n\nRight Rev. Reeksborough R. Smith, M.A., D.D.,\nBishop of Algoma,\nBishophurst,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\n16th July 1931.\n\nNo. 19 - 4 - 1.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of July 7th with reference to the Sucker Creek Indian Day School, I am glad to know that the Department intends to rebuild the school and to add a teacher's residence as soon as it is possible to do so.\n\nI am sorry to learn that the past incumbent has not met with your approval. I am told that the Inspector, as recently as last month, highly praised her work. However, I am not asking that she should continue as teacher, and I have made an effort to secure a really first class teacher in order that every effort may be made to give the school a fair trial.\n\nI am therefore submitting for your approval the name of Mr. George Frederick Dill, care of the Dill Studios, Saskatoon. Mr. Dill is about 24 years old, and holds a professional certificate as Certified Normal Trained Teacher in the Province of Saskatchewan. He has been for three years teaching in the Indian Residential Schools of the M. S. C. C. at Elkhorn and the Shingwauk Home, leaving the latter in order to attend college, which he has now left on financial grounds.\n\nI hope that you will accept this nomination, for I feel that Mr. Dill is a very good man and will give the school a fair chance. If you accept him I sincerely trust that the Indian Agent will be emphatically told to make every effort to back him up. I am informed that he very seldom calls at the school, and the teacher complains that she has not had any assistance from him regarding the enforcement of the truancy laws. Our missionary has repeatedly complained to the Department, who write to Mr. Lewis, but he has not done anything in the matter.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBishop of Algoma\nOttawa, July 23, 1931.\n\nRight Rev. Sir:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 16th instant, nominating the services of Mr. George Frederick Dill for the position as teacher of the Sucker Creek Indian Day School for the coming school year. The qualifications which Mr. Dill possesses have been noted and are satisfactory. The Department will approve of his appointment, to begin duties on or about September 1st, next. The salary allowed him will be at the rate of $90 per teaching month. I shall be pleased if Your Lordship will inform Mr. Dill accordingly and arrange with him to begin duties on the date mentioned.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Lewis is being informed of the appointment of Mr. Dill, and will be instructed to give him every assistance he can in his work, and also to endeavour to have the parents see that there is a regular attendance of their children, or to take the necessary steps to enforce attendance.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRight Rev. R. R. Smith, M.A., D.D.,\nBishop of Algoma,\nBishophurst,\nSault Ste. Marie,\nOnt.\nOttawa, July 23, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that His Lordship the Bishop of Algoma has nominated the services of Mr. George Frederick Dill for the position as teacher of the Sucker Creek Indian Day School for the coming school year. Mr. Dill holds a professional certificate for the Province of Saskatchewan and has had three years' teaching experience in Indian residential schools. The salary allowed him will be at the rate of $90 per teaching month. I have to request that you will give Mr. Dill every assistance you can in his work.\n\nThe Department expects that you will endeavour to have the Indian parents see that their children attend regularly. You should make as frequent visits as you can to this Reserve and see that the attendance is being kept up. If the parents refuse to send their children regularly to school, you may take action under Section 10 of the Indian Act to enforce attendance. The Department will rely on you to assist the teacher in maintaining a full attendance of the Indian children of school age on the Reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have received a notification from the Bishop of Algoma that my daughter's services would be no longer required as teacher of Sucker Creek School. This was a great surprise to me, as she had been requested by His Lordship to teach for the coming year, but what hurt most was the remarks made by your Dept. that my daughter's methods of teaching were not bright or attractive. Also that the Incumbent (myself) had not been successful in getting a good attendance.\n\nHere is the cause of the whole trouble at Sucker Creek. We cannot get the children to attend regularly, simply because the Dept. will not help us, although I have written on several occasions.\noccasions requesting them to do so. The Chief and Agent are obstacles instead of help, and for some reason best known to themselves have always aimed to have the school closed.\n\nHere we have a building not fit for a stable to teach in. The pupils are allowed to stay away as much as they please. A teacher is expected to make lessons bright and attractive to a class of one.\n\nThe average attendance is only 50% of the pupils on roll. I ask, does the Dept. expect the missionary to act as Truant Officer? It is preposterous.\n\nNow, Sir, I believe someone has put in a complaint for spite. Sucker Creek never had a better teacher why are not all the teachers required to have a Normal Certificate if my daughter...\nis compelled to have one?\n\nMy daughter has as good qualifications as most teachers in Indian schools. In addition she is well up in Household Science, Music (both vocal & instrumental) & Nature Study. Can teach needlework & knitting.\n\nHow many normal trained teachers have these most important of all qualifications?\n\nIt is most unjust & I consider needs explanation so I write to your feeling that from you at any rate I will get a full explanation.\n\nI remain, Dear Sir,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. E. Weeks\nOttawa, August 6, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of the 29th ultimo, with reference to the Sucker Creek Indian Day School. As you have been informed by the diocesan office, the Department wishes to give this school a special trial during the coming academic year. Next summer, if the work is to be continued indefinitely, a suitable building will have to be provided. His Lordship has already nominated, and the Department has approved of the appointment of a fully qualified teacher, and Mr. Indian Agent Lewis has been instructed to give special attention to the matter of attendance.\n\nWith reference to the second part of your letter, I may say that the Department does not expect the missionary to act as truant officer. He can do much towards securing a good attendance, but the Department accepts the chief responsibility in this matter. Further, I may say that, when the Department wrote, \"The past incumbent has not been successful in securing a good attendance,\" reference was made to the past teacher of the school. At no time was the missionary referred to in our correspondence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nSecretary.\n\nRev. E. Weeks,\nThe Parsonage,\nLittle Current,\nOnt.\nDiocese of Algoma\n\nBISHOP: THE RIGHT REV. ROCKSBOROUGH R. SMITH, M.A., D.D.\n\nBishophurst\nSault Ste. Marie, Ontario\n\nOct. 19, 1931\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI would invite reference to your letters No. 19-4-1 of June 24th, 1931 to the Ven. C.W. Balfour, and dated July 7th, 1931 to myself regarding the Sucker Creek Indian day school.\n\nIn these letters you state, what is undoubtedly a fact, that the building is old and dilapidated and will have to be replaced at a very early date. You state, however, that the Department will not consider the building of a new school unless there is the assurance of a worthwhile attendance. You therefore asked me to make a special effort to obtain a properly qualified teacher, and with your approval Mr. George Dill started work on September 1st last.\n\nI do not know if you have received any reports of Mr. Dill's work, but those which I have received are so satisfactory that I would wish to call your special attention to them. There is at present a registration of fourteen pupils, and the average attendance for the last quarter was 12.6. This compares very favourably with the average attendance of six for the corresponding quarter of last year. There are not only pupils in grades one, two and three, but also two pupils in the entrance class and one in the first form of high school. Music lessons have been started with four of the pupils. In the recent school fair the pupils did extraordinarily well, winning forty-one prizes, I am told, at the Little Current Fair, together with five in athletics. They also won prizes in the Manitoulin Fair at Gore Bay. Considering the shortness of time during which Mr. Dill has been in charge I think that this augurs well for the future.\n\nI would like to urge upon the Department, however, that it will be quite impossible for me to retain the services of so good a teacher as Mr. Dill unless there is some hope that very soon the school building will be replaced by something a little more suitable for the purpose. It does not seem fair that the Indians at Sucker Creek should have to put up with a building so distinctly inferior to most of the Indian schools, and it is a great drawback that there is no teacher's house on the reserve. Mr. Dill has organized a Sunday School class which is beginning to do a good work for the moral and spiritual uplift of both pupils and parents, but it is difficult to carry on work of this sort when he has to live at some distance from his work. If he were able to live on the Reserve he could exercise a splendid influence over the older boys and girls who have at present no supervision over their leisure hours. The school is in such a state that it is really not worthwhile considering the\nmany major repairs which are urgently necessary, for it seems a waste of money to spend anything upon so dilapidated a building.\n\nI trust that the Department will consider this a matter demanding urgent attention, and that they will give me what support they can in retaining the services of so enthusiastic and capable a teacher as Mr. Dill.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 24, 1931.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 19th instant, with reference to the Sucker Creek Indian Day School. The Department has received other reports concerning the work of Mr. George Dill, and I am very hopeful that he will have a career of much usefulness. If his success continues, the Department will ask for an appropriation for a new school and teacher's residence for this reserve.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Mr. Dill's services were required at the Department in connection with the standardization of school texts, and it was found necessary to continue his services for a longer period than was at first anticipated.\n\nWe are informed by His Lordship the Bishop of Algoma that he engaged the services of Miss Turnbull temporarily until such time as Mr. Dill resumes duties. The Department will allow Miss Turnbull salary for the period she teaches, upon receipt of the usual returns showing the attendance and days taught by her. I would request that you have Miss Turnbull prepare a return and forward same to the Department, through your office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nR. J.

After giving careful thought to all sides of the matter it is regretted that the Department cannot see its way clear to utilizing your services in this special capacity after the 24th instant. I have, therefore, to request that you resume your duties as teacher at the Sucker Creek Day school on the 1st proximo.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nGeorge Dill, Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nThe Deputy Minister\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nHon Sir,\n\nA couple of years ago, we had a good teacher at the Indian School at Sucker Creek. The late Mr. Levis visited the school and soon afterwards the teacher was dismissed and a George Hill sent to teach in her place. This fellow hired a taxi to go to/from school and up a bill amounting to $100 including costs. Some of this is over a year old and the taxi driver (a little woman struggling to make a living) has appealed to the aid of the matter. She needs the money badly but gets only promises. Geo. Hill owes his landlord also and pays her also with promises.\n\nThe Indians are complaining about this man who takes days off whenever he pleases. He is entirely unsatisfactory as a teacher and should be dismissed, but how is this woman (Mrs. Ballantyne) to get her money? He promises to pay her but each cheque but never does it. I am therefore writing to ask if it cannot\nbe deducted from his next cheque paid direct to Mr. Ballentine.\n\nI can send you the exact amount to a cent if this can be arranged.\n\nYour early reply will oblige.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. Edith Weeks.\nOttawa, January 26, 1933.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 20th instant, regarding debts incurred by Mr. George Dill, teacher of the Sucker Creek Indian Day School. It is noted that a part of his indebtedness is for taxi hire.\n\nThis Department cannot be responsible for the collection of debts owed by teachers. It is considered that the owner of the taxi service is responsible to a certain degree for extending credit to a considerable amount for taxi service. The matter of Mr. Dill arranging to pay his outstanding indebtedness has been brought to his attention.\n\nMr. Dill's services were engaged on the recommendation of His Lordship the Bishop of Algoma, and the Inspector's report shows that his teaching services have been satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Edwin Weeks,\nThe Parsonage,\nLittle Current,\nOnt.\nDear Mr. Lutheland:\n\nI had a relapse on Sunday and the doctor, who was in twice yesterday, tells me I should be in bed for another month.\n\nI communicated with the only available Anglican teacher in Little Current. On account of the distance from the school to the town she said that she could not consider going out. The girl who substituted last year is not a Normal-trained teacher and if the work accomplished is any indication of her ability the school might as well be closed.\n\nI shall be glad to hear from you in this regard.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGeorge Dill\n\n[Signature]\n\nFebruary 21, 1933\nOttawa, February 22, 1933.\n\nDear Mr. Dill:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, and regret to hear of your illness. I note that the doctor advises you to remain in bed for a month; also that you have endeavoured to obtain the services of a substitute during your illness.\n\nI hope that your health will sufficiently improve to permit you to resume duties before a month elapses. If you are unable to get a substitute, the school will have to remain closed during the period of your illness. The Department is writing Mr. Agent Lewis accordingly. Should you be able to obtain a substitute\u2014not necessarily one with professional qualifications\u2014who would be satisfactory to the Church authorities, approval would be granted for her employment during your illness. In the event of your doing so, please advise the Department of her name and probable length of time it would be necessary to employ her. I hope that, with a brief rest, you will fully recover and be able to resume duties.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nFor Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nGeo.

The doctor has advised him to rest for a month. He has endeavoured to obtain a substitute during his illness, but, up to the present time, has been unable to do so. He is being informed that if he can obtain a substitute - not necessarily one with professional qualifications - the Department would approve of the arrangement; provided, also, that the Church authorities offer no objection.

I have the honour to report that Miss Mary Turnbull, of Tahkumash, passed through this village today on her way to Sucker Creek Reserve and she expects to reopen the school tomorrow morning.\n\nMiss Turnbull was in charge of this school temporarily during the last fall past while Mr. Dill's services were required at the Department in connection with the standardization of school texts, and her services were quite satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, March 2, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, with reference to the illness of Mr. Geo.

Last year he absented himself for several months and you know Miss Turnbull substituted.\n\nThe Bishop of the Diocese is in England and will not be back till September, so I feel, as his Commissioner here, I cannot wait till his return for action to be taken in this matter. It would then be too late.\n\nThis letter then is to state that we feel it would be in the best interests of the above school if Miss Turnbull was appointed as the teacher for next term instead of Mr. Will.\nMiss Turnbull seems to have the necessary qualifications & has already taught the school for five months, apparently giving satisfaction & commanding herself & the Indians to the Rev. F. Weeks of Little Current.\n\nWe would recommend her therefore to your Department for the position.\n\nIf appointed Mr. Hill would have to be notified,\u2014have you his address, or would your Department write him or should I?\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nC.W. Balfour.\nOttawa, July 18, 1933.\n\nVenerable Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, with reference to the Sucker Creek Indian Day School. In view of your request, Mr. Dill will be advised that his services will not be required at that school after the holiday.\n\nMiss Turnbull has no professional qualifications, and, in view of the fact that there are so many qualified teachers available at the present time, the Department considers that it would be in the best interests of the work at the Sucker Creek School to secure a qualified worker. Under these circumstances, I would appreciate if you would give the matter further consideration and nominate the services of a teacher with proper qualifications for this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nVenerable Archdeacon Balfour, M. A.,\nSt. Luke's Rectory,\nSault Ste. Marie,\nOnt.\nOttawa, July 18, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from the Venerable Archdeacon Balfour, in which he states that the church authorities would prefer a new teacher at the Sucker Creek School for the academic year 1933-34.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the Department considers it preferable to transfer you to the Kettle Point Indian Day School. This school is situated in the Sarnia agency, about seven miles from Forest, Ont. There is an attendance of approximately thirty pupils.\n\nThe salary at this school is at the rate of $85 per teaching month, less ten per cent. This is less than you have been allowed at Sucker Creek, but, owing to a recent ruling of the Auditor General, the Department cannot allow any larger salary at a school than that which has been previously paid, and the amount mentioned is the salary that was paid to the previous teacher of the Kettle Point School. There is a teacher's residence in connection with this school.\n\nI trust that you are prepared to accept the appointment at Kettle Point and will be ready to begin duties at this point on September 5th. Please let me hear from you as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nGeorge Dill, Esq.,\nSucker Creek Indian Day School,\nLittle Current, Ont.\nLittle Current, Ontario.\nJuly 1, 1933.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nThis is my report for the Indian Anglican School on Sucker Creek Reserve for the past year.\n\nWe people on this Reserve are not satisfied with the management of our School under Mr. Dill.\n\nThe School was two weeks late in starting in September, when we engaged Miss Turnbull, who taught a month until Mr. Dill came. He taught until December 14th, when he closed the school until January 9th. He took sick the 9th February, and the School was closed until February 27th, when we engaged Miss Turnbull. She taught, and carried the work successfully until June 19th, when Mr. Dill came back to take the school over for the last two weeks. At this time Miss Turnbull was in the midst of her June examinations, and also the School Fair Exhibits, in writing, drawing etc. The Indian Agent instructed her, to pass over the keys to Mr. Dill, which was a very big disappointment to the children and the parents. Miss Turnbull is well liked by the children, and held at a very high esteem by everyone on the Reserve. Moreover the children were so disappointed about their annual Pic-nic, which the teacher had made preparations for, and was not celebrated at all.\n\nThe children refused to attend school after he came back, and it is certain that the attendance will be none, if Mr. Dill comes back in September.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nChief: Chas Abotossaway\n\nSucker Creek Reserve.\nManitowaning, July 22nd, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith a copy of a letter of complaint from the Chief of Sucker Creek Band concerning the services of Mr. George Dill as teacher in the Sucker Creek Indian Day School during the last year past.\n\nOn account of Mr. Dill's services being required at the Department in connection with the standardization of school texts for a longer period than first anticipated, in September last, and being ill and ordered by his Doctor to rest for a month his teaching at Sucker Creek School has been very irregular during the past year.\n\nMr. Dill was allowed a month to rest during March last, but did not return to resume his duties until late in June when Miss Turnbull, the substitute teacher, was giving the pupils their tests for advancement to higher grades, and had arranged to hold a picnic for the pupils when the school would close, which the Indians claim was not fair to the pupils of Miss Turnbull, as the tests were not completed and their picnic did not materialize.\n\nI might say that Mr. Dill is a competent teacher, but his teaching during the past year has been so irregular, that the Indians have become very much dissatisfied and would like to have a new teacher to take charge of their school for the incoming school year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 26, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, enclosing a communication which you received from Chief Abotossaway, regarding the services of Mr. George Dill, teacher of the Sucker Creek Indian Day School during the past school year.\n\nIn this connection I have to inform you that Mr. Dill is being transferred to another Indian day school. The Department is communicating with Venerable Archdeacon Balfour, M. A., Sault Ste. Marie, requesting him to nominate the services of a qualified teacher to succeed Mr. Dill for the coming school year. When the new teacher is appointed, you will be advised and you may inform the Chief accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI was very disappointed to learn from Honorable Archdeacon Balfour, M.A., that the Department had decided to have the service of a qualified teacher.\n\nWe have two Indian schools here under the service of two married women, neither are qualified teachers. Qualified teachers are to be had in some schools why not in all schools.\n\nI worked very faithfully with my pupils and was held in high esteem by all the Indians on the Reserve.\n\nI trust you will consider the nominating of a teacher for Sucker Creek school and have my service for this coming term.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nSara Thriftell.\nOttawa, August 11, 1933.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, regarding your application for the position as teacher of the Sucker Creek Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, in view of the fact that there are so many qualified teachers available at the present time, the Department considers it would be in the best interests of the work at the Sucker Creek School to secure a qualified worker. In future, teachers who are not fully qualified, upon their retirement will be replaced by workers having professional qualifications. Recently, an appointment of a qualified teacher has been made for the Sucker Creek School, and, under these circumstances, we will not require your services.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nMiss Sara Turnbull,\nTehkumah,\nOnt.\nJohn Tehkummak Ontario\nSept. 11, 1933\n\nThe Indian Department\nOttawa\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland,\n\nI beg to say, there has been a mistake in the number of days in my last cheque. I have asked Rev. E. Hicks to write you but in case he has overlooked the matter I shall send you my report.\n\nIn April I taught 15 days. Easter 6 days. Good Friday 1 day. Victoria Day 1 day. Sick 3 days.\n\nIn May 22 days. In June 15 days.\n\nMrs. Will had charge of school the last week in June.\n\nI have been paid for only 44 days teaching.\n\nI would be very grateful, Mr. Sutherland, if you should send me the shortage on my cheque as I have little left after my keep and taxi service to support is paid.\n\nYours most respectfully,\nSarah J. Finney.\nOttawa, September 15, 1933.\n\nMadam:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, with reference to the amount paid for your services at the Sucker Creek Indian Day School for the period you were in charge of the school during April, May and June, last.\n\nRev.

Under these circumstances, the Agent is being instructed to notify Mrs. Morrow that her services will not be required after the end of the present academic year.

H. Peeling, teacher of the Garden River Indian Day School. I note that both these teachers will not be resuming their work in October, 1942. I shall take steps accordingly to nominate teachers for these positions after I have consulted with the School Inspectors.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nGeorge Frederick Algoma.\n\nBishop.\n24th July, 1942\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSuperintendent Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Department,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI am writing to make two recommendations to you concerning appointment of teachers on Church of England Indian Reserves.\n\n(1) The Sucker Creek School, Manitoulin Island. For this position I am recommending Mrs. R. H. Surrey of Little Current who holds a Second Class Permanent Certificate. She has had seven years experience as a teacher and she also holds a Music Supervisors Certificate. I had a conversation with her recently at Little Current and I feel sure she would do very satisfactory work in the school. I tried to see Chief Abbotsway at Sucker Creek but he was away the day I visited the Reserve. I found, however, from some of the other Indians that they know Mrs. Surrey quite well, and I feel sure they would be satisfied to have her appointed.\n\n(2) The Garden River Indian Reserve. For this school I am recommending Albert E. Smith who has an Ontario Permanent Second Class Certificate. He also has a Permanent Elementary Certificate in Agriculture. He has had 12 years experience in teaching and has had some contact with the Indians at Oka, Quebec. He is a married man, 41 years of age, and has three children. He is well recommended to us as a Christian gentleman, and I feel sure he would do well in the Garden River Reserve School.\n\nI trust you will approve of these recommendations.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nGeorge Frederick Algoma.\nBishop of Algoma.\nOttawa,\nJuly 25, 1942.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 24th instant, the Department approves the appointment of Mrs. R.H. Surrey as teacher of the Sucker Creek Indian Day School for the academic year 1942-43. Salary will be allowed her at the rate of $60.00 a month, plus bonus. Her appointment will date from October 1, 1942.\n\nWe also approve the appointment of Mr. Albert E. Smith as teacher of the Garden River C.E. Indian Day School. His salary will be at the rate of $90.00 a teaching month, plus bonus, and his appointment will also be effective from October 1, 1942. I understand from your letter that this is the same Mr. Smith who taught the Oka Country Indian Day School from November 1, 1940, to June 30, 1939. His services were very satisfactory at that school and he left our service in the hope of bettering his position.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRt. Rev. G.F.

Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nThank you for your letter of July 8th, concerning Sucker Creek School. I was talking to Mrs. Surrey a few days ago at Little Current and I regret that she is unable to continue the splendid work which she has been doing at the Sucker Creek School. We are trying to secure a suitable successor, but it is difficult to do so in these days, when there is such a scarcity of teachers. However, we shall continue to search for a satisfactory and competent teacher. I am glad to learn that the salary applies for ten months beginning September 1st.\n\nI am planning to call together some of our clergy and teachers who are doing Indian work for a conference in the autumn. I am anxious to re-examine our methods of approach to the work as I think we might make many improvements, particularly in our work among the adult Indians. If you have any material on hand regarding investigations which have been made in recent years concerning ways and means of dealing with the work, I should be pleased to receive the information in preparation for our conference.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nGeorge Frederick Algoma.\nJuly 28, 1943.\n\nMr. R.

Johnston,\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, October 17, 1945.\n\nMr. C. R. Johnston, Indian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, with reference to the salary of the teacher of the Sucker Creek School.\n\nIt is not absolutely correct to say that the minimum salary in provincial schools is $1,200. The action taken by the Department of Education for Ontario was to suggest to white school Boards that the minimum salary should be $1,200.00, and I suppose in many cases they have had to pay this amount, owing to shortage of teachers. However, there are certain perquisites attached to an Indian school which do not occur in a white rural school; for instance, teacher's living quarters are provided.\n\nHowever, we are anxious to keep everybody as happy as possible, and it has been decided to allow Miss Blackburn $95.00 a teaching month plus bonus, effective October 1, 1945. This will make her total salary and bonus at the rate of $111.15 a month.\n\nFor Deputy Minister.\nOttawa, October 17, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Sucker Creek Indian Day School, No. 436.\n\nWith reference to memorandum of October 5, regarding the appointment of Miss Dorothy Blackburn at the above-noted school, it has been decided to increase her salary from $85.00 a teaching month to $95.00 a teaching month, effective October 1, 1945.

McCutcheon\nChief Treasury Officer.\n380 John Street,\nSudbury, Ont.,\nSept. 1, 1946\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFrom October, 1943 until June, 1945, I taught at Sucker Creek Indian Day School, near Little Current, Ontario.\n\nIn the last week of May, 1944, one of the pupils, Terry Corbiere, age 9 (1944) was very disobedient, and in the course of events, when I was trying to restore order and make him return to his desk, he hit me with his fist, catching me in the right breast. I expelled the child, but taught him the next year. He was bad, as usual, but did not cause quite so much uproar as before.\nAlmost immediately, I noticed a small lump forming where Jerry had hit me. During the Christmas vacation, 1944, my doctor advised that it be left for some time, unless it increased in size.\n\nIn September, 1945, I returned to high school, after a 5-year absence, to secure normal school entrance. I then noticed an increase in the size of the lump on my breast, and in April, was advised to have it removed as soon as possible.\n\nThe Departmental examinations finished June 25, and I started hospital here that evening; On June 27, my doctor removed two tumours.\n\nI feel that some adjustment or compensation should be made by the Indian Affairs Branch, for I certainly was\nis no way responsible for the way in which the tumours were caused.\n\nMy hospital bill was $28.50, my doctors' bills $62.00, a total of $90.50.\n\nI am at present preparing to attend North Bay Normal School next week, and really would appreciate the return of this money.\n\nIf you so desire, I can forward you my receipts.\n\nKindly let me know what adjustment the Department will make.\n\nThank you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMarion Rothery.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI enclose herewith a letter from Miss Marion Rothery, former teacher at Sucker Creek Indian Day School, which is self explanatory.\n\nI recall the incident referred to in Miss Rothery's letter when Jerry Corbiere struck her, and was expelled from school.\n\nAs explained in previous correspondence, Miss Rothery was unable to maintain discipline in the school, but it is unfortunate that she sustained this injury from a nine year old child.\n\nI am rather doubtful if the Department can allow any redress, particularly since it is over two years since the incident occurred and may be difficult to attribute the growth of tumors directly to it, however I am forwarding Miss Rothery's request for consideration.\n\n[Signature]\nC. R. Johnston,\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, September 11, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. MacTAVISH,\n\nI would like to discuss this case with you.\n\nWill it be necessary to consult Departmental Solicitor?\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nCOL. NEARY\n\nI discussed this matter with Mr. C.E. Stevens, the official in charge of Government Employees Compensation Act administration. He advises that the usual forms under the Government Employees Compensation act should be completed and returned by the Indian Agent with medical reports and any detailed information that can be obtained on the case. Following this we should refer the matter to Mr. Stevens for consideration as to compensability under the Act.\n\nFor your information this Act covers all employees in any capacity, exempt or otherwise, paid from Dominion Government funds including Indian Day School teachers. The Act is administered by the Department of Transport to which Mr. Stevens is attached. If the claim is considered compensable, it will be referred to the Ontario Workmen's Compensation Board. By joint arrangement, the Provincial Board deals with these cases as referred to them, there being no Dominion Boards; but the Dominion pays the awards. Payment is made by the Department of Transport and is not charged to this or other Departments to which the employee belongs.\n\nIf you concur, the usual procedure will be followed in the present case. There is no need for any reference to the Departmental solicitor.\n\nT.R.L MacInnes,\nSecretary.\nOttawa, 14 September 1946.\n\nMr. C.R. Johnston, Indian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ontario.\n\nWe have your letter of the 5th instant enclosing letter from Miss Marion Rothery, former teacher of the Sucker Creek Indian Day School. Her request is unusual and we don't appear to have received any previous correspondence regarding the matter.\n\nHowever, it has been decided to submit the matter to the Ontario Workmen's Compensation Board. If they consider she is entitled to compensation the Dominion Government will be responsible for the payment of the award that they make.\n\nThe necessary forms for presenting her case will be forwarded to you as soon as possible.\n\nBernard F.

Salaries are based on the qualifications of the teacher.\n\nWe have also noted your remarks regarding the salaries which we allow. When qualified teachers can be obtained our salaries compare favourably with White schools.\n\nThe information on our file indicates that Mrs. McLeod is not a qualified teacher and the report submitted to us by the School Inspector last March showed her work was only average.\n\nBernard F.

These forms are to be completed in quadruplicate, three to be forwarded to this Branch and the fourth copy to be retained by you for your files.\n\nI would refer you to Paragraph 2 of Miss Rothery's letter, from I may quote as follows:\n\n\"... I really cannot see why it has to go to the Compensation Board. ....... since I was on duty in the school, I think the Indian Department should be willing to pay the hospital and doctor bills incurred.\"\n\nAll persons employed by the department in any capacity regardless of the nature or class of their employment, that is whether permanent, temporary, full time, part time, seasonal or casual are covered by the Act, so long as they are paid a direct wage or salary by the Government.\n\nAll cases of accident on duty requiring medical attention and/or which are sufficiently serious that a claim for compensation might be involved should be investigated and reported by the Indian Agent with as little delay as possible, as any unnecessary delay may render it difficult to establish the facts required to support the claim and as long delays\nmay disqualify any claim.\n\nI am returning, therefore, the forms submitted by Miss Rothery. Employer's Report of accident to be completed in the required number of forms and signed by you, also the Surgeon's First Report to be signed by the attending physician, and returned to this Branch for further action.\n\nForms Nos. 5, 9 and 94 completed by Miss Rothery should not be sent to this Branch, but direct to the Workmen's Compensation Board in Toronto as directed thereon.\n\nActing Director.\n\n/ITH\nDear Mr. Farquhar:\n\nI wonder if you can help me?\n\nI have written to Mr. Johnston at Manitowaning and he forwarded my letter to Ottawa. Then he sent me Workmen's Compensation Board forms, which I filled in and returned. Since then, I have heard no more.\n\nHere is what happened. In May, 1944, near the end of my first year at Sucker Creek, Jerry Corbierrie was unruly one day, and when I tried to manage him, he punched me. The blow caught me in the right breast. I put Jerry out, and he did not return to school until the next September. By the fall, I noticed a small lump, and when I was home at Christmas, my Doctor advised that it be left for a while, but stated that it had certainly been caused by Jerry's fist.\n\nIn April of this year, I was again examined, when two tumours were found. I was advised to have them removed immediately. As I was at High School here, I had to wait until the end of June, after the final examinations. I wrote my last examination the afternoon of June 27, and entered hospital that evening. They operated June 27, and removed the two tumours.\n\nI failed the examination which I wrote that last afternoon, and was admitted to North Bay Normal School because my doctor sent a letter stating the cause of my failing it.\n\nI see no reason why I should have to pay the expenses of this operation. I have inquired about it, and had I been in an ordinary white school (where it is hardly like such a thing could happen) I could have claimed my expenses.\n\nSince it was during school hours, and I was doing my duty as the teacher, I feel the Indian Department should be responsible for these expenses:\n\n| Expense       | Amount |\n|---------------|--------|\n| Hospital      | $28.50 |\n| Dr. Orange    | 10.00  |\n| Dr. McInnes   | 53.00  |\n| Total         | $91.50 |\n\nI cannot see that it is a Compensation case at all, nor can the Normal School teachers. I lost no time at all, either when it happened or later on.\nSince I am at Normal School, I really need this money, as I paid these bills out of what I had saved for Normal School.\n\nCan you help me? I will be so grateful if you can.\n\nI would appreciate hearing from you soon.\n\nThank you\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Signed) Marion Rothery.\n\nIf you wish to have receipts, or further particulars, I will certainly let you have them.\n\nM.R.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nFeb. 5/47\n\nTo the Acting Deputy Minister:\n\nAttn: Director of Indian Affairs\n\nAttached is a letter dated December 27th and written to Mr. T. Farquhar, M.P., by Miss Marion Rothery, 380 John Street, Sudbury, Ont., formerly a teacher at the Sucker Creek Indian School. In May of 1944, while at the school, one of the Indian pupils, Jerry Corbiere, struck the teacher, with the result that a tumour - and later two - developed which required medical attention and surgery. Miss Rothery's doctor states that this condition was the direct result of the blow. She feels that her medical and hospital expenses should be met by the Indian Affairs Branch.

To date the 'Employer's Report of Accident' is the only form received.\n\nThe Indian Agent is being requested to forward the 'Surgeon's First Report' at his earliest convenience and it will be forwarded to you as soon as it is received.\n\nDirector\nMay 1st, 1947.\n\nThe Deputy Minister,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nClaim 2100168 - Miss Marion Rothery\n\nWe have your letter of April 24th etc., and have to advise that Miss Rothery has submitted a workman's Form 6 and it is quite in order but this claim is being rejected due to the fact that it has not been shown that the disability is the result of the accident reported.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION BOARD,\n\n(Sgd.)

With this attractive new salary schedule and the good living accommodation at this school, I feel we should be able to get a thoroughly qualified and experienced teacher. I am attaching a few application forms in the event that you might have someone in mind to replace Mrs. McLeod.

Mrs. D. McLeod, the present teacher has written asking to be relieved of her duties at the end of this term. At His Lordship's suggestion I wrote back and asked her to carry on for a month or two in the fall. She has agreed, though I take it from her letter with some reluctance, on the distinct understanding that it will not be for more than a month or two.\n\nThe more I think of the arrangement the more unsatisfactory it becomes and I have written to Mrs. McLeod telling her that if at all possible we will secure a new teacher by September 1st and so relieve her of any further responsibility.\n\nWe are anxious to proceed immediately to secure a new teacher and would like to know from you the salary rate which would be available. If you could let us have this information we will take immediate steps so that in due course we may nominate a teacher to you.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJHC/DL\n\nBISHOP'S COMMISSARY\n19-4-1 (E).\n\nMay 25, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nCHIEF TREASURY OFFICER.\n\nRe: Sucker Creek Indian Day School No. 430.\n\nThe Department has received and accepted the resignation of Mrs. D.

Neary:\n\nSince receiving your letter of July 12th re Sucker Creek Indian Day School I have been looking for a further letter including an application from Mrs. Irene Stringer of Toronto. I am wondering whether anything further has come to you in this matter. As I am going to be out of town on holidays at the end of this month for a couple of weeks I am naturally anxious to get something settled. I have written to Inspectors Lapp and Howitt for references in connection with Mrs. Stringer's application.\n\nHave any further applications come in?\n\nOne of our men, writing to me recently expressed the fear that by asking you to advertise for teachers for this school we had forfeited our right to nominate the teacher. I have written at once to him saying that we have in no sense forfeited this right, that we have merely accepted your kind offer of assistance in advertising our needs and that when all applications have been received we will, as in the past, have the right to nominate someone to you for appointment as teacher. This is my understanding of the situation and I would appreciate it very much if you would confirm it.\n\nWe have received the names of one or two apparently well qualified people in the Diocese and are investigating them vigilously. I hope that out of all this we may soon have a satisfactory nomination to send in to you.\n\nWith every good wish, I am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJames H.

Neary:\n\nI regret to say I am no longer interested in the position as I am under contract now to another Board.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIrene Strieger\nTo whom it may concern:\n\nI have known Barbara J. Dean for some time to be a lady of outstanding moral Christian character. One who takes a live & practical interest in all things connected with the Church. She is very much interested in work amongst children and young people. In this field she has given very outstanding service in our Indian Residential School at Birtle, Manitoba.\n\nBeing a person of high moral character it gives me great pleasure to certify the fact. As I am fully persuaded both as to her moral character and to her practical ability as a Christian teacher and leader. Wherever she goes she will be an example for good works, to those with whom she comes in contact. And wherever she may be employed, she will do her utmost to give entire satisfaction in every regard.\n\nJ. J. Garrett. (Presbyterian Missionary)\n\nManitoba.

She has a first class teacher's certificate and 8\u00bd years' experience in provincial schools. Her religious denomination is United Church.\n\nIn forwarding this application Mr. Indian Superintendent Johnston advised that he was expecting other applications. To date we have received none of these from him.\n\nI also have another teacher in mind for Sucker Creek School but, unfortunately, she is Presbyterian. This teacher is Miss Barbara Dean who formerly taught at the Birtle Residential School and who is now attending the University of Toronto. She has a first class Ontario certificate with two years' experience in Indian schools and 20 years' experience in provincial schools.

Marie, Ontario.\nGarrett concerning Miss Dean. I do not know for how long Miss Dean will be available as our Regional Supervisor for Manitoba is anxious to employ her in that province.\n\nYou have in no way forfeited your right to nominate a teacher for this school by asking the Department to advertise. This practice is followed out elsewhere. I hope that you have been able to get satisfactory results from your own enquiries within the Diocese and that, together, we will be able to find a satisfactory teacher for the Sucker Creek School.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nDear Col. Neary:\n\nI am spending two weeks at Gore Bay at Manitoulin Island on vacation. A letter has come from Mrs. Irene Strongest Bt. of 94 Caronan Rd., Toronto, stating that she is not interested in the position of teacher of the Sucker Creek Indian Day School. The grounds of refusal were (i) that the salary for the position of teacher (i.e., approximately $1500) was not adequate - she had refused several offers at that rate - and (ii) the number of holidays offered if she should accept the position was insufficiently generous.\n\nInadequate was the way of thanking her. We are better off without her.\n\nP.T.O.\nSince coming here I have heard of two other prospects. I have urged them both to join in league with you and the Indian Agent on the Island\u2014and send us their applications stated.\n\nOne of these is a Mrs. Murray, of little current. She is apparently an excellent person with some years of successful teaching\u2014she has not discovered what trade of leisure she can operate the fields to help her return to little current in their day and will try to speed things up there. Rumors have it that she has teaching commitments which will make it difficult for her to relocate until December 1st\u2014but I have nothing definite as yet. If she is properly qualified and has good teaching experience it might be the part of wisdom to hold the position open for her till then\u2014provided of course we can secure an adequate substitute in the meantime.\n\nThe other prospective applicant is a Mrs. Anderson at present residing in Wiltonia, Ohio. Of her I know nothing.\n\nI wrote she could arrive here by August 9th. I hope we may have definite recommendations for you soon.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\nJames H. Craig\nAugust 10th, 1948.\n\nCol. B. F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Col. Neary:\n\nYour letter of August 5th re Sucker Creek Indian Day School awaited me on my return to the city last night. I noted with interest the two names of Miss Barbara Dean, and Mrs. Alvira Davison, and the prospect of further applications from Indian Superintendent Johnson.\n\nI received last night an application from Mrs. E. M. Anderson, Box 149, Willshire, Ohio, U.S.A. I take it from her letter that she has also sent in an application to the Manitowaning Indian office and that it will be forwarded to you. On the face of it, it would seem to be the most likely application to date. Mrs. Anderson is an Anglican with second class teacher's certificate and eleven years teaching experience, seven of which were amongst Indians. I have written to the Rev. Canon Haines of Little Current in whose parish Mrs. Anderson grew up and who presumably knows her and her family, asking for a frank opinion.\n\nDoes your Department keep Inspectors' reports, and if so would it be possible to check on Mrs. Anderson's record as a teacher at the Sucker Creek School, 1933-37, and the Spanish River School 1937-40? She lists also experience at Ten Mile Point school, Sheguiandah 1940-42. If Mrs. Anderson's record as a teacher proves satisfactory she would seem to me the best candidate so far from our point of view. I have nothing further from Mrs. Surrey of Little Current but have urged her to act at once if she desires to make application.\n\nWith every good wish, I am\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJames H. Craig\n\nBISHOP'S COMMISSARY.\nOttawa, August 18, 1946.\n\nSucker Creek Indian Day School.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nI have for answer your letter of August 10 concerning the above Indian Day School. We had also been advised by Mr. Superintendent Johnston that Mrs. E. M. Anderson (formerly Miss Bertha Willis) was making application for this school.\n\nMiss Willis (as she then was) taught at the Sucker Creek School from 1933 to 1937 and the Inspector's reports, signed by Mr. Wightman, during that period were quite satisfactory.\n\nDuring the period 1938 to 1940, she taught at the Spanish River C. E. Day School. Mr. Mackillop's inspection reports during this period are quite good and he was well pleased with the general progress of the pupils.\n\nOn our new salary schedule she would therefore be entitled to classification as a Grade two teacher at a salary of $1,220.00 an academic year. I presume that we will soon hear from you with the usual application form.\n\nI have been able to offer Miss Dean a school in Manitoba, where she particularly wanted to go. Dr. Dorey of the United Church is interested in securing Miss Davison for a school in central Ontario. Therefore, I feel Mrs. Anderson is the most suitable and qualified applicant and that we should be prepared to accept her for the Sucker Creek School.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Mary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education.\n\nVery Rev. J.H. Craig, M.A., D.D.,\nBishop's Commissary,\nSt. Luke's Pro-Cathedral,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ontario.\n\nCopy sent to Mr. C. R. Johnston, Supt. I.A.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI acknowledge receipt of telegram dated August 4, 1948 with reference to securing a teacher for Sucker Creek School.\n\nApplication forms were sent out to seven different teachers as a result of the advertisement inserted in Newspapers but only the one, Mrs. Elvira Davison, returned her application to this office.\n\nI have recently received an enquiry from a former teacher at Sucker Creek Reserve, Mrs. Bertha W. Anderson, Nee: Bertha Willis.\n\nThis woman is at present living in United States. An application form was sent to her by Air Mail on August 2nd but has not been returned to this office.\n\nI also have a letter from Mrs. Anderson which is enclosed herewith stating her husband and two children will be with her so I am doubtful if the arrangement will work out satisfactorily.\n\nMrs. Anderson was highly regarded by Chief Abotossaway and other members of the Band when she taught school at Sucker Creek some years ago.\n\nC. R. Johnston,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency.\nAugust 29th, 1948\n\nCol. B.F. Neary  \nSuperintendent of Education  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nDear Col. Neary:\n\nYour letter of August 23rd reached me yesterday. I have been out of town all week and so have not had my mail.\n\nI will at once pass on the revised figure for salary to Mrs. Surrey. She worked it out herself and put the figure of $2,200 down. She will be disappointed but I do not think it will make any difference to her acceptance of the position. I have not yet had definite word from her that she will accept the position nor that she has been able to resign her other job. I have been looking for definite word all this week, and hope it will be here soon. I have made it clear that she MUST be free of her other commitments at least by December 1st if this plan is to go through.\n\nI have had word from Mrs. McLeod that she is willing to carry on till December 1st. She says however\u2014\n\n\"I will expect a salary of fourteen hundred\"\n\nI do not know how to answer that at all. It was a complication that I had not foreseen, nor had the Bishop I think anticipated it. Unfortunately the Bishop is out of town or I would take the whole thing back to him. Is it possible to meet that demand, or should we look for someone else to fall in, in the meantime?\n\nI am deeply concerned by your last paragraph re Spanish River School. I believe that that matter was entirely settled and that Mr. Armstrong had been appointed to the position. I have in my possession a very definite letter from him saying that he will be on the job the first day of school and that we can count on him. Have I slipped somewhere in making the arrangement final and definite? I sent you I believe his completed application form and felt that that would conclude the matter. I am afraid that through my inexperience in these matters I have complicated the situation. Unless you have had word from Mr. Armstrong to the contrary, I am quite certain that he is planning and expecting to teach at Spanish River School and will be in the job on September 7th. If there is anything further that I should do in this matter would you let me know at your earliest convenience?\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJames H.

Neary,\n\nThank you for your wire of August 31st and also for your letter of September 2nd, which reached me today.\n\nMrs. McLeod has written me agreeing to teach in the Sucker Creek School until December 1st. As I pointed out in a previous letter, she asked for a salary of $1400 per annum. I am confident however that she will be content with the amount of $1320 which you have informed me she is entitled to under the schedule. I have sent on this word to her today and am sure that she will accept the figure offered without any further question. I have told her if she is not content to get in touch with you direct.\n\nMrs. Surrey has also written to say that she will be free to take over on December 1st and that she has resigned her other position as from that date. She expressed regret that the salary was not as high as she had expected, but intimated that she would accept the position nevertheless. She asked what the annual increment would be. I said that I understood it would be $60 per year. I asked her to write direct to you accepting the position.\n\nI hope you will feel quite free to offer a school in the Chapleau Agency to Mrs. Anderson. We felt that in years to come she might be available for the Sucker Creek School, if ever the present arrangement comes to an end, but that of course was all very indefinite. My correspondence with her convinced me that she would be a very satisfactory teacher and I hope you may have some luck with her.\n\nI trust that the plans made for the Sucker Creek and Spanish River Schools will work out satisfactorily. As the Bishop has now returned from England, such matters as these will now revert into his hands. May I thank you for the many courtesies you have extended to me this summer in our rather lengthy correspondence over these matters?\n\nWith every good wish,\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJames H. Craig\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nSucker Creek Indian Day School.\n\nI have for answer your letter of September 4th and note that Mrs. McLeod will write to me directly if she will accept the Sucker Creek School.\n\nYou were quite right in informing Mrs. Surrey that the annual increment is $60. per year. I will also expect to hear from her concerning this position.\n\nI immediately wrote to Mrs. Anderson to offer her both the school in the Chapleau Agency and also the vacancy which has recently occurred at Walpole Island.\n\nI wish to thank you for the consideration and appreciation shown in filling both these positions and I hope to have an opportunity of meeting you personally during one of my future inspection trips.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

I have one which falls due on the 16th of this month. I know that leaves you rather short of time, but would be possible to secure a cheque by that time?\n\nI am not certain when I should close the school. I have pupils going up for the Entrance and First Year High School examinations on the 24th of this month. Am I expected to remain until they are finished or am I allowed to close the school on the 24th. I would like a few days before I commence work, but it is not a matter of any great concern, as I feel that the difference in environment will be sufficient holiday, and I am anxious to get at it.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n24th this year\nin view of special work\n[Signature] Lewis\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature] Lewis\n\n[Signature] Lewis\nOttawa, June 16th, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 13th instant, I beg to say that a voucher covering a second advance of $70.00 on your June quarter salary was prepared on the 27th ultimo. At the present time, our accounting system is being changed and, consequently, there is some delay in issuing cheques. This occurred in the case of your cheque, which went forward yesterday.\n\nWith reference to the last paragraph of your letter, the Department approves of the Sucker Creek School closing on the 24th instant. Mr. Agent Lewis is being so advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Russell T. Ferrier]\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nGeo. P. Dill, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nSucker Creek Indian Day Sch.,\nLittle Current, Ont.\nOttawa, June 16th, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Geo. Dill, teacher of the Sucker Creek Indian Day School, advises the Department that some of the pupils are trying their Entrance Examination this year. In addition, I may say that it has been arranged to have Mr. Dill do certain special work this summer. Under these circumstances, it has been decided to allow him to close the Sucker Creek School on the 24th instant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\n\n2 letters\nOttawa, September 19, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, and have to inform you that Mr. George Dill, teacher of the Sucker Creek Indian Day School, will be returning to resume duties on October 3rd, next. Mr. Dill's services were required at the Department in connection with the standardization of school texts, and it was found necessary to continue his services for a longer period than was at first anticipated.\n\nWe are informed by His Lordship the Bishop of Algoma that he engaged the services of Miss Turnbull, temporarily, until such time as Mr. Dill resumes duties. The Department will allow Miss Turnbull salary for the period she teaches, upon receipt of the usual returns showing the attendance and days taught by her. I would request that you have Miss Turnbull prepare a return and forward same to the Department, through your office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT. R. L.

Dill, Esq.,\nSucker Creek Indian Day School,\nLittle Current, Ont.\n\nDear George,-\n\nA rather personal matter has been brought to our attention recently, viz., the claim of Mr. Abelit against you for $145.00, being the cost of board provided for you this summer. Rev. Mr. Hives has also written with reference to an amount of $50.00 which he claims you owe him.\n\nPresuming that these amounts are correct, it makes a total of $195.00 and I would suggest that you forward to the Department an order authorizing the deduction of $45.00 from your December salary, $75.00 from your March quarter salary and the same amount from your June quarter salary. This will clean up these two matters in a reasonably convenient manner for you. I would appreciate hearing from you at your earliest convenience.\n\nI received your other letters recently. We have been extremely busy and reply has been delayed but I expect to write you fully for the end of this week.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n22 Bower Ave., Ottawa.\nDecember 6th, 1932.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nMr. Blair of the Department of Immigration has informed me today of your very kind action on my behalf in connection with a dishonoured cheque for $145.00 issued to me on the 8th October last by Mr. George Dill.\n\nI understand that Mr. Dill, through your good offices, has agreed to refund to me $45.00 this month, $75.00 additional by the end of March and the balance at the end of June. Although I need the money immediately, having been unemployed for a long time, I am glad to accept this settlement as it assures me of the return of the money even though I have to wait for it.\n\nWhen the cheque was returned to me, there was a charge of $4.00 added to it by the Bank, hence the total amount now due me is $149.00.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.P. Abolit\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA,\nOntario.\nLittle Current, Ont.,\nDecember 8th, 1932.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn connection with certain accounts which I owe, viz.:\n\n(a) Due Mr. A.

Please sign and return to me as soon as possible.\n\nRegarding Mr. Abelit's account, he points out that the cheque you gave him was placed in the bank for collection and, when it was returned unpaid, they made a charge of $4.11. This amount added to the cheque, which was for $145.08, makes a total due him of $149.19.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGeo. F.

Her cheque was for $178.20.\n\nThere must be some mistake in this matter and I am writing to ask that the matter be adjusted. The salary was $90 per month and she had been paid at this rate at the end of March.\n\nWill you please send Miss Turnbull a cheque for the difference?\n\nThanking you for your prompt attention to this matter.\n\nI remain, Hon. Sir,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. E. Weeks\nPriest in Charge\nMission of Sucker Creek\nOttawa, August 8th, 1933.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, with reference to the amount paid Miss Turnbull for her services at the Sucker Creek Indian Day School during the quarter ended June 30th, last.\n\nNo definite promise was made to Miss Turnbull by the Department regarding the amount she would be allowed for her services. However, when the return was received for the period she taught the school during the quarter ended March 31st, last, it was decided to allow her salary at the rate of $4.50 a day, less 10%. The return showed that she taught the school for 25 days during the March quarter and she was, therefore, allowed $112.50, less 10%, which made the amount due her $101.25.\n\nThe return for the June quarter showed that she had taught the Sucker Creek School for 44 days during that quarter and, at the same rate as was allowed her in the March quarter, the amount due was $198.00. Deducting 10% from this amount, the Department forwarded her a cheque for $178.20. There is, therefore, no further balance due her.\n\nFor your information, I may add that 10% is deducted from all salaries of teachers of Indian day schools during the current fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The salary allowed her will be at the rate of $85.00 per teaching month, less 10% during the present fiscal year. Miss Willis possesses an Interim Second Class Certificate and has had two years' teaching experience.

As the Sucker Creek Indians have a capital of about $36,000.00 to their credit, it is thought that they should be prepared to furnish the necessary funds for the erection of a school and the Department would like you to obtain a resolution from the band authorizing the necessary expenditure for this purpose from their funds.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Smith\nBishop of Algoma\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nApril 22, 1927.\n\nDear Bishop Smith:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, with reference to the advisability of providing a new building for the Sucker Creek Indian Day School. I shall make enquiries in this connection and will not overlook Your Lordship's recommendation. If we can use funds of the Indian Band, the activity could commence without much delay, if found necessary. However, if Parliamentary Appropriation is required, nothing can be done this year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Rev. Rockborough R. Smith, D.D.,\nBishop of Algoma,\nSault Ste. Marie,\nOnt.\nOttawa, April 25th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that a communication has been received from His Lordship the Bishop of Algoma in which he requests that a new day school building be erected on the Sucker Creek Indian Reserve. He states that the present school building is in a most dilapidated condition and that there is urgent need of a new building.\n\nI have to request that you will furnish a full report concerning the condition of the present school building and whether you would recommend that a new building be erected or not. I may say that the present building was erected from Band Funds. The Sucker Creek Band had at their credit in Capital Account as on March 31st, last, $29,640.00. If you consider that a new building is required, you should place the matter before the Band in Council and endeavour to obtain a resolution setting aside from their Funds the amount that would be required to erect a building. You will, no doubt, be able to form an estimate of the size of the building required and the approximate cost of same. You should also state what accommodation is provided at this point for a teacher's living quarters, and the number of children of school age on the Reserve who could attend.\n\nPlease let us have the information as requested above at an early date, together with your recommendation as to what you would advise be done in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPoor Copy\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of Official Letter No. 19-4-5 of the 25th instant, relating to the question of erecting a new school building on the Sucker Creek Reserve, and in reply I have the honour to report to the effect that I cannot recommend that this project be carried out as there are not sufficient Indian pupils on the Sucker Creek Reserve of school age who could attend to warrant such an expenditure. At the present time there are only five pupils of the Sucker Creek Band, three non-treaty, and two pupils whose parents obtained enfranchisement, who could attend.\n\nThe building in use as a school at present is not in very good condition but will answer the purpose for the time being.\n\nOn my last visit to Sucker Creek I found the members of the band discussing the question of asking the Department to close this school and have the pupils of school age placed in boarding schools but to date not anything further in this matter has developed. If the Indian parents continue to leave the Reserve as they have in the last few years past, the school will be forced to close on account of there not being sufficient pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 4, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 254-39 of the 30th ultimo, concerning the Sucker Creek Indian Day School, and I wish to thank you for your report. In view of the fact that there are only five members of the Indian Band attending this school, no steps will be taken to incur capital expenditure. If, at a later date, you feel that these should be recruited for residential schools and the day school closed, you might let me have a recommendation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nMay 4, 1927.\n\nDear Bishop Smith:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 13th ultimo, I wish to inform Your Lordship that there are but five children of the Indian Band attending the Sucker Creek School. It is true that there are five others enrolled, but this Department is not responsible for their education. I cannot agree to a new building for such a small activity, especially in view of Mr. Indian Agent Lewis' report that the present equipment, while not in good condition, will answer the purpose for the time being.\n\nIf there is no increase in the enrolment of our wards at this school, the Department will seriously consider closing it and having the Indians of school age placed in residential institutions.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Edwin Weeks of Little Current, our missionary in charge of the work on the Sucker Creek Reserve. Mr. Weeks writes:\n\n\".... There are 12 pupils on the roll, and only one does not belong to the Reserve. That leaves 11 children attending the school who reside on the Reserve, and there are several little ones who will soon be attending. There is no other school within reach, and where would these children go for an education? Of course, some of these children may be illegitimate, but that does not seem to matter on other reserves so far as school is concerned.

Lewis,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nDear Sir,\n\nI would like to draw your attention to the terrible condition of affairs at Sucker Creek School.\n\nThe school is built in a regular swamp and during spring and fall is almost unapproachable. Pedestrians must wear long rubber boots to get to the school or sink into the mire.\n\nThe school itself is old and dilapidated, only fit for a stable or similar purpose. It is dark, cold and draughty, to say nothing of dirty, and absolutely unfit for the purpose of a school.\n\nAt times the water comes up through the floorboards as one walks across the floor. The floor itself has worn down so much that the knots stick up like cobblestone.\n\nOne of the Indians, Mr. Thompson, told me the Dept. can have a school-site on his place, right on a hill, dry & clean.\n\nI would like to ask why the present conditions are allowed to continue.\nThere are 14 pupils on the school list,\n8 of whom have full Indian rights.\nMost of the others are, of course, illegitimate\nand must be counted in as school pupils.\n\nWe have written a number of times about\nthe shocking conditions prevailing yet\nnothing is ever done.\n\nLast year an inspector visited the school\nto see what was required and was accompanied\nby Mr. Papineau and of course nothing was\ndone. Why must Mr. Papineau be forever\nin the foreground? The inspector did\nnot come near me. Why not? This is\nan Anglican School and from the Anglican\nclergyman yet Mr. Papineau went\nwith the inspector while I knew\nnothing of the inspectors visit until\nhe had gone.\n\nWe are trying to get our just rights and do\nall we can for the uplift of the Indians\nunder our charge but get no help or\nencouragement from the Dept. of Indian\nAffairs. Why?\n\nI await your esteemed reply.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. Edwin Weeks\nOttawa, April 10, 1930.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, drawing attention to the present condition of the Sucker Creek Indian Day School, and requesting that a new building be erected on another site. It is noted that the present condition of the school is due, in a certain measure, to the site on which the building is located. I may say in connection with school matters at this point that an Inspector from Headquarters will visit this Reserve during the next few months and enquire into the various matters dealt with in your letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. Edwin Weeks,\nThe Rectory,\nLittle Current,\nOnt.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF MR. INDIAN AGENT LEWIS,\nFOR THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER, 1930, ON THE SUCKER\nGREEK INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on File 19-4-7.\n\nThis building is very old and in a dilapidated condition. It is past having repairs carried out and unfit for further use as a school building. The condition of this school building would have been reported before now but it was thought that, on account of the unfavourable attendance, it might be the case that the school would close. The attendance from now on will be on the increase and if a school is to be continued a new building will have to be erected to accommodate the pupils as they require a certain degree of comfort which they obtain in the old building in use at present.\nDear Sir,\n\nI wrote you lastly last summer about the terrible state of the school at Sucker Creek Reserve & you promised that the Inspector would be round some time during summer to inspect airport.\n\nI believe he travelled round the island & visited some of the school, but I do not believe he visited Sucker Creek School. If he did, neither the teacher or myself saw anything of him.\n\nThe school building is a pitiful disgrace to any civilized country & is only fit for a stable. In bygone days it was used as a Church but finally was condemned to a new Church building erected.\n\nIt has served a number of years for a school building but no words can explain its miserable condition.\n\nThe Inspector, when he visited this mission before, was accompanied by Mr. Papineau of the Roman Church & he is himself. I understand a Roman Catholic will never get any fair play while in the hands of tubs of those schemers.\nI know that Mr. Papineau is trying his old game at Sucker Creek of bringing in children from other reserves; he will no doubt repeat his deception which worked so well at Sheguandah & other places.\n\nBefore he applies for a school at Sheguandah I would like to mention that there was, years ago, an agreement between the Dept. of Indian Affairs, the Bishop of the Roman Church & the Bishops of the Anglican Church, in which all agreed that when a reserve was in charge of either Anglican or Roman the other party should not enter.\n\nMr. Papineau has got himself established in three of our missions contrary to this agreement. He does just whatever he pleases. No one in authority seems to dare to stop him. He can break the law, spurn agreements, deceive & as crooked as he likes, no one can touch him. Whence comes all his power?\n\nI would ask you, sir, if we are to get any justice, any fair play from the Dept. of Indian Affairs or if every branch of the Govt. has sold its soul to the Church of Rome.\nSucker Creek School is hardly fit to burn. It is built in a swamp & almost inaccessible except in the summer months. I enclose a photo of this disreputable building & ask you to please state whether the Dept. of Indian Affairs intends to do anything for us or no.\n\nThe photo flatters the building considerably.\n\nI remain Dear Sir,\n\nYours sincerely\n\nRev. Edwin Weeks\nOttawa, November 7, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of the 31st ultimo, with reference to the condition of the classroom at the Sucker Creek Indian Day School. The Department is aware that this building is far from satisfactory and it is proposed to secure an appropriation for a new school next year. If there is evidence that there are a sufficient number of children to insure the future of this activity, the building will be erected. At your convenience, you might prepare a list of all the Protestant Indian children, by families, indicating those which are this Department's wards and showing the ages. All children under school age should be shown as well. Please forward this to Mr. Indian Agent Lewis and ask him to attach thereto his comments and send it to the Department. It would be well to indicate the distance each family resides from some central site on the reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

The building is terrible - holes in the floor, etc., and the present teacher, Miss Rosalind Weeks, did not show any enthusiasm. There were four or five children there and one boy had his cap on. Two others were playing marbles in the corner. I was afraid to ask if it was supposed to be recess, because the door was shut and all were in the school. It was a bright, sunny day.\n\nI selected a new site and, as soon as funds are available, the Department will have to rebuild. In the meantime, there is no reason why some effort should not be made with the present equipment, and the first step will be to secure a new teacher.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Lewis is quite satisfied that the attendance would improve considerably if a good teacher were appointed. The Chief of the Band is supposed to be the truant officer, but he is evidently useless for this purpose. It may be necessary to use the services of the police from time to time.\n## INDIAN TRUST FUND\n\n**The Department of Indian Affairs.**\n\nTo Rosalind Weeks,\n\n| DATE     | AMOUNT |\n|----------|--------|\n| **1931** |        |\n| July 15  |        |\n|          | Authorised by Dept. letter No. dated |\n| June 15  |        |\n|          | To paid T.

However, the resolution was not passed as there was no money on which they demanded a guarantee and to which I was not prepared to promise. They felt that as they are supplying the funds that their labour should be used whenever possible. They have adjourned for one week and have asked me to secure this contract from the Department.\n\nSince then I have seen Mr. Birch, the local contractor whom I have spoken and he says that a scheme could be worked out\u2014using Indians for the excavating and hauling\u2014a cement mixer and his assistant, with two Indian helpers\u2014two carpenters and three or four Indians.\nThis seems to run to be quite satisfactory and would, I think, meet the demands of the Indians. Would it be possible, however, to give them this promise? The Council meets again on April 11th and I should appreciate an answer before that time.\n\nMr. Buch tells me that the building should be completed by in a month's time. Is it that we could be possible to commence operations by May 15th so I would like to see the school completed before I leave?\n\nAlso, I would like to have a full interview with you and Mr. Buch before things were started. This could be arranged later.\n\nI shall communicate the contents of this letter to Mr. Henry by this post.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIn this case would the power of Nindie rest with the Band or with the Department?\nOttawa, April 7, 1932.\n\nDear Mr. Dill:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, with reference to the Council Meeting of the Sucker Creek Band, which was held at Mr. Lewis' request. The Council can be assured that the Department will insist on the contractor or foreman using Indians for all rough labour. Of course, the arrangements, whether by contract or day labour, would have to be left with the Department and the Architect. I do not consider it necessary for you to make a special trip to Ottawa in connection with the plans, if the building is proceeded with. We could send you a set and you could make any suggestions you wished.\n\nPursuant to your Long Distance telephone call, I may say that the Department will insist on controlling the school. All the current expenses would be met from Parliamentary Appropriation, and it would really be in the best interests of the Band itself if we continued our control, as formerly. A copy of this letter is being forwarded to Mr. Lewis, for his information.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T.

As the Department has been unable to secure funds for the erection of new buildings this year, we asked the Sucker Creek Band if they would like us to use their funds for the purpose. As the Council of the Band is favourable to this scheme, I am making a recommendation in the matter to the Honourable Mr. Murphy. I may add, for your information, that Section 95 of the Indian Act gives the Governor in Council authority, with the consent of the Band, to expend their Capital moneys in the construction of improvements when they will be of permanent value to the Band.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nG.

MURPHY,\n\nThe building at the Sucker Creek Indian Day School has outlived its usefulness and is urgently in need of replacement. As it has not been possible to include items for new buildings in our Estimates, the Department asked the Sucker Creek Band if they were willing to take from the Capital Account of their Band Funds the $6,500 which is needed for a combined classroom and teacher's residence. At the present time, they have sent $2,000 for this account. The Council of the Band approves the willingness to use Band Funds for the purpose, provided that the Department will insist on the employment of Indians for all unskilled labour. I am therefore preparing a memorandum for submission to His Excellency in Council. Section 92 of the Indian Act gives the Governor in Council authority to expend their capital funds in the construction of improvements of permanent value.\n\nIf Indians are to be employed as far as possible, the only satisfactory method of construction will be on a day labour basis. It will be necessary to have the name of a competent carpenter foreman of Little Current, to whom we can entrust the work and who will engage whatever skilled labour is necessary. Further, please let me know from what firms in Little Current the Department should purchase the lumber and building hardware.\n\nThe Sucker Creek Indian Day School is approximately 4 miles west of Little Current, which is in the federal district of Algoma East.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nManitowaning, April 26th, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to Departmental Letter No. I9-4-5 of the 29th, of March last with reference to the question of erecting a combined classroom and teacher's residence to replace the old school building at Sucker Creek Reserve, and my letter of the 15th instant enclosing therewith a copy of a motion passed in council by the Indians of Sucker Creek Band authorizing the Department to expend $6,500.00 from their Band Funds for this purpose, I have the honour to report that I am in receipt of a further communication from the Chief of Sucker Creek Band making request that I should ask the Department to let the matter of erecting this building stand over another year. Since the council meeting held on the 15th instant the Indian members have been giving this matter due consideration and now they feel that they have made a mistake in voting such a large amount from their Band Funds towards erecting the proposed school building.\n\nAs practically all the Indians of Sucker Creek Band now feel that the amount asked for by the Department will cut their Band Funds to too great an extent I believe that it would be well to let this project stand for another year. With some repairs the old building can be made use of for the time being.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nApril 29th, 1932.\n\nDear Mr. Nicholson,\n\nSince our conversation this morning the Department has received a communication from the Indian agent at Manitowaning stating that the Sucker Creek Indians upon further consideration have decided to ask the Department not to take action on the resolution to expend $6,500 from their band funds for the purpose of erecting a new school building; they feel that this is rather too much of a drain on their funds at the present time. The Department is disposed to abide by their request.\n\nI thought it well that you should know this as soon as possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. G. Nicholson, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 30, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 254-43's of the 15th and 26th instant, with reference to using Band Funds for the erection of a classroom and teacher's residence on the Sucker Creek reserve. I note the Chief of the Band writes that the Indians feel they have made a mistake in voting the $6,500 which will be required for this purpose. In view of this, the Department will not proceed with the erection of the building this year but will try to secure an item in next year's Estimates for the purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nOttawa, July 5, 1932.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nIt is possible that Band Funds may be used to repair the Sucker Creek Indian Day School, so that it will be more habitable during the coming academic year, if the Department promises to give the Band the free use of this building when the new school is erected. The Band, of course, will use it for council meetings, etc. This suggestion has been made to the Department by Mr. George Dill, who is doing some special work in Ottawa for the Superintendent of Indian Education.\n\nThe origin of this old building is somewhat shrouded in mystery as far as the departmental files are concerned, and it is quite possible, and even probable, that the Anglican Church originally assisted with the cost of construction. Before definitely promising the Indian Band the use of the building when it is no longer required as a school, the Department wishes to have the concurrence or comment of Your Lordship.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRight Rev. Rockborough R. Smith, M.A., D.D.,\nBishop of Algoma,\nBishophurst,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nOttawa, July 5, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. George Dill, teacher of the Sucker Creek Indian Day School, reports to the Department that there is some talk of the Band using the present school house when it is no longer needed for educational purposes. If this is the case, it will have to be repaired. The floor must be replaced, at a cost of approximately $90; it needs reroofing, whitewashing and inside decorating and a new door will be required if the floor is raised. It occurred to the Department that the Band might be willing to expend the necessary funds for these repairs this year, on the understanding that they be allowed the use of the building as soon as a new school is provided. Please discuss this with the Band and let the Department have a close estimate of the total cost. This should receive your early attention, even if it is necessary to call a special Band meeting.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. J.

The unevenness of this floor averages 6\" from point to point. In order to make a job it will be necessary to lay a complete net work of 2\" - 2 x 6 and narrower to cover the floor that is there at the present time, which will necessitate considerable ripping as the 2\" will have to be fitted and ripped from a tapering point up to 6\". The old platform will have to be torn out. On top of this net work of 2\" material a floor of #1 common white pine would answer the purpose. The total cost of leveling and laying floor would be approximately $90.00.\n\nThe best way would probably be to tear out the entire floor and under structure, lay new sills where necessary and cover same with 2 x 8's spaced 2' centres. On these joists to put a dressed sheathing floor and over this I x 4 #1 White pine Tongue and groove. By tearing out the entire inside bottom and the price of this complete would cost $195.00.\n\nIf the floor is raised instead of being torn out a new door will be required the cost of the door plus hanging etc will amount to $10.00.\n\nTo paint to interior walls and ceiling of this building with two coats of good paint any colour the cost of material, labour, scaffold etc will amount to $57.00.\n\nThe roof is in poor condition, it may require new sheathing, but cannot tell until the old shingles are taken off. The cost to shingle this building with high class white cedar shingles, which are 8\" and up clear, tear off the old shingles, furnish whatever lumber necessary for ridge boards, the total cost for entire job $74.00.\n\nThe outside walls of this building are of very old rough lumber which cannot be painted. It would be well to have it whitewashed with lime. The cost of material and labour for one coat would amount to $35.00 or two coats for $65.00.\n\nThe total cost of the necessary repairs to this building would amount to at least $296.00.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nL.

And also I enclose herewith a copy of a resolution passed in council by the Sucker Creek Band asking the Department to grant sufficient funds to have the necessary repairs carried out to this building.\n\nAs this old structure is in such a state of deterioration it is scarcely worth making the above amount of repairs, and if these repairs are carried out it will still be an old rough shell but will answer the purpose as a class room until such a time as the Department will procure funds available to erect a new school building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n| No. of Cts | QT.

The building was put up as a Church, I am informed, and I have seen myself the old East Windows of the Church.\nDiocese of Algoma\n\nBISHOP: THE RIGHT REV. ROCKSBOROUGH R.

If the Department is\nwilling to repair the building, pending the\nelection of another School, I am opinion\nthat the building should still remain the\nproperty of the Church of England in Canada\nin this Diocese and I am prepared to\nundertake that it shall be lent to the\nIndians, when no longer required as a\nSchool, for such community purposes\nas the holding of Council Meetings.\nbut I am not prepared to hand it over unrestrainedly to the Indians because I am told that there is every prospect that, if this were done, they would use it for such purposes as the holding of services by the Holy Roller sect. Quite apart from any question of religious denominations, I am convinced that the Holy Rollers do no good to the Indians whom they excite to wild manifestations or uncontrolled savings which cannot but be harmful to them. I trust that the Department holds similar views on this matter towards which my own experience\nin dubitably inspires me. I could not agree to the use of Church property for purposes of this kind, though, as I have said, I do not object to their using the building in any normal and sensible purpose.\n\nYours Sincerely\n\n+Rocksborough R. Algoma\nOttawa, August 22, 1932.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 11th instant, regarding the ownership of the Sucker Creek Indian Day School building. It is noted that this building is, undoubtedly, church property.\n\nThe Department is requesting Mr. Indian Agent Lewis, of Manitowaning, to ascertain definitely from the members of the Band if they would be prepared to allow the amount required in carrying out the proposed repairs to be taken from the funds at their credit in the Department. The Agent is being informed that Your Lordship would be prepared to undertake that this building be lent to the Indians for such community purposes as the holding of council meetings and for any normal and sensible purpose, when it is no longer required by the school. It is to be understood, however, that the ownership of the building will remain in the diocese. I may add that the Department will have no funds from Parliamentary Appropriation to carry out the repairs, and, if the members of the Band consent to the use of their funds, the repairs required would be performed as soon as possible.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRight Rev. R. R. Smith, M.A., D.D.,\nBishop of Algoma,\nSault Ste. Marie,\nOnt.\nSir:\n\nI have to refer to your letter of the 25th ultimo, concerning the resolution of the Sucker Creek Band, in connection with funds for the proposed repairs to the Sucker Creek Indian Day School building. Please ascertain definitely whether the Indians will agree to the using of their own funds to provide the cost of carrying out these repairs. In this connection I have to say that a communication has been received from His Lordship the Bishop of Algoma, regarding the ownership of the building. He states that it is, undoubtedly, church property and that it was put up as a church. He further states that, if the Department is willing to repair the building, pending the erection of another school, it should still remain the property of the Church of England. However, when the old building is no longer required by the school, His Lordship is prepared to undertake that it shall be lent to the Indians for such community purposes as the holding of council meetings or for any other normal and sensible purposes.\n\nIt is noted, from the estimate of the cost which you submitted, that the repairs required will amount to approximately $300. Please state how you would recommend these repairs be carried out. Could you arrange for the purchase of the materials and have the work performed by Indian labour, or would it be necessary to engage the services of a contractor - he to supply all material and labour?\n\nThe Department will expect an early reply, giving full information, as requested above.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Affairs.\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:\n\nWe the Sucker Creek Band are very sorry we made such a blunder in asking the Dept. to repair our school house. We thought all the time the building belonged to the Band, we did not know the Bishop of Algoma had a claim on it. We are asking where did we surrender the building to the Bishop at Algoma, not at any time that we knew of.\n\nThe Indians of S. Creek built the school themselves forty five years ago without much expense; the Ind. Dept. donated a few dollars towards it, the Indians did the work, and no wages was paid to them. So please show me where the Anglicans have the claim and if the Bishop claims it is up to him to repair it. I absolutely refuse to touch it from now on.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nChief Chas Obotstang\nLittle Current Oat.\nSucker Creek Res.\nAug. 26/83\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAt a meeting held in the Sucker Creek Res. it was moved by Anthony Tahigheyonge, seconded by Wm.

A meeting of the Indians was held at Sucker Creek Reserve on the 26th instant concerning this matter, and it was decided that the band would not take any further action in having repairs carried out to this building; a copy of the resolution to that effect I enclose herewith.\n\nThe Indians were unaware of the fact that the Church of England had a claim on this building. They maintain that it was erected some forty-five years ago through gratis labour by the Indians and a small grant from the Department, and they cannot understand how the Church should claim this property. A communication from the chief of the band concerning this matter is enclosed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n2 enclosures.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDiocese of Algoma\n\nBISHOP: THE RIGHT REV.

Marie, Ontario\nSept. 2nd, 1932\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter number 19-4-5, dated August 22nd, I note that you have accepted my offer to lend the school building at Sucker Creek to the Indians for what you describe as \"any normal and sensible purpose\", an excellent phrase which exactly conveys the meaning which I wished to suggest. The Church has every desire to assist the Indians in any activities which are conducive to their moral and social welfare.\n\nI shall hope to hear from you before long regarding the decision of the Band on the question of the proposed repairs to the school.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 13, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, regarding the repairs required to the Sucker Creek Indian Day School, and enclosing a resolution of the Band refusing to provide, from their Band funds, the expenditure required in the repairs; also letter which you enclosed from the Chief regarding the ownership of the building.\n\nAs the Indians have refused to allow their funds to be used, and, as we will be unable to provide from our Appropriation this year the amount required, I regret that these repairs will have to stand over for the present. We are informing his Lordship the Bishop of Algoma accordingly.\n\nHis Lordship's attention has also been drawn to the claim of the Indians as to the ownership of the building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning,\nOnt.\nOttawa, September 13, 1932.\n\nRight Rev. Sir:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 2nd instant, with reference to the school building at Sucker Creek.\n\nRegarding the repairs, I have to inform Your Lordship that, at a meeting of the Indians held on the 26th ultimo, they would not consent to provide from their Band funds the amount required to carry out the repairs. I regret the Department will have no funds from its Appropriation to provide the cost of the repairs. The local Indian Agent was informed that you considered the building to be undoubtedly Church property. This, no doubt, had a bearing on the Indians refusal to provide the funds required for its repair. The Agent states the Indians were unaware of the fact the Church of England had a claim on this building and that they maintain it was erected some forty-five years ago through gratis labour by the Indians, with a small grant from the Department. I regret, therefore, that the repairs, which it is estimated will cost approximately $500, will have to stand over for the present.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nRt. Rev. R. R. Smith, M.A., D.D.,\nBishop of Algoma,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter No. 19-4-5, dated September 13th, I regret that the Indians at Sucker Creek will not consent to provide funds for the repairs of the school from the funds of their band. If I had known this earlier in the year I might have made an appeal for part of the money from the Woman's Auxiliary of this Diocese. It is too late, however, to do that this year, but I will do my best to see what can be done. I am told by our missionary at Little Current that the Chief at Sucker Creek is very hostile to our Church because he wished to have the school building as a meeting house for those strange people who are commonly called \"The Holy Rollers\". I am, moreover, informed that the activities of these people are producing a very bad effect on the morals of the Indians, men and women rolling about the floor in a most indecent manner. I believe that there is a good deal of truth in these reports.\n\nWith regard to the teacher at this school, I have to inform you that Mr. George Dill who, I understand, has been doing work for the Department during the summer at Ottawa, has not returned to his post, and I have appointed Miss Turnbull to take charge of the school for the time being, as an emergency measure. I sincerely hope that the Department will allow Mr. Dill to return to the school as soon as possible as it is extremely difficult, as you know, to find satisfactory teachers so late in the year.\nI have not asked for your formal approval of Miss Turnbull because it was an urgent matter, and I understood would only last for a few weeks. I presume that you will pay Mr. Dill for that period and that he will hand on the salary to her.\n\nI do not wish to make any formal complaint, but I think you will agree with me that it is hardly fair that the Department should keep one of our teachers in Ottawa at a time when he should have returned to his post in one of your schools. As I am responsible for the nomination of a teacher to this school, I feel that I should have been consulted in the matter.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Acting Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 19, 1932.\n\nRight Rev. Sir:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 15th instant, with reference to repairs to the building at the Sucker Creek Indian Day School, and also regarding the teaching services.\n\nIn reply I have to say that Mr. George Dill, who has been employed on special work in connection with the standardization of texts for Indian schools, will be resuming duties as teacher on the 3rd of October. I regret that Your Lordship was not informed, but the services of Mr. Dill have been required for a longer period than was anticipated. The appointment of Miss Turnbull to temporarily take charge of this school is approved. She will be allowed salary for the period she teaches during the present month, upon receipt of the usual return showing attendance, days taught, etc.\n\nI may add that, when our Estimates for the next fiscal year are being prepared, consideration will be given to placing an item therein to provide the cost of repairs to the school building.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRt. Rev. R. R. Smith, M.A., D.D.,\nBishop of Algoma,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\nTo Mr. Sutherland:\n\nAs the repainting of the Buck Lake school seems to be definitely out of question I write to ask if the Department will supply sufficient paint for this interior. It would take between three and five gallons for the two coats which would be needed. The walls would have to be washed as they are filthy. This and the painting would be done by Indians and would not be very expensive.\n\nI shall be glad to know if funds are available for this purpose.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nOctober 12,
