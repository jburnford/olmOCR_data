Mr. Staley, Principal, has requested me to bring to your attention a few additional matters pertaining to the school.\n\nYou will recall that when you last visited this school he mentioned the need for more lavatory accommodation in the boys' basement consisting of more wash-basins, and two more toilets, and it was suggested that these services be placed in the room off the play-room then used as a kitchen store-room. You replied that this matter had better be deferred until towards the completion of the building, by which time it could be seen if any money would then be available.\n\nAs a result of the alterations in the older building, the room formerly used as the Principal's office has been retained as a kitchen store-room in place of the basement store-room, and it is in this latter room that the suggested lavatory fixtures be located.\n\nF.H. Lepper & Co., who installed the plumbing in the new addition of the school, quote a price of $150.00 to provide \"one large wash-sink, F-6482-A Standard Sanitary Catalogue, 3 ft long\u2014this sink being equal to 3 basins.\" This firm also quote a price of $150.00 to install two toilets in the same room, or $105.00 for one toilet, including the necessary drains, traps and vents. Prices quoted are exclusive of the breaking and making good of the concrete floor. To install the wash-basins and two toilets as quoted, plus the floor work, and plus the toilet stalls, would bring the cost of these services up to approximately $350.00, or to about $295.00 if only one toilet were supplied.\n\nRev. Mr. Staley has also asked me to mention that the matter of renewal of defective wood floors has been in abeyance for some time, and had been asked for in their estimates. These floors are badly worn, and he would like to know if they can be replaced with new flooring where necessary. To meet his request would require about 2000' of E.G. fir flooring, and the labour and materials would amount to about $250.00.\n\nA third request is for the replacement of the platform and steps at the rear of the school, being the boys' entrance to the basement play-room. These steps and platform are now falling to pieces, and if rebuilt might better be done in concrete. We have just about enough cement and gravel on hand to do this work, and could thus be done at no great cost, probably for $25.00.\n\nWe have already had to do a great deal of inescapable work in the existing building, and this added to the work called for in the new addition, in labour and materials, leave no margin for the additional requests, unless this further outlay be authorized. I am therefore passing on these requests to the Department, and will await your instructions before undertaking this further outlay.\nIn the event of the Department granting the request for the additional wash-basins for the boys, it is proposed to transfer the three existing wash-basins in the boys' play-room to the girls' basement play-room to supplement the three basins there, which change would entail but a nominal cost. There would then be the equivalent of 8 wash-basins in the boys' basement lavatory, and 6 basins in the girls' end, which the Principal says would be about right.\n\nMy 4 carpenters are now working at making the cupboards, lockers, shelving, new dining-room tables and benches, etc.; and 4 painters are doing the outside painting of the old building and new addition. The building will look immeasurably better in its new colours.\n\nLast Sunday Dr. G.D. Stanley, M.P., paid a visit to this Reserve, and he told me next day how very pleased he is over the way the money granted has been expended here, and the good value obtained in the new buildings. He addressed a large gathering of Indians and whites in the church, it being a Silver Jubilee service.\n\nOn the advice of Mr. Christianson, I have deferred my trip to Grouard until the 13th instant in consequence of another heavy fall of snow on the 6th, and he feared there might be still more snow farther north. The snow hereabouts is now all gone except the heavy drifts, and by next week the conditions should be favourable for my inspection of St. Bruno's School. I will report promptly after my inspection. I expect to be absent from Morley for about a week.\n\nAwaiting your valued instructions regarding the foregoing requests of the Reverend Principal of the Morley school,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nBuilding Supervisor.\nMorley, Alta. April 30th,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nReport on Addition to Indian School.\n\nSir:\n\nNearly all the work indicated as yet to be done in my Report of the 3rd instant is now completed, and the new rooms provided are now in occupation.\n\nThe plasterers returned on the 23rd instant, and spent a busy week plastering the new partition separating the enlarged boys' and girls' dormitories, the lavatory extension, the old and new stair areas, and considerable patching in the older building. Also, while here, they repaired the ceilings of the class-rooms building where plaster had fallen. All this work is now completed, and has been well done by the plastering contractors, Jonathan & Sons, of Calgary.\n\nThe basement floor of the new addition has also been laid, and the plastering contractors did the trowelling of the finish coat, some of which had to be done in overtime hours so as to catch the cement at the right stage. We used \"Master Mix\" concrete hardener on this floor, so as to insure a hard dust-proof surface. It took 10 gals, costing $1.90 per gal.\n\nThe Department authorized an extra expenditure of $125.00 to provide a stage off the new basement, for which object we left an opening of 14\" in the centre of the divisional wall. This stage will have a lumber floor 13\" higher than the basement level, and be provided with accordion doors hung from an overhead track. This work has yet to be done.\n\nThe metal ceilings throughout the new addition are now completed, and look very well. We have painted them white. I was able to give them a variety of pleasing patterns without extra cost. It was necessary to renew the metal ceilings in the existing building in places where excessive corrosion had taken place, and a great deal of patching had to be done where the furnace pipes and risers had passed through.\n\nThe electrical work has also been completed. The electrical contractor, Mr. Lloyd Orr, of Calgary, carried out this work very efficiently, doing both the wiring of the new addition in conduit, and supplying and hanging the fixtures. It was necessary to change and extend the gong wiring and bells; and to make a number of changes in the existing building to improve the service, and to comply with the more recent requirements of the Electric Code. The Underwriters' Inspector, Mr. R.Wagner, checked over the work, and issued the required certificate.\nI was duly advised by the Indian Agent that authority had been granted to spend $750.00 on cupboards, lockers, shelving, etc., and a start is being made today in providing these requirements. It will take tight squeezing to get this work done for the sum allowed as there was an entire absence of lockers in the existing building, and a shortage of tables and cupboards.\n\nThe plumbing contractor, F.H. Lepper & Co., of Calgary, is now setting up the plumbing fixtures in the lavatory extension and dormitory, this work having been deferred until the completion of the plastering, and it will be completed tomorrow. The plumbing service in the new dormitory has been in operation for some time. Certain repairs in the plumbing of the existing building seemed unavoidable, and have been done while the plumber was on the job. For instance, the floor drain in the boy's basement play-room beside the wash-basins has been long out of commission, so I had the concrete broken and an examination made. This revealed that the trap was broken and the drain blocked, so I am having a new trap installed and this service restored. Other repairs of like nature will have been noted in the plumber's accounts. I felt sure it was the Department's intention that all services be left in good working order in the old as well as in the new building, and I have given orders accordingly.\n\nI was also advised of the authority to re-paint the walls, roof and trim of the existing building so that the entire structure would conform with the colours of the adjacent Department buildings. This outside painting is well started, but is being much interrupted by unfavourable weather. We are experiencing one of the most backward seasons on record, and even today, the last day of April, we are getting a further fall of snow, and the ground is as white as in mid-winter. The inside painting and staining is now well advanced, and as soon as the weather permits, we shall resume the outside painting. I am employing two Indians to help with the outside painting, but am unable to use them on interior work. Two competent white painters are doing the inside work, now nearly completed.\n\nThe new heating plant is proving very advantageous compared with the former hot air furnaces. The Danham Heating Co.'s engineer, Mr. Alex. Walker, who has recently returned from Ottawa, intends to visit the job again, and make a final check of the heating service; and I am also arranging for an early visit of the Provincial Boiler Inspector who will inspect the two boilers at the school as well as the hospital boiler, and from whom we shall obtain the required Certificates.\n\nThe costs are running very close to the estimates, and with the additional sums authorized for the extra work, I think we shall about break even. I will send a segregated statement of costs at an early date.\n\nSpeaking generally, the work is now on the last lap, and should be entirely completed within the next two or three weeks. I am arranging to be absent for a week or so to make the inspection of the St. Bruno's School, as instructed, and intend leaving for the north on May 9th.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nBuilding Supervisor.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nTo: Lloyd Orr Electric,\nCalgary,\nAlta.\n\nDATE 1935\n\nSERVICE\n\nMay 6 Account, Electrical work at Morley Indian Residential School, as per invoice attached.\n\nAuthority: E.R.

New Building, $66.68\n2. Fixtures, $74.31\n3. Bells & Alarms $50.15\n4. Dining Room, $30.35\n5. Alterations, $18.16\n6. Change Switching in Dorms. $9.77\n7. Attic Lighting $25.67\n8. Fire Escapes $14.89\n9. Pressure Tank $20.68\n10. Lamps Elec. $21.00\n11. Basement Alterations Switch $8.21\n12. West Porch $4.08\n13. Rear Entrances $11.37\n14. Drying Room $7.53\n15. Laundry $9.63\n\n$372.28 - $372.25\n\nExplanations of Above Items.\n\n1. New Building, $66.68. The labour & materials shown under this heading together with the account of $197.32 previously rendered and paid for brings the cost of wiring the new addition to $264.00, exclusive of fixtures and lamps.\n\n2. Fixtures, $74.31. This charge is for all the lighting fixtures required, exclusive of light bulbs.\n\n3. Bells & Alarms, $50.15. The bell system and fire alarm signals had to largely changed, and extended. Two new fire gongs and one signal bell, with extra push buttons were supplied and installed.\n\n4. Dining Room, $30.35. In removing walls and stairway to enlarge the Dining Room, the existing wiring concealed in said walls had to be run elsewhere and changes made.\n\n5. Alterations, $18.16. At the request of the Rev. Principal a hall and store-room were incorporated in the ground floor plan of the new addition, which accounts for the labour and materials charged under this heading.\n\n6. Change Switching in Dormitories, $9.77. The building of a new divisional partition across the existing girls' dormitory made it necessary to alter the circuit and switching.\n\n7. Attic Lighting, $25.67. The attic over both the existing school and the new addition are used for storing clothing, etc., when not being used. This item covers the cost of conduit lighting, switches and outlets for the entire attic.\n\n8. Fire Escapes, $14.89. Formerly open wiring carried light to fire escape platforms. This is contrary to the Electric Code, and has been replaced with conduit wiring.\n\n9. Pressure Tank, $20.68. We found the pressure running wild in this tank. Both the obsolete safety valve and the electric cut out were not functioning, with danger to the system. The plumber installed a new safety valve; and the item under this heading covers the cost of a dependable automatic pressure switch and connections.\nExplanations of Electric Account cont'd.\n\n10. Lamps (Electric), $21.09. This item covers the cost of the 46 lamps required, of varying strength, as requested.\n\n11. Basement Alterations, $8.21. It became necessary to change the switching in the existing basement, and provide an extra switch.\n\n12. West Porch, $4.08. The cost of a light extension to this porch.\n\n13. Rear Entrances, $11.27. The two rear entrances were formerly supplied with drop lights from open wiring brought from circuits in the main building. These have been replaced with conduit wiring in compliance with the Code.\n\n14. The former east furnace room has been converted into a drying room, with a doorway cut through from the adjoining laundry. This item covers the cost of providing this new room with suitable lighting, at a cost of $7.23.\n\n15. Laundry, $9.63. The wiring in the laundry has been extended, and conduit outlets brought to the laundry machines. This outlay makes the operation of the laundry both safer and more convenient.\nOffice of the Stony Indian Agency,\nMorley, Alta., May 8th, 1935\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 37, amounting to $572.25 in favour of Lloyd Orr Electric, Calgary, Alta., for Electrical work; Morley Indian Residential School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 119-1-5 dated Oct. 24th, 1934, R.R.

A great deal of \"making good\" had to be done in the original building, especially where partitions, stairways, etc., had been removed, and floors patched.\n\nAccording to our books here, and to meet the final pay-roll, the sum of $532.08 will be required. If the $500 previously asked for has already been sent, then I would respectfully request that the further sum of $32.08 be also sent, to meet the said pay-roll of $532.08.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nJuly 4, 1935.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 21st of June with reference to work at the Morley Indian Residential School, I beg to advise you that the Order-in-Council has today been passed authorizing the additional funds required for this work.

He had a young boy help him, age 10, and not at all bright. Another boy about the same age acted as lookout. The fire was kindled last night and went out. This morning it was started again and burned through the wall boards of the coal bin, and if it had had another 15 minutes start, the building would have gone.\n\nThe local R.C.M.P. got the story from the boys this morning and in the presence of Mr. Staley, and myself, and we are all agreed that the best punishment as well as deterrent, would be for all three boys to be severely strapped, and the ringleader, Jock Simson, be sent to the Indian School at Edmonton until he reaches the age of discharge.\n\nThe three boys are being kept in confinement pending your approval.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nW. B. MURRAY,\nIndian Agent.\n\nM. Christianson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCALGARY, Alta.\nSir:\n\nI beg to attach hereto copy of a letter which I have just received from Dr. W. Barr Murray, Indian Agent at Morley, from which you will note that an attempt was made to set fire to the School. I was talking to Doctor Murray on the telephone this morning, and it now develops that another boy is implicated in the matter.\n\nIt is my intention to go up to Morley tomorrow afternoon, and on my return I shall report further to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOn the 2nd inst., the above named informed me that an attempt had been made to burn the Indian School at Morley and asked that an investigation be made.\n\nAccompanied by the Indian Agent, Dr. W. Murray, a patrol left at once for the school and on arrival were taken to the scene of this fire. In the coal bin, on the southwest corner of the building there was found evidence that there had been a fire. In the corner of the coal bin was found some cut chips and a small piece of burnt paper. The wall in the corner of the bin had been badly burnt through inside wall burnt through and the sill badly charred. The fire had started to eat into wall and the draft had carried the flames upward toward the first floor. The fire was out at this time about 10:00 a.m.; watch was being kept in the event of any smouldering in the inside timbers.\n\nThis is the old part of the school and the wood wall comes below the ground. There is a window in the coal bin. The covering boards had been torn away and outside the window were tracks of running shoes. Near the windows on the ground were some more cut chips. These chips had been cut with a jack knife.\n\nThe amount of damage done was very small due to the prompt action taken by the staff in putting the fire out and about $2.00 worth of lumber will replace the damage done.\n\nMr. Stayley was asked if he had any idea who was responsible for setting the fire and he stated that a boy named Jock Simeon had admitted setting the fire. He had been assisted by another boy Paul Dixon.\n\nJock Simeon was questioned. He stated that he was 14 years old and that he had set this fire so that he could have to go to school. On the night of the fire he had attempted to start the fire but his match had not lit. He could not burn. When he got up in the morning he had taken two other boys with him. One of them had stayed outside the furnace room to see if any person came along so that they could escape to get away without being seen. Jock had kindled, poured the gasoline over it and given it to Paul Dixon who had lit the fire. Both boys escaped at once one by way of the window, the other had been taken off to make a draft, and then joined the Lefthand boy on his way up.\nThe time was about 7:30 when this fire was set. At 7:45 a.m., Mr. J. Hogarth, one of school staff, smelled smoke in the staff dining room and went to the basement thinking that the water heater was smoking. This is a very unusual thing and at that time he did not think anything unusual of the smoke. On his return the smell of smoke was much stronger and accompanied by Mr. Locke, another member of the school staff, they went to the basement again when they saw smoke and sparks coming from the No. 1 corner near the coal bin. Steps were at once taken to put out the fire and with their prompt action no further damage was done and the fire got no further along inside of the walls. The doors were not locked into any of these rooms and the pupils had free access to this part of the building.\n\nPaul Dixon stated that he had assisted the Simeon boy in the morning to start this fire. Simeon had given him the matches to light the fire. Dixon's age is ten years and there is no doubt but that Simeon being an older boy was the leader of this party. The Left Hand boy acting as the Look Out had nothing to do with the setting of the fire but was only acting on the instructions of the older boy.\n\nBoth of the small boys connected with this are well spoken of by their teachers and as yet never mixed in any mischief of any serious nature.\n\nThe Simeon boy has a very low mental rating and is considered not very bright by his teachers. He is of a sullen manner and when reprimanded tends to sulk.\n\nThe Indian Agent pointed out that if this fire had started the night before it would have been very serious and no doubt if the school had burnt some of the children might have been burnt to death. This boy did not seem to consider this and stated so. Dr. Murray is recommending to the Indian Dept. that this boy be transferred to the Indian School at Edmonton. The other two boys will be given the cane for their part in the affair.\n\nDr. Murray and Mr. Stayley consider that sending this boy to Edmonton and having him attend the school at that point would be much better and have a more lasting effect on the boy than any other punishment. The school at Edmonton is a fireproof building and he will have no chance to repeat his offence. There is no doubt but this boy planned this fire and took much time to make his plan successful.\n\nIn the afternoon of yesterday's date, Oct. 1st, the parents of this boy were warned and a meeting was held at the Indian Agency where the whole matter was explained to them. This patrol was made by private car.\n\nFurther report will be submitted when the Dept. decide on the transfer of this boy to Edmonton.\n\nUNLESS INVESTIGATION\n\nThe Insp. of Indian Agencies,\nCALGARY.\n\nSIR: Copy for your information.\n\nBenfr, 3-10-35 (A.G.

E. J. Staley, Principal\n\nIndian Residential School\nUnited Church of Canada\nSir:\n\nI beg to attach hereto police reports on the attempted arson at the Morley Indian Residential School by some boys there. I am aware that the Department receive these police reports, but in case these have not been received as yet, I am forwarding them to you.\n\nAt the request of the Agent and the Indians I went up to Morley on Saturday afternoon and met the Band at the Agency, and the Indians themselves were very much worried over what had taken place and to explain it in the Indians' way they stated that they blamed themselves for this having happened as they had not trained their children properly before sending them to school, and during the time they were there, and that the boys would not have taken this action had they (the parents) been more strict with them. The Indians requested me to point out to the Department they did not want the boys sent away from the reserve to another school and that they would do everything in their power to see that the children behaved in future, and that they would talk to them and warn them. If anything of this nature were ever attempted again, the Indians were prepared to suffer the consequences, but they were quite confident it would not happen again. I am attaching hereto a letter from Mr. Staley, the Principal, who is of the same mind, and I concur with him in his opinion that the children should be let remain there. The Stony Indians are a very law-abiding lot, and as I have said before they feel the matter keenly, and if the boys are soundly strapped either by the Principal or the Parents in the presence of the Indian Agent, I feel this should suffice. I would ask that I be directed as soon as possible in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nOttawa, October 14, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nA request has been received, from the Principal of the Morley Indian Residential School, to be supplied with 6 school desks for pupils in the 7th and 8th grades and 6 school desks for pupils in the second and third grades.\n\nI would request that you ascertain definitely from the Principal the size and type of desk he requires and arrange for the purchase. It would be advisable, in order to have uniformity in the seating equipment, that the new desks be of the same type as those at present in the classroom.\n\nAfter the purchase has been made, please forward an itemized account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nM. Christianson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nCalgary,\nAlta.\nOttawa, October 15, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 409-11 B of the 4th and 7th instant, with attached correspondence, relative to the attempt that was made by certain of the pupils of the Morley Indian Residential School to set fire to the building.\n\nThe Department considers that this is a very serious matter and that punishment should be administered to the boys who made the attempt to set fire to the building. It is noted the Principal recommends that the boys be given a severe whipping instead of having them placed in other institutions and that you concur in this action; also that you concur with him in his opinion that the boys be allowed to remain at the Morley School. It is noted, further, that the Principal is prepared to accept full responsibility for their future conduct.\n\nThe boys concerned in an attempt to set fire to the building should receive adequate punishment, which will serve as a deterrent to them and as an example to the other pupils, and this should be administered either by the Principal or the parents, in the presence of the Indian Agent. The Department will approve of their punishment, as recommended by the Principal and yourself; rather than having the boys concerned sent to a reform school. This action is taken in view of the wishes of the Indians of the Studen Band and also the fact that the Principal has accepted full responsibility for the future conduct of these boys. The punishment should be carried out at the earliest date and all pupils should be informed that any further attempt on the part of anyone to damage the building by fire or otherwise will be more severely punished by having the pupil responsible committed by a magistrate to a term in a reform school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

MacKenzie, Sec.,\nYour File 119-1-5\n\nDear Mr. MacKenzie:\n\nIn reply to your letter of November 13th, we have now received payment from the Stony Indian Residential School, Morley, Alta. Had we heard from the Reverend Mr. Staley previously, it would not have been necessary to refer this matter to you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nROBINSON, LITTLE & CO., LIMITED.\n\nPer: [Signature]\n\nRTB\nSir:\n\nAt the request of Mr. Staley, I beg to ask authority to change some radiators at the Residential School.\n\nThere are two radiators in the kitchen which are never turned on as the large range there keeps the room warm enough.\n\nIn the sewing room there is one radiator on the east wall, which does not heat the room enough. This morning I found the sewing instructress out in the kitchen to warm up.\n\nMr. Staley wishes to have a plumber out to take the two radiators out of the kitchen and put one in the sewing room. The other radiator might be turned over to the plumber in part payment of his work, or kept on hand for some other use in the future.\n\nI beg to recommend that the change be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, January 22, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, relative to the request of the Principal of the Morley Indian Residential School to change two of the radiators in the kitchen and have one installed in the sewing room and the other kept on hand for future use.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of your arranging with a plumber for the removal of one of the radiators in the kitchen and its installation in the sewing room. It is considered, however, that the other radiator should remain in the kitchen where it may be required for future use.\n\nNo unnecessary expense should be incurred in the removal of the radiator and its installation in the sewing room. After the work has been completed, you should forward an itemized accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW.

The lining of the fire box is also very badly burned and in need of replacing, the retail cost of which I find on enquiry would be approximately $21.00. I am informed by the Rev. Principal of the school that the Alberta Iron Works have a pattern for these linings, and could make them up for $7.50.

I must say I have very little to report on this institution, as when the new addition was put on the school last year it was repaired throughout, and is in first class shape in every way, well furnished and well kept throughout. The furniture and fixtures are well arranged and well taken care of. The machinery is all in good shape.\n\nThere were 75 children present at the time of my visit. I believe everyone was under the impression that with the addition to the school it would take care of approximately 100 pupils. This did not work out, and from personal observation I would say it actually only takes care of the overflow under the previous arrangement. In going over the school and discussing it with Mr. Staley, I believe he should only have from 60 to 62 children in this institution at any one time.\n\nThe children all looked well and there was no sickness in the school at that time.\n\nDoctor Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nThe school has 40 head of cattle, 22 of which are cows, and they were milking 14 at the time of my visit, so the children are getting all the milk they require. They also make butter.\n\nThey have 9 horses at the school, 9 pigs and some chickens.\n\nThe Department are well aware that this school have no land of their own, and have to buy all the feed for their stock, &c. Some time ago I was advised by the Department that Lot 5 and part of Lot 7 in the Morleyville settlement that was used by the old MacDougall orphanage might be available. I sincerely hope it will be possible to procure these lots for the use of the school, which will give them just the amount of land they require for their farming operations.\n\nTheir gardening activities never meet with much success owing to frost during the summer.\n\nBUILDINGS:\u2014 As the Department are aware, the two classrooms are separate from the school in another building. This building is in A1 shape, except that it requires exterior painting. No paint has been put on the building since it was built several years ago, and the sooner this is done, the better. The shingle stain has practically been all washed off and the same may be said of the paint on the siding.\n\nThe outbuildings are not very pretentious and these also require painting. Mr. Staley informed me that if the paint for these buildings was supplied by the Department, it could be put on by\nthe Staff with the aid of the older boys, with no cost to the Department for labour. If any funds are available for this, I can give the Department an estimate of the amount of paint required.\n\nThe girls are getting a fairly good training in domestic science, and I always go into this phase of the work very thoroughly. The boys are getting very little outside training, except for doing the chores around the school and a little gardening. A certain amount of repair work is done in the shop by the older boys. This matter came up last December and I have a letter from the Department, No. 119-1-6 of December 27th, last, asking me for the approximate cost of tools required. This is attached to this report.\n\nI also went into the matter of the food the children are receiving, and I am of the opinion that they are well fed and clothed, and there is an ample supply of clothing for both boys and girls. I would say this institution is well run in every way.\n\nThe Staff consists of Rev. E. J. Staley, Principal; an engineer, labourer, male teacher and 6 lady members. There has been only one change in the personnel of the staff during the year. Mrs. Locke, formerly a teacher, is now Matron, and there is a new lady teacher on the staff. The Department have the school inspector's report on the classroom work and I would say from my own personal observation that the teachers are quite satisfactory and are interested in their work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

If any funds are available for this, I can give the Department an estimate of the amount of paint required.\n\nThe girls are getting a fairly good training in domestic science, and I always go into this phase of the work very thoroughly. The boys are getting very little outside training, except for doing the chores around the school and a little gardening. A certain amount of repair work is done in the shop by the older boys. This matter came up last December and I have a letter from the Department, No. 119-1-6 of December 27th, last, asking me for the approximate cost of tools required. This is attached to this report.\n\nI also went into the matter of the food the children are receiving, and I am of the opinion that they are well fed and clothed, and there is an ample supply of clothing for both boys and girls. I would say this institution is well run in every way.\n\nThe Staff consists of Rev. E. J. Staley, Principal; an engineer, labourer, male teacher and 6 lady members. There has been only one change in the personnel of the staff during the year. Mrs. Locke, formerly a teacher, is now Matron, and there is a new lady teacher on the staff. The Department have the school inspector's report on the classroom work and I would say from my own personal observation that the teachers are quite satisfactory and are interested in their work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nMay 18th, 1936.\n\nDear Mr. Christianson,\n\nI have read with interest your report on the Morley residential school and have passed the report on to the Schools Branch.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nM. Christianson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alta.\nOttawa, May 22, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your 409-11 of the 13th instant, reporting on your inspection of the Morley Indian Residential School. The Department is pleased to note that conditions, generally, are satisfactory.\n\nWith reference to transferring Lot S and part of Lot 7 in the Morleyville Settlement to this Department, for use of the school, I have to say that this matter is now before the Department of the Interior. We are advised, by the Lands Branch of that Department, that they have not yet been instructed what action to take. It is hoped to have the transfer arranged at an early date, and you will be advised when a decision has been made.\n\nRegarding the exterior painting of the building in which the two classrooms are located, I would inform you that the sum of $300 is available in the Appropriation for the current fiscal year, for paint and miscellaneous repairs at this school. The Department will approve of you arranging for the purchase of the paint, from a firm on the approved list, to have the exterior of this building painted. Should there be a sufficient amount available after obtaining the paint for the classroom building, you may utilize the same in the purchase of paint for the outbuildings. It is to be understood that all labour will be carried out by the staff, with the aid of the older boys, without cost to the Department. I would suggest that the painting of the classroom building be satisfactorily completed before incurring any expenditure in painting the outbuildings.\n\nThe Department has also the list and cost of the tools required for the manual training of the boys. I return the list herewith, and you may arrange for the purchase of the various items mentioned therein, at a cost not to exceed $132. You should obtain an itemized account, in triplicate, covering the cost, which you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. You should also obtain itemized accounts for the quantity of paint, oils, etc., certify and forward for payment.\n\nEncl.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nM.

We cannot, however, say definitely that this is so until the pump is removed and the well examined.\n\n3rd:- We find that what we consider to be the main cause is, that the school has been enlarged considerably, also that a modern Laundry has been installed; so that the water requirements are very much more than the present pump is able to handle, as this is only a small outfit which is used for ordinary residence purposes. The pressure tank is, however, of good size\u20144' by 16'.\n\nIn view of the above conditions, we consider and recommend that this well should be examined, and if found to have an accumulation of sand or silt that it be removed, and then a pump of much larger capacity be installed. We are pleased to quote you as follows:\n\nWe offer to remove the cylinder and piping from the well and find if the well requires to be cleaned, for the sum of $25.00 (twenty-five dollars).\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that the Morley School have been having some difficulty with a shortage of water, and it appears that the present equipment for pumping, and the cylinder that is in the well, are simply too small for the quantity of water now used by the School since the addition was built. Mr. Snyder from Calgary here installed the pumping outfit at the time the school was built, and in passing there a few days ago he called in at the school and Mr. Staley asked him to examine the equipment and report the matter to me. I am attaching hereto a letter which Mr. Snyder handed to me.\n\nI might say for the information of the Department that the well is only 40 feet deep, and apparently there is nothing wrong in the well itself, but the pumping outfit, as I have said before, is too small for the amount of water it is called upon to handle.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, July 20, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, with reference to the pumping equipment at the Morley Indian Residential School.\n\nYou may arrange for the removing of the cylinder and piping from the well, at a cost of $25. If the well requires cleaning, you may also expend an amount for this purpose, not exceeding $50.\n\nNo provision was made in this year's Appropriation for a new pumping unit for this school and, as our funds are limited, it will not be possible at the present time to consider Mr. Snyder's offer to install a new pumping unit, at a cost of $475.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nM. Christianson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alta.,\nMorley, Alta., July 17, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nI have been informed by Rev. E. J. Staley, principal of the Residential School, that there is almost no water available in the school well. This he considers is due to failure of the source of supply rather than a need of cleaning.\n\nThe well is drilled down to shale and as the depth of the shale is not known, further drilling is not considered feasible. The C.P.R. have an electric pump about 500 yards from the school used to pump water from the river to their tank at the station. Mr. Staley suggests that an arrangement might be made with the railway whereby their pump could be used to pump water from the river through a pipe line to supply the school, thus assuring an adequate supply at all times.\n\nIf the drought continues as at present, it will not be possible to open the school at the usual time owing to lack of water. I would recommend that a survey of the situation be made immediately by a member of the Water Branch in Calgary who could give the best solution of the problem.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 27th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 17th instant, the Department is requesting the Dominion Water Power Branch of the Department of the Interior to have their engineer at Calgary proceed to Morley at the earliest possible date and report regarding the water supply system at the residential school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

Staley, Indian Residential School, Morley, Alberta.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nRobin Hood Mills, Limited,\nCalgary, Alta.\nReport\non\nWater Situation at Indian Residential School\nMorley, Alberta.\n\n1. Purpose of Report.\n\nA letter dated July 28, 1936, Ottawa file 41167-W, was received from the Director requesting that an investigation be made of the domestic water situation at the above-named school and that an estimate be made of the cost of rehabilitating the water supply plant.\n\nThis office was afterwards informed by the Inspector of Indian Agencies that an amount of $75 had been appropriated for repairing the well machinery and cleaning out the well. It was intimated that Mr. R.W. Snyder of Lepper & Co., Plumbers, was to visit the school and make repairs. Consequently, the writer proceeded to Morley on August 4 to survey the situation alone. The main visit was made on August 10 with Mr. Snyder when temporary rehabilitation was made.\n\n2. Causes of the trouble.\n\nThe working head had to be disassembled and the pipes, cylinder and sand point removed. The cause of trouble was at first very obscure. Decisions had to be made on the spot as to possible remedies. It was decided to install a 3\" cylinder. The leather washers were partially worn and leaked badly. The sand point screen holes were partially filled with oil. The six-inch conical point of the sand point had been driven into the shale. None of these difficulties, however, explained the total inability of the pump to raise practically any water, even when working 24 hours per day. It might be mentioned that on August 4 the writer caused the pump to be activated for four hours. As far as could be noted very little water was delivered to the tank, although the pump head leaked water to the floor at every stroke. The principal stated that it would be absolutely impossible to open the school until the water supply was assured. This decision was concurred in fully by the writer. The pump had been activated for 24 hours per day in order to obtain a very limited amount of water for limited purposes.\n\nHowever, after a full examination of the equipment (the 2\u00bd\" cylinder was scored) the well was bailed out. It was found that during the last few years 10 gallons of oil had entered the pipe from the working head. Seven feet of pipe is under water level and probably only a foot or so of the sand point was in water. Although this seemed to be the primary cause of lack of supply, it was considered advisable to leave the 3\" cylinder in the well. The question of general inability of the plant to supply sufficient water will be dealt with at a later point in this report. The actual water supply appears to be unlimited.\n3. Temporary Removal of Cause of Trouble.\n\nAs mentioned above a new 3\" cylinder was installed under the 2\u00bd\" pipe. The sand point was removed as it was considered that there is no sand present now to interfere with the working of the pump. The oil was entirely removed from the pipe. The working head was replaced, together with the pipe and valves, and the whole reconnected with the pressure tank.\n\nThe pump was started, and in three hours the tank was pumped from a state of emptiness to full capacity (55 pounds pressure). The total amount pumped in amounted to about 900 gallons, or about 300 gallons per hour.\n\n4. Ultimate Necessary Activities.\n\n(a) Present Physical conditions\n\nAlthough the pump was working well after repair, it does not follow that the difficulties are overcome. This plant (working head and drop portion) was repaired during the winter. Frequent repairs have been and will be necessary. The fact is that the plant is entirely inadequate to provide the requirements of the present capacity of the school. Too much stress cannot be put on this statement. The \u00be h.p. motor is undoubtedly doing more work than it should do. The working head is entirely too small to provide sufficient water. It will surely again break down due to overwork. Although it may last a short while in its present condition, the whole plant should be renovated, as breakdowns may occur at crucial times, such as fire, when the school is full. This well is the only water supply available.\n\n(b) Requirements of the School.\n\nThe population of the school, and Principal's house, together amount to about 100 people. A laundry, which is in use every day, has been added lately, together with a 40% or 50% addition to the main building. At a modest requirement of 30 gallons per capita per day the school should use at least 3000 gallons per day for domestic purposes, with some addition for lawn watering etc. A fair total estimate of total requirements would be 3500 gallons. Even this amount is less than that estimated for certain other schools of similar population, there being no stock to water.\n\n(c) Present Plant.\n\nThe present plant consists of a Fairbanks-Morse enclosed working-head about 18\" by 12\" activated by a \u00be h.p. motor, installed 5 or 6 years ago. This working-head, No.9, is not manufactured now. The rated capacity is 275 gallons per hour, although it was apparently increased to 300 gallons by the 3\" cylinder on August 10.\nAt least 12 hours continuous pumping is required at present for a day's supply. This is too long. The time occupied should not be for more than 4 or 5 hours. The present rate is 50 strokes per minute.\n\nThe pressure tank is 16' by 4' horizontal type. At full capacity (34\u00bd inches at 57 pound pressure) it holds about 950 gallons. Thus it needs to be filled four times per day to provide for requirements.\n\nIt seems evident that another tank should be provided. The lean-to building, with 3' of concrete basement and 5' of frame, is 20' by 11\u00bd' inside measurement with the tank at one side and the pump near the centre. It would be necessary to extend the building westward about 8' for installation of a second tank. The concrete wall, 3' high, could be left intact except for a door. The roof would be extended at a flatter angle than at present.\n\n(d) Water Supply for Principal's House.\n\nThe house occupied by Rev. Mr. Staley, Principal, is about 600 feet from the school. The water supply for the house is provided by means of barrels filled at the school and carried by team to the house. This is obviously a laborious method. A pipe could be laid from the school to the house and proper plumbing facilities installed. An alternative plan would be the sinking of a well at the house and installation of a pumping system.\n\nA rough estimate of cost of taking water by pipeline to house, including cost of pipe, would be $600 exclusive of plumbing. This is considered to be expensive. The most economical method is to excavate a well (drillers dislike drilling in gravel) within three or four feet of the house basement. A small extension 6' square could be constructed from the basement, directly connected with it, and the machinery installed therein. The soil consists of coarse gravel for over 20 feet depth.\n\n5. Estimate of Cost of Plant Extension.\n\n| Item                                                                 | Cost   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 1 Pressure Tank 5/16 inch shell, 2\" openings, 1250 gallons, 3000 pounds with pipe, valves etc., | 550.00 |\n| 1 working-head and motor, capacity 800 gallons per hour             | 350.00 |\n| Extension of housing building from 21' by 11' to 21' by 18'          | 300.00 |\n| Provision for water supply at house by well                         |        |\n| (a) well machinery                                                  | 300.00 |\n| (b) excavation of 4' square well                                     | 100.00 |\n| (c) housing                                                         | 100.00 |\n\nTotal: $1,700.00\nThe water system of the school has gradually been repaired because of inadequacy of the water supply plant as the school was enlarged, until the limit is passed. Consequently provision should be made for a real extension as described above.\n\n6. The Pumping Plant at the Agent's House.\n\nDr. Murray can obtain only a small amount of water at each pumping. Apparently the syphon at the well leaks as he can only lower the well to the outlet pipe. This pipe is upright from near the bottom of the well for 2 feet. It then bends westward and horizontally to flow downhill to the house. This, again, needs repair, as only a few gallons can be pumped at a time.\n\n7. R.C.M. Police Barracks.\n\nThe writer's attention was called by the Agent, Dr. Murray, to the condition of the well at the bungalow which serves as residence and barracks for the Mounted Police.\n\nThis well, 4' square, is excavated underneath the kitchen basement. It is concreted for 10 feet. The base of the concrete rests on shale. The portion of shale immediately below the concrete wall was left intact, but that within and below the concrete wall was excavated in the form of a seepage cavity in the shape of a bowl with a capacity of 20 or 25 gallons.\n\nA good pumping plant is installed over the well on the basement floor. The water appears and disappears, apparently being influenced by the height of the Bow river, although not likely. An expenditure of $50 would increase the capacity of the cavity to a sufficient amount to provide water supply for the household. It could be deepened from a maximum depth of less than 2\u00bd' in the bowl, to say 4' by 4', i.e., a square cavity. The concrete walls could be extended downward by an orthodox method.\n\n8. Recommendations.\n\n(a) Provision in the 1937 estimates for a complete renovation of the Water Supply at the School ........................................... $1200.00\n\n(b) A well or a pipe line at the Principal's house including well machinery and extension to basement but excluding plumbing fixtures .................. 500.00\n\n15% for contingencies .................................. 255.00\n\nTotal for (a) and (b) & contingencies ............... $1955.00\n(c) Further excavation of well at Police residence and barracks .................................. $50.00\n\nThe last estimate is not to be included in the Indian Department estimates.\n\n9. Plans.\n\nA sketch plan of the layout of buildings accompanies this report under separate cover. In addition, comparative levels were also obtained, and are shown in the form of an elevation on the plan.

Principal of the school advised me these have been returned to him, but is anxious to know if he could get authority to have the repairs as were mentioned on the certificates, attended to before the severe weather sets in. These were as follows:\n\nWater column to be raised to comply with regulations. \u00bd\" drain valve fitted in bottom of water column. Requires good blow down.\n\nIt is hard to arrive at what this may cost, but outside of bringing a man from Calgary to perform the work, I would think the expenditure would be small. I would recommend that Mr. R. W.

(The material 1-3/8 material)\n\nMr. Staley explains that it is very hard to heat the sun porch during the extreme weather due to the fact it was not supplied originally with storm sash, and they find it necessary to remove their plants etc from the room very often on account of the cold.\n\nI shall be pleased to be advised regarding this.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, November 12th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 6th instant, you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of ten (10) storm sash for the sun porch at the Morley Indian Residential School.

The authority for the work, was Department letter, 119-1-5, Oct 27th, 1936.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:-\n\nI have been requested by Rev. Mr. Staley, Principal at the Indian Residential School here, to get your authority to proceed with the repairs etc., as set out on Page 9, estimates, the fiscal year, 1937-38.\n\nRepairs to plumbing, including boilers, and toilets. It is practically impossible to arrive at a probable amount regarding this, but every care would be taken in order that only necessary work be done. This work is covered by the amount asked for to look after the lumber repairs etc., as previously set out in the copy of Mr. Staley's letter, enclosed with my letter of the 11th ultimo.\n\nRoot Cellar:- Approximate size, 20' x 30', inside measure, and 10' high. The walls to be of concrete, and double; double roof and single floor. In this connection, Mr. Staley mentioned the root cellar at the United Church School, Edmonton Agency, excepting of course, the proposed cellar for his school is much smaller. The usual bins would be necessary. It is possible you may have suitable prints on hand for this.\n\nPumping Unit:- I believe this matter was fully taken up by Mr. Christianson, approximately last July, when temporary repairs was then authorized to the existing pumping unit. However, to insure a satisfactory water service, a new unit will be necessary; the one as at present is too small, and in a condition to expect continual expert servicing. I am enclosing herewith copy of a letter from Snyder & Co., regarding the proposed new pumping unit, which may be of use to you.\n\nI omitted to mention, that the present root cellar is in such a condition that everything in it froze solid, last winter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMemorandum: Mr. Wardle.\n\nThe following materials are required in connection with painting, decorating and repair work at the Indian Residential School at Morley, Alberta.\n\n500 feet rough lumber 1 x 6 inches for repairing barns.\n\n500 feet flooring 1 x 2\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) inches, edge grained fir, for repairing floors.\n\n6 gallons flat white paint, first quality, for top walls and ceilings of dormitories.\n\n4 gallons cream flat paint, first quality, for walls, etc.\n\n3 gallons cream enamel, first quality, for lower walls and sun porches.\n\n2 gallons of blue enamel, first quality, for lower portion of children's dining room, etc.\n\n4 gallons of cheap green paint for use in basements.\n\n5 gallons of clear varnish, No 1, quality, for woodwork and floors.\n\nWill you kindly arrange for the purchase of the above materials, which should be shipped addressed to,\n\nW.

Total $119.02.\n\nI beg to repeat that the pumping system is now toggled up in such a way that for the least minor repairs it will be necessary to get a man from Calgary to take the pump out of the well. It is also necessary to make the change before the children return for the fall term.\n\nThe root cellar at the school is entirely useless as the contents freeze up every winter. Mr. Staley requests that the Department furnish a plan for construction if the authority is granted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 26th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Dr. W. Barr Murray, Indian Agent, Morley, with reference to the construction of a root cellar at the Morley Indian Residential School. He states that the approximate size of this building should be 20' x 30' x 10' - the walls to be of concrete, with double roof and single floor. He estimates the cost at $500.\n\nIf you approve the erection of this building, please let me know the approximate amount required for material. Will the school staff do the work, or will it be necessary to employ outside labour? If so, you should advise what tradesmen will be necessary in order that I can advise you regarding who is to be employed.\n\nDr. Murray also states that a new pumping unit should be supplied and forwarded the enclosed copy of letter received from Snyder & Company, Calgary, Alta. Please obtain from this firm a quotation for this pumping unit.\n\nIn connection with the above, it might be advisable for you to discuss these improvements with Inspector Christianson, who inspected the school last year. I would refer you to Mr. Christianson's letter of July 14th, 1936, and official reply of July 20th.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nC. P.

It is my hope that arrangements will be made to proceed with the repairs at the Morley Residential School at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Heey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nEnc.\n\nDr. W. Barr Murray,\nIndian Agent,\nMorley, Alta.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, August 25, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Schmidt:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Indian Agent Dr. W. B. Murray, in which he refers to certain improvements at the Morley Indian Residential School, which, in his judgment, should be undertaken immediately.\n\nMay I refer to departmental letter dated July 28, 1937, in which you were asked to consider certain repairs and improvements at Morley and in which you were requested to obtain a quotation from Snyder and Company, of Calgary, for a new pumping unit at the school.\n\nI am anxious to have your report and recommendations at your earliest possible convenience. It seems to me that, if the members of the staff are prepared to undertake the work, the construction of the root cellar might proceed at once. Anything you can do to expedite this work would be deeply appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nC. P. Schmidt, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nCalgary, Alta.\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your No. 119-15 of the 25th ultimo re root house and new pumping unit at the Morley Indian Residential School, I discussed the matter with Mr. M. Christienson when he was here, and I had decided to go into the matter fully with him and Mr. E. J. Staley, the principal, when we visited the reserve on the 13th ultimo, but did not do so as Mr. Staley was away on vacation at the time of our visit. Since the above date I have been away with Mr. Christienson visiting agencies, and I also made a trip to Lesser Slave Lake Agency while in the North, returning home last Sunday evening. Hence the reason for the matter not being attended to sooner.\n\nOn Monday last I phoned Dr. W. B. Murray, the Agent, suggesting that Rev. Staley begin the work of cleaning the old root cellar pit, which I understand is to be used again for the new root house. I later phoned Mr. Staley, asking him to prepare a list of material required, telling him I intended going to Morley to discuss the matter with him. This afternoon he called at this office with Mr. W. T. Scott, of Calgary, whom he wishes to engage to supervise the work. Mr. Scott had with him a plan of a timber (not concrete) root house, 20' x 30' x 10', the cost of which would be approximately $600.00 -- $525.00 for material and $75.00 for labour.\n\nI pointed out that the figure submitted to the Department was $500.00 only, and was informed that when this amount was placed in the Estimates last summer, no list of material, cost of same, or cost of labour, had been prepared; that the figure given was approximate, or in other words a \"guess.\"\n\nAs regards the purchase of material, Mr. Staley says there are two sawmills in the vicinity,--one on the reserve, operated by a Mr. Darnelle, the other some six miles from the School, the owner's name he did not remember.--He tells me the price of materials at these mills is much lower than at the lumber yards in Calgary.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nMr. Staley now asks that authority be given him to expend $500.00 to build a root house, and that he be authorized to engage Mr. W. T. Scott to supervise the work, other labour to be done by the school staff. He will submit certified vouchers for material purchased; also for Mr. Scott's wages.\n\nI recommend that the request be granted and would ask that I be advised by telegram so that the work may be started at once, as the weather is uncertain in the Morley district.\n\nRe new pumping unit for the school: I have been trying to contact Mr. R. W. Snyder of Calgary, but have been unable to do so yet, as he has been out of the city for some time. On Monday I called at his home and was told he was expected home on Sunday next. I asked that he call on my early next week, when I will discuss the matter with him, and ask him to give me a quotation, which I will forward to the Department immediately.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. Fant. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nOttawa, September 11, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the third instant, I wish to confirm the following night letter sent you today:\n\n\"Department approves expenditure not exceeding six hundred dollars for root house, Morley Residential School. Consult P. L. Hyde, Calgary, regarding firms from whom materials to be purchased and also regarding persons to be employed. Also consult Mr. Hyde with reference obtaining quotations for new pumping unit.\"\n\nIf Mr. W. T. Scott is approved by Mr. P. L. Hyde, he may be engaged. Otherwise, you should employ the man recommended by Mr. Hyde.\n\nIn connection with the last paragraph of your letter, it is noted that you have been endeavouring to obtain a quotation from R. W. Snyder with reference to the new pumping unit required at the Morley School.

They are made in three sizes with 6-9 and 12\" stroke, and being self-oiling throughout require no attention.\n\nThey are ideal equipment for Farms\u2014Creameries\u2014Golf Clubs\u2014Hotels\u2014Summer Resorts\u2014Factories and Mines, and in fact any place where the water in the well is beyond the reach of surface pump, or, in other words, below 24 feet.\n\nThe workmanship and material which enter into their construction is vastly superior to what is considered good enough for a pump, and this ensures quiet, untroubled service.\n\nThey are made in several styles for above-ground discharge and with frost-proof set length for underground discharge\u2014with tight and loose pulleys\u2014with single pulley and gravity belt tightener or with V-Belt drive from motor or gas engine mounted on adjustable rail base on the main frame of the pump as illustrated. Fig. 497-6\" Stroke head with either above-ground or underground discharge can also be furnished with hand attachment as illustrated on next page.\n\nLetter A after the figure number of the head signifies above-ground discharge.\n\nLetter B after the figure number of the head signifies underground discharge with frost-proof set length.\nMcDougall Self-Oiling Deep-Well Working Heads 6-9 and 12\" Stroke\n\nThe total head against which a pump is operating is figured by adding the distance in feet from the position of the pump head to the lowest water level in the well, to the tank pressure which can be reduced from pounds pressure to feet head by multiplying the maximum pounds pressure in the tank by 2.3. Any vertical height from the pump head to the tank should also be added. Horizontal suction and discharge lines within reason do not add materially to the head.\n\nA complete deep well Hydro pneumatic or pressure system includes the following\u2014\n\nDeep well working head for above-ground or underground discharge\u2014motor\u2014belt\u2014automatic pressure controller\u2014tank\u2014gauge glass and mountings\u2014pressure pipe\u2014check valve\u2014drain cock for tank\u2014discharge pipe between pump head and tank\u2014gate valve\u2014horizontal check valve\u2014union\u2014tee for controller\u2014tee for relief valve\u2014necessary nipples and elbows\u2014suction pipe\u2014pump rod\u2014cylinder\u2014foot valve and strainer.\n\nThe cylinder is a very important part of any deep-well outfit, and only the best brass body and lined cylinders are recommended for this purpose. McDougall cylinders have a reputation for giving real service on all depths of wells, and can be supplied in all sizes and lengths as listed in our catalogue and price list.\n\nIn selecting the proper deep-well pumping equipment for any installation, a number of necessary points must be considered\u2014i.e., the amount of water required per hour or day\u2014the depth of the well\u2014the inside diameter of the casing if a drilled well\u2014power available, whether electric motor or steam\u2014consider the distance from the surface of the ground to the lowest water level, and whether pressure or gravity tank system is desired.\n\n| Number Strokes Per Minute | Size of Cylinder | Depth of Well to Lowest Water Level | Capacity in Gallons per Hour | Horse-Power Required (Electric Motor) |\n|---------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| 40                        | 2\"              | 50'                               | 200                         | \u00bd H.-P.                              |\n| 40                        | 2\u00bd\"             | 50'                               | 300                         | \u00bd H.-P.                              |\n| 40                        | 3\"              | 50'                               | 440                         | \u00be H.-P.                              |\n| 40                        | 3\"              | 60'                               | 660                         | 1\u00bd H.-P.                             |\n\nOne idea of the capacity that can be secured with different working heads on wells of lower that will be required for the operation of the outfit.\nSir:\n\nReference your telegram and letter No. 119-1-5 of the 11th instant, authorizing the expenditure of $600.00 for a root house for the Morley Residential School and instructing me to consult with Mr. P.

For instance, Bill Anderson quotes on a pump with a 6\" stroke; Snyder & Company quote on one with a 9\" stroke, and Sam Roberts quotes on a pump with a 12\" stroke.\n\nUnder these circumstances it is not possible to decide to whom the business should be allowed, as we do not know the exact type of pump required at the Morley School.\n\nNo doubt you have this information and, if so, you should secure prices from each of the firms on the type of pump that is required to do the work at the Morley school. When you have these quotations, you can award the business to the firm quoting the lowest price.\n\nThe four quotations which you forwarded are returned with this letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

The shed would be used then for shelter for the milk cows, and would serve a further purpose of providing the necessary accommodation at nights for the range cattle which we are compelled to feed during the winter.

Barr Murray\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nMorley, Alta., March 3, 1938.\n\nSir:-\n\nSubsequent to your letter No.119-1-5, Feb.9, I consulted Mr. Staley in regard to the school refrigerator, and am in receipt of a letter from him that the present machine is large enough for now and all times. He states that it not necessary to carry large stocks of perishable goods as he can get such supplies several times a week. He states that all he needs is a box large enough to hold a quarter of beef, milk and kitchen left-overs.\n\nFor the above reasons, he and I are in accord that a built-in refrigerator is not necessary, nor would it be any added convenience. All that is required to give the necessary refrigeration is a new freezing unit installed in the present box, for which the estimate was $300 less $45 for turn-in of the present unit.\n\nI may not have made it clear in previous letters that it is only a freezing unit which was quoted on, not a complete refrigerator.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant with reference to the refrigerator requested by the Principal of the Morley Residential School. In your letter of January 31 you forwarded a quotation from the Electrical Contracting and Machinery Company. They state in their quotation that they are quoting on a new General Electric refrigeration system. I would appreciate if you would let me have the General Electric catalogue number of this equipment in order that complete information may be supplied to our Purchasing Agent.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

B.

I remarked that this was not a proper thing to do and asked him if he had mentioned this in his reports on the school, which we read and found that under the heading \"Fire Drill, escapes and protection,\" with the exception of his report for January last, when he stated, \"Fire escapes locked,\" his other reports simply stated: \"In good order,\" or, \"in good working order.\"\n\nI asked Dr. Murray to ascertain whether these doors were kept locked and am now in receipt of a letter from him, copy of which I enclose herewith.\n\nI will mention this matter to Rev. Mr. Staley, the Principal, when next I meet him or call at the School.\n\nI should be pleased to know what the Department's wishes are in the matter, which was brought to their attention some three years ago: (Reference Inspector Christianson's No. 409-11A under date of March 18, 1935).\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.

The buildings while of no great value were useful as winter shelter for the cattle. The fire which was discovered about two o'clock by men having on the place burned fiercely and was soon out of control. We were fortunate enough to save large stacks of rye 160 yds. away although there is still some danger and will be for some considerable time because the fire is still burning in large manure piles.

He quoted a price of $25 to correct the situation, and I have ordered the work done as emergent. The price previously quoted by Anderson of Calgary for the same job was $45. I trust you will approve my action.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nMr. C. P. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alta.\nCalgary, Sept. 24th, 1938.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith copy of a letter received from Dr. W. H. Murray, Indian Agent, Morley:\n\nThe new pump mentioned was installed last October: (Reference Dept. letter No. 119-1-5 of Oct. 7, 1937 and my No. 409-11A. of the 26th idem).\n\nWhen Mr. Anderson installed the pump, his agreement was to install a new pump, lower pipe, and new cylinder. In other words, everything new from the pump-head downward. It is now found that the discharge pipe, from the pump-head to the pressure tank, is of a smaller size. Therefore the water is forced into the pressure tank, and this causes vibrations and considerable noise, and is also detrimental to the pump gears, &c.\n\nBy changing the outlet or discharge pipe for a larger one, the extra pressure, vibrations and noise will, we are told, be eliminated. This is what Doctor Murray has ordered done. I trust his action will be approved and the voucher paid when submitted to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. Pant. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa,\nOctober 7, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo enclosing copy of letter received from Indian Agent Murray in connection with the pump at the Morley Indian Residential School.\n\nAn amount of $25.00 will be allowed for the repairs to this pump authorized by Indian Agent Murray.\n\nHowever, in view of the information contained in the third paragraph of your letter it is considered that you should endeavour to obtain a refund of this amount from Mr. Anderson. Apparently in installing the pump he did not comply with the terms of his agreement with you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nC. P.

In the amount of $30.02 as you will see if you check the items on invoice just about every tap was leaking at the school as we used 36 washers in leaky taps alone, you will also notice it was necessary for us to install two new ball cocks in the toilet tanks, as they were completely worn out, with result the water was running straight thru them.\n\nThere was also a wash basin almost off the wall that had to be replaced and properly installed, flush balls in 2 instances were leaking badly and with conditions such as described it just meant that water pump was going full blast all the time in order to keep up with the wastage.\n\nReferring to invoice #6, in the amount of $11.55 for cleaning boiler at the Hospital, this was necessary due to the fact that the oil burner had not been functioning proper for some time with the result that a great deal of carbon, was deposited all thru the boiler and it certainly is only good business at any time to thoroughly clean out the boiler in the fall preparatory for winter's use, more especially in the case of a Hospital where very serious results could happen in the event of a boiler failure during the cold weather.\n\nWe trust the above explanation will clear up any question of why this expense was necessary in all cases, and we will look forward to receiving the departments, check at their earliest opportunity as I can assure you we have got some heavy commitments to make, and payment, of account would be very much appreciated at this time.\n\nThanking you we remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.J.

Barr, Murray,\nIndian Reservation,\nMorley, Alberta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFurther to our conversation, over the telephone re invoices rendered as of Aug. 31st. 1938, for repairs to Plumbing and Heating boiler etc.\n\nTaking the invoices in rotation viz To Cleaning and Flushing out boilers total cost. $33.80.\n\nInvoice #2.\nIf you will recall this was the original job that we were called on to do, and it certainly proved very necessary, as we found the boiler very dirty indeed and if same had not been attended to at the time there is a grave doubt in the writers mind whether you would have got thru the winter without a breakdown, it was whilst we were cleaning and inspecting the boiler in question that we found it was absolutely necessary in the interest of safety alone to replace the defective return lines of the heating plant to the boiler as in some instances the nipples were eaten clear thru with rust, and if they had not been replaced when they were, the certainly would have emptied the boiler where either an explosion or a burnt out boiler would have been the result. This repair covered invoice #4.\n\nInvoice #3.\nCovers the renewing of circulating pipes from new pump that was installed last year. This was was necessary for this reason. There is a 2\" discharge from pump to tank, but when pump was installed for some unknown reason the 2\" discharge was bushed down to 1 1/4\", with this result pump was gradually pounding itself to pieces, and it would only be a matter of time before it would have been a wreck and would have to be replaced and we consider that this expense of $30.61\nStony Agency.\n\nMorley, Alberta. December 9th/30.\n\nSir:-\n\nI duly received your letter of November 26th, File No. 409-11A, & immediately got in touch with Messrs. Shrubshall & Coy asking them to furnish me with a report on the work done by them at the school & the reason for it's being done.\n\nI have now received a report from Mr. Shrubshall setting forth the reasons for the work being done, copy of which report is submitted herewith.\n\nI might say that the contents of your letter of August 16th were conveyed to Mr. Staley, the principal of the school & he retained the services of Mr. Shrubshall to do the work & having him on the ground, had him do the other work.\n\nIn doing this Mr. Staley had in mind the lateness of the date & the immediate prospect of the children being back in residence & the absolute necessity of having the work done immediately. The necessity of having the work done during the holiday season had been outlined in correspondence in the Spring & the request that it be done was based on an inspection of the equipment by plumbing & heating experts. Mr. Staley considered that by having it done while the men were on the ground, he was saving the Department a much greater outlay at a not very distant date & without looking over the equipment, one could not judge how very necessary it was that the work be done.\n\nOn the face of it, it looks as though the authority of the Department had been overstepped to a considerable extent, but this was done not solely to buck authority, but with a view to having something done, which was in the best interests of the Department.\n\nI trust that my explanation as above may be accepted.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nC. Paul Schmidt Esq.\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alberta.\nSir:\n\nThe following is a copy of a letter received from the Department:\n\n\"File 119-1-5 Ottawa, Aug. 13, 1938.\n\n\"Dear Sir:\n\n\"With reference to your letter of the 8th instant enclosing amended requests by the Principal of the Morley Residential School, Mr. F.

He is also being requested to purchase the beds, mattresses, linoleum and fire hose.\n\n\"You may authorize an expenditure of $50.00 for checking the boilers and heating plant and $25.00 for labour for repairing the floors.

This also applies to the hiring of labor.\n\nWhen forwarding vouchers for payment quote the file number and date of the Department's letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nC. Fant. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nW. B. Murray, Esq., M. D.\nIndian Agent,\nMORLEY, Alta.\nSir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter No. 119-1-5 dated the 23rd ultimo, re exceeding the amount of $50.00 authorized for checking the boiler and heating plant at the Morley Indian Residential School.\n\nYour letter was received here during my absence on a visit to the Lesser Slave Lake Agency, and Miss P. Blanchfield immediately wrote Dr. W. B. Murray, Indian Agent, asking him for an explanation. I am attaching hereto copy of his reply, with enclosure.\n\nDoctor Murray called at this office yesterday, when I discussed the matter with him.\n\nThe only reason he gave for exceeding the amount allowed, was that Mr. Shrubsall had found that the repairs were urgently needed and Rev. Mr. Staley, the principal, was most anxious to have them done before school re-opened. I made it known to him that this reply was not satisfactory, and referred him to Requisition, Form 37\u00bd, dated August 8th, last, which he and the Rev. E. H. Staley prepared in this office; (Reference my No. 409-11A of the same date, addressed to the Secretary); also, to my letter No. 409-11A dated August 16th, addressed to himself, a copy of which I am attaching hereto. His reply was, \"Never again!\"\n\nI have no excuse to offer for him: He has been in the service a long time, and should be familiar with Departmental rules and regulations, and I think he deserves a strong reprimand and warning. He should at least have written explaining the matter, when submitting the voucher.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nAfter reading Mr. A. J. Shrubsall's report, I am satisfied, and I believe you will agree, that the repairs were very necessary.\n\nI am therefore returning the voucher herewith, and would ask that it be paid. The firm who performed the work state in the last paragraph of their letter that they have some heavy commitments to make.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. Pant.

Shrubsall & Co., for checking over the heating plant at the Morley School.\n\nI also note on file a letter, signed by Mr. Hoey, under date of August 13th last, directed to Mr. Schmidt, Inspector at Calgary, authorizing the sum of $50.00 for this work, which authority was passed to you, this being the amount asked for in your requisition.\n\nIf the expenditure had been $4.00 or $5.00 over the amount authorized nothing would have been said but when the amount is over expended by $71.95, it looks as if no care or supervision was given to this work. Had you talked the matter over with Mr. Shrubsell he would have been able to advise you immediately that the $50.00 was not sufficient and you would have had ample time to write the department explaining the circumstances and requesting a further authorization. Even if the amount is comparatively small it is a serious matter to over expend more than was authorized and, in my opinion, shows lack of interest on your part in not checking up on the work while it was being performed.\n\nWhen you forwarded the voucher you made no mention of the extra money spent. A full explanation is required immediately regarding this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeneral Superintendent of Agencies.\n\nW. Barr Murray, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nMorley, Alberta.\nOttawa,\nDecember 27, 1936.\n\nEX'D.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. BAILEY\n\nI attach voucher covering the cost of emergency repairs made at different times to the boilers at the Morley Indian residential school.\n\nI should appreciate your issuing purchase order so that the account may be paid.\n\nR. A. JOEY,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 119-1-5, Dec. 22, re over-expenditure on repairs to the heating plant at the school.\n\nA full explanation has been forwarded through the Inspector's office, accompanied by a letter from the plumber giving a technical explanation to show the urgency of the work. I expect these have reached the Department by this time.\n\nMr. Shrubsall came out and cleaned the boilers which was the job that I knew had to be done. He then looked over the whole plant and showed me valves, nipples, etc., which were worn out and in urgent need of replacing. On looking at the new well pump, he showed me that it would soon be ruined unless the outlet pipe were enlarged. There is no one in the community who knows anything about heating systems and I had to follow my judgment based on the technical information he had given me. He states in his letter that major breakdowns might have occurred if these repairs had not been effected. If that had occurred after my having been warned by a heating expert, I likely would be held responsible. The children were due to come into school thereby increasing the work of heating system and plumbing, not leaving sufficient time to communicate with the Department, so I ordered the work performed; the sole purpose being to prevent a greater expense.\n\nThis information should have gone with the voucher but it inadvertently got into the mail before an explanatory letter was written.\n\nI further beg to state that care and supervision were exercised by both Mr. Staley and myself and there was no lack of interest or of checking on my part while the work was proceeding. I trust that Mr. Shrubsall's letter will show the urgent nature of the work, and that its being performed was to the best interests of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary.\nMORLEY ALTA 3\nSECRETARY INDIAN AFFAIRS 317\nDEPT MINES AND RESOURCES OTTAWA\n\nPIPE ON BOILER SCHOOL HEATING PLANT REPAIRED LAST FALL AGAIN\nLEAKING WOULD SUGGEST HEATING EXPERT LOOK IT OVER TO SEE IF PRESENT\nSET UP WRONG PLEASE INSTRUCT BY WIRE\n\nW BARR MURRAY..\nCONFIRMATION\n\nOttawa January 4 1929\n\nC P SCHMIDT\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nCALGARY Alberta\n\nAGENT MURRAY REPORTS BOILER PIPE MORLEY SCHOOL AGAIN LEAKING ALTHOUGH REPAIRED LAST FALL -stop- PLEASE TAKE NECESSARY ACTION TO EFFECT REPAIRS AT LOWEST POSSIBLE COST -stop- SUGGEST YOUR ENGAGING A DIFFERENT FIRM AS FORMER FIRM'S WORK MUST HAVE BEEN UNSATISFACTORY\n\nPhoned by R A Hoey\n\nINDIAN AFFAIRS\nOttawa,\nJanuary 5, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nA cheque has been issued in favour of A. J. Shrubsall & Co. for $121.93 as requested by your voucher No. 99.\n\nThis voucher included the firm's account of August 31 for $30.02. There is an item on this account of $2.88 for 36 tap washers, and also an item of $15.65 for labour. Apparently a considerable amount of the labour was due to placing washers on certain taps. This is very simple work and there does not appear to be any reason why it should be necessary to engage a plumber to do it. Washers for both hot and cold water taps can be purchased very cheaply. Please let me know why some member of the school staff did not place them on the taps.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nW. Barr Murray, Esq., M.

Your letter is most unsatisfactory.\n\nWe are not questioning the necessity of the work at all. I would refer you to my letter, 119-1-5, of December 22nd and you will note that you have not explained the contents of the third paragraph therein. What I want to know is why you did not take the matter up with the Department immediately, instead of going ahead with the work, not letting the Department know anything about it until the vouchers were submitted.\n\nI would like to impress upon you that your action in this matter is viewed most seriously.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nGeneral Superintendent\nof Agencies.\n\nDr. W.

A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nSir:\u2014\n\nConfirming my recent telegram re heating plant at the school, I beg to report that a large pipe which enters the boiler, evidently a water return is again leaking.\n\nA new valve was put in this pipe last fall, which stopped the leak for the time being, but I was informed by Mr. Shrubshall who did the work, that the nature of the equipment required was such that it would cause trouble frequently.\n\nThis has been a source of trouble since the boiler was installed. When heavy firing is necessary there is quite a large knocking noise in this pipe and the leak is greater.\n\nI beg to ask authority to have the system looked over by a heating expert, and would suggest Mr. Alex. Walker or a man he would recommend. The workmen we have had here do plumbing and heating; and they are more plumbers than heaters. I would like a heating specialist to look it over and advise if any change could be made to eliminate the knocking which I believe to be from the same cause as the leaking.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.B.

Schmidt,\nInspector, Indian Affairs,\n507 Public Building,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn checking over Heating System at Morley School, I have found the following defects.\n\n(1) Discharge from pump in to equalizer pipes is tapped into pipe instead of the proper fittings; this causes leaks as there is not thread enough in 3\" pipe to hold same.\n\nThis can be remedied by installing two 3\" x 1\u00bd\" tees; Two 3\" flange unions, four 3\" nipples and necessary 1\u00bd\" nipples on discharge from pump.\n\n(2) On return header at back of boilers, there are no valves, and water does not equalize in boilers as one glass shows as much as 4\" more than the other.\n\nThis can be overcome by putting in two 2\" gate valves on return and twinning boilers with necessary unions and fittings. This connection is necessary as at present one boiler is getting more water than other from condensate pump. This also will provide the use of one boiler and an even water line.\n\n(3) The main feed header valve requires gland packing as they show evidence of leaks.\n\n(4) Check valves on discharge line from pump to boiler to be ground in on seat.\n\n(5) Cleanout plugs in boilers are cast iron, brass plugs should be used as they are easily removed for cleaning purposes and do not rust.\n\n(6) All return traps on system should be checked over for leaks through diaphragms. Strainers and drop pockets also to be checked over.\n\n(7) Condensation pump motor to be examined to see how\nCalgary, January 7th, 1939.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your radiogram of the 4th instant, which reads:\n\n\"AGENT MURRAY REPORTS BOILER PIPE MORLEY SCHOOL AGAIN LEAKING ALTHOUGH REPAIRED LAST FALL STOP PLEASE TAKE NECESSARY ACTION TO EFFECT REPAIRS AT LOWEST POSSIBLE COST STOP SUGGEST YOU ENGAGE A DIFFERENT FIRM AS FORMER FIRM WORK MUST HAVE BEEN UNSATISFACTORY.\"\n\nUpon receipt of same I went to Mr. Chas. Sellens, District Architect, asking him if he would recommend someone to do the work; he recommended Mr. P. Kennedy, of Calgary, with whom I arranged to go to Morley yesterday, the 6th instant, to look over the boilers.\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of Mr. Kennedy's report, which is self-explanatory, and I would recommend that he be authorized to make the changes and repairs mentioned therein, which it is obvious are necessary. These he pointed out and explained to the Agent, Dr. Murray, Rev. Mr. Staley, Principal of the School and myself: I might add that Mr. Kennedy states he made these recommendations when at the school some two years ago, but same were never acted upon.\n\nBeing informed there was no immediate danger, and that unless the weather became very cold and both boilers had to be steamed, there appeared to be sufficient time for me to forward Mr. Kennedy's report to the Department for their consideration and approval before proceeding with the work.

I realize I am at fault for the procedure I followed, and I exceedingly regret acting as I did.\n\nI knew, of course, that my procedure was irregular but I expected the Department would consider I was justified by the urgency of the work and by the saving of an extra trip by the plumber, which would have been added expense. As stated previously, I had intended to send a full explanation with the voucher, but it accidently was mailed before the letter was written.\n\nI can see now that I should have wired to the Department, and confirmed the wire by letter. That I did not do so, I greatly regret; and I ask that you accept my assurance that irregularities will not occur again.\n\nI considered at the time that I was acting in the best interests of the Department, and this opinion was concurred in by Mr. Staley with whom the situation was fully discussed.

I contacted Mr. Kennedy, who went to Morley to look over the pump to see what repairs and material were required.\n\nMr. Kennedy called at this office today and informed me that the cost of the job would be $94.00, for labour and material, including 40 feet of 3-inch pipe, 40 feet of 58 wood pump rod, 3-inch cylinder, material for air cushion, &c. He stated that the pump is at present \"hammering itself to pieces\" and that something should be done at once, but he preferred that I inform the department of the cost before he proceeded with the work. I am sending this letter by air mail, and beg to ask for a reply by radio so that there need be no delay in getting this pump in good working order.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. Pant.

P. Kennedy was called and made the repair.\n\nThe second accident was at the school. A swing check valve between the pump and pressure tank gave way allowing water to run back through the pump and flood the floor.

This requisition is asking for beds, mattresses, and blankets. These are really necessary in order to keep up the equipment.\n\n2. Requisition for 1000 ft. No.1 Edge Grain Flooring. This is really required for patching worn places in the various dormitories and other rooms in the Residential School building. I inspected these floors recently and recommend this expenditure.\n\n3. Requisition for paint and shingle stain. I recommend that this paint be purchased in order to preserve the roofs and interior woodwork.\n\n4. Requisition for materials to build an additional mink house, capable of housing 150 mink. The raising of mink has been very successful and the profits are substantial. The school boys are very enthusiastic with this venture and I recommend this material be furnished.\n\n5. Requisition asking for repairs to plumbing and toilets, and a new toilet bowl, also for the cleaning and blowing out of boilers. A complete check and necessary repairs required for the steam-heating equipment. The boilers should yearly be blown and cleaned out each year. This work has not been done for three years. I recommend this be done as early as possible in order that we may avoid more costly repairs at a later date.\n\n6. Requisition asking for Battleship linoleum to cover school dining-room floor. If funds are available I would like to have this done but the five previous items are more important, and this could probably wait for another year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.M.A. Ireland,\nActing Indian Agent.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nOttawa, July 19, 1940.\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF\n\nMorley Indian Residential School\n\nVOTE 76 Allotment 10 - 691\n\nSHIP TO Rev.

Beds and mattresses requested will be purchased by the Purchasing Branch. The Department does not supply blankets.\n\n2. The paint and shingle stain is also being purchased through the Purchasing Branch.\n\n3. Materials required for repairs and improvements to the mink-house will be purchased by our Purchasing Branch.\n\n4. You may expend an amount of $44.00 in purchasing from a firm on the approved list No. 1 Edge Grain Flooring for repairing the floors.\n\nAn amount of $60.00 may be expended in replacing one closet bowl, making repairs to plumbing and toilet and blowing out boilers. The amount just mentioned includes both material and labour.\n\nYou may expend $20.00 in the purchase of hardware, nails, hinges, and catches in repairing the mink-house.\n\nOwing to lack of funds, the Department is not in a position to consider purchasing the Battleship linoleum at the present time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. J.N.R.

The freight is based upon inclusion in carload lots from our Winnipeg factory to our Calgary selling branch, and reshipment by local freight from Calgary to Morley.\n\nFrom the above you will recognize that we could not possibly have a freight bill from Winnipeg to Morley, and in any event, the freight would be extremely higher if merchandise was shipped L.C.L. from Winnipeg to Morley.\n\nAs your request for quotation called for f.o.b. Morley prices, instead of quoting you a straight price, which we would have done had it been a matter of local freight to be added, we showed in our quotation the prices of the articles, the tax and the freight as three separate items.\n\nWe trust that with this information before you you will be able to pass our invoices for payment.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary-Treasurer\n\nThe prized ingredient of a manufactured product is the integrity of the builder.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPay to\nC.F.

I am sorry the case was such as to need the immediate attention of an electrician and the time could not be spared to meet the request to the department in the usual way.\n\nThe situation revealed much more serious difficulties than we had imagined and involved a large amount of rewiring in the old part of the building. In fact, such was the condition of wiring that we were very lucky to have escaped from much more dangerous situations. Prior to the rebuilding, five years ago, the wiring had carried much too heavy loads and this was the real cause of the recent breakdown.\n\nI can assure you that the prompt relief that we got from a very dangerous situation was greatly appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Residential School\nUnited Church of Canada\nRev.

I was called over to the School on the morning of the 26th December, as they had a breakdown in the power at the School residence. Mr. Staley informed me that Lloyd Orr Electric had done the installation of the electric system. I therefore got this man on the phone and asked him to come out and fix up the trouble, as myself and the School Staff were unable to locate the reason for the breakdown. He therefore came out, and discovered that we had been in serious danger of having a fire, as a lot of the old wiring was completely burnt out, and this job turned out to be more costly than we had expected. However this job should be good for many years to come.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nLetter No.\n\nOffice of the STONY Indian Agency,\n\n6th January 1947\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 216, amounting to $82.91 in favour of Lloyd Orr Electric, Calgary, Alberta, for Emergency Electrical repairs Residential School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Vote: 76-10-691\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa\n\nForm No. I.A. 518\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA\nREV.

Attached herewith are six requisitions prepared by Rev. E.J.Staley, Principal of the Morley Indian Residential School.\n\nRequisition 1. This is for paint, varnish, shingle stain, for Residential School.\n\nRequisition 2. Mr Staley says present septic tank needs alterations and enlarging. As it is, the tank cannot adequately take care of sewage disposal. Estimated cost $250.00.\n\nRequisition 3. I would recommend that the 400 feet of flooring be furnished and at least $100.00 be allowed for plumbing and electrical repairs.\n\nRequisition 4. I am not inclined to recommend this expenditure this year.\n\nRequisition 5. As the crop at the school farm appears to be progressing favourably I would recommend this purchase.\n\nRequisition 6. On this requisition I would ask the 300 feet of Galvanized water pipe be purchased. The purpose of this, to pipe water to the hogs, and other live stock. The Binder and rake should wait to see how the crop looks later on.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.M.R.Iredale\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nC.P.Schmidt Esq.\nInspector Indian Agencies.\nCalgary, Alberta.\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith six requisitions for materials and labour for the Morley Indian Residential School, prepared by Rev. E.J. Staley, the Principal, and forwarded here by Mr. J.N.R. Iredale, the Acting Indian Agent. I am changing the order of preference as follows:\n\n1. Requisition No. 2 is for enlarging the septic tank. This is very, very much needed: The present tank is too small. (Ref. my reports on this School, dated Feb. 2nd and Dec. 2nd, 1939, Pages 7 and 6, respectively). I would ask that this matter be given immediate consideration, and the work completed before the reopening of the School in September, next.\n\n2. Requisition No. 3: I would ask that $150.00 be allowed for plumbing repairs.\n\n3. Requisition No. 5: Both the Binder and Hay Rake will be required this Summer. I recommend that these items be allowed.\n\nRe Requisition No. 1, for paint - both outside and inside:\nRe-painting the outside, and decorating the interior would, of course, brighten things considerably. Owing to War conditions, I am not recommending same. The Department are aware that we have cancelled a certain amount of outside painting of the Agency buildings: (Ref. Dept. No. 21-119 of June 6th, 1941). The Agency and School buildings are only a few rods apart, and both are seen from the main (tourist) highway; if any exterior painting is done, both sets of buildings should be touched up.\n\nRequisition No. 4 is for a shed to be built on what is referred to as the Orphanage Ranch; Viz., lands taken over by the School (Church) for stock growing purposes. (See Dept. No. 119-1-9 dated Dec. 17th, 1935; also No. 119-1-14 dated May 14th, 1937, and Jan. 29th, 1938). The School grow a few acres of green feed and keep their main herd of cattle on this place, both in Summer and Winter. Owing to War conditions, I am not prepared to recommend this, and I am wondering whether the Department should be asked to pay for improvements on this farm.\n\nRequisition No. 6 is for 500 feet of two-inch pipe, to convey water to the hogs: This is, without a doubt, a great labour-saving device; however, I consider the work can be carried on as in the past, and the saving of the cost of the material go towards War services.\n\nRe flooring asked for on Requisition No. 5: This is asked for to renew the flooring in the dormitories. These floors are showing signs of wear, and will have to be renewed before long. If the Department find that they cannot grant the full amount, I would suggest that say half of it be given this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nC. Pant. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nOttawa, July 21, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 14th instant, enclosing requisitions for expenditure in connection with improvements at the Morley Residential School.\n\nIn the current year's appropriation it was found possible to include an amount of $405.00 only, for repairs and improvements and the purchase of new equipment at the Morley School. Under these circumstances, we can only favourably consider allowing Requisition No. 2, enlarging septic tank, at a cost of $250.00, and as regards Requisition No. 3, we can allow $150.00 towards the cost of plumbing repairs.\n\nYour requisition in connection with the septic tank is not exactly clear. It reads as follows:\n\nRe enlarging of septic tank 12 x 12 x 7 $110.00\nMaterial, cement, gravel, sand and fittings\nLabour and alterations to present tank $140.00\n\n$250.00\n\nAm I to infer that the item of $110 is for labour? In regard to the materials costing $140, detailed information must be given in order that purchase may be authorized by our Purchasing Branch. Can the work be done under the supervision of the Principal or the Agent?\n\nWith reference to the amount that will be -\n\nMr. C. P. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alberta.\nbe allowed for plumbing repairs, namely $150.00, explicit information should be given in order that this item may be dealt with by our Purchasing Branch.\n\nIn view of lack of funds, it will not be possible this year to favourably consider the other requisitions forwarded with your letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nFILE 119-45\n\nVOL. 7 CLOSED\n\nFROM 14 - 10 - 38\n\nTO 21 - 7 - 41\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume 6357)\n\nFile 757-5, part 4\nStony - Morley Residential School - McDougall\nOrphanage - Buildings & Accounts. 1935 - 1938\n\nFile 757-5, part 5\nStony - Morley Residential School - McDougall\nOrphanage - Buildings & Accounts. 1938 - 1941\n\nFile 757-5, part 6\nStony - Morley Residential School - McDougall\nOrphanage - Buildings & Accounts. 1941 - 1949\n\nFile 757-9, part 1\nStony - Sarcee Agency, School Lands - McDougall\nOrphanage. 1890 - 1928\n| Date   | Description          | Amount |\n|--------|----------------------|--------|\n| 20/11/40 |                      | \u00a32557   |\n| 21/11/40 |                      | \u00a32215   |\n| 22/11/40 |                      | \u00a31034   |\n| 23/11/40 |                      | \u00a3605    |\n| 24/11/40 |                      | \u00a3114    |\n| 25/11/40 |                      | \u00a319     |\n| 26/11/40 |                      | \u00a3132    |\n| 27/11/40 |                      | \u00a31953   |\n| 28/11/40 |                      | \u00a34.96   |\n| 29/11/40 |                      | \u00a324295  |\n| 30/11/40 |                      | \u00a32024   |\n| 31/11/40 |                      | \u00a310475  |\n| 01/12/40 |                      | \u00a31221   |\n| 02/12/40 |                      | \u00a3261    |\n| 03/12/40 |                      | \u00a32156   |\n| 04/12/40 |                      | \u00a3323    |\n| 05/12/40 |                      | \u00a34586   |\n| 06/12/40 |                      | \u00a3615    |\n\n*New field?*\nSir:\n\nRe your letter, file 409-11A, dated July 26th 1941, regarding the repairs for the septic tank at the Morley Residential School.\n\nAfter receiving your letter, Mr. Staley got Mr. Lepper of the F.H. Lepper Co. of Calgary, to come out and give an estimate on the work required. With the result, Mr. Lepper said the septic tank did not require to be enlarged, and that the whole trouble was caused by the laundry water going directly into the first compartment of the septic tank. As this liquid contained so much soap, lye, and other bleaching compounds etc., it absolutely killed or destroyed bacterial action, which would ordinarily take place in the first compartment of the septic tank, with the result that the tank was always plugging up with solids, and would not syphon into the second and third compartments.\n\nTherefore, the only way to remedy the condition, would be to re-construct the drains from the Laundry and run the drainage direct from the Laundry to the third compartment of the septic tank. This would entail a considerable amount of labour, as they would have to dig a trench about four or five feet deep, and about one hundred feet long. They would also have to take up part of the Laundry floor (concrete) and break through the concrete foundation in order to change the direction of the drains. The Lepper Co. have agreed to do the work and furnish the material required, for the sum of $250.00.\n\nRegarding the other plumbing work required. This is asked for, to install an eight foot double wash sink in the girls wash room. The Lepper Co. have one of these on hand, which they have had for some time, and the cost of the material is $165.00. In view of the fact that they have had to keep this wash sink for years, before they had a call for it, they offer to instal this at the Morley Residential School, Material and Labour, for the sum of $150.00.\n\nThe above offer would appear to me, to be very reasonable, and the work is very necessary, and should be done immediately, if possible before school re-opens. However, I would mention that this Company's name does not appear on the approved list.\n\nFor your consideration, please.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.M.R. Redden\nActing Indian Agent.\nCalgary, August 16th, 1941.\n\nSir:\n\nReference your No. 119-1-5 of the 21st ultimo, in connection with improvements at the Morley Residential School, I beg to advise that I sent a copy of your letter to Mr. J.N.R. Iredale, the Acting Indian Agent, asking him for details as requested therein.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith copy of his reply, together with copy of Mr. Lepper's letter attached thereto.\n\nI trust this is the information required by the Purchasing Branch.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.

E. J. Staley, Principal\n\nMORLEY, ALTA.  \nMarch 24th, 1945.\n\nMr. Iredale,  \nIndian Agent,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe attached invoices from Lepper and Co., are of course a representation of bills originally forwarded last October.\n\nMost of the work involved came about by reason of emergent repairs that had to be affected at the school. Among other things the hot water system broke down completely and it was found that quite apart from repairs being needed to the jacket heater, that certain lines and most of the taps were completely worn out and incapable of being repaired. Accordingly repairs to this phase of our hot water supply were affected. This involved a great deal of the material on invoice including new flume pipes from the jacket heater. While dealing with the hot water system repairs were affected to the toilets through the buildings and in addition several leaky valves on the heating system were either repaired or replaced.\n\nThe appendix shows a crane check valve that had to be secured and fitted in the pipe line leading from the pump to the water storage tank. The old valve was worn out and was allowing the water to leak back into the well.\n\nThe bill as a whole can be certified as correct and came about because after twenty years of use the break down of one portion necessarily resulted in trouble in other directions.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCopy\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Voucher #295 - $224.81\nLepper & Company, Calgary.\n\nThis account is for plumbing work done by the above named firm at the Morley Indian Residential School building during the month of October, 1944.\n\nSometime early in October, 1944 Mr. Staley notified me that he was having some trouble with the hot water system and must have some immediate repairs done.\n\nAs this appeared to be an emergency he said he would have to get a plumber out right away. In this I concurred.\n\nAt that time I was under the impression that it not going to be a very big or expensive job. I was not notified by Mr. Staley that it had become necessary to do so much additional work.\n\nThe first I knew about this invoice was about two months ago when I received an \"Account Rendered\" statement from the plumbing company and upon making enquiries from Mr. Staley he said he had received the invoice last October and had brought it over to the Agency Office, but I am sure that it was never received by this office.\n\nHowever, I got in touch with Lepper & Co. and asked them to re-submit their account and when I received their statement I was considerably surprised at so much work being done without the Agency approval. So much so, that I requested Mr. Staley to write a letter of explanation a copy of which is attached herewith.\n\nI checked over the work and it appears to have been done alright. I notice one item in the account for \"meals $6.60.\" I don't think this item should be allowed.\n\nJ.N.H. Iredale,\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nI-H.\nEnc. Voucher #295\nCC Staley Letter.\nOttawa, April 4, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT.\n\nI attach account amounting to $224.81, covering the cost of material and labour for repairs to the plumbing system at the Morley Indian Residential School. This school is situated in the Stony Indian Agency, province of Alberta, and is owned by the Government. With reference to the account, the Agent writes in part as follows:\n\n\"This account is for plumbing work done by the above named firm at the Morley Indian Residential School building during the month of October, 1944.\n\n\"Some time early in October, 1944, Mr. Staley notified me that he was having some trouble with the hot water system and must have some immediate repairs made.\n\n\"As this appeared to be an emergency, he said he would have to get a plumber out right away. In this I concurred.\n\n\"At that time I was under the impression that it was not going to be a very big or expensive job.

Among other things the hot water system broke down completely and it was found that quite apart from repairs being needed to the jacket heater, that certain lines and most of the taps were completely worn out and incapable of being repaired. Accordingly repairs to this phase of our hot water supply were effected. This involved a great deal of the material on invoice including new flue pipes from the jacket heater. While dealing with the hot water system repairs were effected to the toilets through the buildings and in addition several leaky valves on the heating system were either repaired or replaced.\n\nThe appendix shows a crane check valve that had to be secured and fitted in the pipe line leading from the pump to the water storage tank. The old valve was worn out and was allowing the water to leak back into the well.\n\nThe bill as a whole can be certified as correct and came about because after twenty years of use the breakdown of one portion necessarily resulted in trouble in other directions.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Rev. E. J. Staley)\nOttawa, April 4, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT.\n\nI attach account amounting to $224.81, covering the cost of material and labour for repairs to the plumbing system at the Morley Indian Residential School. This school is situated in the Stony Indian Agency, province of Alberta, and is owned by the Government. With reference to the account, the Agent writes in part as follows:\n\n\"This account is for plumbing work done by the above named firm at the Morley Indian Residential School building during the month of October, 1944.\n\n\"Some time early in October, 1944, Mr. Staley notified me that he was having some trouble with the hot water system and must have some immediate repairs made.\n\n\"As this appeared to be an emergency, he said he would have to get a plumber out right away. In this I concurred.\n\n\"At that time I was under the impression that it was not going to be a very big or expensive job. I was not notified by Mr. Staley that it had become necessary to do so much additional work.\"\n\nI also enclose copy of a letter from the Principal of the Morley School.\n\nWhile it is true that no specific authority was given for this work, the explanation made by the Principal seems reasonable, and as the building is owned\nby the Government, I think it is only fair that we should pay the account.

R.J. Stealey, Principal of the Indian Residential School at Morley has requested that certain new equipment be purchased for the school as under:\n\nOne new Connor washer (commercial size) costing about $800.00. I am informed that the present machine is practically worn out, will not last much longer and cannot be further repaired.\n\nMr. Stealey also requests authority to have the smaller \"Jeyes\" machine repaired at an estimated cost of approximately $80.00.\n\nAlso the laundry stove is completely worn out and it is desired that the school be furnished with a new one.\n\nThe principal also wishes to get a complete new set of fire-box linings for the large kitchen range, (Curney, John Bull) which will cost approximately $25.00.\n\nMr. Stealey also pointed out that he would like to get 10 new institutional beds which will cost approximately $125.00 each, less mattresses, but in this connection he says he could use Air Force double deck cots which he thinks can be purchased for about $8.50 each, less mattresses, which can be purchased from the salvage department at about $2.50 each mattress.\n\nI would ask that immediate consideration be given to these various requests.\n\nActing Indian Agent,\n\nH-200\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, August 6, 1945.\n\nMr. J.N.R. Iredale, Acting Indian Agent,\nMorley, Alberta.\n\nI have your letter of the 3lst ultimo, with reference to new equipment requested by the Principal of the Morley Residential School. The following expenditures are authorized:\n\n1. $80.00 to repair the small \"Maytag\" washer;\n2. $25.00 to purchase firebox linings for the large kitchen range.\n\nWith reference to the new washer which you state is necessary, please let me have the serial number and any other information possible regarding the washer at present in the school. If you know when this washer was supplied, you should also give that information.\n\nRegarding the laundry stove, please state the type and size of stove required and, if possible, quote a catalogue number. Purchase of the washer and the stove will be handled by our Purchasing Branch and they require complete information before they can ask for prices.\n\nRegarding the last paragraph of your letter, in connection with the beds and mattresses, I would appreciate knowing from whom Mr. Staley secured the information that Air Force double deck cots can be secured for about $2.00 each and mattresses for about $.50 each. Our information is to the effect that the purchase of equipment used by the Air Force has to be made through the War Assets Corporation, Montreal, and so far we have not been able to secure any such equipment from them.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nThe Brock Company (Western) Limited\n\nWholesale Dry Goods\nCents Furnishings, House Furnishings\n\nCor.

However, I think that it can be salvaged for use in the boys' manual training shop.\n\nWe should try to obtain a new washer a size larger than the one described above.\n\nRegarding the stove used in the laundry room. This is really a cook stove with a reservoir, less a warming oven. Description is as follows:\n\nMorley \"Triumph\"\nA hole cook stove, with back and reservoir.\n24\" X 30\" height 30\"\nReservoir 24\" X 12\"\nCost about $60.00\n\nThis stove is used to heat two galvanised boilers for boiling clothes, and also for heating sad irons in order to teach the girls how to do washing and ironing in their own homes under similar conditions.\n\nRegarding the last paragraph in your letter Mr. Staley has already purchased used double decked beds, (Airforce) from the Brook Company, Western Limited at $7.50 each. I am enclosing herewith an invoice for seven double decked beds which he purchased in June last, which he holds out of school funds. He says he has also purchased mattresses at $2.50 each but does not know if any more are available at the present time. He also showed me an invoice for another six double decked beds and also showed me the beds which he has not yet set up. These he purchased on August 1st, 1945 and which I understand are being paid for from school or church funds. By using these double decked beds he is creating a little more floor space in the boys' dormitory.\n\n(Over)\nI might add that the double decked beds all bear the manufacturers name, \"Simmons Limited\" and there is no doubt about them being used previously by the armed forces. But they are all in practically new condition.\n\nIt is hoped that the foregoing information will prove sufficient for your requirements.\n\nJ.N.R.

H.J. Staley, principal at the Morley Indian Residential School has brought to my attention the condition of the electric wiring in the school residence building. He has written me requesting that consideration be given to the necessary re-wiring. A copy of Mr. Staley's letter is attached hereto.\n\nRecently I looked over this situation and I find the wiring referred to is quite old and is very brittle. I think it should be thoroughly gone over by an electrician.\n\nAs this work might run into quite a sum of money I thought I should write to you before calling out an electrical firm to give a detailed estimate of the work and materials required.\n\nHowever if you grant me permission I will ask for an estimate and submit it for your approval.\n\nNo action will be taken by me until I receive your reply.\n\nJ.N.R. Iredale,\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nEnc.\nIndian Residential School  \nUnited Church of Canada  \nRev. E.J.Staley,  \nPrincipal.  \n\nMorley, Alta.  \nJan. 1st. 1946\n\nDear Mr. Iredale,\n\nI have become alarmed at the condition of some of the electric wiring at the school and examination of some of it reveals that there is a basis for worry. Many of the rooms are lighted by old fashioned drop cords and these with the sockets have been in use for twenty years with the result that the wiring is very brittle and the insulation in most cases gone. Other wiring leading to some of the machinery should be gone over and I would request that something be done to deal with what could easily turn into a serious situation.\n\nWiring installed at the Mission House at the same time, by the same people, has recently been the cause of a few thousand dollar fire. I would request then that sixty drop cords and sockets be renewed, or better still, that in some places in the school, a new system of lighting altogether be installed. The sewing room, office, dispensary, staff dining room and sitting room should all have modern lighting.\n\nYour attention to the matter would be appreciated although I am not in the position to give you any figure as to cost at the present.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n(Sgd.)

E.J.

Rain is seeping through the roof which is causing the plaster to fall off. This should be repaired during the summer holidays. Mr. Staley estimates the cost at approximately $75.00\n\nKitchen Range. The kitchen range is in need of repairs\n\n- New section for the top\n- New oven door\n- New grate linings\n\nApproximate cost $100.00\n\nPlumbing work. All plumbing should be overhauled, taps, toilets, new rods for pump, boilers cleaned and checked.\n\nEstimated cost $125.00\n\nFurnace - classrooms. The furnace is getting to be in a dangerous condition and should be completely overhauled.\n\nApproximate cost $125.00\n\nIt would appear that all the foregoing requests are very necessary and I therefore ask for your favorable consideration.\n\nJ.M.R. Iredale\nActing Indian Agent.\nOttawa, July 5, 1946.\n\nMr. J.M.R. Iredale, Indian Agent,\nMorley, Alberta.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 28th ultimo, regarding repairs required at the Morley Indian Residential School, the following expenditures are approved:\n\n1.

Lepper & Company - $302.38\n\nPlumbing - Morley Residential School.\n\nThis account covers very necessary and emergent repairs at the Morley Residential School. It was necessary to install a new range boiler in the kitchen of the school and also install a new water front on the large kitchen range.\n\nThe boilers of the steam heating system were cleaned and repaired. All the plumbing in the building, i.e., water closets, bowls, taps, hot and cold water systems has all been put in good working order.\n\nIt was impossible to get an estimate on the work previous to doing the job because the plumber could not tell what might be required.\n\nIt is trusted that a purchase order will be issued to cover this account. This work has been completed satisfactorily.\n\nJ.N.R. Iredale,\nActing Indian Agent.\nOttawa, 1 November 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nAttached is an account amounting to $302.38 covering emergency repairs at the Morley Indian Residential School.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would issue purchase order so that the account may be paid.

Iredale, Acting Indian Agent,\nMORLEY, Alta.\n\nWe have your letter of the 18th instant enclosing Voucher No. 233 covering an expenditure of $302.38 at the Morley Residential School.\n\nIt has been decided to pay this account but we would point out that authority should have been obtained before the expenditure was incurred. We are allowed a certain amount each year for Indian education and it is simply impossible for Departmental officers to control expenditures if Indian agents assume authority for expenditures which have not been previously authorized.\n\nBernard F.

All bills presented from Brocks were paid and it is not like them to omit anything.\n\nHowever I suppose you will have to accept the material and explanation and unless you can prove to the contrary pay the bill, for the fact that we received the beds cannot be disputed.\n\nKind regards. Yours\n\n(Sgd.) Ed.\nAIR MAIL\n\nStony Indian Agency,\nMorley, Alberta.\nAugust 9th, 1945\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe:- Morley Residential School.\nNew Purchases.\n\nIn reply to your air mail letter of the 6th inst. relative to equipment and repairs required at the Morley Residential School, file 119-1-5.\n\nRegarding the new washer required, the present washer is a J.H.Connor, Ottawa.\nModel 24. W.\nNo. 135.\nVolts 110 - 220 - 60 cycle.\nInstalled 1935.\nCost - not known.\n\nThe motor in this machine is worn out and has been repaired many times. However, I think that it can be salvaged for use in the boys' manual training shop. We should try to obtain a new washer a size larger than the one described above.\n\nRegarding the stove used in the laundry room. This is really a cook stove with a reservoir, less a warming oven. Description is as follows:\nMcClary. \"Triumph\"\n4 hole cook stove, with back and reservoir.\n24\" x 30\" height 30\"\nReservoir 24\" x 12\"\nCost about $60.00\n\nThis stove is used to heat two galvanised boilers for boiling clothes, and also for heating sad irons in order to teach the girls how to do washing and ironing in their own homes under similar conditions.\n\nRegarding the last paragraph in your letter Mr. Staley has already purchased used double decked beds, (Airforce) from the Brock Company, Western Limited at $7.50 each. I am enclosing herewith an invoice for seven double decked beds which he purchased in June 1945; which he paid for from school funds. He says he has also purchased mattresses at $2.50 each but does not know if any more are available at the present time. He also showed me an invoice for another six double decked beds and also showed me the beds which he has not yet set up. These he purchased on August 1st, 1945 and which, I understand are being paid for from school or church funds. By using these double decked beds he is creating a little more floor space in the boys' dormitory.\n\n(Over)\nI might add that the double decked beds all bear the manufacturers name, \"Simmons Limited\" and there is no doubt about them being used previously by the armed forces. But they are all in practically new condition.\n\nIt is hoped that the foregoing information will prove sufficient for your requirements.\n\nJ.H.R.

E.J. Staley, Principal of the Indian Residential School at Morley has requested that certain new equipment be purchased for the school as under:\n\nOne new Connor washer (commercial size) costing about $800.00. I am informed that the present machine is practically worn out, will not last much longer and cannot be further repaired.\n\nMr. Staley also requests authority to have the smaller \"Maytag\" machine repaired at an estimated cost of approximately $80.00.\n\nAlso the laundry stove is completely worn out and it is desired that the school be furnished with a new one.\n\nThe principal also wishes to get a complete new set of fire-box linings for the large kitchen range, (Gurney, John Bull) which will cost approximately $25.00.\n\nMr. Staley also pointed out that he would like to get 10 new institutional beds which will cost approximately $25.00 each complete with mattresses, but in this connection he says he could use Air Force double deck cots which he thinks can be purchased for about $6.50 each, less mattresses, which can be purchased from the salvage department at about $2.50 each mattress.\n\nI would ask that immediate consideration be given to these various requests.\n\nJ.N.R.

Original on File 75-1-19\n\nRe: Morley Residential School.\n\n119-1-\n\nIt is also suggested that this school be provided with a 16 MM Motion picture machine for the entertainment of the pupils, and parents, this it is believed would assist the Principal to gain contact with the people of the Reserve, other than through school. They have a nice church building adjacent to the school, and I note that the congregation on Sundays is always good, and it is thought that a gathering of say once a week of the parents and children would foster a better spirit.\nMr. J. E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent,\nMorley, Alberta.\n\nDear Mr. Pugh:\n\nMr. Clark Chidlow of the American LaFrance Foamite Co., Calgary checked our fire fighting equipment on Monday, April 28th, and the following supplies are required to fill our four large extinguishers, and to have a refill on hand:\n\n8 Soda Acid Fire Extinguisher Recharges\n\nIt was found that 8 of the small \"Pyr Fighter\" extinguishers were not working, and these have been taken to Calgary to be checked and, if still usable, repaired and refilled.\n\nMr. Chidlow recommended that our present fire fighting equipment should be supplemented by the purchase of five new extinguishers of the \"Foamite\" type at a cost of $125.25.\n\nIn view of the increased safety of the children and staff, and the more adequate protection for the School property which this new equipment would give I believe the expenditure of this amount is amply justified.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nMr. J. E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent,\nMorley, Alberta.\n\nDear Mr. Pugh:\n\nThe matter of fire fighting and adequate protection of life and property at the Morley Indian School has been emphasized by the visit of Mr. Clark Chidlow of the American LaFrance Foamite Co., Calgary, who recently checked our equipment and made suggestions for more effective control of fire.\n\nWe need a better system of alarm. At present our alarm is a continuous ringing of a system of inside bells and an outside horn that is also used for the routine changes of duty during the day, and because of this loses much of its effectiveness as an alarm for fire. A distinctive siren, for fire only, would certainly increase the possibility of all the occupants of the building getting out safely in case of a sudden fire.\n\nThe installation of such a siren would not only be a protection for the School, but might also be of invaluable assistance in the control of fire in other buildings in the area.\n\nThe cost of such a siren as quoted by Mr. Chidlow is $67.50. This is without the cost of installation which would possibly amount to $50.00 more. In view of the increased protection which such a system of alarm would give I believe this expenditure would be fully justified; and, if it meets with your approval, I hope this suggestion may be passed on for the consideration of the Department.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nG. Roy Ingham,\nPrincipal\nStony Indian Agency,\nMORLEY, P.O.,\nAlberta.\nMay 3rd 1947.\n\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH, DEPT OF MINES AND RESOURCES, OTTAWA, ONT.\n\nI beg to advise that recently on a visit from Mr Clark Chidlow, representing the American La France Fire Engine and Foamite Co., of Calgary, I took the opportunity of having Mr Chidlow check over the Morley Indian Residential School, requesting him to collaborate with the Rev G. Roy Inglis, Principal of the above school, with a view to ascertaining the condition of his fire-fighting equipment, and general fire protection for this school.\n\nAs a result of this visit, I have received the enclosed correspondence from the Principal which sets forth what is considered to be essential in the line of extinguishers for full protection at this school.\n\nIt will be observed from the recommendations made by Mr Chidlow that a further 5 new extinguishers of the \"Foamite\" type should be provided to be placed in the following strategic places in the school building:\n\n1. Basement of the Outside Class Room building.\n2. Entrance to Class Rooms upstairs, adjacent to each room.\n3. Kitchen hallway.\n4. Furnace room.\n5. Main entrance hallway to Residential Building.\n\nPrices quoted by the Western Supply and Manf Co. of Calgary, Alta for the above type of \"Foamite\" extinguisher is $25.15 each for lots of four or more, prices quoted being F.O.B. Calgary, Alta.\n\nThe Principal's action in having the several extinguishers that were found to be un-useable, eight in all, is recommended to the Branch for the approval of the expenditure that will be entailed, and it is further recommended that the new extinguishers requested be authorized.\n\nA further letter from the Principal of the above school is also attached suggesting that a Fire Alarm siren be provided, and in discussing this matter with the Rev Inglis, I am inclined to accept his recommendation in the matter, as it would appear that bell ringing has lost its value as a fire protection medium, the siren would also be a warning to the Community at large, being situated in close proximity to the hospital and Agency premises.\n\nTo page 2.\nAt the present time, this school is equipped with a fire bell ringing system at the rear doors of the dormitories, which operate as the doors are opened, but not until. The main bell is used for calling staff and pupils to classes etc., and the Church bell is used for church purposes, hence it is thought that bells around this school have lost their value as a fire warning alarm.\n\nThe cost of the suggested Siren is quoted in the Principals letter attached.\n\nMay the foregoing suggestions and recommendations be considered as outlined, and this office advised, please.\n\nJ.E.

The heating arrangements to be in conjunction with the boilers.\n\nThe estimate given to Mr. Iredale was at that time $840.00, but in view of increased costs during the past year, it was deemed advisable to obtain a new tender.

Stony-Sarcee Indian Agencies\n\nDec. 6th. 1947.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nRE: Plastering of Class-rooms,\nMorley Residential School.\n\nIn connection with the above matter, it is advised that under authority of file 119-1-5(WT 1) of Sept. 30/47, Mr. H.E. Wright, was employed to carry out this work.\n\nThe classrooms were stripped of the old plaster and a start was made on the ceiling of the West classroom. It was found that the lath was not durable enough to carry the weight of plaster. The reason being that in the original construction of the building, strips of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) by \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) were nailed across the ceiling joists which are of 1 x 10 and the laths were then nailed to the 1 x \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) strips. It was noted that the weight of the plaster had pulled these strips together with the laths, loose. The space between the laths was also found to be insufficient with the result that when the new plaster was applied that the same buckling would occur as had taken place with the old plaster. As the job had been started, the writer undertook to provide lath wire and stone board to recondition the ceilings in both classrooms and the partition between. The laths on the ceiling together with the strips were entirely removed, and in one classroom, metal laths were used, in the other, stone board. The reason for the difference being that we were unable to procure sufficient for both rooms of either material. Mr. Wright, because of his contacts with building supply firms, was asked to obtain this material. The total cost of this extra material is $123.47 and was paid for in cash by Mr. Wright for which, together with his contract price of $650.00, a voucher will be submitted in due course.\n\nThe writer trusts that the Branch will concur in this action.\n\n(John E.

Agent\n\nDate Stony-Sarcee Indian Agencies.\nOctober 25th, 1946\n\nMr. J.M. Iredale,\nIndian Agent,\nMorley, Alta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe hereby submit our tender to take out the old hot water tank and jacket heater in the Morley Indian School and install in its place, the following: for the sum of $375.00.\n\nA new 30x120 hot water storage tank, shall be 1\" and heads 2\". This tank to be installed about 18\" above the present pneumatic cold water tank and to be placed on a 2\u00bd\" pipe stand. To install this tank it will be necessary to make an opening in the north side of the pump house and of course replace same when the tank is placed in position.\n\nIn the above figure we have estimated on heating the water with a Red Head, Taco or equal, water heater. This heater is a unit in itself with steam coils and has a heating capacity of 245 Imperial Gallons per hour. Raising the temperature of the water 100 degrees.\n\nWe have estimated on making connections to the steam outlet of each boiler carrying a 2\u00bd\" line to the heater, trapping the condensation and discharging into the present condensation pump and receiver.\n\nThe hot water circulating pipe from this heater to the tank to be 2\u00bd\".\n\nWe find that coal fed hot water heaters of this size required for this job are not made at the present time but it is the writer's opinion that the steam heating arrangement as specified above would be more satisfactory. This heater would be placed above the condensation pump thereby taking up no room, in front of the boilers. It would also eliminate the smoke pipe. We also believe that the maintenance cost would be reduced; the only attention that it would require would be that it would have to be taken out once a year and cleaned.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF. H.

H. LEPPER & CO.,\nPer\n\nFHL.H.\nMorley Indian Residential School.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of January 31, concerning the above residential school. As you are probably aware, we have spent considerable money at the Morley Residential School this year. In addition to minor items, we have expended the following sums:\n\n1. Plumbing repairs - $26.50\n2. Double deck bunks - $52.50\n3. Repairs to kitchen range - $50.50\n4. Inspection and servicing of fire extinguishers - $19.90\n5. Repairs to plumbing - $20.90\n6. Sewing machines (3 table and one power) - $240.75\n7. Fire extinguishers - $120.48\n8. Replastering of classrooms - $650.00\n9. Materials for lathing above classrooms - $123.47\n10. Installation of hot water tank and heater - $975.00\n11. Servicing and repairs to plumbing - $57.60\n\nYou will see from the above that the department has expended a fair share of money on the above school.\n\nTherefore, we have not yet been able to consider the enlargement of the kitchen, etc., as recommended. If no major repairs are required at this school next year, we hope to be able to carry out the Dietitian's recommendations.\n\nThe refrigerator at the former Mount Elgin Residential\n\nReverend George Dorey, D.D.,\nSecretary, Board of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street West,\nToronto 2B, Ontario.\nSchool has already been sold through War Assets Corporation.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

The Indian Affairs Branch pay $40.00 per month towards this amount during the months of October to April inclusive.\n\nWe would like to retain the services of Mr. Daniel Williams, who has rendered good service during the past winter, and we are prepared to give him light work during the summer if the Indian Affairs Branch will continue the grant of $40.00 per month. This will help us to keep the older boys in the class-room more than half the time as we are doing at present.\n\nIt is therefore requested that the grant for the Night Watchman be made for the twelve months of the year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG.

Mr. Clark, in company with Superintendent Pugh, made a very careful survey of the situation on the Stony Reserve. We are in total agreement with his suggestion that a building with six classrooms on the main floor, a full basement, and a top floor for teachers' quarters be erected.\n\nWe can only add that this should be included in this year's program, if at all possible.\n\nG.

Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of May 26th with reference to the Morley Residential School.\n\nAs soon as Major Clark returned to the Department we discussed the situation on the Morley Reserve with him. We realize that increased school accommodation is necessary but to erect a building of the type mentioned in your letter would involve an expenditure of upwards of $75,000.00 under present building conditions. No funds for this purpose were provided in the current year's appropriation and consequently we are unable to give favourable consideration to erecting a building this year.\n\nWe would appreciate it if you would write us more fully regarding the type of building which Mr. Pugh and yourself consider should be provided. When we are preparing our estimates for the fiscal year 1949-50, we will give very careful consideration to your recommendation.\n\nBernard F.

Gooderham, Esq., Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies, Calgary, Alta.\n\nRe: Branch File 119-1-5 (E.1) July 22nd 1948.\nSchool Buildings, Morley Indians; School.\n\nWe have for acknowledgement the above referenced Branch letter, requesting further information as to type of school building required, as additional accommodation at the above school.\n\nThe writer had in mind when making tentative recommendation for day school provision, that a building similar to that now in use as a class room be provided, which would have two class rooms over a basement, that would contain a workshop, furnace etc.\n\nSince discussing the matter with you, Mr. Uddick has made his survey, and has probably made some definite recommendations in general on this school, and we are of the opinion, that before deciding anything in the matter, it would as well to know what his views are in the matter of this school in general. Further accommodation for teachers would be required, up to four teachers and perhaps this could be provided as a unit with any new two class room building that might be erected in this programme. This may be covered in Mr. Uddick's report to the Branch.\n\nThe writer is treating this matter entirely from a day school angle, with provision only by the school for mid-day meal.\n\nA re-designed building similar to the two room day schools now being erected with provision for sleeping quarters, bath rooms and electric lighting facilities should be considered, and such a building might be erected for approximately $45,000.00, at present costs.\n\nSome provision should be made for increasing the kitchen facilities at the present school.\n\nRespectfully submitted for your consideration.\n\nJohn L. Hugh,\nSuperintendent,\nStony - Sarcee Indian Agencies.\nCALGARY, Alberta,\nAugust 12, 1948.\n\nB. F. Neary, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Morley Indian Residential School\n\nYour file 119-1-5 (A.1) of July 22.\n\nAttached is copy of a letter just received from Superintendent J. L. Pugh, which is self-explanatory. Though we have no copy of Mr. Ruddick's report, we are of the opinion that he did not make any specific recommendations with regard to the method of providing more classroom facilities at Morley.\n\nMr. Pugh is now of the opinion that a classroom block, based on the standard plan for a two-room day school similar to the one to be constructed at Sarcee, but enlarged and re-designed to provide three classrooms and facilities for four teachers, would meet the need at Morley. There should be, of course, a full basement. The present two room classroom block would be retained as such, giving five rooms in all, or it could be made into a large one room classroom by removal of the partition.\n\nBased upon the estimated cost of a one room day school, the cost of the above building would be $45,000.00 or more. Superintendent Pugh is placing an item in the Story House Estimates for $60,000.00.\n\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Hot Water System, Morley Ind: Residential School.\n\nIt is advised that the Principal of the above school has passed along to this office, a letter from the F.H. Lepper Co., Plumbers and Heating Contractors of Calgary, stating that they recommend an extra coil insert for the hot water heating apparatus installed last year at this school.\n\nThe state \"That they feel you should have this unit on hand and when the present one requires attention you would have a replacement. This would take but a short while and the building would not be without hot water for any length of time.\"\n\n\"The old one could then be re-cleaned and ready when the other one required attention.\"\n\nThe above Company quote the cost of the coil, at $98.00 with certain pipe connections.\n\nSubmitted for consideration, and it is recommended that to maintain a constant hot water supply in the event of corrosion fouling the coil in use, that the additional unit be provided.\n\nA.M.

We are also forwarding him a requisition for the materials required for the kitchen extension.\n\nWe have noted the tender of J.F. Wall in an amount of $825.00 for doing the necessary carpenter work. Is it possible to secure any other tender for this particular part of the work?\n\nThe tender from F.H. Lepper & Co. is in an amount of $645.00. Evidently this includes the cost of the canopy of the kitchen range ($150.00) and an amount of $495.00 for plumbing and radiator changes. Is there any possibility of securing anyone else to quote on the plumbing and radiator changes?\n\nWith regard to the painting it appears from your letter that you have received tenders as follows:\n\nS.C. Wright - $1,750.00\nApplicators Limited - $2,106.00\nWe do not appear to have received the tender of Applicators Limited in an amount of $2,106.00.

We have now been able to obtain further quotations in regard to the painting work, but have been unable to induce any contractors to look over the work except Mr. Williamson of the Neider Construction Co Ltd., and he has failed to give us a tender, although his offer was shown to the writer, and refused to make an attempt to get it up.\n\nTenders on painting are as follows:\n\nAppletons Ltd. Tender attached.\nMr. Sigel & Co. Ltd. Tender attached.\nM.O. Elliott Tender attached.\n\nAll of the above tenders are of the City of Calgary, Alberta.\n\nIt will be noted that all three tenders cover labour only, and labour and material, and therefore we have not quoted the figures above.\n\nIn view of our obtaining further tenders on the plumbing work, we invited the Anderson Plumbing Co of Calgary to tender, and they have taken no action.\n\nIt is felt that there is not much city work that contractors are not interested in connection with the present time, and we are advised to offer further tenders as requested. We believe that the prices we obtained are in line with present conditions. In the matter of the building work to be carried out, we have only one offer, or at least of Cochrane, Alta., but we are still trying to find others, and we are convinced that if the work is approved for this year, that we should commence as soon as possible, and selection of the tenders made from those available.\n\nMay we be advised please.\n\n[Signature]\n\nCommissioner, C.P.T.,\nStoney-Carroke Indian Agency.\n\nCopy to: Mr. Goodenough, Esq.,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alberta.\nMemorandum:\n\nIndian Affairs Branch.\n\nRe: Building material for repairing Morley Indian Residential School #757.\n\nPurchase Order No. 47164 was issued yesterday covering all of the material specified on Mr. Pugh's requisition which was received on the (27th of July), with the exception of the second item.\n\nKindly instruct Mr. Pugh to arrange for a local purchase of this item, calling for 15 yards of gravel and sand.\n\nW.

Neary.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa,\nOntario.\n\nRe: Kitchen Alterations, Morley Indian Res.; School.\nStony Indian Agency.\n\nWith reference to the marginally noted project, it is advised that material or the above work has been delivered, inclusive of lumber, cement etc., and paints.\n\nIn connection with the labour to be employed for the alteration work, it is advised that Mr. Wall of Cochrane took other work, and is not available. As a consequence the writer proceeded to find other carpenters who who quote on the work, and the following have quoted:\n\n1. Mr. A. Gray, 1115-9th Street East, Calgary, Alta., quotes:\n   Day Labour only: Foreman ................. $1.85 per hour\n   Carpenter .................. $1.47 \" \"\n   Labourers .................. $1.00 \" \"\n\nPlasterers Union Rates\n\nPlus 12% of total pay roll, to cover Workmans Compensation, Insurance, Transportation and use of power tools, Pay Roll to be met 1st & 15th of the month. Estimated time to finish work 8 weeks.\n\n2. Mr. R. Rolston, 3804-13th Ave. West, Calgary, Alta.,\n   Day Labour:\n   Foreman ................... $1.75 per hour\n   Carpenters ................ $1.47 \" \"\n   Labourers .................. $1.00 \" \"\n\nEstimated total amount of job by the above party, $1270.00\n\n3. N.F. Mitchell, Cochrane, P.O., Alberta,\n   Day Labour:\n   Foreman $1.70 per hour\n   Carpenters ................ $1.47 per hour\n   Labourers .................. $1.00 per hour\n\nEstimated total amount for job $1295.00\n\nThe estimated total time to complete this work varies from 5 weeks to 8 weeks, and all three men quoting figured about a 5 to 6 man crew for the job, an estimated daily rate total approximately $6.50 per day, the school to provide accommodation.\n\nOf the three quoting, Mr. Gray appears to be the more businesslike, but we feel would be more costly. Mr. Mitchell is the next choice, a local type of carpenter, and doing good work in the district, and we believe capable of doing this work.\n\nAll those quoting will undertake the complete job, inclusive of plastering, we to provide all materials and gravel.\n\nAs we have no instructions as to labour, either for the above alterations or painting, may we be advised as soon as possible. It is suggested that we provided with an accountable cheque for the alteration work, in the amount of $1500.00, based upon the above quotations.\n\nJohn. F.

The plan proposed is I think unworkable, and some other means must be devised for securing the end aimed at, no doubt a proper one. Would you please let me have any papers you have on the subject with a description of the land upon which it is proposed to build the orphanage. I would suggest too that before you go to Council with the matter an agreement be come to as to the expenditure with the method of authorizing it, as at the present time the question is not ripe for final settlement.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nDear Mr. Sedgewick,\n\nIn reply to your note of the 2nd inst., forwarding a report made by my Minister to Council on the 26th Aug. last, in respect to the title to the site on which the Indian Orphanage at Morleyville, Alberta was erected, being united in the Supt. Gen. of Indian Affairs and the Methodist Church of Canada jointly, and which plan you state you think is unworkable, and that some other means must be devised for securing the end aimed at; and you ask me to let you have any papers I may have on the subject, with the description of the land upon which it is proposed to build the orphanage;\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nIn compliance with your request I beg to enclose herewith file No. 30688 of the Deptt., and have to state, with regard to the description of the land, that it would appear to be sufficiently described in the report to Council, above referred to, namely, Lot No. 8 in the plan of the Morley Settlement, and as shown on the map accompanying the report. The title to one-half section of the land on which the buildings are situated, it is proposed shall be vested in the name of Mr. Smith, described. However, this is considered to be an insufficient description; the Deptt. of the Interior, which allotted the land to the Methodist Church, would be able to give you a description by metes and bounds.\n\nIn regard to your suggestion that, before the Deptt. goes to Council with the matter, an agreement should be come to as to the expenditure with the Methodist Body, I beg to inform you that the Orphanage...\nin question has been in operation for some years, and the Indians are anxious to obtain us for our assistance. A view upon the site is that we propose expending $600.00 to assist the Methodist Church in making an addition thereon. This expenditure the Supt Gen. authorized to be incurred without waiting for the settlement, so to title, on the occasion of his recent visit to the North-West, and the work is now proceeding.\n\nIf you will turn to the letter from the Dept of the Interior on the file enclosed, dated the 23rd Aug., you will observe that this Dept was advised, by it, to have an Order-in-Council passed reserving the land in question in the Supt Gen. of Indian Affairs and the Methodist Church, jointly, for Indian purposes.\n\nI have, etc.\nOttawa, October 29th, 1870.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to return file no. 30648 of your department, and to state with reference to your letter of the 28th inst., that for several reasons it would not be practicable to carry out the recommendation made by the Superintendent General in his report to Council of the 26th inst., viz., that under the authority of Council the title to one half section of the land on which the buildings of the orphanage are located may be vested in the Superintendent General and the Methodist Church jointly for Indian purposes.

Burgess Esq.,\nD.M. of the District,\nOttawa.\n\nNov. 24th, 1850.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th Inst.; and I beg to thank you for the copy of the Patent Act therewith, for the Methodist Church site at Burleyville, which appears to be sufficient for the purpose.\n\nYours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. Christie\nReferring to conversation at an interview you were good enough to grant the Rev. J. W. Youngall and myself on the 30th ultimo, when matters pertaining to Indian Institutes in the North-West were under consideration, I beg to submit a memo concerning the Youngall Orphanage at Selkirk, especially in regard to the site of the school on which the buildings have been erected.\n\nUp to the present time the Institute has been conducted by the Rev. Eld. Mr. Youngall, who was alone responsible for its\n\nThe Honorable the\nSuperintendent of\nIndian Affairs.\n\nOttawa\nfinances and general management\nof missionary society, while leaving\nno responsibility of that kind,\nnevertheless recommended the dec-\nlaration to the conference and\nsupport of the Methodist Church.\nAt the recent session of the Mission-\nary Board, the whole question was\ncarefully considered, and it was\nfinally agreed that the Orphanage\nshould be taken over as a part of\nthe regular work of our missionary\nsociety; a committee has been ap-\npointed to arrange details of this,\nfor which will formally take effect\nat the next session next, but in\nthe meantime the Missionary Board\nvirtually assumes the financial re-\nsponsibility, and all correspondence\nrespecting the Orphanage will there-\nafter be through, so to speak, the\nMission Board.\nWhen the Orphanage was first established a portion of land aggregating two sections was applied for. The location being too near the mountains to carry out farming to any large extent, application was made for the quantity of land stated so that there would be sufficient room for stock raising which is one of the industries connected with the Institution. When the late Hon. Mr. White was the Minister of the Interior the whole matter was fully explained to him, and a promise was given that a patent would be issued for the two sections to the Methodist Church. But some afterwards, however, the matter was left in abeyance, as it was thought that possibly the Department would adopt the Orphanage.\nas part of its regular Institute work, in which event the title to the land would not be asked for by the Missionary Society, as it has been decided that the Orphanage will remain in the character of a Boarding School, and will not be assumed by the Department. I would also request the application of the Missionary Society for a patent to the land, so that in any extension of the present buildings or erection of new ones we may be adequately protected in the possession of our property.\n\nIt is the intention of the Missionary Board to provide some additional accommodation and appliances that are needed for the efficient carrying out of the work. I trust therefore that a decision respecting the patent\nwill be reached as soon as possible,\nso that we may proceed without\nunnecessary delay.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nA. D. Wetherald\n\nGeneral Secretary.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith copy of a letter dated the 6th instant from the Rev. W. D. Rankin, General Agent of the Methodist Missionary Society, requesting the privilege of visiting the United States in connection with the Methodist Church.\n\nI am, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et archives Canada\nMcDougall Orphanage\n\nThe question of the orphanage matter was then fully discussed and decided.\n\nThere is no question but that the orphanage will take care of the children so long as there are any such children. This Department has no intention of taking the orphanage into its own hands and the Board cannot now receive the orphan children for the time being until such a decision is made.\n\nIt is not the intention of the Board to make any decision at this juncture. The Board should be advised as soon as possible.\n\nThe Board will consider the question of the matter of your application and the orphanage matter.\nIn connection with\nthat which he had in\ntwo letters.\n\nFirstly, that he\nis the new Will-Crean\nUnder Writ, who has\nreceived a copy of a\ndraft of a letter to\nthe Right Hon. of the\nlate Secretary of State\nwhom he had the\npleasure of seeing, and\nin that behalf he\nwould be obliged that\nthe said letter be\nused for the purposes\nof the Department.\n\nSecondly, that\nthere is no\ncorrespondence\nwhich he had written\nand had in his care\nfor must have been\nsent to Mr. D. Paul.\nI therefore propose to\ncopy of the letter\nto have the book\nin that part of it which relates to the land\nact, and so the rest,\nthink it best to\nthis in the matter.\n\n[Signature]\nRev Dr Sutherland\nJuni Soc\nMethodist Mission Rooms\nToronto\n\nHi:\n\nThey brought me word of your letter of the 6th inst.\n\nIn reply I have to inform you that note has been taken of the fact that the Medicine Hat orphanage has been taken over as part of the regular work of the missionary Board, & that all correspondence with it will thereafter be through the office.\n\nAs to that part of your letter which\nrefers to the application made for additional land for the orphanage. I beg to inform you that I have sent a copy of your letter to the Dept. of the Interior (which Dept., as you know, is charged with the administration of Indian Lands) for action respecting the application.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nThe Methodist Church,\nMISSIONARY DEPARTMENT,\n\nToronto, May 6, 1893\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to the McDougall Orphanage at Morley, Alberta, I beg to say that arrangements are in progress whereby the Missionary Board of the Methodist Church will assume control of the institution about the first of July next. It may be explained that up till now the institution has been in a certain sense of a private character; that is, Mr. McDougall only was financially responsible, but it is deemed expedient that this should now be changed. As considerable expense has been incurred in the past, there is a necessity for increased accommodation in the near future.\n\nI beg to lay before the Department the application of the Missionary Board for a Patent for the lands upon which the Institute is built, as explained.\nin former correspondence these\ncomplain about two sections. This\namount being rendered necessary\nto secure a sufficient cattle range.\nIn former correspondence it was\nproposed that this institution should\nbe taken charge of by the Government\nor managed as an ordinary Institute.\nThe Department did not concur in this\nproposal, but when Rev. Mr. McDougall\nvisited Ottawa in March last he was\ninformed that a Patent for the lands\nwould issue shortly to the Methodist\nChurch, so that we might proceed with\nsuch improvements & enlargement as seem\nto be required for the efficient carrying on of\nthe work. Hoping that this matter will\nreceive prompt favorable attention.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nA. Butterland\n\nTo the Honorable\nThe Right Honorable\nIndian Affairs\nOttawa\nSir:\n\nReferring to the letter to you from this Department of the 12th October last respecting the application of the Methodist Missionary Society for additional land to be given them in connection with the Indian Orphanage at Morley, I enclose herein a copy of a letter of the 16th instant received from the Rev. Mr. Sutherland, General Secretary of the Methodist Missionary department of the above Church, in which he refers to the previous application for a patent for the land upon which the above institution is built, which he states is explained in his former correspondence, comprises about two Sections, and that the Rev. Mr. McDougall, who visited Ottawa in March last, was informed that a patent for the land would issue shortly to the Methodist Church, and that that body would be free to proceed with such improvements and enlargements as seemed to be requisite for the efficient carrying on of the work.\n\nIn this connection I beg to state that\nno such information was, of course, given by this Department to Mr. McDougall; and it is assumed, therefore, that Dr. Sutherland must be referring to an interview Mr. McDougall had with you on the subject of the land to be attached to said Orphanage.\n\nI will accordingly, in acknowledging Dr. Sutherland's letter, inform him that a copy of the same has been sent to your Department, and that you will deal with the question of the lands to be patented to the Methodist Church in connection with the Orphanage referred to.\n\nYr. Obt. Svt.\n\nRev. A. Sutherland, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMethodist Mission Rooms,\nToronto.\n\nRev. Sir:-\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 16th instant, in which you state that arrangements have been in progress whereby the Missionary Department of the Methodist Church will assume control of the McDougall Orphanage at St. Norley, Alta., about the 1st July next, and that hereafter it will be conducted as it has heretofore been, which was, in essence, a certain sense, under a private character, Mr. McDougall being only financially\nresponsible; and you refer to the necessity for increased accommodation in the near future, and say before the Department the application of the Missionary Board for a patent for the land upon which the institution is built, stating that the same comprises about two Sections; and you advert to former correspondence in which it was proposed that the Orphanage should be taken charge of by the Government and managed as an ordinary institute, in reply to which you were informed that the Department did not concur in that proposal, and you also state that when the Rev. Mr. McDougall visited Ottawa in March last he was informed that a patent for the land would issue shortly to the Methodist Church, so that it would be free to proceed with such improvements and enlargements as seemed to be required for the efficient execution of the work, I beg to refer you to the letter from this Department of the 12th October last, which informs you, inter alia, that a copy of your letter to which that letter was a reply had been sent to the Department of the Interior, which Department is charged with the administration of Dominion lands, for action respecting the application.\n\nI have now the honour to inform you that any intimation to a copy of your letter which is now being replied to has likewise been sent to the Department of the Interior, with a view to the land matter being receiving the attention of that department; and I may state that Mr. McDougall must have obtained the information which you state he did from the Department of the Interior.\nrespecting the issue of a patent for the land connected with the Orphanage, as this Department was not in a position to give him any information on that subject.\n\nYr. Obt. Svt.\nToronto, 6th Oct., 1892.\n\nSIR,\n\nReferring to a conversation at an interview you were good enough to grant the Rev. J. McDougall and myself on the 30th ultimo, when matters pertaining to Indian Institutes in the North-West were under consideration, I beg to submit a memo. concerning the McDougall Orphanage at Morley, especially in regard to the title of the land on which the buildings have been erected.\n\nUp to the present time the Institute has been controlled by the Rev. Mr. McDougall who was alone responsible for its finances and general management. Our Missionary Society, while under no responsibility of that kind, nevertheless commended the Institution to the confidence and support of the Methodist Church. At the recent session of the Missionary Board the whole question was carefully considered, and it was finally agreed that the Orphanage should be taken over as a part of the regular work of our Missionary Society. A Committee has been appointed to arrange details of transfer, which will formally take effect at the end of June next; but in the meantime the Missionary Board virtually assumes the financial...\nfinancial responsibility, and all correspondence respecting the Orphanage will hereafter be through, or from the Mission rooms.\n\nWhen the Orphanage was first established a portion of land aggregating two sections was applied for, the location being too near the mountains to carry on farming to any large extent, application was made for the quantity of land stated so that there would be sufficient room for stock raising which is one of the industries connected with the Institution. When the late Honourable Thomas White was the Minister of the Interior the whole matter was fully explained to him, and a promise was given that a patent would be issued for the two sections to the Methodist Church. Sometime afterwards, however, the matter was left in abeyance, as it was thought that possibly the Department would adopt the orphanage as part of its regular Institute work, in which event the title to the land would not be asked for by the Missionary Society. As it has been decided that the Orphanage will remain in the character of a Boarding School, and will not be assumed by the Department, I would now repeat the application of the Missionary Society for a patent to the land, so that in any extension of the present buildings, or erection of new ones, we may be adequately protected in the possession of our property.\n\nIt is the intention of the Missionary Board to provide some additional accommodation and appliances that are\nare needed for the efficient carrying on of the work. I trust therefore that a decision respecting the patent will be reached as soon as possible, so that we may proceed without unnecessary delay.\n\nI have, &c.\n\n(sgd) A. Sutherland.\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nThe Honourable\nThe Supt. General\nof Indian Affairs.\nCertified Copy of a Report of a Committee of the Honourable the Privy Council, approved by His Excellency the GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL, on the 13th April, 1893.\n\nOn a Report dated 26th of March, 1893, from the Minister of the Interior stating that application has been made on behalf of the Missionary Society of the Methodist Church of Canada for a grant of two sections of land in connection with the McDougall Orphanage at Morley N. W. T.\n\nThe Minister is informed that for upwards of 15 years Lot 8 has been claimed on behalf of the Orphanage Institute, conducted by the Rev. John McDougall, a Missionary of the Methodist Church of Canada, and a short time ago the control of this Orphanage was taken over by the Missionary Board of the Church and he submits the annexed copy of a letter from the Reverend Dr. Sutherland, General Secretary of the Methodist Missionary Society, renewing the application of the Society, explaining why for some years the matter by consent of the applicants and the Government remained in abeyance, and setting out that it is the intention of the Society to provide the additional accommodation and appliances required for the efficient carrying on of the work of the Orphanage.\n\nThe Minister is aware that during the past six years\n\nThe Honourable\n\nThe Minister of the Interior.\nyears improvements to the value of several thousand dollars have been made on the Lot now claimed, chiefly in the way of buildings and fences, and that the work performed by the Reverend Mr. McDougall through the instrumentality of the Orphanage has been of the highest importance to the cause of civilization and progress among the Indians of the North West.\n\nThe Minister recommends that under the provisions of Sub-clause 8 of Clause 90 of the Dominion Lands Act he be authorized to issue a free patent to the Missionary Society of the Methodist Church of Canada for Lot 8 of the Morley Settlement, in the Provisional District of Alberta, in the North West Territories of Canada, containing 1176 acres more or less, for the purposes of an Orphanage for Indian Children, and for such use only.\n\nThe Committee advise that the requisite authority be granted as recommended.\n\n(signed) John J. McGeo,\nClerk of the Privy Council.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour by direction to send you herewith, for your information, a copy of an Order-in-Council dated the 12th April last, granting Lot No. 8, Morleyville Settlement, to the Missionary Society of the Methodist Church of Canada, for the purposes of an Orphanage for Indian children, and for such use only.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent-General\n\nof Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nS.M. Burgess Esq.,\nDeputy Minister,\nPapay Nation,\nOntario\n\nJune 13th, 1892\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant enclosing a copy of an order delivered dated the 17th of last January, Lot No. 8, Morleyville Settlement to the missionary Society of the Methodist Church of Canada for the purpose of an orphanage for Indian children. In view of this case, I am very glad to inform you that it was assumed that Dr. Guthrie and Mr. Maclean, Secretary of the Methodist Church of Canada, had been duly notified by you, and that the passage of this Act...\nThe Methodist Church,\nMISSIONARY DEPARTMENT.\n\n101093\n\nToronto, 15th July, 1893.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 26th ultimo, No. 96930, in which reference is made to a statement made by Mr. Farm Instructor Grasse regarding the teacher at McDougall Orphanage, I beg to say that a copy of the letter has been sent to the Rev. Mr. McDougall, and we await his answer thereto.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Mr. Reed,\n\nReverend A. Sutherland, the General Secretary of the Missionary Department of the Methodist Church at Toronto, has been in correspondence with the Department for some months past with regard to the grant of a patent to that Church for the site on which the Indian Orphanage in the Morleyville settlement is erected. If you will refer to your file No.30,698, you will find that an Order in Council, of which a copy was forwarded to your Department on the 6th June last, was passed on the 12th of April, 1893, granting Lot No.8, Morleyville settlement, to the Missionary Society of the Methodist Church of Canada, for the purposes of an Orphanage for Indian children, and for such use only. Dr. Sutherland protested against a limitation of this kind, and the reasons which he offers in support of his claim to an unconditional grant are such that the Minister feels disposed to accede to the request. Such a grant, however, would require an amending Order in\n\nHayter Reed, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nCouncil,\nH.R.2:\n\nCouncil, and in order that the Minister may be able to justify the action proposed to be taken, I would be greatly obliged if you would obtain for me a little history of what has been done in regard to the Orphanage in question. I have no doubt you will be in a position to furnish this information.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. Dr. Sutherland alleges that the late Hon. Thomas White promised that the grant of this land when made should be unconditional. We have no record of that promise here. Kindly let me know if your Department has.\n\n[Signature]\nFebruary 25th, 1864\n\nDear Mr. Burgess,\n\nIn reply to yours of the 18th instant, I may say that I am readily agreeable to the information you seek for, of our relations with the Mohawk Ojibwe and their work.\n\nWith regard to the quantity of land your department may be able to give in connection with the lands already, we are only concerned to see that an area of some ten acres, including and immediately surrounding the site upon which the building shall be located by the crown, since it was upon such understanding with you... enough that the department incurred its liability on building. We cannot from here give you any accurate description of the area to be removed, nor could we, probably, get it without incurring the expense of sending a surveyor to the spot, and I would be glad to learn whether you could possibly devise any course by which, without involving the issue of patent to the church, we could secure the ten acres referred to, thus a favourable opportunity for having it defined may occur.\n\nA. M. Burgess,\nSuperintendent of the Interior.\n\nOttawa.\nThere does not seem to be any record in this department of any such promise as you say the Rev. Mr. Gutherlend claims to have received from the late Hon. Thomas White, and if there was any correspondence on the matter it, and, I presume, have been with him as Minister of the Interior.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nDear Mr. Reed,\n\nI am duly in receipt of your letter of the 20th instant, Ref.-30,698, and shall await the receipt of the memorandum with regard to your relations with the McDougall Orphanage at Morley, and its work. No doubt when that has been received it will enable us to come to a conclusion as to what should be done in the matter of surveying the block of ten acres on which the building stands.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHayter Reed, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nThe late Rev. George Hollowell had for years in contemplation the establishment of an Orphanage in the North West, chiefly for the benefit of the numerous children who had been left friendless by the small-pox epidemic, and was about taking definite steps in the matter when his tragic death occurred. Two or three years later the enterprise was taken up by his son, the Rev. John Hollowell, with, it is understood, no other aim except that which he voluntarily given by friends of the Indians in the Methodist Church, the Missionary Board feeling unable to make an annual grant, in view of the other claims of the work. It appears that land was purchased with the consent of the Government, and that application was made for a grant of some \u00a31000, so as to afford sufficient room for a suitable building. Mr. Hollowell proceeded with the work, securing a large portion of the land, erecting a small building, supplied with firewood, and opened the Home for the reception of orphan children. The Department has informed that this was all done largely at his own expense, and from the time the enterprise began until the autumn of 1892 he expended some \u00a32500 more than he had received from all sources.\n\nIn\nIn 1865 the Department made a grant of $700 toward the Indentification, which was continued until the outbreak of 1877, when it was increased to $300 per capita per annum.\n\nIn 1890 a new building was erected by the Government, at a cost of over $2000. This building has given increased facilities and comfort to the pupils. Upon the completion of the building the per capita grant was increased from $300 to $72 per annum.\n\nBefore beginning operations on the land now assigned to the Department consideration is proper to take a view of the land on which the building was to be located, and asked that the title be as well as $20 acres of land be vested in the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs and the Methodist Church for Indian purposes. Instead of doing before doing it was arranged that conditions prevail by which the land being used for any but purposes specified therein without the consent of the Superintendent General should be donated in the Department's name to be donated to the Methodist Church. The conditions included were that \"the Methodist Church, its members or assigns, shall not at any time hereafter without the express consent in writing of the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs for the purpose of using the said parcel of tract of land, or any part thereof, or parcel the same, or any part thereof, be\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 29th ultimo, I have the honour to enclose the deed added for reference to the original application.\n\nIn my letter to you of the 30th ultimo, it was stated that the quantity of land thus purchased was determined in my last report. This was in accordance with the instructions given by the Rev. John Gurnall at the time, but I observe from the correspondence on file that my predecessor mentioned in his letter to you of the 31st October 1820 one half section, and this, I understand, was the area for which Letters Patent issued.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

As the season is advancing and I would like to have this information as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nJohn R. Hall, Esq.,\nSecretary\nof the Dept. of the Interior,\nOttawa.\nDepartment of the Interior,\n\nOttawa, 30th August, 1889.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge your letter of the 12th instant, Ref. 116965\u20145, asking to be advised of the result of the correspondence had with Mrs. Elizabeth Boyd as to her intentions regarding Lot No. 7, Morleyville Settlement, for which she had been given permission by the Land Board years ago to make a homestead entry of 160 acres, and to purchase the remainder at the rate of $1.00 per acre.\n\nIn reply I am to say that on the 23rd May last Mrs. Boyd was given sixty days within which to exercise her privilege of accepting the conditions of the award, but up to the present time no reply has been made to my letter, nor has any report been received from the Agent of Dominion Lands at Calgary of an entry having been made for a portion of the lot in question. Before giving you a definite reply in this matter I will telegraph to the Agent, and should there be no entry, or no application for entry by Mrs. Boyd, the lot can then be set aside for the purposes of your Department. As pointed out in Mr. Hall's letter of the 21st April last, Mrs. Boyd has paid on account of the settlement with Mr. Francis White, who had a leasehold of lands in this vicinity, the sum of $168.40, and should it be found equitable that this amount should be refunded to Mrs. Boyd, the lot can be transferred to your Department, provided\n\nThe Acting Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDepartment of the Interior,\n\nOttawa,\n\n-2-\n\nprovided your Department guarantee that this amount, along with the accrued interest from the date of payment at the rate of 6% per annum, be refunded to Mrs. Boyd.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\nOttawa, September 1st, 1892.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th instant in further reference to the application made to this Department for Lot No. 7 Morley Settlement on account of which you state that Mrs Elizabeth Boyd has paid the sum of $168.40 and should it be found equitable that this amount should be refunded to Mrs Boyd you should require this Department to guarantee payment of the amount together with accrued interest from date of payment at the rate of six per cent per annum and in reply I beg to say that provided the lot in question is transferred to this Department it will if necessary assume the responsibility of refunding the amount equitably due to Mrs Boyd on account of payment made by her in settlement with Mr P. White who holds the leasehold of the lands in the vicinity.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. D. McLean\nSecretary\n\nJohn R.

McLean,\nSecretary\n\nJohn W. Kiddrie, Esq.,\nPrincipal,\nMcDougall Orphanage,\nNorley, Alta.\nA two-inch pipe would give an ample supply of water for all domestic purposes.\n\nThe Commissioner suggests that the Department of Public Works be asked to prepare specifications. I do not see that this is necessary as the chief thing to be guarded against is the danger of frost, and the Agent or Principal should have knowledge of how deep the pipe should be sunk than anyone unfamiliar with the locality.\n\nThis matter has been before the Department for some time, and I think it should not be finally disposed of.\n\nIf we had only $150, we could save a great deal of money by a proper arrangement. We have heard of a proposal to lay the pipe under the road, but it seems to me that it would be more economical to lay it in the street.\n\nI am convinced that the best course would be to lay the pipe in the street.\n\nA.S.\n[Signature]\n[Date]\nOTTAWA, 14th December, 1899\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nMay we water supply for McDougall Orphanage.\n\nThe sum of $750.00 is included in this year's estimates for the purpose of conducting water into the building from Lot 7, Norley Settlement.\n\nThe negotiations for the transfer of this lot to the Department are not yet concluded, the Department of the Interior having granted a further extension of time to Mrs Elizabeth Boyd, in whose name the lot stands, to complete her purchase. As, however, the school would be entitled to obtain water from the spring on this lot, the Indian Commissioner was instructed to call for tenders for connecting the spring with the school, and was requested to consult with Mr Ponton, who was then in the West.\n\nMr Ponton has placed on file certain correspondence had between him and the Commissioner in regard to the preparation of estimates from which it will be seen that to put in a four-inch cast iron pipe will cost over $1000.00, while a four-inch galvanized wrought iron pipe would come to over $1600.00 and a two inch pipe would cost the whole of the amount voted, -$750.00. Mr Laird and Mr Ponton both favor a three or four inch pipe on account of the additional protection it would give in case of fire, but if their recommendation were approved of, additional funds would have to be provided.\nDepartment of the Interior,\n\nOttawa, 23rd December, 1899.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 20th ultimo, No. 116963\u20145, asking to be informed how much longer time Mrs. Boyd is to be allowed within which to make homestead entry for 160 acres of Lot 7, Morleyville Settlement; I beg to say that it now appears Mrs. Boyd has no interest in this lot, but disposed of it some years ago to one Frank Ricks, who the Agent of Dominion Lands at Calgary reports is prepared to carry out the conditions of the Department relative to the disposal of this lot. Mr. Ricks has, therefore, been given a period of thirty days within which to close up the matter, and if it is closed up to the satisfaction of this Department, the lot in question cannot be transferred to your Department in connection with the MacDougall Orphanage at Morleyville.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa, December 23rd, 1925.\n\n[Handwritten note]\n\n[Signature]\nSir,\n\nIn reference to previous correspondence regarding the application of this Department to acquire the right to utilize the spring on the 100 acres of Lot 7, Macdonald Settlement for the purpose of obtaining the water supply required for the Schonell Orphanage, I have to request that you will be good enough to state how the matter now stands.\n\nIn your letter of the 23rd ultimo you say that Mr. Hicks, the assignee of Mr. Boyd, who homesteaded this lot, has been given a period of 30 days within which to close up the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.G.

On the 3rd instant, the Agent of Dominion Lands, at Calgary, communicated the decision of this Department to Messrs. McCarthy & Stuart, the Solicitors acting for Mr. Ricks, and consequently the 30 days allowed will not expire until about the 3rd proximo.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

D. McLean, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, 15th February, 1900\n\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to the question of water supply for the McDougall Orphanage, I have to say that the Department is advised that Mr Frank Ricks, the assignee of Mrs Boyd, who made the homestead entry for 160 acres of Lot No. 7, Norleyville Settlement, has paid the purchase money in full for this lot, the title to which now stands in his name. Arrangements, therefore, will have to be made with Mr Ricks for permission to enter upon his property and utilize the spring thereon.\n\nThe Department thinks that the Church authorities would be in a better position to treat with Mr Ricks for the necessary concession than it would, and it would like you to advise them accordingly.\n\nThe sum of $750 is all that is available for putting in the water supply and there are, therefore, no funds for the compensation of Mr Ricks, should he require it.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg,\nMan.\n\nSecretary\nBox 316, Calgary, Alta.\nMay 30th, 1900.\n\nThe Hon. David Laird,\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Principal of the Orphanage and Home has three times approached the owner (or claimant) of the Spring of flowing water from which it is desired to run same into the Buildings, and thus far has been unable to secure anything like a permanent right to use the water. Will you kindly do what you can in this matter, as this question of water supply is one which should be settled as soon as possible.\n\nHealth and comfort, and convenience, are all seriously involved and we will hope that you will be able to afford speedy relief.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd) John McNaught.\nOffice of the Indian Commissioner\n\nFor Manitoba and the North-West Territories,\n\nWinnipeg, 3 June 1900.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 16th February last, relative to the question of water supply for the McDougall Orphanage, I beg to say that as suggested by you I communicated with the Church authorities with a view to obtaining permission from Mr. Frank Ricks, the owner of Lot No. 7 Morleyville, to enter upon his property and utilize the Spring therein, and I regret to state that although repeatedly written to on the subject the only reply I received is the enclosed letter dated the 30th ultimo, from the Rev. John McDougall, wherein he states that they have not yet succeeded in obtaining the desired permission from Mr. Ricks, and he requests that the question be taken up by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, 13th June, 1900.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant with further reference to the question of water supply for the McDougall Orphanage and forwarding a copy of a communication from the Rev. John McDougall, in which he states that the Church authorities have not yet succeeded in obtaining authority from Mr Frank Ricks, the owner of Lot No. 7, Norleyville, to enter upon his property and utilize the spring thereon.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that if you think it advisable to do so, you may communicate with Mr Ricks on behalf of the Department with a view to obtaining the desired permission from him.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nSecretary\n\nWinnipeg,\nMan.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 12th June, 1900.\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nRe water supply for the McDougall Orphanage.\n\nThe question of furnishing a water supply for this school has been before the Department for a couple of years and no definite arrangement has as yet been arrived at. The sum of $750 was voted last year and re-voted this year for this purpose, but there was a hitch in regard to the ownership of the property from which the supply was to be derived and it was only in February last that this Department was advised by the Department of the Interior that sale of the lot in question had been completed to Mr Frank Ricks.\n\nThe Commissioner was written to on the 15th of that month and requested to ask the Methodist Church authorities to enter into negotiations with Mr Ricks for permission to utilize the spring on his property. The Commissioner now writes enclosing a copy of a letter from the Rev. John McDougall, stating that so far they have been unable to come to terms with Mr Ricks, and requesting that the matter be taken up by the Department.\n\nIn connection with this matter I may state that\nthat the sum already voted will lapse on the 30th instant and from estimates furnished by the Commissioner and Mr Ponton, this amount, owing to the advance in the price of iron, will not be sufficient to complete the work as at first contemplated. If Mr Ricks has to be paid a consideration for a permanent right to use the water, more money will be required for this purpose.\n\nI may state that both Mr Laird and Rev. Mr McDougall omit to state the amount of consideration, if any, that Mr Ricks is most likely to require. The Department could, however, write to Mr Ricks and ask him to state for what amount he would grant the required concession, and this is apparently what Mr Ricks has been waiting for.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Duncan\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 15th February last, I beg to state that the Rev. John McDougall called at this office today and informed me that he is unable to make any satisfactory arrangement with Mr. Frank Ricks, the owner of Lot No. 7 Morleyville, to utilize the spring thereon for a supply of water for the McDougall Orphanage. Mr. Ricks states that he is not yet in possession of the title to the lot and he will not make any arrangements until he holds such title.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Commissioner\n\nSecretary,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, 20th June, 1900.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 16th instant in connection with the question of water supply for the McDougall Orphanage I beg to inform you that Mr Frank Hicks, the owner of Lot No. 7 Murrayville Section is now in possession of the title to the lot as the patent therefor issued on the 7th instant.\n\nIn this connection I beg to refer you to my letter of the 15th instant, in which you were authorized to make arrangements with Mr Hicks if you thought it advisable to do so.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nSecretary\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg,\nMan.\nDepartment of the Interior,\n21st June, 1900.\n\nSir,\n\nI am directed to inform you that the patent for lot 7, Morleyville Settlement, dated the 7th instant, was forwarded to the Registrar at Calgary this day, and the patentee, Mr. Frank Ricks, was notified of this action.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nBlue print film removed and sent to Dept. of Justice with letter of 1st October 1902.\n\nPrint from which print made to be record in Surgeon's Office.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs:\nOTTAWA, 19th February, 1901\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nMemo re water supply for McDougall Orphanage.\n\nDr Lafferty showed me a communication from Mr Ricks, the owner of Lot 7 Morley Settlement, which adjoins the school lot, in which he demands the sum of $1,000.00 for the privilege of using the water from the spring on that lot. Lot 7 contains 61 1/2 acres, for which Ricks paid $11, receiving his Patent on the 7th June last. The Department has, for the past two years been endeavoring to obtain the use of this spring for the past two years, as there is no water available on Lot 8, the school lot, and Mr Ricks has given his ultimatum that if his offer is not accepted, he will prevent the school from taking water therefrom.\n\nI think that Mr Ricks' proposition is most unreasonable, and is, I understand, made because he has had some disagreement with the Rev. Mr McDougall and thinks that he is in a position to force the Department to pay him his price. Lot 8 was patented to the Methodist Church on the 28th Nov., 1894, my Ex having been set apart by Order-in-Council for the use of Orphanage and Training School for Indian children. This Lot contains 1876 acres.\n\nIt was a mistake in the first instance placing the school where it is, with no available water supply, and the Church should have taken steps long ago to secure perpetual use of the spring.\nI think the question of price should be submitted to arbitration and if Ricks will not consent to this, steps should be taken by the Department to expropriate Lot 7, or at least the portion North of the road on which the spring is situated. I think this could be done as it is in the interest of the Government to use the spring, as the school cannot be carried on without the water supply.\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe school is short of facilities in their present form, and this additional acreage is really needed for this purpose.\nMorley Jan 22nd 1901\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nIn regard to the purchase of that portion of lot No. 7 lying north of the road and west of the McDougall building where the Orphanage gets their water from, they can have it for One thousand dollars and I will agree them to pay up in full or they may not hold me bound by any other agreement.\n\nWhen I gave notice by the Department I only had notice to have my title and so when I call for the whole of lot No. 7 of the Morley Mills Special Survey part I am only agreeing that lot No. 7 be lying north of the road and west of the McDougall Orphanage building.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOTTAWA, 25th November, 1901:\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn reply to that portion of your letter of the 8th instant which refers to the water supply for the McDougall Orphanage, I am directed to inform you that the Department has decided to purchase that portion of Lot No. 7, north of the road in the Morley Settlement now held by Mr. Hicks on which the spring from which the school obtains its supply is situated. When the purchase is completed steps will be taken to connect the school with the spring by a pipe line.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\n\nRev. A. Sutherland D.D.\nGeneral Secretary\nMethodist Missionary Society\nMethodist Mission Rooms\nToronto,\nOnt.\nSir,\n\nIn connection with previous correspondence relative to the water supply for the McDougall Orphanage I am directed by the Superintendent General to inform you that he has decided to purchase that portion of Lot No. 7, north of the road in the Morley Settlement now held by Mr. Ricks on which the spring is situated from which the school obtains its supply. You are hereby authorized to make arrangements for the purchase of this land from Mr. Ricks so that the spring may be connected by pipes with the institution. The necessary amount to complete the purchase and pay for the installation of the system will be included in this year's supplementary estimates.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nSecretary\n\nWinnipeg,\nMan.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 25th November, 1901:\n\nThe Secretary:-\n\nIn order to carry out the instructions of the Supt. General with reference to the water supply for the McDougall Orphanage I beg to say that it will be necessary to provide at least $2500.00 in the Supplementary Estimates for the purchase of the land and piping the water from the spring to the building. Mr Ricks, the owner of Lot 7 on which the spring is situated offered to sell part of the lot for $1000.00, this offer only to be good for ninety days. He may possibly want more now.\n\nYou will see from the estimates on file regarding the cost of piping it will take at least $1500.00 to put in the best quality of galvanized iron pipe.\n\nMartin Benson\nOTTAWA, 28th December, 1901:\n\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to the matter of the water supply for the McDougall Orphanage and to official letter of the 25th ultimo on this question, I beg to say that there will be sufficient funds in the current year's appropriation to pay for the purchase of the land from Mr. Ricks and it would be well to arrange for the transfer at as early a date as possible so that the necessary material for piping may also be purchased before the end of the fiscal year.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Secretary\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, M.M.\nMorley, January 18, 1902.\n\nTo The Indian Commissioner,\n\nRegarding that part of lot No.7, of the Morley Settlement north of the road, and west of the McDougall Orphanage, containing about three hundred acres, all under good fence.\n\n1st.\n\nI will exchange that part of lot No.7, for section twenty, township twenty five, range five west of the fifth meridian, or\n\n2nd.\n\nI would sell that part of lot No.7, Morley Settlement, where the McDougall Orphanage obtain their water supply north of the road for the sum of twelve hundred dollars, or\n\n3rd.\n\nI will sell the right to lay pipes to the spring, where they are at present getting their water supply, for six hundred dollars, to have the use of the water as long as the said McDougall Orphanage is used for educational purposes or under Government control, but if ever said McDougall Orphanage goes into the hands of any private individual said water supply, if leased for six hundred dollars, goes back to whom ever holds the deed to that part of lot No.7 Morley Settlement north of the road.\n\nThis agreement holds good for ninety days after the twentieth of January 1902.\n\nSigned Frank Ricks\n\n(sgd.) H. E. Sibbald Witness\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose an agreement drawn up by Mr. Ricks, in connection with lot No.7, Morley Settlement.\n\nAs you will see he makes three propositions.

McLean, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nOTTAWA, 25th February, 1902\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your telegram of the 18th instant with regard to the exchange suggested by Mr. Ricks of the part of Lot 7, Morleyville Settlement, on which is situated the spring from which the McDougall Orphanage obtains its water supply, for Section 30, Twp. 25, Rge. 5, West of the 5th Meridian, I beg to enclose herewith a copy of a letter from the Secretary of the Department of the Interior from which you will see that that Department will dispose of the South half of the said section on the same terms as the North half, provided a release can be secured from Messrs. Leeson and Scott of their leasehold of the above half section.\n\nIt would be well, therefore, for you to communicate with the lessees and ascertain whether they are willing to give up their leasehold at the expiration of the current year's term, namely the 1st August next.\n\nIt would seem to the Department that if\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg.\n\nthe Man.\nthe whole section can be acquired, Mr. Ricks should be willing to exchange all of Lot 7 for it, as that part north of the road which he offers is of no value except for the spring.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.D. McLean\nSecretary\nReference letter one hundred sixteen thousand nine hundred sixty-three, fifteenth instant. Would interior sell south half section twenty same prices as north half subject lease expiring first august.\n\nD. Laird\nTo Mr. J.

John McDougall, examined the school building and its surroundings and the spring on Lot 7 from which a supply of water is sought. In the evening I met Mr. Frank Hicks at the Agency and discussed the question of terms with him. I found he was unwilling to reduce his price of $1200 cash for the portion of Lot 7 north of the Morley Settlement road, which contains the springland that he was decidedly unwilling to exchange the whole of Lot 7 for section 20, Twp 25, Rge 5, West of the 5th Meridian, for the reason that the whole of Lot 7 has been fenced in, and there are farm buildings on the portion of the lot south of the road. He claimed that the fencing of the north division of the lot had cost him $400; as the fence is a fairly good post and wire one, I dare say the statement of cost is nearly correct. I ascertained that he was still willing to exchange the portion of Lot 7 north of the road for the above-named section; but as Mr. Leeson of Leeson & Scott was in Calgary, and I would have to see him as required.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nrequired by the Department of the Interior, to obtain a release of the leasehold of the south half of the said section.\n\nMr. Ricks made an appointment to meet at Calgary on Monday the 14th instant to consult with Mr. Leeson. The meeting took place at Calgary as appointed and we together saw Mr. Leeson. He seemed favourable, but said he would have to consult the Manager of his ranch, and others, and would write me at an early date. When I received your letter of the 25th instant yesterday, I wired and received the reply of which the following is a copy:\n\n\"Will see Ricks next week and may come to some understanding.\"\n(Sgd) L.W. Leeson.\"\n\nBefore Mr. Ricks and I parted at Calgary, I thought it well that we should come to a conditional agreement, a copy of which is placed herewith.\n\nI would suggest that the Indian Department deposit the $960.00 with the Department of the Interior, the price at $1.50 per acre asked for the whole of the said section 20; and that the Interior instruct their Agent at Calgary to grant through the Lands Title Office there to Mr. Frank Ricks a title in fee simple subject to the terms of lease of Messrs Leeson & Scott, gives a proper conveyance to the Indian Department of all of Lot 7 in Morley Settlement plan of survey, north of the road through said settlement, as it is at present fenced (containing 312 acres, more or less). Mr. Ricks says the portion of Lot 7 proposed to be exchanged is free from all encumbrances, but the Department through a lawyer or otherwise should have a proper search made before the exchange is completed.\n\nI have little doubt that Messrs Leeson & Scott will release the leasehold; but if not, Mr. Ricks is willing to take\nthe section subject to the terms of the lease, as regards its termination, therefore I do not see that the exchange of land need be delayed.\n\nAs soon as I hear from Mr. Benson I will advise you of the nature of his reply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n--COPY--\n\nCalgary, April 14 - 1908.\n\nI hereby agree to convey the fee simple of all that portion of Lot 7 in the plan of survey of the Norley Settlement, north of the present fence on the north side of the Public Highway running through said Settlement, free of all encumbrances, for the fee simple of Section 20, Township 26, Range 9, West of the 5th Meridian, as an exchange, subject to the terms of the grazing lease for the south half of said section now held by Messrs. Lessen and Scott, as soon as it can be legally terminated.\n\n(Sgd) Frank Ricka.\n\nI agree to above exchange subject to approval of Minister of the Interior.\n\n(Sgd) D. Laird,\nIndian Commissioner.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 5th May, 1902\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nRe water supply for McDougall Orphanage.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner reports that he has had an interview with Mr Ricks, the owner of Lot No.7 of the Morleyville Settlement, on which the spring supplying the school is situated, and that gentleman agrees to accept Section 20, Twp.25, Range 5 West of the 5th Meridian in exchange for a portion of his lot containing the spring, subject to the lease held by Mr Leeson and Scott of the South portion of the above named section.\n\nThe Department of the Interior has agreed to allow this Department to purchase Section 20 at the rate of $1.50 an acre and the Commissioner recommends that the money should be deposited with that Department for the purpose of effecting the exchange.\n\nMr Ricks title should be examined into by a lawyer before completing the transfer.\n\nAs this matter has been standing for some years I would suggest that the necessary steps be taken to close it out as soon as possible. You will see that the Minister ordered that this quarter-section should, if possible, be obtained.\u2014See memo.\n\n12th Nov., 1901 turned out herewith.\n\n[Signature]\nOTTAWA, 5th May, 1902\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to previous correspondence on the subject of obtaining a water supply for the McDougall Orphanage I beg to inform you that this Department is now prepared to purchase Section 20, Twp. 25, Rge. 6, west of the 6th Meridian from your Department subject to the lease of the south half of the said section to Messrs Leeson and Scott, at the price quoted by you in your letter of the 14th February last, namely $1.50 per acre.

There are funds available for the purchase.\n\nI have today seen Mr. Rothwell, the law clerk of the Department of the Interior; and he has agreed that the best way of carrying out the arrangement made will be for the Agent of the Minister of Justice at Calgary to investigate the title of Ricks to the portion of lot 7 Morley to be conveyed, and that upon a favourable report as to title and execution and registration of transfer by Frank Ricks to the King, as represented by the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, the Department of the Interior will on the request of this Department and payment, by this Department, at the rate of $1.50 per acre cause a patent to be issued to Frank Ricks as nominee of this Department for the north half of Section 18 and the north half of Section 20 both in the above Township 25, range 5, west of the 5th Meridian.\n\nI think it will be necessary to have a description showing the measurements of the lot to be conveyed by Ricks. There is on file a blue print copy of a plan of the Morleyville settlement compiled in the Department of the Interior in 1885 and 1886. If this is the plan registered...\nregistered in the Land Titles Office at Calgary a sufficient description of the land can probably be made by the surveyors of this Department.\n\nA copy of this memo can be sent to the Department of Justice for instruction of the Agent of the Minister of Justice at Calgary and also to the Department of Interior as a record of the action taken.

I enclose herewith cheque for $480.00 the price of the two half Sections and request that a patent issue as soon as possible to Mr. Hicks therefor in accordance with the arrangement referred to in my letter of 1st October last to you Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nP.

The Agent of Dominion Lands at Calgary has been advised of this payment.\n\nI am to say that the Departmental letter of the 4th ultimo contained an omission in regard to the area of these two half sections. That letter should have stated that the acreage of the two half-sections was 320 acres each. This would make a total area of 640 acres but the omission of the word \"each\" no doubt mislead you as to the amount to be paid. The total amount for 640 acres at $1.50 per acre is $960.00, and there will thus be a further sum of $480.00 payable on account of this land.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Loomis for the whole of sec. 12 Township 35 Range 6 West of Fifth Meridian if the Department wants that property. I think so.\n\n12 Township 35 Range 6 West of Fifth Meridian is open & there is no claim for homestead entry.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJames Parks\nMorley\nOttawa, June 17, 1907.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 37th ultimo and of the letter enclosed therewith from Mr. Frank Hicks relating to the proposed addition of the Southernly part of Lot 7 in the Morleyville settlement (containing 362 acres) to the lands of the McDougall Orphanage and to inform you that the matter is being considered.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.H. Oakley, Esq.,\nPrincipal\nMcDougall Orphanage,\nMorley, Alta.\nJune 6, 1907.\n\nMemorandum for\n\nDeputy Minister,\n\nThe proposition contained in the letter hereunder from the Principal of the McDougall Orphanage and from Mr. Frank Ricks simply means that the Southern part of lot No. 7 in the Morleyville settlement, containing 362 acres, be added to the McDougall Orphanage.\n\nTo carry out this proposition Mr. Ricks says he will grant the said land on condition that he receives in payment therefor Sec. 12, T. 25, R. 6, W. 5 M. (containing 640 acres)\n\nIf it should be decided to make the proposed addition to the lands of the Orphanage we will require to purchase the said Sec. 12, or otherwise obtain it from the Department of the Interior. I think before proceeding any further in this matter we should have a report stating whether the said addition is actually required for the purposes of the school, and details in connection therewith, for the consideration of the Department, and would suggest that the matter be submitted to Mr. Benson for this purpose.\n\nChief Surveyor.\nOttawa, June 14, 1907.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Oakley, Principal of the McDougall Orphanage, submits a proposition from Mr. Frank Ricks to exchange the southern part of Lot 7, Norleyville Settlement, containing 362 acres for Sec. 18, T.35, R. 6, W. of the 5th Meridian, containing 640 acres, which he says would be a very valuable addition to the school property.\n\nThe school is built on Lot 8, Norleyville Settlement, which was patented to the Methodist Church and contains 1176 acres. In addition to this the Department purchased the northern portion of Lot 7, containing 250 acres, which gives them a total area of 1426 acres, which should be ample for the school, and there does not appear to be any necessity for obtaining this additional piece of land. Farming can never be successfully carried on at this school, and they have all the land they need for stock-raising.\n\nIf the Church authorities had considered that this extra piece of land was required, they would have suggested the advisability of obtaining it when the Department was arranging for the acquisition of the water supply from Mr. Ricks some years ago. Ricks evidently thinks that the Department is an easy mark and would like to get another ranch at its expense.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin B. Brown\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 27th ult., in regard to the acquisition of the Southerly Part of Lot 7, Norleyville Settlement, for school purposes in connection with McDougall Orphanage, I beg to say that the Department considers that this institution has now all the land necessary for carrying on its farming and stock-raising operations.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.B.

Mr. Perrier for the proposed new boarding school building on the Morley Reserve has some distinctive features which will have to be considered in putting in water and sewage systems and suggesting that you could have levels taken by one of the Water Branch engineers of the Department of the Interior next time he is in the vicinity, should the Department desire you to do so.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department would like to have such a plan and you will be good enough to request the engineer who visits the locality to furnish you with one at his earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMorley, Alta.\nIN INDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE,\n\nMorley, Alta.\n\nJanuary 23rd, 1914\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter #116963/1 of the 14th inst., I have the honor to say that Mr. Ritchie, of the Water Power Branch, Dept. of the Interior, went over the ground in vicinity of the proposed school site, and gave me following levels:\n\nHeight of water above nearest site 24.5 feet.\n\" \" middle \" 19.3 \"\n\" \" furthest \" 26.4 \"\n\nThe middle site is probably the one which will be used, thus having a gravity system which will supply water to second story, but not sufficient to throw a stream on to the roof in case of fire.\n\nThere is an alternative scheme to the above which might be taken into consideration by the Dept. The C.P.R. have their pump house on bank of Bow R., quite close to above building sites, surrender for this and pipe line to Morley was given last year. I think if the Department wished to make use of this it would be possible in some way to connect up with C.P.R. system. Some time I met one of the officials of the Company I will find out if this is feasible.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nIndian Agent\nOttawa.\nFebruary 6th, 1914.\n\nDear Mr. Perrier -\n\nReferring to the proposal to erect a new boarding school building on the Morley Reserve, I have to ask you to be good enough to let the Department know whether you have made a definite decision as to your choice of location for this building.\n\nThis information is desired in connection with the provision of an adequate water supply.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. T. Perrier,\nPrincipal, Brandon Industrial School,\nBrandon, Man.\nRev. T. Ferrier\nSuperintendent of Methodist\nIndian Schools in Canada\n\nBrandon, February 11, '14.\n\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDent. Supt., Gen., Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your favor of the 6th, re the site for the new building on the Morley Reserve.\n\nYour Agent at Morley and the Rev. Mr. Steiner and myself gave considerable attention to the question of the site and we decided on the location just west of the road that leads to the bridge. The Hospital and the tents used in connection with this are on the other side of the road.\n\nThe question of a water supply for the ground floor and the basement is very easily solved. There is a beautiful spring on the high side from which it could be piped right into the building. This would give an unlimited supply for all purposes such as washing, cooking and for anything that could be accomplished on the ground floor and in the basement; and we thought that for closest purposes in the dormitories it could be pumped from the Bow River. The C.P.R. have already a pump right close by, with which they pump their water from the tank up to the stations. It might be possible to utilize this pump for a small consideration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT. Ferrier\n\nTP/JM.\nExtract\n\nIndian Agent's Office.\n\nMorley, Alta.\n7th April, 1914\n\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to letter No.116963-1 of October 25th, 1913 I have been considering whether the Department would like a sketch of probable location of new school before asking for tenders, as the site picked out by Rev. Mr. Ferrier has some distinctive features which will have to be considered in putting in water and sewage systems.\n\nIf the Department desires a plan I could have levels taken by one of the water branch engineers, Dept. of Interior, next time he is in the vicinity.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.W. Waddy,\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 27, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 7th instant I beg to say that the Department would be glad to have a sketch of the probable location of the new boarding school building on the Morley Reserve and you may have levels taken by one of the water branch engineers, Department of the Interior.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, June 2, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the water supply for the proposed Indian Boarding School at Morley which was discussed with you when in Ottawa recently, the Department would like some information as to the exact location of the proposed building and the distance to source of water supply, to enable them to complete the plans, also all information and data necessary for the building of a concrete reservoir at source of supply, with sketch plan and profile, also profile of the ground below the school for drainage purposes.\n\nIt is noted in your letter of January 23rd last, that the height of water above site is 24' 5\" 19' 3\" and 26' 4\". Please mark these points on your profile drawing.\n\nIt will be well, also, to mark on the sketch the exact positions of the old pipe line to hospital, the source of which is the proposed point from where the water will be taken for the school.\n\nI am sending you herein a blue print of the C.P.R. water supply, on which I am marking in red lines an old pipe line which apparently shows the water, from near the bridge. You might give me any information you can with respect to this.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\n\nT.W.

However as the lease gave them access to pipe line and pump house this road was not allowed them.\n\nI have marked Mr. Ferrier site and Mr. Inspector Markle site on plan. The former seems to me to be the best, but I will explain to Mr. Scott all the advantages and dis-advantages of each place, both are very desirable.\n\nThe matter of reservoir will have to be considered after the location is decided upon, as a change of site would entail a complete change of water system, one being gravity and the other force pump or ram.\n\nThe Secretary.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nJ.

Casewell of Calgary and had a complete report made. Mr. Casewell has sent his plans to the Department under separate cover, copies of which I retain in this office. Spring No.1 is the one we looked at on your visit here. The necessary head cannot be obtained by gravity from this, but I think it possible to use it.

OF INDIAN AFFAIRS.\nSEP 11 1914\nARCHITECT.\nOttawa, Sept. 14, 1914\n\nSirs,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant enclosing bill of Mr. L. G. Caswell for the Morley School waterworks and sewerage system with additional item of cost to be attached to the original estimate.\n\nIt will be necessary to provide on the plan for the disposal of the sewage other than conveying same to the Bow River and specifications are also necessary so that the work may be carried out at a later date. These should be prepared and sent into the Department as soon as possible.\n\nIt will also be necessary to render a bill in detail for the work done before this can be paid and in connection with this I have to say that while the work done is satisfactory, the account therefore, is considerably in excess of what the Department has paid for similar services in other places or expected to pay for this work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMorley, Alta.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nfor Mr. Scott.\n\nPlans, reports and approximate estimates of cost of the proposed waterworks and sewage system for the Morley Indian Boarding School have been prepared and received from Mr. L. G. Casewell, Engineer of Calgary, Alta.\n\nThe water plans recommend a supply being taken from a spring numbered 5 on his plan situated at a distance of 6000 feet South West of the proposed school site. This spring is said to be of exceptionally good water with a discharge of 135 gallons per hour or 3,240 gallons per day which is an ample supply. Reservoir proposed will hold 110,000 gallons or a full supply for five days or a limited supply for ten or fifteen days.\n\nThe supply is by gravitation with ample head and is sufficient for all domestic and school purposes as well as affording a limited hydrant supply for fire purposes.\n\nSprings Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 although considerable nearer the school site are not recommended as they are not constant.\n\nThe proposed sewage disposal system is by\nseptic tank with a gravel filter bed in second compartment\nand the discharge is disposed of by discharging into the river\nor by seepage into the subsoil.\n\nThe estimated cost of water system\nis placed at $3,407.38\nand sewage disposal at $1,285.50\nor a total of $4,692.88\n\nNo specifications have been prepared\nor sent in for this work and this should be done before the\nplans are ready to use.\n\nArchitect.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nDEPT.

If necessary, it shall be sufficiently shored or braced to prevent any caving. Evenly level off the bottom. Backfill behind tank walls, and any parts excavated below grade to be refilled with selected gravelly material watered and thoroughly rammed. If any water is encountered in excavation, the Contractor shall remove same before proceeding with the work. Under no circumstances must concrete be placed in position under water. Any rock encountered will be paid for as an extra as hereinbefore provided. If, however, a boulder less than half a cubic yard that can be removed without blasting is encountered, that shall not be classified as rock. After completion and removal of the forms, excavation to be solidly backfilled around the walls and well rammed into place.\n\nConcrete.\n2. Concrete shall be 1 : 2\u00bd : 4 mix, placed to forms and dimensions shown on the plans. The roof of the Tank shall be reinforced. If the foundation is found to be soft, the floor also shall be reinforced and the work paid for as an extra. Evenly float to a smooth finish the floor, roof and exposed walls and neatly round off corners. Build baffle wall with two pieces reinforcing steel as shown. Manholes to be formed in roof and other finished openings including inlet to tank, two outlets from first chamber, and outlet from tank, all as shown. Provide and set in place two 90 degree elbows as outlets from first chamber of Tank to second chamber. Build the wall around filtering material, carry the projection all round so that the sewage may overflow from all sides, as\nshown on the Drawings. The Concrete shall consist of cement, sand and broken stone or coarse screened gravel mixed in the proportions by measure of four parts broken stone to two and a half parts sand, and one part cement by volume. Pit run gravel, if clean and well graded, may be used. The aggregates shall be measured in proper measuring boxes, except that a sack of cement shall be considered as one cubic foot. The broken stone must be capable of passing through a two inch ring. It shall be perfectly clean. No forms must be removed until the concrete deposited has stood for thirty six hours.\n\nWhen the concrete is mixed by hand, the mixture of sand and broken stone or gravel is first to be spread in a thin layer on a timber platform, then the cement spread on the top thereof, then the cement mixed thoroughly whilst dry, after which the proper quantity of clean water is added gradually while the mass is being turned over, and mixed until the mortar thus formed covers the concrete or broken stone or gravel entirely, and until the concrete attains a proper consistency. If broken stone be used with gravel, it should be wet thoroughly and added to the wet mass during the mixing. Concrete shall be made with so much water that comparatively light tamping will be required to cause the mortar to fill all the interstices of the stone. Immediately after mixing, the concrete shall be conveyed to place in such manner that there shall be no separation of the different ingredients. It shall be rammed or tamped thoroughly in layers not exceeding twelve inches in thickness, and otherwise agitated by suitable tools so as to produce a thoroughly compact concrete of maximum density, and so that all interstices are filled; and so that the concrete presents a smooth, finished, unbroken mortar surface without exposed stones when the forms are removed, whether the exterior of the mass be mortar alone or concrete. Should any concrete receive its initial set before being placed, it shall be rejected and removed. Should, during construction,\nany surface of concrete be allowed to harden or dry before\nthe other concrete is placed thereon, it shall be swept\nperfectly clean with brooms, then wetted thoroughly with\nclean water, and covered with a thin layer of one to one grout,\nso as to make a perfect contact between the old and the new\nwork, and thus ensure that the mass will be truly monolithic.\nThe forming of such dry surfaces shall always be prevented\nif practicable. If the walls are stepped below their finished\nheight, a two by four check shall be made in the center of\nthe wall as a key for the next layer, and a similar check in\nfloors underneath the centre of walls. All concrete should\nbe kept damp until thoroughly set by drenching it, or the\nforms containing it, twice a day. If, notwithstanding extreme\ncare in placing and ramming the concrete, imperfections are\nfound when the forms are removed, such imperfections to be\nfloated over with mortar composed of one part Portland Cement,\nand two parts sand, but no plastering of any kind will be\npermitted.

McLean Esq.,\nActing Deputy Supt: General of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nSir,\n\nWater Supply.\n\nActing under instructions, I left Calgary on July 25th for the purpose of making a Survey and collecting data with which to formulate a scheme for Water Supply and Sewerage Disposal in connection with the new boarding school, Morley.\n\nLOCATION.\n\nThe School is to be built on a site approved by the Deputy Minister of Indian Affairs, 1500 feet West of the Indian Agency Headquarters, and 1100 feet South West of the Steel Bridge carrying the main automobile road from East to West over the Bow River.\n\nThis is an ideal location.\n\nFORMATION.\n\nThe formation is of gravel, sandstone and blue shale outcrop.\n\nDRAINAGE.\n\nThe drainage is natural, any storm water is readily absorbed by the gravel, and the School will be built on rising table land.\n\nSOURCES OF SUPPLY.\n\nThere are five Springs in the vicinity, as shown on the Plan.\nNo.1, and the Bow River traverses East and West at a distance of 1000 feet North of the School.\n\nSprings Nos' 1, 2, 3 & 4, are inadequate in their supply. With the exception of Spring No.1, they dry up at intervals during the summer, or seep away through the gravelly formation.\n\nThe necessary amount of 'head' could not be acquired by adopting these Springs. A pumping engine would have to be used, and the supply of water would be insufficient, taking into consideration that sixty per cent goes to waste and cannot be re-used, to warrant the use of a hydraulic ram.\n\nThis Spring is a frequent halting place for Indians. Many call to drink and water their horses.\n\nSPRING NO. 5:\n\nThis is a large Spring, situated 6000 feet Southwest of the School Site, to which I have run a line as shown on the Plan. The Chief of the Bearpaw Tribe of Indians on this Reserve states that it has never been known to fail for 18 years, that it is the best drinking water the Indians are acquainted with, and that the Indians themselves would favour this Spring being utilised as the School supply.\n\nI have computed the discharge, and find it to be 135 gallons per hour, or 3,240 gallons per day of 24 hours, which is more than ample.\n\nThe water forms a creek which discharges into the pond as shown on Plan No.1. This pond is generally about two feet deep, and the water finds its drainage through the gravel below.\n\nI consider that this Spring should be utilised as the Source\nof Supply.\n\nRESERVOIR AND DAM.\n\nI suggest, therefore, that an earthen dam and reservoir be constructed below the Spring as shown on the Plan No.1, details on Drawings Nos' 4, 5 & 6. The reservoir to hold 110,000 gallons, or five days supply.\n\nPIPE LINE.\n\nA two inch pipe line is laid from the intake, having a screen at the end, and tilted on a pile of stones as shown, to prevent silt or obstructive matter entering the pipe.\n\nAt the point \"A\" on the plan, or pipe line, the pipe is reduced to $1\\frac{1}{2}$ inches to ensure it running full, and as a considerable amount of pressure or velocity, due to gravity, is obtained from here on, this pipe will do its work well.\n\nOUTLET & DISCHARGE.\n\nAssuming an elevation of 4043 feet to be well within the upper story of the School building, by the use of the formulae given on Drawing No.3, (Water Supply Chart), we have a discharge of 12 gallons per minute at this point.\n\nThis gives a satisfactory supply through all taps or openings within the building.\n\nIf it is desired to fix Fire Hydrants around the building there will also be a good supply, with the necessary amount of pressure for use in case of fire.\nSEWERAGE DISPOSAL.\n\nSEWER PIPE & SEPTIC TANK.\n\nThe disposal of sewage and other wastes can be suitably conducted by means of a six inch C.I. sewer pipe to a Septic Tank of the design shown on drawings 7, 8 & 9.\n\nIt is proposed to locate this Tank under a depth of eight feet of earth as a guard against frost, with two manholes from the surface down, and a concrete manhole at a distance of 400 feet from the point of commencement as shown on the Profile.\n\nDETAILS OF TANK & TREATMENT.\n\nThe sewage can be made to enter the settling chamber at a grade of 2.0%, which gives a satisfactory velocity into the tank. With this grade the pipe will be self cleansing and will not require flushing.\n\nThe sewage passes under a \"baffle wall\" before flowing into a second settling pocket in which it comes in contact with air and water before overflowing on to the gravel filter. The baffle wall, and the positions of the two outlets from the first chamber in relation to its inlet, ensures, when in action, a slow and steady movement of the sewage during preliminary sedimentation, and prevents splashing.\n\nThe air is excluded from this chamber when in action. Some of the industrious bacteria must live in water with a minimum amount of air, and have quiet surroundings.\n\nThe sewage now enters the second chamber with a lake-pocket for the further pleasure of the anaerobic or sea-going bugs before overflowing on the screened gravel filter.\n\nA continual supply of fresh air enters and leaves this chamber.\nthrough the vents as shown in sectional elevation, Drawing No.8. The fresh air, and water contained in the above mentioned pocket, supplies the necessary aerobic bacteria.\n\nWhen the now partly purified sewage has risen 4 feet, it runs around the concrete four inch projection shown on plan and in section, which is designed to enable the sewage to overflow on to the filter from all sides.\n\nOUTLET AND DISPOSAL.\n\nAfter filtration through a bed of four feet of screened gravel, the sewage runs through the six inch outlet at a grade of .10% and discharges into the trenches, where it seeps away through the gravel.\n\nALTERNATIVE.\n\nAn alternative method would be to build a Cesspool of brick set in cement mortar with open joints. As, however, the use of trenches enables the liquid to be actually seen and better investigated should any defect appear throughout the system, and it cannot be definitely assumed, at present, that the nature of the sub-soil, at that depth, would facilitate a filtering disposal of the liquid, I have in the present case projected a series of trenches on the Plan for this purpose.\n\nSLUDGE BED.\n\nThe sludge from the Tank is emptied through the manholes on the Sludge Bed where shown on the Plan, and the amount is not great. From one to two cubic yards per million gallons of sewage\nL.G. CASEWELL, C.E.\nRoom 103\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nOct. 7th 1914.\n\nREPORT ON\n\nJ.W.

Of course it is understood in doing so that the interests of our educational work at Morley shall stand on its own merits and that this sale of the ranch will in no way prejudice our educational interests in Southern Alberta.

There is also a building that has been used for class room purposes. The other outbuildings are not of much value. This land is owned by the Government. There is also a section and three-quarters of land in connection with the Red Deer Institute. We proposed that both of these properties should be sold and that the Methodist Church should receive credit for the same and the proceeds be put into the new plant at Edmonton. Mr. Scott assured us that this would have to meet the approval of Parliament but that he would strongly recommend that this be done.\n(Copy)\n\nJohn J.

Roland Winter (L.S.)\nRegistrar\nSouth Alberta Land Registration District\nMemo.\n\nThe Deputy Minister,\n\nIn regard to the question of disposition of the McDougall Orphanage property at Morley, I beg to submit the following statement in connection therewith.\n\nOn the 28th of November, 1894, Letters Patent were issued by the Department of the Interior to the Methodist Church its successors and assigns, for all that parcel of land situate, lying and being in the Morleyville settlement, in the district of Alberta, composed of lot No. 8, as shown on plan of survey of the said settlement, dated the 11th of January, 1892, on the condition that the Methodist Church, its successors and assigns, should hold the land so long as the same should, except in case of the consent of the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs expressly given in writing to the use thereof or of any portion thereof for other purposes, be used for the purposes of an orphanage and training school for Indian children, and for no other purpose or purposes whatsoever.\n\nOn the 7th day of November, 1902, a Certificate of Title issued out of the Land Registration District for southern Alberta, to His Majesty King Edward the Seventh, for that portion of lot 7 in the settlement of Morleyville which lies to the north and west of a certain surveyed trail through said lot called the Calgary and Morley trail, as shown on plan of the said settlement. This land was paid for\nfor out of school vote, under an exchange arranged with the Department of the Interior.\n\nOn the 5th of September, 1919, File 24833, Rev. Mr. Perrier was advised that Mr. Wellman had forwarded the rental for this property for next year, and that the same had been accepted. It was also stated that consideration of disposition of the property could not definitely be undertaken until it was decided what was to be done, and that in any event, Mr. Wellman would be protected during the year.\n\nOn the 30th of November, 1919, Mr. F. Fletcher, Secretary-Treasurer of the Morley School District, was advised that the Department would have no objection to the Morley School District using the old school-house known as the McDougall Orphanage property, free of charge, the arrangement, however, to be subject to the land being sold at any time, File 116,963/1.\n\nIn view of the tenure of the above land, it does not appear that this Department would be in a position to give a grant thereof in case of sale. Even if a release were obtained from the Methodist Church, it would appear that the Grant should issue from the Interior Department, as the property could not be considered as Indian lands.\n\nAttached hereto is a plan showing the properties in question, also copy of Certificate of Title and of Letters Patent referred to.\n\nOfficer in Charge.\nOttawa, December 23, 1919.\n\nHis Excellency\n\nThe Governor General in Council,\n\nThe undersigned begs to report that, for the purposes of an orphanage and training school for Indian children, letters patent were issued by the Department of the Interior on the 25th day of November, 1894, to the Methodist Church, covering lot No.6 in the Morleyville Settlement, in the provisional district of Alberta, in the North-West Territories, the description of the property and the conditions on which the letters patent were issued being as follows:\u2014\n\nNow know ye that by these presents we do grant, convey and assure unto the said The Methodist Church, its successors and assigns, all and singular that parcel or tract of land, situate, lying and being in the Morleyville Settlement, in the provisional district of Alberta, in the North-West Territories, in our Dominion of Canada, and being composed of lot No.6, at the Morleyville Settlement aforesaid, as shown upon a map or plan of survey of the said settlement, dated at Ottawa, the eleventh day of January, A.D.1892, approved and confirmed by Edward Deville, Surveyor-General of Dominion Lands, and of record in the Department of the Interior, containing by measurement eleven hundred and seventy-six acres, more or less; saving and reserving, nevertheless, unto us, our successors and assigns, the free use, passage and enjoyment of, in, over and upon all navigable waters that now are or may be hereafter found on or under or flowing through or upon any part of the said parcel or tract of land; and also reserving therewith and therefrom all rights of fishery and fishing, and occupation in connection therewith, upon, around and adjacent to said\nsaid lands, and also the privilege of landing from and mooring\nboats and vessels upon any part of the said lands, and using the\nsaid lands in connection with the rights of fishery and fishing\nhereby reserved, so far as may be reasonably necessary to the\nexercise of such rights, also excepting and reserving thereout the\npublic surveyed road one chain in width crossing the same.\n\n\"To have and to hold the said parcel or tract of land unto\nthe said The Methodist Church, its successors and assigns, so long\nas the same shall, except in case of the consent of our Super-\nintendent General of Indian Affairs expressly given in writing, to\nthe use thereof, or of any portion thereof, for other purposes,\nbe used for the purposes of an orphanage and training school for\nIndian children, and for no other purpose or purpose whatsoever.\"\n\nIn addition to the above mentioned 1176 acres, and for\nthe same purposes, the Department of Indian Affairs acquired from\nFrank Hicks that portion - containing 262 acres - of lot No.7 in the\nNorleyville Settlement, which lies to the north and west of a certain\nsurveyed trail through said lot 7 called the Galway and Norley\ntrail, and covering which said portion of lot 7 the Department of\nIndian Affairs holds certificate of title from the South Alberta\nLand Registration District to His Majesty King Edward VII, in ex-\nchange for which portion of lot 7 Mr. Hicks was given by the Depart-\nment of the Interior the north half of lot 18 and the north half of\nlot 20, township 25, range 5, west of the fifth meridian, for which\nthe Department of the Interior was paid by the Department of Indian\nAffairs the sum of $960.00 from the Parliamentary Appropriation for\nIndian Education.\n\nIn view of the fact that the said lot 8 and portion of\nlot 7 above referred to are no longer used for the purposes of an\norphanage and training school for Indian children, the undersigned\nwould recommend that the same be herewith relinquished by the\nDepartment of Indian Affairs to the Department of the Interior.\n\n[Signature]\n\nS.

The title of the lot is in His Majesty The King - not in the right of the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa, December 30, 1919.\nThe Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a report, dated 23rd December, 1919, from the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, submitting that, for the purposes of an orphanage and training school for Indian children, letters patent were issued by the Department of the Interior on the 28th day of November, 1894, to the Methodist Church, covering lot No.8 in the Morleyville Settlement, in the provisional district of Alberta, in the Northwest Territories, the description of the property and the conditions on which the letters patent were issued being as follows:\n\n\"Know ye that by these presents we do grant, convey and assure unto the said The Methodist Church, its successors and assigns, all and singular that parcel or tract of land, situate, lying and being in the Morleyville Settlement, in the provisional district of Alberta, in the North-West Territories, in Our Dominion of Canada, and being composed of lot No.8, at the Morleyville Settlement aforesaid, as shown upon a map or plan of survey of the said settlement, dated at Ottawa, the eleventh day of January, A.D.1892, approved and confirmed by Edmond Deville, Surveyor-General of Dominion Lands, and of record in the Department of the Interior, containing by admeasurement eleven hundred and seventy-six acres, more or less; saving and reserving, nevertheless, unto us, our successors and assigns, the free use, passage and enjoyment of, in, over and upon all navigable waters that now are or may be hereafter found on or under or flowing through or over any part of the said parcel or tract of land; and also reserving throughout and therefrom all rights of fishery and fishing, and occupation in connection therewith, upon, around and adjacent to said lands, and also the privilege of landing from and mooring boats and vessels upon any part of the said lands, and using the said lands...\"\n\nThe Honourable\nThe Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nlands in connection with the rights of fishery and fishing hereby reserved, so far as may be reasonably necessary to the exercise of such rights, also excepting and reserving thereout the public surveyed road one chain in width crossing the same.\n\nTO HAVE AND TO HOLD the said parcel or tract of land unto the said Methodist Church, its successors and assigns, so long as the same shall, except in the case of the consent of our Superintendent General of Indian Affairs expressly given in writing, to the use thereof, or of any portion thereof, for other purposes, be used for the purposes of an orphanage and training school for Indian children, and for no other purpose or purposes whatsoever.\n\nThe Minister observes that in addition to the above mentioned 1176 acres, and for the same purposes, the Department of Indian Affairs acquired from Frank Ricks that portion, containing 262 acres, of Lot No. 7 in the Morleyville Settlement, which lies to the north and west of a certain surveyed trail through said lot 7 called the Calgary and Morley trail, and covering which said portion of lot 7 the Department of Indian Affairs holds certificate of title from the South Alberta Land Registration District to His Majesty King Edward VII; in exchange for which portion of Lot 7 Mr. Ricks was given by the Department of the Interior the north half of lot 18 and the north half of lot 20, township 25, range 5, west of the fifth meridian, for which the Department of the Interior was paid by the Department of Indian Affairs the sum of $960 from the Parliamentary Appropriation for Indian Education.\n\nIn view of the fact that the said lot 8 and portion of lot 7 above referred to are no longer used for the purposes of an orphanage and training school for Indian Children, the Minister recommends that the same be herewith relinquished by the Department of Indian Affairs to the Department of the Interior.\n\nThe Committee concur in the foregoing recommendation, and submit the same for approval.\n\n[Signature]\nClerk of the Privy Council.\nOttawa, January 21, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to Order in Council of the 14th instant relinquishing, by the Department of Indian Affairs to the Department of the Interior, the lands set apart by letters patent, which were issued by your Department on the 28th of November, 1894, to the Methodist Church, covering Lot No. 8 in the Morleyville settlement, Alberta, for the purposes of an orphanage and training school for Indian children, and part of Lot No. 7 also in the Morleyville settlement, I beg to inform you that F.

Hunter of 224 8th Avenue West, Calgary, who carried on a real estate and insurance business at that place. Mr. Hunter was for some years employed in the office of the Rocky Mountain Park at Banff and was later for a short time Superintendent of the Yoho Park at Field. He asks whether there is any way in which he could obtain the privilege of disposing of the old McDougald Orphanage, which he states comprised some 1500 acres of land north of the C. P. R. and east of Morley Station. He states that this property has not been used by the Indian Department for several years but has been leased to ranchers in that district, and if there is any intention of disposing of the property he would like to have an opportunity of handling the business and trying to negotiate a sale, of course I suppose on the usual terms on which real estate men handle business of this kind. Mr. Hunter is a man of good character and considerable energy and ability and I am satisfied that he could be depended on to handle honestly and satisfactorily any business that might be given to him. I would be much obliged if you would let me know whether there is any possibility of his being considered in connection with a transaction such as he refers to.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. G.

This is not the orphanage building proper but is situated a short distance behind the main building. Some time ago permission was given to the school section to hold classes there. It appears that this is not the wish of the inspector nor the Department of Education. I will give you a quotation from a letter received today:\n\n\"This has been a matter of embarrassment and annoyance to the school inspector and to the Department of Education, who are of the opinion that the school is being held in a much better place. The inspector told me he would feel much relieved if he should hear that the building had been sold for old lumber.\n\nWe have an offer of $150.00 for the building. The man would move it off and use it as a stable. I do not know whether the Church or the Government furnished the money to build this building. The orphanage building was built by the Church. I presume that the Church put up the money for the other building, but of this I am not sure. I think it better to sell the building and the money can be placed where it belongs. I would like your advice on the matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndustrial School, Brandon.\n\nTV/GF\nMemo.\n\nMr. [signature]\n\nIn order to complete the transfer of the title of Lot 8, as referred to in Mr. Cote's letter of the 5th ultimo, hereunder, to the Department of the Interior it will be necessary to secure from the Methodist Church a conveyance of the said lot to His Majesty King George V., in the right of Canada.

This Department does not require the Certificate of Title issued to the Methodist Church which, as Mr. Orr points out, is not in the possession of your Department. What is required is Certificate of Title vesting this lot in His Majesty in the Right of Canada. It is thought that your Department would scarcely have taken the action which it did in relinquishing this land to this Department by Order in Council unless title thereto had previously been vested in His Majesty.\n\nI beg to request that you be good enough to let this Department have a reply in this matter at as early a date as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

If you concur in this view and transmit Reverend Mr. Ferrier's letter to this Department the matter will be given prompt attention.\n\nI may say that the Morleyville School District No. 172 was given permission in August last to temporarily utilize the McDougall Orphanage School House on lot 8, together with three acres of land immediately surrounding the building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.A.

A.G.

Since this Duplicate Certificate of Title was deposited in the Public Archives by your Department it is thought that were you to explain to Dr. Doughty the nature of this document as well as the circumstances under which it was transferred to the Archives he would see the necessity of releasing the same to this Department. As you are aware this Certificate of Title is not an historic document but rather a document of a negotiable character.\n\nPlease refer in this connection to Mr. Orr's letter addressed to me bearing date the 14th July, 1920, file 116963.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[N.O.

McLean, Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nFebruary 7th, 1920.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to your inquiry over the telephone yesterday regarding lands on the Stony Reserve formerly utilized in connection with the Dougall Orphanage, an institution for the training of Indian children, I beg to say that when this school was closed the land in connection therewith reverted to the Department of the Interior from which it was originally obtained. This action was taken by Order in Council of January 14th, 1920. The land consists of lot No. 8 in the Morleyville settlement, and a portion of lot No. 7, containing 262 acres.\n\nI would suggest, therefore, that if you wish to make further inquiry you communicate with Mr. W. W. Cory, Deputy Minister of the Interior.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nR. Irvine, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 14, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your No. 409-11A of the 6th instant, with reference to the proposed buildings for a residential school at Morley. I note that you will prepare a rough sketch and forward it to the Department in due course. With reference to the water supply, I have to inform you that the Department had Mr. L. C. Caswell, C.E., of 33 Lineham Block, Calgary, make a report in 1914. He found four springs marked with a red dot on the enclosed plan\u2014which were quite close to the site that was proposed for the new buildings at that time. Concerning these four springs, the engineer reports in part as follows: \"They are inadequate in their supply, with one exception. They dry up at intervals during the summer or seep away through the gravelly formation. The necessary amount of 'head' could not be acquired by adopting these springs. A pumping engine would have to be used and the supply of water would be insufficient, taking into consideration that sixty per cent goes to waste and cannot be re-used, to warrant the use of a hydraulic ram.\"\n\nThe engineer refers to three of these four springs as having a flow of 135, 115 and 32 gallons per hour at certain seasons. I believe the site to which he refers is one selected by Mr. Inspector Markle in 1914, which is a few hundred feet distant and considerably higher than one suggested by Rev. T. Perrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian schools and hospitals.\n\nThe engineer reports at some length concerning the feasibility of securing a water supply from a large spring situated 6000 feet southwest of the proposed site and marked with a red cross on the enclosure. This spring apparently has excellent water and at that time had a flow of 135 per hour. The engineer recommended that this spring be utilized.\nbe utilized for the school and that a reservoir and dam be built and a pipe-line laid. The cost of this scheme was estimated at approximately $3400. The engineer drew plans in this connection and also prepared specifications for a sewerage disposal system the cost of which was estimated to be $1285.50.\n\nAs it was decided in August 1914 not to proceed with the erection of a school, no further action was taken in connection with the water supply or disposal systems.\n\nI wish to add that there is a possibility of securing a supply of water from the C. P. R., who own and operate, I believe, a pump at the Bow River and have a large tank at Morley station. It might be advisable in the interest of economy to approach the railway company with a view to having them supply the water for the proposed new residential school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Since then this land has been leased to another, but I believe the lease expires in about a year.\n\nWe are now needing it for pasture in connection with the Morley Indian Residential School. The land in question is known as \"Lots 7 and 8, Morleyville Settlement, Morley, P.C., Alberta.\" You will remember we discussed this matter in the Land Office Department when I was in Ottawa a short time ago.

Lot 8 and a portion of lot 7 were formerly used for pasture by the McDougall Orphanage but were relinquished by the Department of Indian Affairs to the Department of the Interior in January 1920, when the land was no longer required for school purposes. Please let me have a recommendation concerning this request.\n\nI find that our file is incomplete with reference to the land that has been set aside for the use of the Morley Indian Residential School.

There are four horses and eight cows at the school and they have about 110 acres of pasture fenced around the buildings, four acres loaned by this office opposite the Agency and east of the bridge at Morley, about 100 acres east of that again (Mission property), and about 80 acres (Mission property) north of the Banff trail at east end of reserve, so I think that they have plenty of pasture for the stock carried.\n\nThey may want it for some other purpose, but it is too far away from the school for a pasture.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Asst.

Mr. Gibson has advised that if the files are forwarded to Edmonton he intends to retain all papers subsequent to the transfer of the natural resources but has asked whether we have any objection to turning over the files to Edmonton.\n\nAs you will note, various lands in the Morleyville Settlement passed to the Province of Alberta on the transfer of the natural resources but two lots Nos. 7 and 8 have been claimed by this Department to have not passed with the others and there is considerable correspondence on file with regard to the status of these lots. A great deal of the correspondence with reference to Lots 7 and 8 is subsequent to the transfer of the natural resources and will, therefore, not be forwarded to Edmonton but we are concerned whether there is anything on these files prior to the transfer aforesaid which might prejudice our claim to these lots or to any other rights the Department might have in the Morleyville Settlement and before answering Mr. Gibson's enquiry it is thought advisable that you should peruse the files with a view to advising us whether there is any objection to the correspondence prior to the date of transfer being forwarded to Edmonton and if there is objection what papers should be removed from the files before transfer is made.\n\nEncls.\n\nFor D.J.

Minerals were included in this patent. This lot was retransferred for which we now hold Certificate of Title 32756. In this retransfer Ricks turned back to the Crown everything he got under the patent of the 7th June, 1900.\n\nLot 8, Morleyville Settlement, patented from the Crown (Dominion) to the Methodist Church on the 26th day of November, 1894. Minerals were included. Methodist Church transferred back to Crown (Dominion). There was no reservation in this transfer as to minerals, therefore, they are now back in the Crown - see Certificate of Title from Methodist Church to Crown (Dominion) 32722, 1925.\n\nA copy of this memorandum is being sent direct to Mr. Gibson for his information.\n\nAppended hereto is copy of a letter which might be retained in your records. This is a memorandum, dated the 5th December, 1929. It will be noted that the statement is contained therein that part of lot 7 and lot 8, Morleyville Settlement are administered under the provisions of the Public Lands Act ......... and are not properties that will go to the Province of Alberta with the Natural Resources.

These two lots are held by the Crown (Dominion) by virtue of duplicate Certificates of Title Nos. 32V58 and 32V72 respectively. These Certificates were obtained from your records for examination and are returned herewith. The lots in question, by reason of the fact that the Crown had title by Certificate of Title prior to the transfer to the Province of Alberta of its Natural Resources, pursuant to the Alberta Natural Resources Agreement Act, were retained by the Dominion by virtue of Section 18 thereof which, in part, reads as follows:\n\n\"Except as herein otherwise expressly provided, nothing in this agreement shall be interpreted as applying so as to affect or transfer to the administration of the Province (a) any lands for which Crown grants have been made and registered under the Land Titles Act of the Province and of which His Majesty the King in the right of His Dominion of Canada is, or is entitled to become the registered owner at the date upon which the agreement comes into force\".\n\nIn my study of the files it was deemed advisable to determine the ownership of the minerals in these said lots and I am to advise you that the minerals underlying these lands are in the Crown (Dominion).\nOTTAWA, March 26th, 1947.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Director\nLands, Parks and Forests Branch\n\nI have for acknowledgment your memoranda of March 5th and March 10th with reference to lots in Worleyville Settlement.\n\nThe correspondence on the three volumes of your file No. 64274 and the two volumes of file No. 156236 has been reviewed and provided all papers subsequent to the transfer of the natural resources are removed and retained in your Branch I can see no objection to the aforesaid files being forwarded to the Department of Lands and Mines, Edmonton, Alberta.\n\nI am returning under separate cover the five files above mentioned.\n\nDirector\nALBERTA\nDEPARTMENT OF LANDS AND FORESTS\n\nEdmonton,\nSeptember 30th, 1949.\n\nDear Dr. Keenleyside:\n\nWhen I was in Ottawa it was my intention to discuss with you the ownership of Lot 7, Morleyville Settlement, north of the roadway and the whole of Lot 8 in the same settlement.\n\nBy reason of the fact that this property was held under Certificate of Title it was retained by Canada upon the transfer of the natural resources. However, from the information we have we are of the opinion that the property should belong to the Province.\n\nUpon a perusal of the records you will find that when acquiring the part of Lot 7 the consideration was the granting of patent to Frank Ricks for the North half of Section 18 and the North half of Section 20, Township 25, Range 5, West of the 5th Meridian and the sum of $1.00. Furthermore, that Lot 8 had been transferred to the Methodist Church with the usual habendum clause that upon the lands ceasing to be used for the express purpose for which they were granted, namely for the purpose of an orphanage and training school for Indian children, that title would again become vested in the Crown. The land having ceased to be used or required by the Methodist Church it was transferred back to the Crown on the 14th of October, 1920, the consideration being the sum of $1.00.\n\nAt no time does it seem that the Indians were in any way entitled to these lands under the terms of treaty.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Signed) J. Harvie,\nDeputy Minister.\n\nDr. H.L. Keenleyside,\nDeputy Minister,\nDepartment of Natural Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nPlease return to Indian Affairs Branch when signed.\n\nOttawa, 19 October, 1949\n\nJ. Harvie, Esq.,\nDeputy Minister,\nDepartment of Lands & Forests,\nEdmonton, Alta.\n\nDear Mr. Harvie:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of 30th September with regard to Lot 7, Morleyville Settlement, north of the highway, and that portion of Lot 8 in the same settlement lying north of the severance line, and I regret that I am unable to agree with your contention that the properties should belong to the Province of Alberta.\n\nYou point out that the said Lots which originally had been transferred to the Methodist Church, were re-transferred to the Crown on 14th October, 1929, on the grounds that they were no longer required by the Church, but you are apparently not aware that in 1928 the authorities of the Morley Indian Residential School applied to the Department of the Interior to have the Lots made available to the said school for pasturage purposes. Such request would, in the ordinary course of events, have been granted; but at the time it was made, no action could be taken for the Lots had been leased for a term of years expiring in 1934, and were therefore not available to the residential school. However, following the expiration of the said lease, the 1928 application was again brought forward, and as the Lots were considered necessary to the operation of the residential school, they were reserved for the Indian Affairs Branch for the purposes of the said school, and have continued to be used by the school to this date. As you are undoubtedly aware, the Morley Indian Residential School, while operated by the United Church of Canada, is subsidized by the Government of Canada.\nWhile it is probable that at some future date the Lots in question will cease to be used for the purposes of the said school, I do not see that this would in any way alter the fact that as at the date of the transfer of the natural resources, the Lots were in an exempted class, and in any event, when the use of the Lots by the school comes to an end, it is our intention to add the Lots to the Stony Indian Reserve where they are urgently needed to provide additional grazing and agricultural land for that group of the Stony Band living north of the Bow River.\n\nUnder the circumstances above mentioned, I regret that it is impossible for us to recognize your claim that the Lots passed to the Province of Alberta under the terms of the Natural Resources Agreement.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH.

I would point out that, when the children are at their homes, they are under the care of their parents or guardians and they must accept responsibility for the children's care and conduct while under their charge.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

While her mother does the best a woman can for her, she will be better fed and clothed in the school, and when she becomes old enough to go to the Class room, she will learn to write.

Barr Murray, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nMorley, Alta.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE\nPB CALGARY, ALTA., March 23rd, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to bring to your attention that while at Morley inspecting that Agency the matter of children attending the school came up. I have known of a great many cases where Indian children were attending school and they would be much better left out of school on account of ill health; and I have often noticed that although the general surroundings and the food were better in school, when they were allowed to go back home they would pick up in a few months. The question came up that if the Doctor finds that a child is not doing well in school, and as Medical Officer he is of the opinion that by bringing it home and getting it out into the fresh air it would do better, has he the authority to discharge the child, or would this have to be taken up with the Department? I was not sure on this point.\n\nI have known medical men to give instructions to discharge certain children. This, of course, would only come up once in awhile. There are three girls at the Morley School at present who are T.B. bed patients and in my opinion they would do much better at home; At least no worse, as I do not suppose any of the three will live. I shall be glad to be advised on this question.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, April 2, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your 409-11B of the 23rd ultimo, I beg to say that, if the medical officer reports to the Indian Agent or yourself that the physical condition of a child in a residential school is a menace to the health of the other pupils, the Department considers that discharge should be immediately granted. Of course, in all such cases, the Department should be advised at once of the reasons why the pupil has been sent home.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nM.
