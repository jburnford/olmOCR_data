The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1945.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated January 22, 1946.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Shuswap Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 1st 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Shuswap Indian Res.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated July 20, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRequ.

$[Blank]\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Shubenacadie Indian School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1926.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Oct 10, 1926\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated Oct 10, 1926\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5.

The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Shubenacadie Indian Res. School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**REPORT of the Indian Residential School at Shubenacadie on November 8th, Reserve for Quarter ended December 31st, 1946**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE, DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|----------------|-----|-----|-----|----------------|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 153             | Steven Peter M.| 15  |     |     |                 |                    |                        | Sept. 24/36              | 92         |                                                                                                                  |\n| 160             | Minnie Anna    | 13  |     |     |                 |                    |                        | Sept. 1/37               | 92         |                                                                                                                  |\n| 178             | McLeod Russell | 15  |     |     |                 |                    |                        | Nov. 3/38                | 92         |                                                                                                                  |\n| 179             | Julian Peter   | 15  |     |     |                 |                    |                        | Nov. 7/38                | 92         |                                                                                                                  |\n| 188             | Labo James     | 12  |     |     |                 |                    |                        | Aug 3/39                 | 92         |                                                                                                                  |\n| 193             | Peters Leo     | 15  |     |     |                 |                    |                        | Sept. 1/39               | 92         |                                                                                                                  |\n| 194             | Thomas John L. | 12  |     |     |                 |                    |                        | Sept. 1/39               | -          | Dec.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1947.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: March 31, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Shubenacadie N.S.\n\nthis 31st March, 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Shubenacadie Indian Res.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On the Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated July 7, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Shubenacadie, N.S., this 9th July, 1947.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, any payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated July 12, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Shubenacadie this 12th July 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Shubenacadie Indian School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1947.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: October 25, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated: October 25, 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 22, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated October 22, 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days' residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1947.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: October 22, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Shubenacadie this 10th Oct., 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended December 31st 1947.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: December 31st 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Shubenacadie Indian School for the Quarter ended December 31st 1947.\n\nPrincipal: J.M.

quarter:**\n\n**AMOUNT of per capita grant due for Quarter:** $\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1947.\n\nPrincipal: J.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the total number of days in quarter.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended September 30th 1948.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: 9th October 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

(RG 10, Volume 665h, file 2-5-2, part 1)**\n\n**PUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA**\n\n**POOR COPY**\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 9th, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated October 9th, 1946\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n##

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When going to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Schoolname End Res.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Buhlerwahde Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31st, 1949.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: April 1st, 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nR. 3444\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Agency**\n\n**REPORT of the Shubenacadie Ind.

This should read $107.26, a difference of $2.18.\n\nThe trouble was, that, when issuing the cheque we deducted the $2.18 but when we entered it in the book, we took the figure on the invoice. To make matters worse, this cheque was not returned to the Bank on the morning of March 31st. When we got the Bank Book on May 1st, this item shows as on March 31st.\n\nThis item was for house equipment, so to keep matters straight we have deducted the $2.18 from equipment costs, and then from the totals, all the way through to the end of March. The Bank Statement attached to the Quarterly Report will show that the Bank Balance on March 31st was $4991.18. Deducting cheque No. 332 for $107.26 and cheque No. 337 for $20.61, will give true balance of $4863.31.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is noted that under the heading \"Expenditures\" the items of clothing, food, fuel, house equipment and farm and garden, show a substantial increase from the year 1943-44.\n\nWhile the financial condition of the Shubenacadie School at the present time is satisfactory, I would like to have an explanation of the reason for the increase in the items just mentioned.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

We remark, however, that the total for the two years of 1943-44 and 1944-45 combined, is over a Thousand Dollars less than the total for the two previous years.\n\nOn FUEL it was necessary for us to import Hard American Coal last year, instead of the usual Welsh hard coal that we had heretofore used. The increased cost per ton, plus the freight and duty, made that much higher.\n\nGenerally, while there was a large increase for one year on House Equipment and Farm, the total for the two years is practically the same as the total for the two previous years.\n\nThe purchase of an Electrical bread and meat cutter, or slicer, at $310.00 was a necessary and most useful unit added to the kitchen efficiency.\n\nNo Canadian household has escaped increased costs during war years and we cannot hope to do better here.\n\nWe trust that we have explained matters to your satisfaction, and if there are any further details you wish, please let us know, and we shall gladly send them.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nREVEREND J.M.

We are sorry for the delay in answering, but for the past month, we were quite busy with the pump situation.\n\nIn reply to your inquiry as to the cause of increased expenditures for 1944-45, over preceding years, May I submit the following table of costs for the last four years.\n\n|        | CLOTHING | FOOD     | FUEL, Etc. | EQUIPMENT | FARM    |\n|--------|----------|----------|------------|-----------|---------|\n| 1941-42| $360.68  | $477.92  | $764.29    | $205.32   | $791.80 |\n| 1942-43| $229.94  | $116.03  | $322.38    | $162.37   | $785.43 |\n| 1943-44| $52.99   | $49.59   | $804.13    | $192.26   | $793.83 |\n| 1944-45| $43.40   | $735.18  | $470.50    | $207.82   | $506.79 |\n\nThe above shows that generally the two years of 1943-44 and 1944-45 combined are not much more costly, and that is the only way to make comparisons.\n\n1943-45 was not a normal year as to costs. We could not secure required amount of clothing, boots, or underwear. Hence we were living from our house supplies, in stock, which are very much depleted at this time. We had only a cost of $52.99 for clothing in that year, while a pair of boots costs $3.00. When we have a chance to purchase needed clothing, then you will have increased costs. All our purchases for house, children, or farm, were more costly during the last year. Dominion statistics are at hand at Ottawa to account for part of the increase.\n\nOne item alone, woollen goods for winter skirts, trousers, and outdoor wear, it was impossible to get. When we did procure some last year, it was quite an item. It was only by the most careful use of much material given us by the Military, through Mr. Rice, that our devoted Sisters cut and patched to make things go, and save costs.\nResolved\n\nThat Reverend J.W. Brown\n\nbe and they are/he is hereby authorized for and on behalf of\nthe organization to sell, assign and transfer the following\nDominion of Canada bonds:\n3% maturing November 1st, 1956 #L 2 V2579 for $5,000,\nfully registered in the name of Shubenacadie Indian Residential School\n\nwe, the undersigned, hereby certify that the foregoing\nresolution was duly passed at a meeting of the . . . . . . .\nduly called and held on the . . . . . . day of . . . . . . 19\nthe whole pursuant to the laws governing the said organization,\nand that the said resolution is in full force and effect.\n\nGiven under our hands and seal of the said organization\nthis . . . . . . . . . . . . . . day of . . . . . . 19\n\n(Chairman or president)\n\n(Secretary)\nThe Royal Bank of Canada\n\nShubenacadie, N.

Brown has asked us to sell a Dominion of Canada bond fully registered in the name of the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School, maturing November 1, 1956, for $5,000.\n\nBefore we can sell this bond, we require the enclosed resolution or one of a similar effect, completed by authorized parties of the Dept. of Indian Affairs, giving Father Brown the necessary authority to complete the transaction. The proceeds of the sale are to be placed to the credit of the current account at this branch in the name of the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School.\n\nWe understand you are familiar with transactions and we would appreciate your having the resolution completed and returned to us as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

W. Brown, was authorized to proceed with the work needed and pay for it from school funds. It is for this reason that he desires to sell the Bond mentioned.\n\nAs the bond is registered in the name of the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School, the Director of the Indian Affairs Branch and myself consider that the only signature required is that of Father Brown, who is the signing officer for the Shubenacadie School account.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nThe Manager,\nRoyal Bank of Canada,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\n## Receipts and Expenditures\n\n**Month of:** December **1945**\n\n### RECEIPTS\n\n| Date | RECEIVED FROM | Description | Amount |\n|------|---------------|-------------|--------|\n|      | Mr. Smith     | Salary       | $600.00|\n|      | Mr. Johnson   | Rent         | $30.00 |\n|      | Mr. Smith     | Rent         | $30.00 |\n\n### EXPENDITURES\n\n| Date | PAID TO       | Description | Amount |\n|------|---------------|-------------|--------|\n|      | Mr. Johnson   | Rent         | $600.00|\n|      | Mr. Smith     | Rent         | $30.00 |\n\n### TOTAL\n\n- **Receipts:** $630.00\n- **Expenditures:** $630.00\n- **Balance:** $0.00\n\n---\n\n**Indian Affairs** (R01c, Volume 665a, file 265-3, part 2)\n\n**PUBLIC ARCHIVES**\n\n**ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES**\n\n**CANADA**\n\n**POOR COPY**\n## Receipts and Expenditures\n\n### School\n\n**Month of November 1945**\n\n| Date | RECEIPTS | EXPENDITURES |\n|------|----------|--------------|\n|      |          |              |\n|      |          |              |\n\n**Receipts**\n\n- **Date**\n- **Received From**\n- **Gov't per capita Allowance**\n- **Check**\n- **Grant**\n- **Total**\n- **Date**\n- **Paid To**\n- **Balance**\n\n**Expenditures**\n\n- **Date**\n- **Received From**\n- **Gov't per capita Allowance**\n- **Check**\n- **Grant**\n- **Total**\n- **Date**\n- **Paid To**\n- **Balance**\n\n---\n\n**Indian Affairs** (RG 1C, Volume 665a, file 265-3, part 2)\n\n**Public Archives**\n\n**Archives Publiques**\n\n**Canada**\n\n---\n\n**Poor Copy**\n## Receipts and Expenditures\n\n### School\n\n**Month of October 1945**\n\n| Date | Received From | Description | Amount |\n|------|---------------|-------------|--------|\n| Oct. | Brought Forward |             |        |\n|      | Sale of Old Cans |             |        |\n|      | 2 cases         |             |        |\n|      | 20.00           |             |        |\n|      | 2 x 1 lb pack @ 10 |             |        |\n|      | 7.16            |             |        |\n\n### Expenses\n\n| Description | Amount |\n|-------------|--------|\n| Rent on Car Park | 23.00 |\n| Gas & Oil | 47.80 |\n| Total | 107.80 |\n\n### Balance\n\n| Description | Amount |\n|-------------|--------|\n| Balance     | 159.42 |\n\n### Expenditures\n\n| Description | Amount |\n|-------------|--------|\n| Balance     | 159.42 |\n\n---\n\n**Note:** The image contains handwritten entries and calculations, which are not transcribed here due to the handwriting style.\nAverage - 138.7\n\nNet Earnings 6,241.50\nGrant 520.13\nTotal 6,761.63\nProvince of NOVA SCOTIA\n\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPer Capita Allowances\u2014Residential Schools\n\nFor Quarter ended December 31st 1945\n\n| PRINCIPAL | NAME OF SCHOOL | ANNUAL PER CAPITA ALLOWANCE | AMOUNT DUE |\n|-----------|----------------|----------------------------|------------|\n| Rev.

S.\n\nI have been advised by Sister Mary Charles, Superior at the captionally noted School, that their finances are at a very low ebb.\n\nIt is understood that a Grant is given this School quarterly, and it has been the custom for an advance to be made within the three month period. On checking over the Financial Statement from this School which was forwarded to you on June 29th/48, I noted that the Bank Balance was five dollars ($5.00), so it can be readily seen that an advance is urgently required.\n\nIt would be greatly appreciated if an advance of $1,000.00 could be made with the least possible delay, as wages have to be met for the current month.\n\n(H.

S.\n\nReference to your telegram of July 6th last, respecting\nthe financial condition of the captionally noted School.\n\nThe Principal, Rev. J. W. Brown advises me that it was\nan oversight on his part, that the financial statement did\nnot bear his signature.\n\nI have gone over his books very carefully and I cannot\nfind one instance where there was not good judgement used\nin the purchase of equipment, supplies, etc. The present\nfinancial condition of this School can be attributed\nto the increase costs of living which has gone up from 50%\nto 60% within the last year; whereas, the per-capita grant to\na school was only increased by 17%. Wages have been increased\nat this Institution by approximately $100.00 by month and the\nmanagement have stocked up considerable fuel, feed, etc.,\nwhich will be carried in to the next Academic year.\n\nThe wages for the month of May has been paid, but no\nsalaries have been paid for the month of June.\n\nI would strongly recommend that this Institution be given\nan advance grant to meet their current obligations.\n\nH.

If this money is not coming very soon, may we have an advance on the quarter? At the present time we have on hand sixty-three dollars and one cent ($63.01), not sufficient to pay for the light and power in order to take advantage of the ten percent (10%) discount.\n\nWe are very grateful for the increase in the per capita grant and we hope with a few more pupils to be able to meet our obligations.\n\nIf it is to be an advance on the quarter, could you make it not less than three thousand dollars?\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nRev. J. P. Mackey.\n\nP.S. Cheque in this morning's mail, thanks a lot.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Rev. Msgr. J.P. Mackey,\nPrincipal,\nShubenacadie Indian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, Nova Scotia.\n\nDear Msgr. Mackey:\n\nI have just reviewed your financial statement for the quarter ended March 31st, 1949, for the Shubenacadie Residential School.\n\nIt is noted that under the heading \"Buildings and Repairs\" there is an expenditure of $103.49, and under the heading \"House Equipment\" there is an expenditure of $304.62. Might I suggest that in future if repairs are required or new equipment is needed, you write to us before incurring the expenditure.\n\nIn the case of repairs you would only have to state what is required and give an estimate of the cost. In the case of equipment you would have to list the articles needed, and if they come within the range of the items which we allow, purchase will be made through the Departmental Purchasing Agent. A description of the article, catalogue number, the name of the firm and the cost at which they can be secured should also be supplied. By following this suggestion we could probably save you a considerable amount of money during the course of a year.\n\nAs you are aware, we do not always supply articles which you might enter under the heading of equipment,\n\n.....2\nbut are actually replacement of expendable articles. However, purchase of equipment of a more or less permanent nature will be favourably considered.\n\nI trust that everything is going well at the school, and that you are enjoying good health. Best wishes for Easter, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nProvince of NOVA SCOTIA.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPer Capita Allowances\u2014Residential Schools\n\nFor Quarter ended June 30, 1949\n\n| PRINCIPAL | NAME OF SCHOOL | ANNUAL PER CAPITA ALLOWANCE | AMOUNT DUE |\n|-----------|----------------|----------------------------|------------|\n| Rev.

A set of plans and literature concerning Indian residential schools were left with Father McManus.\n\nIt is proposed to secure the Sisters of Charity for the domestic and classroom activity, and we visited their Mother House on the Bedford road, near Halifax. Their institution and the Sisters we met made a very favourable impression and they, too, seemed quite eager to go into Indian work. We left with them also a set of plans and literature concerning residential schools. The Mother General of the Order is at present in Western Canada and she and her staff arranged to visit the Blood Indian Residential School, to get firsthand information concerning its conduct.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nDepartment Architect.\nMemorandum for Dr. Scott.\n\nDecember 21, 1926.\n\nESTIMATE OF COST\nNEW BUILDINGS\n\nSchool MARITLES\n\nAccommodation 100\n\n| Item                  | 1927-28 | Later | Total |\n|-----------------------|---------|-------|-------|\n| Site                  | To be purchased | 4,500. | 500.  | 5,000. |\n| Contract              |         | 30,000. | 70,000. | 100,000. |\n| Extras                |         |       | 5,000. | 5,000. |\n| Furnishings           |         |       | 8,000. | 8,000. |\n| Shelves, etc.         |         |       | 2,000. | 2,000. |\n| Water, Light & Sewage (Sewage only est.) |         |       | 2,000. | 2,000. |\n| Outbuildings          |         |       | 5,000. | 5,000. |\n| Stock, etc.           |         |       | 1,500. | 1,500. |\n| Inspection, etc.      |         |       | 1,000. | 2,000. |\n\nTotal 35,500. 96,000. 131,500.

J. L. Ilsley, B.A., of Kentville, N.S., for Hants-Ling, met us there and assisted until a final selection was made. At the outset, we had a preliminary look at the various sites that had been brought to our attention by letter, and, without much hesitation, we soon confined our interest to the Ettor and Gay farms, which were carefully examined. Certain local persons with some influence were desirous that the Davis property be included in the final examination, but Mr. Ilsley and ourselves could not agree that it was suitable enough to be worthy of comparison with the other two.\n\nIt was considered advisable to proceed to Halifax for the 20th and 21st, for the purpose of meeting the church authorities and to look into building materials and sources of supply. The final selection of a site was postponed until Friday, the 22nd. On that date the Ettor and Gay farms were examined with considerable care. While the first named property appeared to possess more possibilities as a productive farm\u2014a much wider choice of acreage being available for purchase\u2014from every other angle the Gay property was more suitable.\n\nThe Gay property is situated one-half mile from the station at Shubenacadie\u2014immediately on the outskirts of the village. The site is reached by a good road leading directly from the village\u2014a distinct advantage over other properties, in that it is not necessary to cross the railroad when travelling to and from Shubenacadie. It is pointed out that this railroad is the main line of the C.P.R., over which there is heavy traffic, and the importance of this to the staff and children will be understood. The farm consists of approximately 65 acres of cultivated upland, 50 acres of woodland, 10 of which have already been cleared sufficiently for pasture, and 17 acres of meadow which produces hay perennially without attention. The properties surrounding it appear to be clean and well-located. We consider this Gay farm, which consists of about 65 acres, more or less, large enough for the needs of the proposed institution for some time to come. The farm is to be clean and productive and is in one block. It should be mentioned that a fresh water lake, suitable for boating and fishing, just touches the northern boundary of the Gay farm.\n\nOn this property is an ideal building site which commands a view of the countryside in all directions. The building will be seen from the railroad and...\nfive roads running in and out of Shubenacadie. The site selected also provides ample opportunity for excellent drainage and water supply, the Shubenacadie river being less than 100 yards from the spot for the building. Electric current and telephone connection are available.\n\nWe wish to point out that it was impossible to locate a building site on the Etter property which was at all close to the railroad or main highway, and the drainage facilities were not at all comparable with those of the Gay property. This also applies with more force to the Davis property, but, in addition, the Davis property's only possible site for the building was immediately over disfiguring gravel pits and generally rough ground. It was represented to us that a siding which was close to the Davis property would be a big advantage. However, this feature was not worthy of serious thought as all materials would have to be unloaded from the cars into a vehicle and hauled up a difficult grade to the building. The Gay property, without railroad to cross and only a few hundred yards farther from a railroad station, had the distinct advantage of being near a post office and business community. We were warned by certain interested parties that the road leading to the Gay property, which happens to be the main road to Maitland, was flooded at certain seasons of the year. We made several enquiries from independent sources on this connection and we learned that the road was flooded for an hour or two a day in the spring of certain years only, but that it was not impassable even when flooded.\n\nMr. S. J. Etter wanted $13,500 for his farm, which consists of 270 acres. A lot of the value of this property is tied up in the buildings, the most important of which would have to be removed in the event of an Indian residential school being erected there. Mr. George Gay, in his written offer to Mr. Indian Agent Lawlor, asked $9,000 for his 130 acres, and was able to secure from him an option on the property at $7,000, provided he be allowed to harvest this year's crop. He promised to do the fall ploughing and otherwise prepare the fields for next year's farming operations.\n\nWe wish to recommend that the farm of George Gay be surveyed at an early date, with a view to determining not only the exact size of the property but also the best building site. If everything is found as has been represented to us and the title is satisfactory, we believe it advisable to arrange the purchase. In our opinion it is easily the best property near Shubenacadie for an Indian residential school. When title is being searched, it should be ascertained what privileges the owners have in connection with the lake that touches the property and if there is a right of way around its southern extremity.\n\nSome time ago, approximately one-eighth of an acre of this farm was sold for the site of a residence. Three\nor four years ago, the purchaser, Mr. Allan S. Etter, erected a residence, which would make a very suitable home for the farm instructor and other male members of the staff of the proposed school. This residence and lot, which is situated on the entrance road to the property, can be purchased for $4,000, which sum is less than would be required to erect a suitable farmer's residence. We strongly recommend that this property, also, be purchased.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nDepartment Architect.\nPlan shewing lands owned by\nGeorge Gay Esq. and situate at Shubenacadie, Hants Co., N.S.\n\nScale 200 ft to Inch.\n\nBearings shown hereon are as determined by angles turned on transit circle from a magnetic meridian observed Sept 26th 1927 at the point of beginning shown and indicated hereon by the letter A.\n\nSurvey and plan by the undersigned.\n\nProvincial Land Surveyor\nHalifax, NS Nov 30th 1927\nNov. 14, 1927.\n\nDear Father Mol\u00e9ans,\n\nWhen the Architect of the Department was in Halifax in July he left with the Reverend Sisters of Charity a copy of a plan of an Indian Residential School, which it was thought would be suitable, with minor changes, for the proposed new building at Shubenacadie. The Sisters promised to look this plan over and return it to the Department at an early date, with their comments and suggestions. To date I have not received this plan, and as we wish to get next year's work under way, I would appreciate it if you would see that same is returned to me as soon as possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Father C. H. Mol\u00e9ans,\nSt. Mary's Cathedral,\nHalifax, N.S.\n7. If the Indian Department considers it a necessity to have the boys taught Manual-training, there seems to be no provision made for this useful work.\n\n8. A Domestic-science room for the girls would be equally beneficial if it were thought desirable. Bringing the girls and boys to the general kitchen would be helpful to them and to the work during some parts of the day, but the real scientific work cannot be given at this period.\n\n9. There seems to be no provision made in the basement for male help. This will be necessary for the boiler-room, etc., etc.\n\n10. No provision is made for cold-storage which is a real necessity. If the building is far into the country, it might be difficult to get meat and other provisions often. Besides it is necessary to have food that is left over from one meal to the other cared for in cold storage.\n\nThe above suggestions, if acceptable, would help very much with the success of the work. We regret that there should be any delay in returning your plans and in submitting our suggestions. Should there be any further information required from us, we shall be very much pleased to comply with your inquiries.\n\nHoping that the work will progress satisfactorily, we are,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nSisters of Charity\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S.

We regret that we have delayed in returning the plans to your department until now.\n\nOur General Superior being absent during the greater part of the Summer, must be our excuse for keeping the plans so long. We are enclosing a list of the suggestions that might be acceptable for the better government of the work in this residential school. It is well in the beginning of this undertaking to have the conveniences that we think necessary in order to make the work more satisfactory.\n\nLet us state here the points under consideration:\n\n1. Would it not be well to have two (2) doors at least, in each of the dormitories on the top story?\n\n2. The wash-tables in the middle of these dormitories would seem to be unsanitary. They certainly would not be helpful to the discipline of the dormitory. Might these wash-tables be placed in the center of the toilet-rooms. In this case, these rooms would have to be made larger, or would it be desirable to cut off from the end of each dormitory, lavatories for this purpose? This would permit the children to be trained to better advantage.\n\n3. Would it not be advisable to have fire-escapes from the upper dormitories instead of from the staff-room?\n\n4. It is desirable to have closets on the Girls' and Boys' side of each floor for brushes, brooms, etc.\n\n5. The children will have unused clothing, as they must have at least some changes. There does not seem to be much provision made for the storing of this clothing.\n\n6. In the basement in each of the recreation-rooms some provision should be made for the children's boots and rubbers. Perhaps for these small cubicles might be made along the side of the wall and these could be used for seats also.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Although the gentleman who wrote it, Robert Cass, Esq., of Shubenacadie, N. S., protests that he has \"no axe to grind\", yet I think that the property, which he owns and describes, should not be overlooked in selecting the best site for the proposed residential school for Indian children.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. J. Boyd,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nShubenacadie N.S. June 6th 1927\n\nA.J. Boyd Esq.,\nSuperintendent Indian Affairs N.S.\nCarmen, C.B.\n\nDear Mr. Boyd:\n\nI was pleased to learn that through your effort there is a likelihood of an institution for Indians being established here, and regret that I did not at the time know of your visit. I do not wish to butt in anywhere, but I presume that the first thing in your mind is a suitable location, at a reasonable price, for the popularity of the movement will depend much on the location.\n\nI need not say to you that Shubenacadie Village, situated on the C.N.R., and on the main highway from Halifax to Truro, exactly in the centre of the Province, the best farming community in the province, with excellent connection by Rail, Main highways, Stages, Telegraph and Telephone with all parts must be a desirable location, and the Indian Reserve of some 1000 acres is only 5 miles distant.\n\nAs a lifelong resident of the place, and for many years past Appraiser for the Canada Permanent Mortgage Corporation, I have perhaps a better knowledge of the farms here, and their values than others could have, and I have no axe to grind.\n\nI do know however if you can secure a suitable location and build this institution near our Town, and close to Ry Depot, Post Office, Tel and Tel offices, Churches etc. that it would mean much to the appearance and popularity of the Institution, and to the future of this Town.\n\nI can well believe that a location on the main highway with a good elevation, ample water supply and opportunity for sewerage and with a good view would be the ideal, and several such can be obtained here within \u00bd mile of the Ry Depot and Post Office.\n\nWhile I repeat that I have no axe to grind, and my first thought is the best interests of the Institution and this Town and community, I beg to say that I have one of the finest farms in the Province, within sight of the Town, less than \u00bd mile from Ry Depot, on the main highway, at a good elevation overlooking the Shubenacadie River and in full view from the Railway, most excellent situation, splendid soil, about two weeks earlier than most farms, ample water supply for an Institution and sewerage easily available, 32 acres of the renowned Shubenacadie River marsh, the most prolific and easily cultivated of farm lands and yielding a continual annual crop of hay without cultivation, small orchard, a splendid flat for an institutional athletic grounds, a large barn capable of housing 50 head of cattle and storing 150 tons hay and located where in my judgement it would not interfere with your other buildings.\n\nI only bought farm last year. It had been rather neglected, but cut 120 Tons Hay and some grain crop but I\nexpect in two years to be making it produce 200 tons hay besides other crops.\n\nThe whole farm contains around 400 acres, but I would sell the front or cultivated portion say 150 to 200 acres and retain the rear end woodlands for myself.\n\nNow all this does not sound as though I have no axe to grind. But the fact remains that I am not anxious to sell it. Besides there are a number of other places near the town, which can be bought and one or two of them at low prices. S.J. Ritter, George Gay, Fred Ritter, Joseph Fleming, all have good locations and are worth your while looking over to get the best for the money.\n\nMy farm could easily be made one of the show places of the country, the view of and from the farm cannot be excelled.\n\nThe marsh alone is valued $200 per acre or $6400, but if you would not want the marsh I will keep it, and sell the upland portion, or any part of that.\n\nWhile as I have said I am not anxious to sell, I am very anxious that you get a property that will suit you entirely and within 4 mile of our town, as I know that would mean a great deal to the future of the community.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It has been run as a dairy farm for forty years and is in a good state of cultivation. The soil is loam with clay sub-soil and is easily worked.\n\nThe building consists of house with nine rooms finished throughout, with furnace in cellar and water in house, but no bathroom.

M. Dewis and Mr. Stewart Etter, and am enclosing a letter from Mr. Dewis, in which he gives a description of his farm, and price wanted.\n\nI might say that I visited the farm with Mr. Dewis and roughly checked up his statements and which I believe are correct. I might say that this is the farm directly opposite the small way-station known as Dewis' Siding.\n\nThe farm is completely fenced with wire fencing. Nothing in the nature of a crop has been put in this season for the reason that Mr. Dewis lost his largest barn last Fall and has not been living on the farm this season.\n\nIn reference to Mr. S. Etter's farm, I would say that I looked over same with him, and am also enclosing his letter giving description and price. To his description\nI would add the following:\n\n\"The frontage faces the main highway and railway, and is approximately sixty rods wide, then widens out to about one hundred and twenty rods and runs straight back to the Shubenacadie River. The farm is entirely fenced all around.\n\nThe buildings consist of:\n1 Two storey dwelling size 24x23 with 311 attached 24x22, modern improvements,\n1 Implement Shed 85x25,\n1 Barn 40x60. Basement stable.\n\nAll buildings are in good repair and built within the last few years. Four wells supply water for this farm.\n\nThe above descriptions cover the two properties asked for, and I would beg to say that if further information on the said properties is required, to please command me and I will do all possible to supply same. I am taking the liberty to inform you that since the object of your visit has become known to the farmers here, that several of them are willing to dispose of their farms here so that if the farms reported on do not meet with your approval, there are\nseveral to choose from.\n\nI would say that during our conversation, you stressed the point that the farm you selected would have to be able to supply quantities of water and I presume you meant soft water.\n\nI am taking the liberty of enclosing a description of a farm property here that for water supply, elevation and drainage cannot be duplicated in this section. This is known as the George Gay Property, located on the Main Road to Maitland. A building on this property would show well from the Main Trunk Road, the Village of Shubenacadie and the Railroad.\n\nTrusting that my report may meet with your approval, and assuring you of my best attention at all times.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDuncan C.

I decided that it would not be in the interests of the scheme to locate the building on the Shubenacadie reserve. I had an interview with the Indian Agent at Shubenacadie, Mr. D.B. Lawlor, and I directed him to obtain information with reference to farms that might be for sale in the vicinity of Shubenacadie and to make a report. My Deputy for Indian Affairs reminded Mr. Lawlor that we were awaiting his report, and I trust that it will reach me in a few days. If you have any recommendations to make, I should be glad to receive them, and before coming to any definite decision in the purchase, I will communicate with you.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[C.

Scott Esq.\nDeputy Supt General of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMr. D.B. Lawlor, local Indian Agent has waited on me and inspected my farm.\n\nIn the absence of definite knowledge as to your requirements, I have drawn up a rough sketch and description showing a number of different proposals for sale, and have told him further, that I will subdivide farm in any other way that will meet your wishes.\n\nWhile Mr. Lawlor perhaps would not consider himself competent to declare emphatically on the quality of the farm, I know he was favourably impressed.\n\nHe certainly was with regard to the location, building sites, and particularly the water supply and facilities for the sewage which I pointed out to him, and which are noted on the description I gave him for forwarding.\n\nHe at least was surprised when after inspecting some others, I showed him A REAL FARM.\n\nI pointed out to him that the soil was different from any other he had seen being a deep sandy loam, free from stones, easily cultivated and very productive.\n\nThis was easily demonstrated on the ploughed grounds and growing crops.\n\nI might repeat that for a number of years I have been appraiser for The Canada Permanent Mortgage Corporation, and know something of farms and farm values. I have appraised many of the farms in this district, and you can believe that when I bought a year ago I bought what I knew to be the best one.\n\nI intended keeping it but continued sickness of members of my family make it advisable for me to sell.\n\nWhile the matter of your choice of the several offers I have made, is immaterial to me, if you will permit me to suggest, as a practical man, your best purchase is lots No. 1 and 2\u201490 acres at $6,500 inasmuch as the Barn on these lots, is not old, is an up-to-date plan and with slight repair and alteration would be A 1 and could not be replaced for $4500.\n\nI have no hesitation in saying this would be the best 90 acre farm in Nova Scotia.\n\nIf you wish to add the Marsh Lot No. 4\u201434\u00bd acres at $3000, or a total of $12,500 you would have 125 more farm without any any superior in Canada.\n\nThis Marsh land is valued at not less than $150 per acre. I would not sell it separately for less than $4500. I am offering to you in combination with other lots at $3000.\nIt is the finest of agricultural land suitable for any crop by cultivation and yielding an annual hay crop without any cultivation or fertilization and has been doing so to my personal knowledge for upwards of 50 years.\n\nGenerally, let me say, without making any comparison with other farms available,\n\nYou do not have to cross a Railway track (which must be objectionable) to get to my farm.\n\nIts frontage is on the main Provincial highway.\n\nThe Soil is a deep loam free from stone, easily cultivated and very productive.\n\nIts location cannot be excelled. It is in the exact centre of the Province within \u00bd mile of Railway Depot, Post and Telegraph Office, Schools, Churches, Public Hall, County Exhibition and Athletic Grounds.\n\nIt has ample water supply and opportunity for inexpensive sewerage, to the River, excellent building sites and the view of and from the farm cannot be excelled.\n\nThe prices quoted are less than actual value. You may buy cheaper farms but not of this size, location or quality.\n\nLooking to the future of the Institution, in view of the location, quality and facilities, initial expenditure of a thousand or two dollars extra is nothing.\n\nThe large Indian Reserve is within 5 miles.\n\nLast year notwithstanding neglect of former owner this farm gave me 120 tons hay besides other crops, the growing crop on it today is worth upwards of \u00a31200.\n\nWithin two years if I keep it I will make it yield much more.\n\nFinally I am offering a square deal. I am not enhancing values in any of the different proposals I have made, on the other hand I am offering at very low figures.\n\nMy cards are on the table and while from personal reasons I am anxious to sell, I am not altogether governed by self interest but as an old resident of the community who has always taken part in movements for its benefit, I am putting forward the proposal that I know to be best for the community, and for the future success and popularity of your Institution.\n\nI leave the matter in your hands.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

At A, B, and C, are three excellent wells while at D there is a hollow and spring, where a dam 15 ft long and 5 ft high would conserve enough water for institution, the hollow is already utilized and joined to the barn underground pipe.\nAt E with a dam on the brook 20 ft long and 5 ft high any quantity could be retained and joined to the institution, or could pump direct from lake.\nDirect sewerage to river could be easily obtained where marked on sketch, going through highway and railway culverts already there.\nRiver being tidal water, sewerage is permitted.\nOne of the greatest fertilizers is the mud from the banks of the river which is obtainable in unlimited quantity.\nThe straight lines show present boundaries of farm but as I apprehend you do not wish rough land or wilderness, the dotted lines will show you the portion I propose to sell you.\nI will retain the rough land on the Northern side which will give me access to Wilderness and woodlands in rear.\nMy proposal is that I will erect new post and wire fence along the dotted lines of such portion as you may purchase, and the cost of this is included in the price I quote you.\nYou will understand that in offering you by these dotted lines I am offering you the cultivated portion of my farm, now carrying a valuable crop, and I will in the absence of definite information...\nFarm Robert Cass\n\nas to your exact requirements, but understanding you want about 100 acres of cultivated land or land ready for cultivation, I will subdivide my farm in any way you wish.\n\nThe acreage suggested in the lots marked in red dots is only estimated but will be properly surveyed out on sale and fence erected by me on the surveyed lines.\n\nJust here I beg to say that anywhere on Lots 2 and 3 would be a desirable building site for your institution, being well elevated.\n\nIf you do not desire the hill in rear which I use for pasture and which is ready for the plough, I will sell you 100 acres off the front from O on the North side to S on the South side in a direct line leaving the upper courses of the brook and the dam site on your lands and the lower courses of brook on the pasture lands I retain the fence crossing the brook below your dam site.\n\nThis would be all cultivated land except some bush along the brook near the North Eastern corner and a few acres of pasture in the valley at South Eastern corner.\n\nMy prices (fenced) are as follows:\n\nLots No 2 and 3 without buildings, 100 acres $7,500.\n\nLots No 1, 2, and 3 with buildings and orchard about 90 acres $20,500.\n\nLots No 1, 2, and 3 with buildings and orchard about 125 acres $10,500.\n\nLots 1, 2, and 4 includes marsh and buildings about 124 acres $12,500.\n\nLots 1, 2, 3, and 4 about 159 acres $13,500.\n\nOr upland frontage O to O 100 acres including buildings and orchard $11,000.\n\nAnd if you wish Marsh Lot No 4 in addition add $3,000, or a total of $14,000.\n\nIf you do not want marsh I will be glad to retain it.\n\nHere again I would point out that on Lot No 1 marked X on the sketch is one of the finest building sites in N.E., and one I intended keeping for myself but continued illness in members of family has decided me to sell. It could be made the show place of the country.\n\nAgain Note - The growing crop on this farm is worth $1,000, if purchased immediately you secure the crop on the portion purchased. Harvesting hay crop should begin about July 10th.\n\nYesterday I had an U.S. enquiry for this farm and I quoted $16,000.

I am pleased to state that the Roman Catholic ecclesiastical authorities who will be associated with us in the conduct of the institution are very favourable to the scheme, and I have directed that Mr. Russell Ferrier, Superintendent of Indian Education, and Mr. R.

He is thoroughly familiar with the location of boundaries and also with what is required in connection with building.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.L. Ilsley\n\nJLI*MR\nKentville, N.S., July 23, 1927.\n\nHon. Charles Stewart,\nMinister of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMr. Ferrier and Mr. Orr came to Shubenacadie last Tuesday and I met them there. I visited the four proposed sites with them. They went to Halifax without making a definite selection and returned yesterday and selected the Gay property. This selection is satisfactory to me.\n\nI did not in any way influence or try to influence the decision of Mr. Ferrier and Mr. Orr believing that they should get the best site available in view of the large amount of money to be spent for construction. Mr. Ferrier, speaking to me by phone last night, said that some arrangement was made with Gay and his son to work on or look after the property next summer. Gay and his son are Conservatives and I am inclined to think that any such arrangement would be undesirable from the political standpoint and should not be confirmed by yourself. The payment of government money to Conservatives is resented by Liberal workers in this province, and it occurred to me shortly after Mr. Ferrier told me this had been arranged it might mean trouble. I found Mr. Ferrier and Mr. Orr very reasonable and their modus operandi very satisfactory in every way, and I am not in any way complaining. I trust, however, that any arrangement they made to employ either Gay or his son is merely tentative, as I am sure it was. My present feeling is that no agreement to employ the Gays should be entered into. The selection of the Gay site is acceptable to several of the leading Liberals, as they are interest in the property as mortgagees, creditors or otherwise.\n\nThe selection of the Gay property was bitterly resented by Hon. B.B. Fulmer, the leading man in our party in the district, who called me up last night and indulged in much menacing talk about the support I would lose next election. I am satisfied that he is practically alone in his dissatisfaction with the site. The site that he offered was according to Mr. Ferrier and Mr. Orr entirely unsuitable and I agreed with them. Fulmer will criticize\nme and talk a lot because we are buying from a Tory. However, I am satisfied and I would not on any account alter the selection now. I would like, however, to be consulted in detail about any supplementary purchases of property that take place in the vicinity and about any proposed employment of Gay and his son. I do not want to give Pulmer a real ground for grievance.\n\nI would appreciate it if you would advise me promptly as to the government's intentions in respect of the matters I have mentioned in this letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.L. Ilsley\nAugust 6, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Ilsley,\n\nThe Honourable Mr. Stewart, Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, is leaving for the West tonight and has not had time to reply to your letter of July 23rd. He therefore asked me to do so. He approved of the purchase of the Gay property and instructions will go forward to Mr. R.W. McKenzie to carry out the necessary survey. When we receive a description of the property a lawyer will be instructed to search the title, and in due course the purchase will be completed. I note what you say about the employment of Mr. Gay, and I beg to assure you that we will meet your wishes and he will not be employed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nJ.

Fulmer sent to the Minister with reference to the purchase of the property for the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School. The Minister asked me to reply to Mr. J.L.

S.\n\nOn the 13th ultimo a General Fair Wage Clause was furnished to your Department for inclusion in the specification for the above-mentioned work. This clause calls for the observance of the rates of wages and hours of labour of the different classes of workmen required which are generally accepted as current from time to time during the continuance of the contract for competent workmen in the district in which the work is being performed, and if there be no current rates or hours in the district, then fair and reasonable rates and hours. A schedule has been prepared setting forth the wages rates and hours which are applicable under these conditions at the present time, and it is desired by the Minister of Labour that your Department will communicate this latter information to contracting firms who are desirous of tendering for the work in question.

It is not enough for him, therefore, to make general claims about the transmission of his glass without ample proof, for from then on he is morally responsible for every transmission and health claim he makes, inasmuch as people buy his glass for one purpose\u2014to improve their health.\n\nIt becomes him, therefore, to do three things:\n\n1\u2014To make a glass which transmits enough of the vital ultra-violet health rays (from 2900 to 3200 A.U. wave length) for health and healing purposes.\n\n2\u2014To state what percentage of the health rays within the above lengths his glass will transmit, show transmission charts, quote authorities, give results of actual scientific and practical tests besides laboratory transmission tests, and give a statement covering the uniform transmission of his glass.\n\n3\u2014To be sure that his stock glass made in quantities for sale is as good in transmission as the small batches made up for laboratory test work prior to entering a quantity production schedule.\n\nNot only does the Vitaglass Corporation govern its sales policy and the character of its product by this standard because of its moral responsibility to its customer, who is the public, but it feels that its distributors, who must share the responsibility for any health product they sell, value the assurance that when they sell VITA glass they know that the product\u2014every pane of it\u2014is made according to this high standard and that VITA glass will do what is claimed for it. Although it has been the practice of the Vitaglass Corporation since its beginning to show proof of its claims, it is assembling here some more scientific evidence to add to the knowledge of VITA glass distributors, so that when they sell VITA glass they will know they have sold a glass which transmits sufficient health rays for health and healing purposes.\n\nThere are two kinds of ultra-violet rays in natural sunlight. First, there are the longer ultra-violet rays\u2014a portion of which comes through ordinary glass\u2014sometimes known as the photographic ultra-violet rays, because they affect a sensitive photographic plate. These longer rays do not have much health-giving properties, if any. Then there are the shorter, vital ultra-violet health rays, technically known as those between 2900 and 3200 A.U.\n\nThis folder gives authoritative evidence of the presence of these shorter rays in sunlight, of their health value and of their transmission through VITA glass in sufficient quantities for health and healing purposes.\n\nVITA glass is distributed through the regular glass channels. It is shipped from Bonded Stock, cut to size, labeled, and indelibly etched with the name VITA in the lower left hand corner.\n\nB. & S. H.

If any batch of VITA glass fails to meet our high transmission standards, it is discarded.\n\nVITA glass is a scientific health product used widely by invalids and also in hospitals. Hence every precaution is taken in order to make certain that each pane of VITA glass will transmit a sufficient volume of the vital range of ultra-violet rays for health purposes.\n\nIn the manufacture of ultra-violet ray transmission glass there is no certainty that each batch will be uniform. Thus it is necessary that each batch be tested. This allows the Vitaglass Corporation to give a transmission guarantee covering the health value of every pane of VITA glass.\nAuthorities state that there is health benefit from vital ultra-violet in Winter sunlight\n\nThe vital ultra-violet health rays are present in natural light practically all the year around in sufficient quantities for health.

Two weeks after she put the VITA glass in, she manifested great gain in physical vigor and in general toning-up and, after a month, her face and hands are tanned as if she had been out of doors in the sunshine for that same length of time.

U. wave length\n\nIt is a proven fact scientifically that the ultra-violet rays in light that have a wave length shorter than 3200 A. U. do not pass through ordinary window glass, except occasionally and then only in negligible quantity, and that a volume of those ultra-violet rays of wave length longer than 3200 A. U. do pass through ordinary glass up to 3900 A. U. where the visible light in the sun's spectrum begins. It is a fact, accepted by scientists and physicians generally, that ordinary glass shuts out the health and vital part of natural light. Therefore, that health part of light (the part of sunlight that causes tanning) must lie in the ultra-violet rays shorter than 3200 A. U. wave length. This is substantiated specifically by authorities as follows:\n\nAUTHORITIES:\nW. W.

Perhaps it is owing to the fact that window glass is opaque to rays shorter than about 3200 A. U. and that sunlight, filtered through window glass, is deprived of most of its germicidal power.\n\nThis is, no doubt, the region of the solar spectrum that has the greatest therapeutic action, especially at sea level.\"\n\n\"These investigators (Hess & Weinstock) report that the spectrum line at 3020 A. U. possesses marked anti-rachitic potency; the 3130 line only very slight specific power.\"\n\n\"The rays which are most potent in producing pigmentation are those between 2900 and 3300 Angstrom Units, which are the shortest wave lengths in the solar spectrum. Wave lengths shorter than 3300 are absorbed by glass* and it is known that pigmentation does not take place if sunlight passes through glass,* so the longer waves do not cause this effect.\"\n\n(* This refers to common window glass.)\n\n\"Vital ultra-violet (from 3200 to 2900 A.

Increase the number of red corpuscles in the blood. Increase resistance to and aid in curing colds, influenza, tuberculosis, and other diseases.\n\n2. Aid the blood to absorb phosphorus, calcium and iron\u2014materials which build and strengthen bones, teeth. Prevent rickets.\n\n3. Tan the skin and are good for many skin diseases.\n\n4. Aid in convalescence: Aid in building the body to stand the strains and shocks of life. Increase mental and physical vitality.\n\n5. Kill bacteria and germs.\n\nThese rays of sunlight make for better health and longer life. Ordinary glass keeps them out\u2014VITAGlass lets them through. (VITAGlass transmits up to 70% of the Vital Ultra-violet Health Rays, whereas 40% are considered sufficient for Health and Healing Purposes.)\n\nScientific School Test in England showed growth of children in room with ordinary glass windows, for nine months, was less than 50% of normal growth of children in room glazed with VITAGlass.\n\nChick Test in late winter 1927 under auspices of American Medical Association showed that chicks reared behind ordinary glass grew less than 50% of normal growth of chicks grown behind VITAGlass.\n\nIn each scientific test, growth in rooms with windows of ordinary glass was retarded over 50%.\n\nPlaces and Purposes for Which VITAGLASS Should Be and Is Used:\n\n1.

Limited McGill Bldg., Montreal Royal Bank Bldg., Toronto Sole Agents and Bonded Distributors in Canada for the Vita Glass Corporation.\nVITAL ULTRA-VIOLET SUNRAYS\u2014THEIR MEANING TO HEALTH...\n\nAn \"outdoor\" life has always been known to be a healthy one. For many years people have attributed this to \"fresh air\" and exercise. And in part, of course, this is true. But a main ingredient in outdoor healthfulness, perhaps the main ingredient, is, as physicians for years have been coming to realize, sunlight.\n\nExperiments prove that sunlight stimulates growth by causing the body to absorb more calcium and phosphorus\u2014both necessary for bone formation and sound teeth. It enriches the quality of the blood by stimulating formation of hemoglobin, the oxygen carrier. It is of enormous importance in increasing better general health and resistance to disease. It has been found to be one of the best germicides in the world. \"Cold\" germs and tuberculosis germs die faster in sunlight than in strong antiseptic solutions.\n\nIt was found also that direct rays of the sun would cure certain serious illnesses\u2014tubercular cases of the surgical type, for example. Sunlight aided the cure of rickets in children, and it was found that children who were kept much in the sunlight did not develop rickets even though their diet was deficient in vitamins.\n\nBut a remarkable fact developed. Sunlight, when filtered through ordinary window or plate glass is robbed of its beneficial properties. Why? Science sought an answer and discovered that the health value of sunlight was not contained in the light rays but in the invisible ultra-violet rays. And of these ultra-violet rays only a small band, the actinic or vital rays, are health giving. These vital rays are unable to penetrate window glass.\n\nORDINARY GLASS KEEPS THEM OUT\u2014A GREAT NEW DISCOVERY\u2014VITA GLASS\u2014LETS THEM THROUGH!\n\nThen it became obvious that one of the great reasons that indoor people were pale, apparently bloodless and deficient in stamina, was lack of sunlight. For if you sit at an ordinary window flooded with sunlight you might just as well be in a windowless room as far as the sun's health action is concerned. You get light but the window glass keeps out the vital health rays as effectively as would a dungeon wall!\n\nDuring the past decade scientists everywhere have been searching for a substitute for window or plate glass, which would be as transparent and useful and at the same time transmit the essential health-sustaining ultra-violet rays.\n\nThe discovery has been made in Vita glass, the invention of a distinguished English research scientist, Prof. F. E. Lamploch, M.A., Cambridge. Vita glass is manufactured solely by Chance Bros. & Co., Ltd., of Birmingham, England.\n\nVita glass is available in clear glass, designed for use in ordinary windows and sold at a price which makes it available to everyone. It transmits 50 to 65% of the available vital ultra-violet rays whether the day is clear or cloudy. Physicians say this is amply sufficient for health and healing purposes.\n\nIt is also available in cathedral (diffuse) type for solaria, skylights and other uses where clear vision is not desired.\n\nINDIRECT LIGHT ALSO CONTAINS VITAL HEALTH RAYS\n\nVita glass is not limited to use in direct sunshine only. Reflected sunlight, cloud shine, sky shine all contain ultra-violet radiation. According to the Weather Bureau of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, light from these sources is rich in ultra-violet radiation and fully as valuable as direct sunlight. The test at Southwick (see below) was made in an atmosphere worse than any city in the United States, with very little direct sunshine at all. The results indicate the presence of ultra-violet rays under adverse conditions, and also prove their value.\n\nThe transmission of Vita glass in direct sunlight is over 50 per cent of the available ultra-violet radiation. Indirect radiation is transmitted to an even greater per cent of the amount present because reflection is to a larger extent eliminated. This has been proved by experiment.\n\nIt must be emphasized that indirect light contains a large amount of radiation. One of the most eminent\nauthorities on heliotherapy writes in a private communication: \"Blue sky and bright clouds are a source of ultra-violet light, and more of these rays come from skyshine than from the high sun directly, and far more than from the sun low in the heavens. VITA glass lets the ultra-violet of the sun through nearly as well as silica.\" (Fused silica panes (quartz) cost about $100 per square foot.)\n\nAll of this means that under most conditions daylight contains some of the valuable ultra-violet radiation, and that wherever present it is efficiently transmitted by VITA glass.\n\nTESTS OF WORLD-WIDE IMPORTANCE TO HEALTH\n\nBefore presenting VITA glass to the Canadian public, it has been experimented with and used in England for over two years and results have been remarkable. In a school in Smethwick, England, a test conducted by Dr. J. Bell Ferguson, Medical Health Officer, showed in the ten months' period when a careful record was kept, the following result:\n\n| Class                        | Average gain in weight of pupils in control class | Gain in average height control class |\n|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| VITTA glass class            | 2.65 lb.                                         | 1.22 in.                            |\n| VITTA glass class            | 6.11 lb.                                         | 1.86 in.                            |\n\nThese classes were chosen by the school authorities as being representative, and the results obtained have caused the installation of VITTA glass in the Smethwick schools. Other schools are following suit. Here is an extract from an article which was printed in the Nottingham Evening News, issued Oct. 16, 1926:\n\n\"After two years' experience of the glass, I am a convert,\" says Mrs. Kirk, Headmistress of the Leenside Infants' School. \"There can be no gainsaying the fact that the health of the fifty children in the room fitted with VITTA glass has been wonderfully improved. After a year's school work in this particular room, both boys and girls emerge looking the picture of health!\"\n\nWHAT AUTHORITIES SAY...\n\nSir Henry Gauvain, a leading authority in the field of the sunlight treatment of tuberculosis, recently stated before the New York Electrotherapeutic Society:\n\n\"In VITTA glass we have a very useful artificial means of getting ultra-violet light under various circumstances. I use it in my own house to get a satisfactory result. I have found it of extreme value. Those of you who have hospitals or large clinics know that if you are giving your patient sun treatment and showers come up it is a most awful nuisance to the patient to be suddenly rushed out. The patient thinks about it a great deal and if he gets wet it is very annoying. I found this VITTA glass very good. I had a sliding roof made in sections, and when the showers come down comes the roof. The patient can then still be exposed. Of course, VITTA glass does not cut off all the light, but there is plenty between the rays through and you can go on exposing for quite a long time.\"\n\nLet us look for a moment to one of the effects of VITTA glass in the London Zoo. Here is an extract from a London newspaper concerning it:\n\n\"Animals have lived through the winter which have never before survived a winter in the gardens. Animals have bred which have never before done so while in the Zoo, and all the animals which used to mope so dreadfully are quite happy.\"\n\nVITTA glass is already specified or used in a number of hospitals, sanatoria and schools in Great Britain, the United States and Canada. A partial list may be found on the back cover of this booklet.\n\nWHERE VITTA GLASS SHOULD BE USED\n\nIn the Medical Field.\nHospitals, sanatoria, preventoria, infirmaries, hotels, and health resorts.\n\nEducational Field.\nParticularly in public and private schools including Montessori schools and kindergartens.\n\nThe Private House and Apartments.\nIf not in the whole dwelling, then at least in the Children's rooms, sun porch, skylight, the room to be designated as a health-room and used when any one is sick, a room to which elderly people or others are confined more or less.\n\nOffice Buildings.\nIn offices, where one or many gather to spend the daylight hours in work, where healthy bodies and energetic minds are needed to cope efficiently with the daily tasks, where subnormal health reacts to the disadvantage not only of the business but the dependents who remain at home.\nMiscellaneous.\n\nDay nurseries for children, solaria, hotels, office buildings, factories, roof gardens, swimming pools and gymnasiums (exposed to the light), zoos, greenhouses.\n\nSTARVED FOR SUNLIGHT...\n\nWith the growth of the cities and the multiplication of indoor workers millions of people are starving for sunlight. It is probable that you who read this booklet are among them.\n\nYou need be no longer. Nor need any member of your family. At all seasons, in any weather, no matter whether your occupations confine you indoors or not, you may have the benefit of the available ultra-violet rays in your own home at little cost.

Wave lengths longer than 760 \u03bcm are called infra-red, and those shorter than 400 \u03bcm, ultra-violet. Though the average eye is not sensitive to wave lengths shorter than 400 \u03bcm such rays actually exist in the light of the sun, extending down to a wave length a little more or a little less than 300 \u03bcm, depending on the time of day, season of year, latitude, altitude and clearness of atmosphere.\n\nSince ordinary window glass shuts out the ultra-violet rays below about 310 \u03bcm, much attention has been given of late to the production of special glasses, transparent to the shortest wave lengths which the atmosphere permits the sun to furnish us. This letter circular gives the results of ultra-violet transmission tests which have been made at the Bureau of Standards upon a number of such special glasses and common window glass.\n\nTOTAL TRANSMISSION OF VARIOUS GLASSES FOR THOSE ULTRA-VIOLET SOLAR RAYS TO WHICH COMMON WINDOW GLASS IS OPAQUE\n\nUsing a filter method, direct measurements with sunlight as source, have been made during the noon hours of especially clear days from April to December, 1927.\n\nThese measurements covered the solar spectral region to which common window glass is opaque (below about 310 \u03bcm). Table I gives for that region the total transmission found for the following specimens:\n\n| Trade Name          | Per Cent.

(RG 10, Volume 6055, file 265-5, part 2)\n(1) Vioray is the foreign trade name for Helioglass.\n\n(2) This consists of a fine wire screen whose interstices are covered with cellulose acetate.\n\n(3) This is a loosely woven fabric usually covered with paraffin.\n\nSPECIAL TRANSMISSION OF VARIOUS GLASSES FOR THE ULTRA-VIOLET RAYS\n\nA second and more reliable method of measuring the relative transparency of a specimen of glass to ultra-violet light is to determine its spectral transmission curve, wave length by wave length. Curves of this description are shown in the accompanying illustration. These curves were obtained by means of an artificial source of light (quartz mercury arc) giving a line spectrum richer in ultra-violet than the solar spectrum.\n\nBy means of these spectral transmission curves an estimate of the relative transmissions of the various specimens for rays shut out by common window glass, may be obtained by reading from the curves the values of the transmission at 302 \u03bc\u2014 the wave length of an intense mercury line, of convenient value for making such tests. Table 2 gives transmission values for this wave length. These are our most recent findings for new specimens.\nTable 2\u2014Per Cent.

The rate of change is much more rapid with the arc than with the sun and varies also with the different glasses.\n\nVitaglass has been on the market the longest, hence concerning this glass we are able to give the most information on solarization. A sample which had been in a hospital window in Rhode Island for a year was found to have a transmission of 25 per cent. at 302 \u03bcm (for thickness = 2.3 mm). Further exposure to the quartz mercury arc reduced the transmission but little, showing that solarization was complete.\n\nExposure in Washington of a sample (t = 2.35 mm) of Vitaglass directly to the sun for 123 hours (between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. during June, July, and August) decreased the transmission from 47 to 35 per cent. Our tests show that the greatest decrease in transmission occurs during the first few weeks exposure. The average transmission of Vitaglass at 302 \u03bcm after complete degeneration by the mercury arc is about 25 per cent. for a thickness of 2.3 mm.\n\nHelioglass has not been on the market for a sufficient length of time to obtain a complete solarization test. Two samples each of Helioglass and Vitaglass, exposed simultaneously to the sun in October to December, were found to have decreased in transmission at about the same rate. The average transmission of Helioglass at 302 \u03bcm after complete degeneration by the mercury arc is about 30 per cent. for a thickness of 2.3 mm.\n\nCorex glass appears to undergo no appreciable change in transmission when exposed to solar radiation. For example, a sample of cathedral finish Corex which had been in a greenhouse roof in New York for 14 months was found to have, as nearly as could be measured on that kind of surface, the same transmission as a new sample. It was then polished plane and found to have a transmission of 89.5 per cent. at 302 \u03bcm, while the average transmission for new samples as given in Table 2, is 89.\n\nOn the other hand, exposure to a quartz mercury arc causes a very marked decrease in the transmission.\nCel-o-glass (cellulose acetate) becomes opaque at 302 \u03bc\u03bc, and shorter wavelengths, after 25 hours exposure to the quartz mercury arc. A sample that was exposed to the sun for 400 hours during the months of April to October, decreased but little in transparency at 302 \u03bc\u03bc. On the other hand, samples that transmitted 30 per cent. at 302 \u03bc\u03bc, when new, transmitted only 5 to 10 per cent. at this wave length after being exposed on the side of a building continuously day and night for 8 months, April to December, showing that the change in transparency may be owing to the varying conditions of the weather.\n\nQuartz-lite is not appreciably affected by sunlight. Exposure to the quartz mercury arc decreases its transmission slightly (measured at 313 \u03bc\u03bc).\n\nCommon Window Glass is also slightly decreased in transmission by exposure to the quartz mercury arc but changes inappreciably in sunlight.\n\nTHICKNESS\n\nThe thinner the glass, the greater in general will be its transparency to ultra-violet rays. Considerations of strength, however, set a limit to an indefinite reduction in thickness. Commercial samples have been submitted for test with a thickness of less than 1 mm (1/25 inch). In installing such glass, attention should be given to the proper size of sash to meet safety requirements.\nWhat VITA Glass Looks Like\n\nVITA glass is a real glass containing an ultra-violet transmission formula worked into glass form. And in appearance is like ordinary glass.\n\nVITA glass in your windows admits not only the health rays of sunlight but also 4% more light than ordinary glass.\n\nVITA glass comes in two forms\u2014clear and cathedral. The clear is transparent like ordinary glass\u2014the cathedral is an obscure glass, to be used where clear vision is not desired.\n\nCathedral may be had in various thicknesses; also in wire cathedral.\n\nIn standard stock thickness, panes up to six square feet in clear and up to eight square feet in cathedral may be glazed. Window panes larger than that should be divided, have a muntin put in. Cathedral may be glazed in larger pane sizes, according to thickness specified.\n\nWhere VITA Glass is used\n\n| Homes | Sun Porches | Hotels |\n|-------|-------------|--------|\n| Factories | Cow Barns | Solaria |\n| Sanitarium | Schools | Greenhouses |\n| Offices | Nurseries | Stock Farm |\n| Hospitals | Hot Sash | Buildings |\n| Chicken Houses |\n\nFLOODED with Sunlight yet Starved for SUNSHINE\n\nPILKINGTON BROTHERS (CANADA) LIMITED MANUFACTURERS and SOLE DISTRIBUTORS in CANADA of VITA GLASS\nInstinctively, we all crave the exhilaration of outdoor life. When tired, we experience, outdoors in the sunlight, a physical and mental stimulation. We feel refreshed invigorated.\n\nBut inside, even in cheery, sunbathed rooms we sense a lack of some vital quality. Medical science now tells us exactly what it is we miss\u2014the ultra-violet rays, the life rays of the sun. And the reason these rays do not reach us indoors is simply because ordinary plate and window glass lock them out. Light enters but the sun's vital energy does not.\n\nOrdinary glass thus places a burdensome tax upon our health.\n\nIt is estimated that we spend on an average 90% of our daylight hours behind glass. We live behind glass. We ride behind glass. We work behind glass. And, naturally, we pay its costly price.\n\nLittle wonder, then, that instinctively we desire to get outdoors into the fullness of the sunlight. To meet this desire, science has developed a new kind of window glass called VITA glass which brings the vital elements of sunlight indoors. It is made so available to you that there is no reason why you should not take advantage of its health benefits. It brings the health value of outdoor sunlight indoors. Thus you can end this daily indoor tax upon your health.\n\nWith VITA glass windows you will feel better, look better, work better, for it brings the sun's health rays to you without exposure to unpleasant elements.\n\nVITA glass is endorsed by leading physicians. Has been tested and passed upon by the Council on Physical Therapy of the American Medical Association.\nVITA glass will pour the healing, healthful, energizing rays of the sun through your windows. It transmits over 60% of the sun's vital ultra-violet energy\u2014much more than sufficient for health and healing purposes.\n\nThe energy received every day, at home or at work, will lighten daily tasks\u2014leave you fresh at night. Lassitude and fatigue will disappear. Irritability will be lessened. Physical and mental activity will be increased. You can now take a healthful sun bath indoors.\n\nNow there will be less need for mother to force ill-tasting cod-liver oil into the mouths of infants. With VITA glass in the nursery windows, a child is practically protected from the effects of dust and dirt, wind and storm. Richness is prevented and the blood enriched so that growth is normal and healthy.\n\nNow Healthful Germ-Free Homes\n\nNot only do the ultra-violet rays build health, they protect health. Science claims that they form the most powerful germicide known to man. Whereas ordinary glass will not destroy certain bacilli, a few minutes' exposure to the ultra-violet rays of sunlight will. Consider what a factor this is toward protecting the health, especially of children in the home.\n\nLess Absences Due to Illness\n\nAbsences from offices average 8\u00bd days per person each year. In your office, VITA glass brings greater health to all your employees. Helps them build up greater resistance to common colds and other minor illnesses. As health increases, costly and annoying absences decrease.\n\nIt is estimated that the cost of replacing ordinary glass with VITA glass is more than paid for by annual payroll savings and in increased production.\n\nCareful Tests Made\n\nVITA glass is a tested, unpatented product. It is not experimental. Rigid tests have proven its ability to transmit the ultra-violet energy in sufficient volume for all health purposes. No longer need mankind be deprived of the body's need for growth.\n\nNote These Tests\n\nTests prove that chicks under VITA glass grew 220% as rapidly as under ordinary glass. Under VITA glass, the children in the Smethwick School test grew, likewise, 216%, as rapidly as under ordinary glass. The same results were obtained in normal healthy. Thus under ordinary glass a tax was placed on the health of both children and chicks and growth was retarded 50%.\n\nUsed in Many Hospitals\n\nAs further evidence of the health value of VITA glass, note that though it has been available in the United States only since September 1926, it has already been installed or ordered for scores of hospitals and sanatoria as well as for schools, homes, homes, apartments, factories, and office buildings.\n\nNorth Light is Valuable Source of Ultra-Violet Rays\n\nAuthorities have proven that skylight and cloudshine are excellent sources of ultraviolet. That is the reason why we sometimes receive a severe sunburn at the seashore or on the golf links on a cloudy day. Direct sunlight is not necessary. The rays enter the house as the sun is present in about the same proportion as visible light. Thus every window, not only windows with southern exposure, can be made a continued source of health.\n\nVITA Glass is Not Costly\n\nVITA glass, naturally, costs more than ordinary glass. But ordinary glass costs you money because it reduces health and vitality. Yet in no other way can most of us gain the same healthful results of the sun's ultra-violet energy at the same negligible cost during each year of the year. You have undoubtedly paid many times over the cost of installing VITA glass in your office or home. Pay for it in ill health and reduced efficiency.\n\nConsider its cost only by comparison with other less certain and more expensive means of gaining the benefits of natural sunlight. You will agree that VITA glass will, on that score alone, save you valuable time and money every year.\n\nVITA glass is not expensive. Everyone can afford it. If not for every window, then at least for the more important ones. Find out exactly the cost of installing VITA glass in place of ordinary window glass in your house or office. Use the order form enclosed for your convenience.\n\nDoctors Tell Us\n\nthat the vital ultra-violet rays (the life rays) of the sun, do the following:\n\n- Kill bacteria and germs. It is these rays that make sunlight the greatest of all disinfectants.\n- Tan the skin.\n- Help the normal skin and assist the cure of certain skin diseases.\n- Increase the hemoglobin and red cells in the blood.\n\nOrdinary glass keeps out these rays\u2014VITA glass lets them come indoors.\n\nTHE HEALTH WINDOW GLASS\n\nVITA glass is endorsed by leading physicians.

Scott,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOur Halifax Depot have quoted for the glass requirements in connection with the residential school Shubenacadia, and the question has been raised it would be possible to have VITA sheet glass used in certain parts of the building, if not all.\n\nWe feel sure you will have heard of this wonderful glass but, in case you have not, we take the liberty of writing you in a general way and enclosing to you literature which will give you some important facts in connection with this healthful glass.\n\nIt will no doubt interest you to know that we are manufacturing \"Lamplough Vita Glass\" at our factories in England and are carrying stocks at all our Depots throughout Canada.\n\nBriefly we would state: the Ultra Violet Rays of the sun will not pass through common window glass nor as much of the Infra-Red, or heat rays. The former rays contribute largely to good health while the latter are beneficial on account of their warmth. There are several makes of glass which it is claimed function in the same way but VITA glass is the original. It has been subjected to a series of tests over the last three years and has been proved to fulfill all that is claimed of it.\n\nWith regard to prices, the figures are as follows:\n\nVITA Sheet Glass $1.00 per foot up to one thousand feet.\nVITA cathedral Glass .95\u00a2 per foot up to one thousand feet.\n\" Plate Glass $3.50 per foot up to one thousand feet.\nF.O.B.

The columns of course will be cast and machined in Halifax, so that if there are any changes which you might want made on the columns, which would not affect the length of the beams, would appreciate if you would wire through your approval of the beam portion so that I might get same ordered.\n\nTrusting the details submitted may meet with your approval.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nWHN/S.\n\nEnclos.

As far as he could see, the labour conditions were not posted on the work as required under the contract. From enquiries made by our officer he was, moreover, doubtful if the rates of wages which were furnished to your Department in March last as being applicable under the terms of contract were being observed in all cases.\n\nWe should be pleased if you would direct the attention of the contractors to the requirement that the labour conditions should be posted on the work and I would ask also that you would be good enough to ascertain the rates of wages which are being paid to common labourers, carpenters and others employed on the work. In doing so, it would perhaps be desirable to direct the contractors' attention to rates which were set out in the statement of current rates and hours which were communicated to them at the time tenders were taken.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGerald H.

Crowell, Esq.,\nInspector of Construction,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nDec. 6, 1928.\n\nDear Sirs,-\n\nI received your letter of the 4th instant this morning. I had already written you with reference to the metal ceilings, which letter you have no doubt now received.\n\nReplying to your letter regarding the ceilings it will be satisfactory to me if you use the design No 2145. I am returning herewith the cuts as requested.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH. GRIMBY OKR,\nArchitect for the Department.\n\nRhodes Curry Ltd.,\nAmherst, N.S.\nDear Sir:\n\nFather MacKie and Mr. Crowell, the Inspector at Shubenacadie School asked me to submit to you patterns of steel ceiling for the different rooms.\n\nAs the ceilings are quite low I presume you would prefer a small pattern. That was the suggestion of the Inspector, also Father MacKie, so I picked out two patterns and am submitting same for your approval.\n\nWe intend to use the moulding as shown on design #2132 - also use a plain border filler in the large rooms.\n\nPlease make your choice from these two patterns marked in red ink and return them to us, as we have cut them out of the Metallic Roofing Co.'s catalogue.\n\nWe would like to have your decision as soon as possible so as to get the material ordered.\n\nYours very truly\n\n[Signature]\n\nPresident\n\nASC R\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Supt., General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have a letter from Robert Cass of Shubenacadie of which I enclose a copy. I wish you would very carefully consider this proposal. If, without any or much additional expenses, your pipe could be made available for fire protection, it would be a splendid thing for the Village. The Militia Department here in Kentville permits private property owners to tap their main, with the town's consent, and I would like it very much if something could be done for the town of Shubenacadie in this way at the time the pipe is laid to the institution. Of course, nothing should be done to prejudice the water supply or sewage system of the institution, and your engineers would know whether the proposed extension to the town for fire protection would prejudice these things. I would appreciate it very much if you would look into\nit at once and let me know what view the Department takes.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. H. Osley.\nShubenacadie Nov. 23rd, 1928.\n\nJ. L. Ilsley, Esq., M.P.\nKentville, N.S.\n\nDear Mr. Ilsley:\n\nThe Engineers were here yesterday, and surveyed at the Indian Farm for the water supply for the institution, and are taking it from the Lake just adjoining and partly on the farm. They are making plans of course only sufficient for the Institution, a pumping station with say a 4 inch pipe which would be adequate for that according to the Engineers.\n\nIt would be a great thing if they could be induced to make this large enough (say a six inch pipe) to supply water for the village here for fire protection and other services. Not being an incorporated town, but a part of the municipality, the village is not now in a position to make any definite proposals, and would have to call a citizens meeting and so on, and it would take a little time to get shaped up. It would not be a terribly extravagant thing for the Dept. to put in a plant adequate for all future needs of the Institution and the village as well. It would certainly be a most popular move for you if you could bring this about or even to delay the plans and work until negotiations could be had looking forward to this.\n\nBetter get in touch with Ottawa at once and at least get them to consider the matter, and perhaps you could get some proposal from them that we could put before a citizens meeting, which would at least show that you were trying to do something for the community at every opportunity, and if nothing ever came of it you would have credit for the move.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd) Robert Gass.\nDecember 12, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Ilsley,-\n\nI have given most careful attention to your letter of the 30th ultimo with enclosure from Mr. Robert Gass, in which you deal with the proposal to add to our water supply system at the Shubenacadie school in order to accommodate the town and provide for them a fire protection system. I doubt very much the advisability of the Department becoming involved in a scheme of that kind. We would have to provide a pumping plant much larger than would be required for the school including a larger elevated storage tank. The cost of installation would be correspondingly increased; this increase could hardly be charged to public funds and would have to be met in some way by the town and the town would also be put to considerable expense in laying a pipe line from the elevated tank to the town, with hydrants and the necessary hose and equipment. We would have been glad to consider this proposed plan but taking into consideration the cost of installation and the cost of operation it seems to me wise to say that we do not consider the plan favourably.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.

When Mr. Ferrier was in Shubenacadie, Mr. Gay spoke to him about this, and he was advised to apply about this time. If one of these barns is not needed for school purposes, either now or at a later date, you may give Mr. Gay permission to tear it down and take away the material, provided he leaves the site of the old building in a level and clean condition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The only need of either barn might be that the lumber in them could be used for other buildings. If it becomes known that Mr. Gay is to have one barn, then it is quite possible that you will have a request from other sources for the other barn.

I take exception to this as being unsanitary and not in keeping with the rest of basement which has no wood. I think a better method would be to cover frame with metal lath, coat with cement mortar, mortar & enamel, put on 2nd or third coating coat, and finish coat of cement painted to a good surface. The colored base can be carried around the floor line the same as all the basement rooms.\n\nA letter will clear this up in plenty of time.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJ.

I may say for your information that the Department has experienced considerable trouble where the individual seat flushing closet was used due to the rough usage given to plumbing fixtures by the children in the Institution.\n\nWith reference to the supports for the wash basins in the boys' and girls' wash rooms in the basement it is desired that a fixture similar to Standard Sanitary Plate P. 6095, size 16 x 20 be installed and referring to this plate you will see that it includes painted metal brackets which are secured to the floor as supports for the basins.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Crowell\nInspector of Construction\n\nThe Secretary\nDept of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOnt.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe hardwood flooring, Indian School, Shubenacadie. May say when we were estimating this job we figured on using No.1 grade hardwood flooring, which we presumed was your intention to have used in a building of that sort, for School purposes. The grading rule for No.1 is as follows:\n\n\"No.1 - 25/32 inch and thicker, will admit of tight, sound knots and slight imperfections in dressing, but must lay without waste. Standard lengths in all widths in this grade shall be trimmed 15 to 16 feet; the proportion of lengths 15 to 34 feet inclusive shall be what the stock will produce up to 40 percent\".\n\nThis makes a real good floor. The wearing qualities are just the same as the clear grade. When it is laid it is hard to tell the difference.\n\nYour Inspector interprets the specification as calling for Clear. We did not interpret the specification that way and consequently we figured on using No.1 grade, and if we are forced to use the Clear grade it will cost $300.00 more than we figured, and you really will get no better floor.\n\nI have used a lot of the No.1 grade in my own house and find it makes a first class job. We have also used it in Schools and other Institutions.\n\nWe intend placing the order for this flooring right away and would like to have your decision at your earliest convenience.\n\nPresume you are as familiar with the grading of hardwood flooring as we are. May say the sound knots in No.1 are very few. May find an occasional pencil knot in a board.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPresident\n\nIndian Affairs.

After this date clear flooring was to be known as first grade. First grade flooring shall have one face practically clear but colour no defect. Green or dark streaks not over 1/6\" wide or 3\" long or its equivalent and small defects which can be readily removed by the ordinary method of scraping after the floor had been laid, permitted.\n\nThis grade must have one face free from all shake and shock. Lengths 2 to 16 feet but not over 15 percent under 3\u00bd feet.\n\nI am sending a copy of this letter to the Inspector of Construction.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.

We did not get the last of the granite trimmings until sometime in January, which caused a long delay - also caused us a lot of extra expense.\n\nWe are now being delayed on account of the non-delivery of flooring. We had No.1 flooring engaged, supposing that was the grade required, but as you have insisted on using clear grade, we had to cancel the order for No.1 and place the order elsewhere for clear, and we cannot get delivery until the last of this month.\n\nOn account of this, and other minor delays, we will be obliged to ask for about two months extension of time. We are doing everything we possibly can to have the building finished at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nASC R President\nMarch 16, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Cuddy,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 13th instant, I note that it will be impossible to have the new Shubenacadie School built in the time specified.

D. McLean, Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\n\nRe Water Supply Indian College\nShubenacadie, N. S.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of Nov. 6th with reference to survey for Pipe Line in connection with the proposed water supply for the College building, I would say that I have made a preliminary survey and think it advisable before going further to submit the following as to existing conditions, in order that the decision as to location be made with full knowledge as to the situation.\n\nI am sending you under separate cover a Blue Line Print of that portion of the property lying between the Shubenacadie - Maitland Main Public Road and the River, on which is shown, roughly, two alternative locations.\n\nYour letter conveys the impression that the proposed pipe line is to enter the Lake where the shore is within the boundaries of the college property.\n\nUnder ordinary conditions I would have assumed that this had been decided upon and have disregarded the second location which, as will be noted, involves crossing a part of the adjoining farm owned by the Brothers Snide. It has also occurred to me that, owing to the fact that my Plan of the College property shows only a small portion of the Lake, a mistaken idea may have been formed as to its size, and location with\nreference to the College property. For this reason, I have thought it advisable to submit this memo and await further instructions before making the final location.\n\nThe location marked \"A\" - \"B\" - \"C\" as shown, is entirely upon, and takes the water from that portion of the Lake which is within the boundaries of, the College Property.\n\nThe distance by this line is 1900 feet, assuming an approximately direct line and reasonable distance from the shore to point of intake. This last should be determined by soundings for the depth of water and observation of the effect on the water of drainage entering from the main road which passes near the Lake at this point.\n\nThe rise of the ground from the water level at this point is such that the pump house must be located practically at the shore, see point \"A\" on Plan. The tank will require to be at the point marked \"B\" distant about 1000 feet from \"A\" at which point the elevation is about three feet above the floor of Boiler Room, which is 29 feet above the lake level as on the date of survey, which may be regarded as ordinary high water. The pipe from A to B can be straight with a practically uniform grade. The ground is clear and there is no rock.\n\nFrom \"B\" to the building the ground first falls to an elevation of approximately 18 feet above the Lake Level, then rises to the building.\n\nIf this line is adopted it will probably not be considered advisable to place the Tank near the building as suggested in your letter, as to do so would necessitate either pumping over the ridge and through the hollow or carrying the pipe line at a considerably greater length around the southern side of the hill in a curve. (See the dotted line \"C - D\" - \"A\").\n\nIn any case, with this line the Pump house must be at the lake.\n\nHaving no information as to the estimated daily consumption, capacity of tank, or size of the pipe to be used, I am not able to say anything as to what protection from frost will be required for the tank.\n\nIf this is to be a consideration it can, of course, be more conveniently provided for if the tank is located as your letter suggests, in the rear of the buildings and near the Boiler Room. It should, however, be mentioned that owing to the steep slope and somewhat \"springy\" nature of the original surface here which has been built up with the loose clay and earth excavated from the foundation of the building,\nit will be necessary to pay greater attention to the foundation for the tank if placed at that point than if located elsewhere.\n\nAs has been made clear, the adoption of this route, while having the advantage of being entirely upon the property of the College, and absence of curve in the pipe line, has the disadvantage of requiring the Pump House to be at the Lake, and the tank at about 900 feet from the College Building. There is also the question as to whether the water at this point of intake will be found as pure as if taken further from the road, as at the point \"F\".\n\nThe alternative route marked \"C\"-\"E\" \"F\" as proposed involves crossing the Snide farm, for a distance, between the College Property boundary and the Lake shore, of 425 feet. This line which leaves the lake at or near the point marked \"F\" passes over an approximately level surface, through and along the margin of a swamp with a gradual rise which reaches an elevation above the Lake level of 14 feet at point \"E\", 1100 feet from the Lake, at which point the Pump House can be located.\n\nFrom \"E\" to the building at \"C\", the distance as measured on the survey tangents is 718 feet to the corner of the Boiler Room at the rear of the building at or near which the Tank will be located.\n\nThis line is open and the excavation cost, while slightly greater than that on line \"A\"-\"B\"-\"C\", owing to the necessity for greater depth where it crosses two small ridges, will not be materially greater, and may possibly be offset by the somewhat shorter pipe line called for.\n\nAs shown, the line is not straight but the curve, if thought objectional, can be eliminated by alteration in direction at the pump.\n\nWithout knowing the size and type of pipe which will be used, I am unable to estimate to what extent the friction through the 1100 feet will affect the lift.\n\nI have spoken to Mr. Snide as to the pipe line crossing his property and he has expressed himself as not opposed to it or in any way inclined to put obstacles in the way. He mentioned as a reasonable compensation $100.00, but afterward told me he was not disposed to \"Bargain\" and would accept any reasonable compensation. I am of the opinion that he will accept $50.00.\nAs will be apparent the advantages of this location are slightly shorter distance and its being possible to locate the Pump House within 700 feet of the College and the Tank as close as may be required, also the, probably, more desirable point of intake.\n\nThe disadvantage being that it is in part on the adjoining property.\n\nI have not thought it necessary at this stage to make more than a preliminary survey, or to prepare a profile of the two routes. If you will advise me as to which location has been selected I will at once complete the Survey and forward plan showing details.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

While there I gathered the information necessary to lay out the water supply system for the building and I beg to submit the following particulars.\n\nAdjoining the School property is a small lake indicated on the plan as Snide Lake and located approximately 2000 feet N.E. of the School building. An analysis of the water from this lake was made in the laboratory of the Provincial Department of Health at Halifax and found to be satisfactory for domestic purposes. The possibility of using a well as a source of supply was considered, but it was found on inquiry that well water in the vicinity of Shubenacadie was hard and unpalatable. Snide Lake is, therefore, recommended as a source of supply.\n\nBefore the most economical system could be decided upon it was necessary to ascertain if a continuous supply of electric power would be available at the School. On inquiring it was found that the local Electric Light Co. has been taken over by the Avon River Power Co. and they will be in a position to supply a continuous 24 hour service after July 1st of this year. With continuous electric power available a water supply system incorporating a pneumatic tank and automatic power pumps is recommended.\n\nThe layout of the proposed water supply system provides for a pump house, located approximately 700 feet to the rear of the School building and 1100 feet from the Lake. At this point the elevation of the pump house will be 14 feet above the water level of the lake and 15 feet below the basement level of the School. The suction pipe will be 5\" galvanized steel and the force main 4\" galvanized steel pipe. The pumping equipment\nwill consist of a Fairbanks Morse No 4340 self-oiling Typhoon power pump, belted to a ball-bearing motor, both mounted on steel base. This pump has a working pressure of 65 pounds and a capacity of 5000 gallons per hour.\n\nFor fire protection a Fairbanks Morse Centrifugal pump No 3264, 4\" with direct connected motor will be provided. The pump house will be 14' x 16' of brick construction and will house the pumps and a 4' x 16' pneumatic tank. The building will be heated by a stove.\n\nThe system contemplated will provide an ample supply of good water for all domestic purposes and an adequate fire protection.\n\nI would recommend that the installation be carried out by day labour under the supervision of Mr. Crowell, who has acted as Inspector of Construction on the work. Mr. Crowell is competent to supervise this work and the day labour basis will be the most economical way of having the system installed. All materials required will be purchased by the Department.\n\nThe following is an estimate of the cost:\n\n| Description                                      | Cost     |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Trenching, laying pipe and back filling          | $3,000.00|\n| Pipe and fittings                                | $3,000.00|\n| Pump house and equipment;                        |          |\n| Pump house                                       | $1,500.00|\n| Pumps                                            | $1,025.00|\n| Automatic motor starter and pressure regulator   | $200.00  |\n| Installation                                     | $200.00  |\n| Pressure tank and equipment                      | $1,000.00|\n| Electric pole line to pump house                 | $900.00  |\n| Miscellaneous                                    | $500.00  |\n| **Total**                                        | **$11,225.00** |\n\n[Signature]\n\nARCHITECT.\nIndian Residential School\nShubenacadie N.S.

The Department intends to proceed with the installation of this water supply system by day labour, under the supervision of Mr. Crowell. Plans are now being prepared here for the pump house, etc., and I would ask you to please lay out the pipe line from the lake to the schools, as indicated on Co. No. 7a, on the plans submitted with your letter. The point F to be located where you consider the best point for the intake. I would also ask you to kindly have a short agreement signed by the owner allowing the installation of the pipe line across his property. It is thought that a compensation of $60.00 for this privilege should be ample.\n\nFor your information I would say that it is the intention to erect the pump house at point E shown on your plans. The pipe from the lake to the pump house will be 8\" and from the pump house to the school 4\".\n\nIn view of the fact that there will be a regular supply of electric current available at the school after July 1, it is the intention to install a generator tank with automatic pumps. The tank will be located in the pump house. As it is desired to have this work started as soon as possible I would appreciate it if you could lay this line at your earliest convenience.\n\nWill you please advise me what your fees would be for making one inspection a week of the water supply system during its installation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy Min.

As soon as Mr. McKenzie has located the pipe line you may proceed at once with the necessary excavation, and if you will advise the Department when the work is commenced an accountable cheque will be sent you with which to pay the labourers. In the course of a few days a plan of the pump house will be sent you, also the name of the firm from whom you may purchase the necessary pipe. You might consult with Mr. McKenzie when he is making the survey for the pipe line as to the best system to adopt in carrying the pipe to a suitable depth in the lake, so as to ensure a satisfactory intake. Before you install the portion of the pipe in the lake I would ask you to please advise me how you propose to carry out this part of the work.\n\nI would ask you to also advise me if you think it necessary to have Mr. McKenzie visit the work once a week to check up your levels and pipe line, etc.\n\nFor your information I am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter which is today being sent to Mr. McKenzie.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

This is the situation here. Anticipating that you would start the barn by the first of June I permitted Wallace Gay to take the larger barn and at the same time the one in need of most repairs. The result is that now we are pressed for space. With about 75 tons of hay, 12 acres of oats, 3 to 4 acres of potatoes, about 1500 bushels of turnips, and many of the smaller vegetables, ready in from a month to three months, we will have no place to store them unless the barn is under way very soon. Speaking to Mr. Crowell he said that he could supervise the laying of the water line and look after the barn at the same time.\n\nI admit that I should not have allowed Gay to take the barn, but at the same time that barn would be of no use unless there were considerable repairs made on it.\n\nWe expect to start haying about the 20th of July, so will you please do the very best you can to provide a place to store it.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMr. J.D. MacLean\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nA barn will be required for the new Shubenacadie Indian Residential School. On my last visit to the School I discussed with the Reverend Principal the accommodation required in the barn. He has since forwarded a plan which will meet the requirements, and which can be built for approximately $6,500.00. Mr. Crowell, Inspector of Construction, is at present supervising the installation of the water supply system, and I beg to recommend for your consideration that the barn be erected by day labour, as Mr. Crowell will be able to look after the erection of this building while the other work is in progress.\n\nARCHITECT.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, June 24, 1929.\n\nMr. Orr,-\n\nMessrs.

In a day or so I will send you a detailed drawing showing the exact size of the concrete bases for the pumps with the bolts indicated, required for bolt up the frame to the concrete.

McKenzie,\n\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of July 3rd, and note instructions.\n\nI have already given Mr. Crowell line and grade stakes for that section of the pipe line between the Pump house and Lake, also line stakes on the pressure section; I will give him grade stakes on this section by the time he is ready for them.\n\nWith regard to this section, the line crosses a rather pronounced hollow over which I want if possible to carry the pipe on the surface for a short distance.\n\nThis will I think be quite feasible as the hollow in question should be filled in the natural course of Farm improvement, and I think this can be done at less than the cost of sinking the pipe as is, of course, necessary on the remaining portion of the line.\n\nI enclose herewith copy of the agreement to be signed by Messrs. Snide. This is for your approval.\n\nI have not as yet submitted it to Mr. Snide, but in discussing the matter a few days since he suggested the clause providing for payment for damage should it be found necessary at some future time when the land was under crop, to open the line or use the right of way in such manner as to cause additional damage.\n\nI have included that condition as it seems to me to be not unreasonable.\n\nYou will note also that I have mentioned the width of the strip or right of way over which the privilege is given as ten feet which should be ample for all purposes.\nI have also endeavoured to generally phrase the agreement so as to be capable of being interpreted as a perpetual Lease, otherwise I think it would be necessary to carry a termination clause which in this case would be undesirable.\n\nWill you kindly return this if it covers the situation, or otherwise prepare one which I will submit for signature.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nJuly 16, 1925.\n\nRev. Sirs:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 17th instant regarding the building of a new barn, I beg to say that the Department approved of the erection of a barn in accordance with the blue prints submitted by you, the work to be carried out by day labour under the supervision of Mr. Crowell. Time sheets should be kept for all labour and forwarded to the Department in duplicate. Accounts for all material should also be forwarded in duplicate duly certified to by yourself.\n\nOn application an accountable cheque will be sent to you to pay for labour on this work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing, Assistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Father Mackey,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nIndian Residential School\nShubenacadie N.S. July 12/29\n\nSir,\n\nRe concrete floors & bases, these were formed on the wall before the walls were plastered and when the putty coat was applied to the walls above the base in the travelling of it the lime putty water ran down over the base, and to get rid of these stains they mixed some of the art-rock color in water and used it as a color wash to come over these stains, with a result that this color rubs off very easy, if you put your hand over the base it is covered with true color and there is a streak across the base where the color has been rubbed off. The only finish the floors have received was a coat of linseed oil + gasoline mixed, with a the floors are all mottled in color, where they got a heavy coat they are one color, where the coat was thin they are lighter, and in doing the floors every strip seems to be a different shade, and where one strip of wood joins another + so received 2 coats on the lap the true color of the floor shows up. Your specification says these floors shall be finished in accordance with the Masters Builders specification or approved equal, you can see by referring to this specification or to my letter of March 30th that they are\nthis work must be varied with a way the same color as the floor, it is a part of the laying of these floors, as you will see by referring to the Act-2 specification. You will see by his letter he says we have given a first-class job & before that he says, We did not figure on doing that class of work and if we are compelled to vary that floor the same as a first-class it will cost us a lot of money. He seems to think this is a 2nd or perhaps a 3rd class job and this necessary varying is not necessary as this school is only for Indians to hold when he wanted to lay 2nd grade hardwood flooring. The leaks in the roof are around the outside walls and the roofer is here today attending to them.\n\nThere is a concrete slab or platform outside shop entrance door-way, it shows on the plan the same as other entrances which have this slab put in. We should also have door stops put on the base, to keep the door knobs from putting a hole in the plaster walls.\n\nand until this work is done I cannot say he has completed the contract to any satisfaction.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\n[Signature]\nJ.W. Brownell\nInspector of Contractors\nCopy.\n\nMr. Crowell\nInspector of Construction\nIndian School\nShubenacadie N.S.\n\nDear Mr. Crowell,\n\nWe are in receipt of your affidavit.\n\nNote what you say regarding furnishing of Indian School.\n\nI have been confined to my house with a bad cold all this week hence the delay in answering.\n\nI was under the impression that we had done everything in connection with School building that was called for in the specification and shown on plan.\n\nI do not know what more we can do to the basement floor other than what has been done.\n\nI never supposed for a moment that a floor of that kind would be wanted. In fact in the Master Builder's specification the warking is a warking is a separate process and can be specified by the Architect if so desired. We did not figure on doing that class of work and if we are compelled to wark that floor the same as a first class job in a private residence it will cost us a lot of money that we did not figure on. As I have already explained to you, the contract was taken at a very fine figure and owing to the delays which were caused.\nbeyond our control, there is no profit in the contract for us.\n\nWe want to do what is right, but I think any builder will bear me out in saying that we have no right in doing anything further to the basement floors.\n\nI consider we have given a first class job in that respect. Re. the leaks in the roof, I am writing Mr. Doucette and trust he will go to Shuter & Shooter at once and try to make everything satisfactory. We would make the building tight no matter if it had been taken over or not.\n\nRegarding the platform you speak of in the rear of the building. Was it two taken up with Mr. Burns? I do not understand why this was done was left off if it was supposed to be put there. I will take the matter up with him - or would you kindly have it done and send us the bill. I do not imagine it will amount to much.\n\nAs you know we have some $20,000 tied up in the building, besides our certified cheque and it is quite necessary that we get relieved from our obligation as soon as possible so as to get our money.\n\nIf you can do anything to expedite the taking over the building, I assure you it will be a great obligation to us.\n\nYour very Truly,\n\nA.

Curry\nRhodes Curry Ltd\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe are in receipt of a letter from the Dept of Indian Affairs saying you would like to have the building taken over and the final payment made.\n\nIf you will please finish the cement floors & bases, put a cement slab as shown on the plan outside the shop entrance doorway and there are about a dozen leaks in the roof that were pretty bad the last rain.\n\nIf you will kindly do this we will say your contract is finished and the final payment can then be made.\n\nYour very Truly,\n\nJ.

You, of course, understand that this Pipe is regularly supplied in random lengths averaging about 20' and if favored with your valued order we would supply as near as possible to the quantity specified, possibly the amount would vary slightly either way.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nfor AUSTEN BROS. LIMITED\n\n[Signature]\n\nHEA/DW\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nJuly 18, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nPrices were obtained for the piping required for the water supply system at the Shubenacadie School. The lowest quotation received was from Mr. L. Melvin, 6 Cunard St., Halifax, who quoted a price of $1,356.00 for 12 ft. Standard Lap Welded Galv. Steel pipe in 30 ft lengths with all necessary galvanized steel couplings required, which figures out at $1.13 per foot, also a price of $595.50 for 750 ft of 4\" Standard Lap Welded Galvanized Steel pipe in 30 ft lengths with all necessary galvanized steel couplings required, which figures out at $0.84 per foot.\n\nSince the line has been surveyed it may be that the amount of piping above mentioned may be incorrect. I would ask you, therefore, to order from Mr. L. Melvin the exact amount of piping you require in accordance with the above description. You should also order whatever piping is required to connect up the water supply system with the barn. Whatever further fittings are required you can have supplied by Peter Brown, who have been instructed to do the plumbing work required for this installation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nS. W. Crowell, Esq.,\nInspector of Construction,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nJuly 16, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant and note that work has commenced on the water supply system at the Amherst Indian School. The agreement as submitted appears to be satisfactory, and I am therefore returning it to you as requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Nelson,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. W. McKenzie, Esq.,\n12-13 Queen Street,\nHalifax, N.S.\nJuly 19, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the acceptance of the building from the Rhodes Curry Co. Ltd., it would appear that we are holding back rather a large amount for the amount of work required to complete the contract, and I would suggest that you issue a further certificate holding back an amount you think sufficient to cover the work that has not yet been completed to your satisfaction.\n\nWith reference to my letter of June 28th in which I enclosed a list of the pumping equipment, I beg to say that an order has today been placed with the Canadian Fairbanks Morse Co. for this equipment and they have been asked to ship this addressed to you, also to forward the accounts in duplicate which I would ask you to please certify to and return to the Department.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a blue print showing the exact sizes of the bases for the pumps.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing, Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Crowell, Esq.,\nInspector of Construction,\nEmbecoodie, No.5.\nJuly 19, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that your quotation of June 22nd amounting to $2,162.20 is accepted for the pumps and fittings, etc., as listed in your quotation.\n\nI would ask you to make shipment as early as possible, addressed to J. H. Crowell, Superintendent Indian Residential School, Shubenacadie, N.S. The accounts in duplicate should also be forwarded to Mr. Crowell.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nCanadian Fairbanks Morse Co.,\nOttawa.\nJuly 19, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that your price for the piping required for the new Subomacdie School is accepted but as there may be a slight variation in the quantity of pipe required, I have written to Mr. Crowell, the Inspector of Construction on this work, asking him to check up the exact amount of pipe required and place the order with you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

There has been other expenses for material in connection with the pump house, including lumber, gravel, buckets, etc. The freight on the gravel has been paid, that accounts for the cheque number being 1, 2, 4, not 1, 2, 3. All ploughing carting etc. has been done by the farm horses, but not charged. If you wish that to be charged against the water installation it can easily be done as we have the time of such work. Again the cheque for paying the men did not come till July 6th. and as the men were asking for their money before that I advanced the money to Mr. Crowell covering the amount of the cheques No. 1 and 2. The balance as you will see is $388.95, which will not be sufficient to cover the wages for the next week and the cost of material, so will you please let us have some more money. I have opened a second account at the bank for this work, so I hope I won't get things mixed up. When I have the receipts for the material purchased I will forward two copies to you. I have only one receipt for freight bills, will it be necessary to have three copies?\n\nPlease let me have a supply of envelopes of all sizes and color.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMr. J.D.

We expect to have a big crew on Monday next.\n\nEnclosed you will find a quotation from Beatty Bros. for the equipment necessary for this barn. As you have many of the barns at other Indian Schools equipped from Beatty Bros., you will know whether this quotation is a reasonable one. Really the only barn material we have in hand is the hay-fork and a few pulleys and about an hundred feet of rope.\n\nTo have the best results much of this material should be put in place during the course of construction of the barn and for that reason I hope you will be able to give this matter you immediate attention.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMr. J.D. MacLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 29th, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 23rd instant with reference to the new barn being built at the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School, you may accept Beatty Bros. quotation for the equipment necessary for this barn. With reference to the plan of the barn, you could obtain another copy of this from Beatty Bros., as the Department wishes to retain the copy sent here for record in this office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Deputy & Secty.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReference to progress on the pipe line for water supply to the Indian College at Shubenacadie, N. S.\n\nI wrote you some ten days since but through an oversight the letter was not mailed during my absence, of upwards of a week, from the Office. The letter referred to was in substance as follows:\n\nMr. Crowell has at the time of last inspection almost completed the laying of the Pipe and had the foundation and floor of the Pump House in, and walls about two feet above the floor.\n\nSome trouble and consequent delay was caused due to the walls of the excavation caving, but this was not of a serious nature and once the pipe was on the ground caused no delay.\n\nI thought it advisable to ask Mr. Crowell to leave the Pipe uncovered for a short time in order that we might note whether there was any tendency to sink or rest unevenly or in such a way as to cause undue strain, owing to soft bottom in sections of the trench.\n\nThis will not in any way inconvenience or impede Mr. Crowell as he had intended, (properly I think) to defer covering in the pipe until after the Pump had been installed and the system thoroughly tested.\n\nThis should be in about a week or ten days and when done and the Pipe covered I will forward you a Plan showing location and Profile of the pipe line.\n\nI take this opportunity to say that I think Mr. Crowell appears to be most capable and reliable and is doing the work both efficiently and economically and is taking every care to ensure its being satisfactory in so far as the installation is concerned.\nWith reference to the agreement for the Right to cross the lands of Messrs. Snide.\n\nI left copy of the agreement with the Rev. Father Mackie to be submitted to and discussed with the Snide Brothers but owing to their having been busy in connection with farm work I have only now been informed that the agreement is satisfactory and will be executed upon payment of the consideration, viz: $350.00\n\nWill you forward this amt. to me or to Father Mackie, or remit direct to Messrs. Snide.\n\nI would suggest that as the parties granting the concession on both elderly men it would be advisable to complete the matter with as little delay as possible.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

On Water Installation I have made a mistake and issued two cheques No. 10. The first was $113.20 for labor, and the other No. 10 was $27.61 freight on the pumps.\n\nYou will also find enclosed a freight bill for $59.36 for gravel. At the time the gravel came there was not sufficient money in the Water Installation account to pay it, so I took it from the School account; but that amount will be placed back in the School account at the time the bank books are balanced; the end of this month. So the real balance at the end of this month for Water Installation will be $655.09 less $59.36 -----$595.73.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. J.D. MacLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nDear Sir:\n\nWe are in receipt of yours of the 24th inst. stating you are returning our deposit security, which we presume we will receive in a day or so.\n\nAlso note what you say regarding basement floors, Indian School, Shubenacadie. Very sorry indeed that Mr. Orr did not let us know when he expected to be at the building so we could have met him in person and had everything made satisfactory.\n\nWe tried to give you a first class floor in the basement and our Superintendent was under the impression that he put the floor in according to specification.\n\nI wish you would let us know just what the Architect wants and if it is embodied in our contract for this building, to do additional work to the floor we will be only too glad to do so, but we are under the impression that we gave you a first class building, and we put in several things not called for, but if there is more work to be done, which our Company is called upon to do we would like to get it cleaned up so as to get the balance due us on this contract.\n\nWe will appreciate a letter from Mr. Orr stating just what he expects us to do.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nASC R\n\nPresident\nShubenacadie Indian Residential School\n\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nSept. 26th, 1929.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWill you please let me have more money for the Barn? As the time sheets shew we only have $155.65 and freight due on gravel which came this afternoon will leave us less than one hundred.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMr. J.D. MacLean,\nAsst.

If so will you please send some money to pay for this work. We will be ready to start it on the first rainy day.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMr. J.D. MacLean,\nAsst.

Since there is no provision for soap basins as they are at the present, and the matter of economy for the future I think it should be a good thing.\n\nFor the toilets it will be necessary to have a supply of odorizes?\n\nThe agent representing G.H. Wood & Company Ltd., 353 St. Nicholas Street, Montreal, was here last week and gave the following quotation.\n\nThe tank, piping, and taps for the battery of basins $91.00 each. (possible reduction)\n\n3I odorizes @ .75 each\n\n4 cases of blocks for odorizes 8 in a case, @ $12.50 a case\n\nThe odorizes at first were $1.50 but by the time we got through a considerable reduction was made.\n\nPerhaps if you took the matter up with the firm you could obtain better prices.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMr. J.D.

Davies also had the pleasure of quoting the Reverend Father Mackey of the Indian School in Shubenacadie, N.S., in connection with the disinfecting and air purifying of the fixtures of this School.\n\nWe find that you would require thirty-one of our Junior Oval Fixtures, finished in Oxidized Copper. We are pleased to quote you at $1.50 each less 50\u00a2, or 75\u00a2 net.\n\nZEF-IR CEAR JUNIOR OVAL BLOCKS\n\nare without a doubt the finest air purifying medium ever yet devised. They are manufactured from concentrated, highly volatile chemicals and will do their work efficiently and satisfactorily. These blocks are packed in sets of eight and are priced at $1.50 a set. To refill the thirty-one Fixtures you will require four sets containing thirty-two Blocks.\n\nHoping to receive your instructions in this regard we are,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG.H. Wood & Company Limited\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Manager\n\nZEF-IR PRODUCTS Blocs, Blockettes, Crystals.\n\"ZEF-IR\" Blocs are an indispensable adjunct to the ventilating system of any building.\n\nThey do not merely overcome one odor with another. They actually correct the condition of the air by breaking up the carbon dioxide (foul gases) into free oxygen again, thus conserving health.\n\nFor this reason \"ZEF-IR\" Blocs are ideally suited for use in industrial plants, office buildings, hospitals, etc., in fact wherever conditions demand continuous purification of the air.\n\nStandard Equipment in Modern Buildings!\n\n\"Zef-ir\" Blocs give off invisible vapors which quickly penetrate every corner of the room and so rapidly and pleasingly neutralize all noxious odors.\n\n\"Necessary Sanitary Equipment for Every Public Washroom.\"\n\nZEF-IR BLOCS\n\nIndispensable for Lavatories and Washrooms\n\nPurify the Air...\n\n\"ZEF-IR\" Blocs are moulded under high pressure resulting in these features:\n\n1. 97% of the material in \"ZEF-IR\" Blocs goes into the air in the form of vapor. Evaporation is uniform throughout and there is no residue.\n\n2. \"ZEF-IR\" Blocs being moulded under high pressure are compact, which assures long lasting action over a given period.\n\n3. A set of six \"ZEF-IR\" Blocs will last for more than a year, will actually last that long.\n\n4. \"ZEF-IR\" Blocs are the best means of purifying and purifying in Washrooms, Bathrooms, Theatres, Offices, etc., \u2014 they are clean and pleasing.\n\n5. The Blocs are clean to handle and easy to stock. They are attractively finished and in attractive packages.\n\"ZEF-IR\" Blocs are made in four odors, Cedar, Lilac, Rose and Oriental Bouquet. They are all very effective and pleasant.\n\nThere is an element of psychological appeal that is often overlooked in the theatre, exclusive shop, or waiting room. That is the appeal to the sense of smell. \"ZEF-IR\" caters to that sense\u2014by an indefinable fragrance in the atmosphere, supplying the final touch of distinctiveness.\n\nPlease the 5th Sense!\n\"Purify the Air\"\n\nProprietors of Hotels, Theatres and Public Buildings will instantly appreciate the appeal to the fifth sense of \"ZEF-IR\" Blocs. They purify the air effectively and pleasantly.\n\nZEF-IR CRYSTALS\n\nAdaptable for Hotel Rotundas\n\nQuickly! Pleasantly!\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6058, file 265-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nCompact Outfits Last One Year\n\nThere is real satisfaction in solving your air purifying problem with \"ZEF-IR\" Blocs. Each outfit contains a wall case and six Blocs, that will last the full period claimed.\n\n\"Zef-ir\" Crystals\n\n\"ZEF-IR\" Crystals may be sprinkled in inaccessible corners and apertures. Theatres find them especially helpful in reconditioning the air in auditoriums.\n\nHandy Shaker top Cans\n\nThree standard odors: Lilac Rose and Oriental Bouquet\n\n\"Zef-ir\" Blockettes\n\n\"ZEF-IR\" Blockettes or urinal cakes are indispensable for keeping toilets sanitary and free from offensive odors. They are purposely made insoluble in water so that the constant flow of water against them will not dissolve the Blockettes.\n\nCedar Moth Blocs\n\n\"ZEF-IR\" Cedar Moth Blocs have certain characteristics which makes them highly effective against moths. Cedar has long been known as a moth repellent in itself, and combined with other effective ingredients \u2014 our Cedar Moth Blocs, positively destroys moths and their larvae.\n\nThe gases they liberate are five times heavier than air and penetrate to the most remote part of piled or stored textiles.\n\nThe Blocs do not impart any odors that cling to the goods.\nG.H.WOOD & COMPANY\nLIMITED\nOWNING AND OPERATING\nLIQUID SOAP\nAND\nSANITARY PRODUCTS\nCOMPANY\n\n353 St. Nicholas Street,\nMontreal, Que.,\nOctober 18th, 1929.\n\nDeputy Minister,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOur representative, Captain H.P. Devien, had the pleasure of interviewing the Reverend Father MacKay at the Indian School of Shubenacadie, N.S., in connection with the proposed installation of\n\nLIQUID SOAP EQUIPMENT\n\nin the lavatories of that school.\n\nWe find that this school is equipped with two lavatories each having fourteen wash basins. The complete cost of Liquid Soap Valves, Tanks, etc., to be supplied with this installation would be $185.00. This is a very close figure and we sincerely hope we will receive your order covering this service.\n\nLik-wid Brand Liquid Toilet Soap can be supplied at the price of $1.50 per gallon in drum lots of fifty gallons, f.o.b. Montreal.\n\nLiquid Soap is, without a doubt, the finest service ever devised for the prevention of the spread of contagious diseases. It will also serve to keep your lavatories clean and orderly and is without a doubt, much more economical than the ordinary common bar of soap.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG. H.

H. Wood & Company have written the Department direct. I have referred them back to you. If you are considering the installation of this equipment, I believe you should have their quotation, as forwarded to the Department. They have quoted on liquid soap valves, tanks, etc., installed on wash basins, for $185, and 75\u00a2 net on the junior oval fixture, finished in oxidized copper. The soap itself and the deodorant, on which they quote $1.50 per gallon and $12.50 per set of 8, respectively, will have to be purchased from school funds, as they are considered current expenses. This is all provided you are satisfied that this installation is advisable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. J. P.

It appears that these floors have been improperly laid and it is felt that if the workmen entrusted with this work had taken more time the result would not have been so unsatisfactory. If the floors had been laid in accordance with the specifications the result would have been a hard smooth surface and I am sure you will agree if you examine these floors that such is not the case. In the meantime I am instructing Mr. Crowell to issue a further certificate and suggesting that he hold back a thousand dollars until the floors have been put in proper shape.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The prices in the locality are more extreme than they were a year ago. Could you purchase them through the Dept. of Agriculture and ship them down here?\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir,\n\nWith reference to the account submitted recently in favour of Power Bros. Limited amounting to $1,027.16, I beg to say that a cheque is being forwarded to them for this amount less $77.80, which covers two items, one for express and freight - $48.60, and one for board expenses, - $29.20. This balance will be paid if you obtain from Power Bros. and forward to the Department receipts for the express and freight also receipts for the board expenses.\n\nA further advance of $500.00 is being sent you for the payment of labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The cheque for that amount usually would be issued on the following Tuesday, Nov. 26th. But at that time we only had a balance of $158.80. So I used my personal account in order to pay the men. I received your cheque for $500.00 this morning. After depositing the $500.00 and issuing a cheque for $269.80 the balance is as shown on the time sheet, viz. $388.00.\n\nEnclosed also is freight bill for $1.16.\n\nFor the week ending Nov. 30th, the time sheets call for $234.60 which will be paid to the men tomorrow. A freight bill of $4.12 for material for clothes closets etc. will only leave a balance of $148.12, which will not be sufficient to pay the men for this week.\n\nThe end of this week will practically see the Barn finished, but there remains considerable work in the school. So will you please let me have some more money.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. J.B. MacLean\nAsst. Deputy Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\n\nIndian Affairs.

Father MacKay, the Department of Highways of Nova Scotia, supplied seven carloads of crushed gravel, from their crushing plant at Debert, Colchester County. This gravel was used in connection with fixing up the road, leading to, and around the school.\n\nFather MacKay promised that he would arrange through your Department to pay for these carloads.\n\nWe attach, hereto, bill, amounting to $18.85, covering our cost of the gravel at the plant, plus freight charges from Debert to Shubenacadie.\n\nKindly let us have your cheque at the earliest possible date, as we wish to include this amount in the accounts of our year. We would be very glad if you would have cheque reach us before the 15th instant.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nChief Accountant\nDepartment of Highways\nHalifax, N.S.\n\nHEP:OCR\n\nIndian Affairs.

The first five car-loads were looked after by the Dept. of Highways as to unloading, spreading etc. Those five car-loads took them up near the school, and that was as far as they were prepared to go. The other four car-loads were looked after by us. The freight was prepaid, and for a time I had the freight receipts but the Dept. of Highways asked for them so I sent them on. I kept a copy and the four first mentioned on their list are the ones I looked after, the freight charges on them are correct.\n\nFrom the appearance of things I think that the Dept. of Highways will take it upon themselves to look after the labor in connection with the unloading etc. for Mr. Black, Minister of Highways gave me to understand that the work on the road proper would be done on that basis.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMr. J.D.

McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRhodes, Curry Limited, Contractors of this Town, who built the new school for the Indians at Shubenacadie, have consulted me in reference to an amount of $1,000 which is being withheld from them on account of an adverse report that has been filed with the Department by J. W. Crowell, the Inspector appointed, I presume, by the Government to inspect this particular work.\n\nA perusal of the correspondence would indicate that the floors in the basement and some other parts of the building were not in the condition called for by the Specifications. At first I was inclined to believe there was some faulty construction but on going into the matter fully with the Contractors I find the complaint of Mr. Crowell is that the surface of these floors was not waxed. I quote from the Specifications as follows:\n\n\"Finish of Concrete Floors - All concrete floors in basement and bathrooms and toilets on all other floors shall be finished with a topping of color mix in accordance with the specifications of the Master Builders Company or approved equal. The floors when finished shall be absolutely dust proof and water proof and trowelled to a hard smooth surface. The floors shall be finished in red and to the thickness of \u00bc.\"\nI respectfully call your attention to the fact that under the Master Builders Company if the floors constructed as set out in the above Specifications are to be waxed, that is to be so specified by the architect. No such specification is to be found, and if that is the only complaint of Mr. Crowell and it is not a part of the contract I do not see how the Department is justified in withholding the money.\n\nThis would be an extra in my opinion. If the Department wished the floors waxed it would cost in the vicinity of $1,200.\n\nIf there is any doubt about this contention I wish you would look into it and advise me as to the attitude of the Department.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJAHAT.\nSir,\n\nI enclose to you herewith the report of Mr. Crowell's work during the month of December at the College Building and the expenses charged by the Department were for meals only.\n\nMr. Crowell informed me he worked 25 days during the month and forwarded vouchers accordingly.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nD.B.

The specifications stipulate that the floors are to be trowelled to a hard, smooth surface. This has not been done, and if you will examine these floors you will find that they have either been laid by inexperienced workmen or sufficient time was not taken to properly trowel the surface. Some time ago the Rhodes Curry Co. were advised that the Department expected them to put these floors in a proper condition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F.

Pump house has been built, pressure tanks & pumps installed, and the entire system is now giving good service.\n\nBarn has been completed including installation of water, lighting & drain from root cellar.\n\nWe have built wardrobes in the dormitories with accommodation for 56 pupils. 2 large dish cupboards for the dining room & one each for sisters' dining room, kitchen & men's dining room.\n\n20 tables, linoleum covered tops for the dining rooms; and 30 benches. A large table for the sisters' dining room. 2 large tables for the reading rooms. 1 large table for the sisters' community room.\n\nStationery cabinet for school supplies.\n\nShelving in the store-room & laundry.\n\nA cabinet for bread, a large pine covered table for the kitchen & small one for the bakery.\n\nWe have also installed the altar railing, Pews for the chapel, sewing room tables & counter.

You are the only one who knows the arrangements made when you were here last September. His letter will explain just what has been done and what work remains to be done on the interior of the building. I need not tell you that he has been working right along and at the same time figuring out the plans you left with us, giving me the amount and the kind of material most suitable to the work. Of course there were times when I thought that the work was not going fast enough, but I honestly think that we can show value for the money expended. If you do not feel that you would like to have his time extended again then I suppose I can keep him on the pay-roll here. We really need a small combination ice and milk house, an implement shed, hen-house, and a place for pigs, and a root cellar as the one in the building is not at all satisfactory. I would like to have Crowell till those things are finished, although it looks queer to have a foreman for two men, but as was understood when you were here he is a working foreman.\n\nHoping that you will drop me a line soon and let me know what you think is the best solution.\n\nWith kind regards to yourself and Mrs. Orr.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

In the two dormitories in the wings we have yet to build 16 lockers of four sections each, 8 in each dormitory, allowing for the accommodation of thirty-two pupils in each. Also shelving in the linen store room and a cabinet of small size in the pharmacy room. Doors and windows will have to have some attention as they are not working as they should. Between the window sills and the granite is the place where the rain seems to be getting in and in order to save the plaster it will be necessary to have that matter attended to.

When we received the bills the prices seemed to be rather high, so they allowed $2.50 on the hook-strip, but they did not really deduct it, so I did it myself, and for good measure took another hundred off.\n\nOn the other account an allowance of $48.00 because we were going to ship them back if they did not make that allowance for what we considered poor workmanship.\n\nI have signed my name to them and trust they will go through.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMr. A.F.

This will all be expended by tomorrow and there will be $576 due to J.W. Crowell, since I was to pay him from this account from the first of March to 21st inclusive, 18 working days @ $6.00 = $108.00.\n\nIn the School account, at the present moment there is something over a hundred dollars in the Bank, but outstanding bills are well over the thousand mark. So I will issue a check for the full amount in the Bank in part payment for one of the many outstanding accounts. So the end of March will show no cash on hand. Will send you a statement in a day or so covering Dec., Jan., Feb., and March.\n\nI suppose it will be alright to pay J.W. Crowell when I receive a grant for the remainder of the work sometime in April.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMr. A.F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary\nReverend Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith Departmental cheque No. 8356 for $54.36 in favour of Mr. J.W. Crowell, balance due him as shown on your labour return of the 22nd instant.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.H. Paget,\nChief Accountant.\n\nRev. J.F.

This work was as time sheets will show, was finnished on Friday the 21st, inst.\n\nThe remainder of the interior work only includes the shelving of the linen room and one of the store rooms on the third floor, also the stand for rubbers etc just inside the recreation rooms, and a few odds and ends. But as there is no money in the bank for this work I think that you would advise not doing any work till after the first of April. So I will make arrangements with Mr. Robinson to make a start about that date. I hope his work will be as satisfactory as that done by Crowell and Stevens but I am afraid.\n\nIn the meantime I hope that you will send me money about the first of the month to pay for this work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Asst.

Rice pudding and apple pies in the oven for three hours and not cooked is to say the least a bit provoking.\n\nThe kitchen range is a McLary and I don't think the trouble is there. With the wind in a certain direction the stove has no draught. The only solution is to build the chimney five to ten feet higher. If you ever had trouble of this kind in your home you will realize that the sooner the difficulty is adjusted the better for all concerned. There has been complaints from that quarter for some time, today was the limit.\n\nWill you please let me know if I may go ahead and have the work done.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6055, file 205-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nIndian Residential School.\n\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nMarch 24th, 1970\n\nDear Sir:\n\nConcerning the outbuildings which we think are needed:\n\nHen House\n\nEnclosed faded plan, we would like to add ten feet in order that we might have space for feed-room.\n\nDairy\n\nA dairy house to suit twenty-five cows, with accommodations for cleaning milk cans. Under the same roof we would have the ice house. From what they have at the other schools you will know better than I could tell you what is really required.\n\nImplement Shed.\n\nAbout eighty feet long by twenty-five feet, which would allow for work shop and blacksmith shop at one end. Where machinery which would not be used during the winter is stored, we would propose hinged doors, otherwise doors on rollers. A good deal of the lumber could be had from the old barn, which I think is to be torn down. As for the roof we would like high enough to give us space to store in winter the screens and in summer the double windows. We have not space to store these things in the school.\nRoot Cellar\n\nTaking down the old farm house we thought that the cellar could be converted into a root-cellar without any great expense. A coating of cement on the inside of the stone wall and raising the foundation a foot or two above ground, a cement floor with a drain of tile pipe. The present drain has been blocked up for some time. A double roof with straw or shavings in between would we think give us something as near frost proof as anything we can think of.\n\nStore house\n\nWe hope that the day is not far distant when we will buy our flour and feed by the carload. So we think that there should be a building about the size and form of a box-car built in order that we would have a place to store flour and feed.\n\nAs to the cost of these buildings frankly I don't know and with Crowell gone I have no one that I could ask with any confidence.\n\nPig house\n\nSomething for about twenty-five hogs, about fifty feet by twenty-five alley way down centre and pens on either side, also space at one end for a slaughter house. I should not mention the enclosed sketch but it is to try and give you an idea of about where we think the buildings should be placed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. A.F.

We have not space to store these things in the school.\nOttawa, April 1, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th ultimo, with reference to outbuildings at the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School. I note that a henhouse, a dairy, a utility building (implement shed, workshops and store room), a root cellar, a storehouse and a hogpen are required. Only limited funds are available for improvements at your school this year, and I should be glad if you would list these in order of their urgency, so that the Department can make a decision as to what shall be done this summer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Secondly the Implement shed. At the present time we have a certain amount of feed which could be used for hogs, and at the same time it would be very convenient to have a dairy. So I cannot say which is more urgent. As regards the Store house, I suppose we could continue buying flour and cow feed in small quantities. We would like to give the children, at least the ones who are not strong, eggs and milk, but if the hen house cannot be built this year, then we can only do the best that we can.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.F.

Sir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 11th instant, with further reference to the outbuildings at the Shubenacadie School, will you please advise me the approximate size of the root cellar contemplated, also the type of construction and the location where you would suggest this root cellar should be built. Please advise also the approximate size of the implement shed required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing, Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. Father Mackey,\nPrincipal, Shubenacadie School,\nSHUBENACADIE, N.S.\nMay 5th, 1930.\n\nMEMORANDUM: Mr. Feller.\n\nRe:- Shubenacadie Residential School.\n\nMAIN BUILDING:\n\nFather Mackey reports that, with a driving rain storm, there is a considerable leakage of water on every floor on the front of the building. This damage the plaster on all the floors and seeps through to the basement. The sub-contractor on the roof (from Dartmouth, Halifax) examined the roof and it was decided that it was not the fault of the roof. Father Mackey further states that he has heard of similar complaints at other buildings throughout the Province where \"blue-nose\" brick was used.\n\nBARN:\n\nFather Mackey stated that practically all the barns in Nova Scotia have lightning rods. He wished this matter to be brought to your attention and, if the Department considers this equipment necessary on the barn at the Shubenacadie School, Father Mackey has secured a quotation from Ettinger Bros. of $126.40 for the complete installation.\n\nPUMP AND PUMP HOUSE:\n\nThe pump is not working properly and Mr. McKenzie, who surveyed the place, intends to visit Shubenacadie about May 5th and give Father Mackey some information regarding it. Following Mr. McKenzie's visit, Father Mackey will write the Department and I considered that, on receipt of this letter, it might be advisable to write the makers of the pump, viz., Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Co., who might be able to give some expert advice regarding its operation. The local agent of the Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Co. was unable to advise Father Mackey exactly what action to take to remedy the difficulty.\n\nBASEMENT FLOOR IN MAIN BUILDING:\n\nFather Mackey states that this floor still requires some attention. He further stated that he understood that a certain amount had been withheld from the contractor with a view to having this condition of the floor remedied. If so, the contractor has not yet taken any action.\nCurrie\n\nDept wishes to determine offers for new printing site. \u2014 Do you advise form lots to north present property for the flag site or can a better site be selected between these town lots railroad.\nOttawa, May 7, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nMr. Phelan's report concerning the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School is now on file, and I wish to refer to one or two questions arising therefrom. The Department Architect, on receipt of a letter from you, concerning the pump, will discuss the question with a representative of the Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Company. Mr. Orr has given considerable thought to the basement floor and has done and is doing everything possible to have the contractor remedy the condition. It is not the policy of the Department to install lightning rods on the barns at Indian residential schools. The report concerning water coming in at the front of the building during a driving rain has been noted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. J. P.

If I had that information then I intended writing Fairbanks-Morse, giving them whatever other details I could give and asking for a solution why the bigger pump is not working as it should. We have already burned out one set of brushes, made a test without the load, read what instructions were given, came to the conclusion that either there was not enough electric current or the pump was overloaded. Had the current tested a few days ago and we are certainly getting 220 volts. So my humble opinion is that the five horse power for the 5000 gallon under the pull that it has here is not enough. The smaller pump of three horse power and 2500 capacity works well.\n\nIf you have the information that I have been looking for I wish you would take the matter up with Fairbanks-Morse.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I took Mr. Dunne, our Superintendent along with me, and examined the floors thoroughly. I must say I was very much surprised that fault could be found with floors such as we put in that building.\n\nFather MacKey pointed out the bad places - there was only one - about four feet square in the Girls Play Room and one about the same size in the Dining Room.\n\nThe steps have been worn some, mostly on account of the children's boots. I noticed in the Boys section of the building, even the steel nosings have been worn.\n\nIt is almost impossible to keep any kind of a concrete floor in shape without some treatment. I would advise you to authorize putting on two coats of Hippo oil. I do not know of anything better for floors. We would be willing to rub down the rough places with fine carborundum and would do anything in reason to assist, but must say in all the buildings I have been in for the last year or so, I have not seen a better concrete floor than what we have put in that building.\n\nI do not think it fair to hold up $1000.00 of our money for a small item like that, and I trust you will see your way clear to authorize the payment of the balance due us. I assure you we would appreciate receiving this payment, very much.\n\nYours very truly\n\n[Signature]\n\nPresident\n\nASC R\nJuly 10, 1930.\n\nDear Father Mackey,\n\nSome time ago Mr. Curry of the Rhodes Curry Co., contractors for the Shubenacadie School, called at this office with reference to the payment which has been held back by the Department until the floors were properly finished.

When I paid the men last Monday I had not sufficient funds, and this morning I paid Fred Robinson his thirty-six dollars by check. I received the check for three hundred last evening. This being the end of the week the wages due, which will be paid Monday the 11th, amounts to $170.40, leaving a balance of about $100.00.\n\nThere are only seven men working now, foremen, two carpenters, and four laborers. These laborers are doing rough carpenter work at the rate of forty cents an hour. During the election campaign and the uncertainty that has come as a result of the change you will readily understand that it has not been to the benefit of the work in hand. Since the telegram the other day I think that things are moving along a little better.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

Note that balance is $66.37.\n\nAs intimated in a previous letter I am not satisfied that the work has been going on as it should, especially for the last month. The foreman himself says that they will be through on the 28th inst. He does not mean by that that the work will be completed. But that the workers of the party in power will take over the work. I had a note from Mr. Foster some time ago saying that he had recommended another foreman. Mr. Foster is the defeated candidate in this constituency.\n\nThe money I have on hand will pay for three days this week, and I propose to lay them off then and wait to see what will be the outcome of all the talk. I don't think that any other crowd of men could do any less than the present crew. I am disgusted with them.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Asst.

For the past week with prevailing southerly winds the kitchen has been filled with gas, and it was almost impossible to provide the meals, as under those conditions there is scarcely any draught. The estimate we submitted was high because it means taking out the granite, and placing it higher. If that were not done it would certainly give a queer appearance to the chimneys.\n\nI do wish that you would have something done about it.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.F. MacKenzie, Esq.\nActing Asst.

It is thought, however, that it would not be necessary to obtain hose of as large a diameter as mentioned by you, viz., 3\". Would not 1\u00bd\" be sufficient? However, the Department will leave this matter in your hands to obtain the hose of a size which you consider advisable. In arranging for the purchase, you should follow the general instructions which have already been sent you. Care should be taken to see that the hose is kept in a good serviceable condition, is tested from time to time and thoroughly dried after use. Please obtain an account, in duplicate, from the firm from whom the purchase is made. This you should certify in the usual manner and forward to the Department for payment.\n\nWill it be necessary to obtain a reel on which to wind the hose when not in use?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Furthermore we have (3200) volts on the heavy wires coming on the property and a transformer not more than 150 feet from the pump house, and the pump house and barn are the only connections from this transformer.

In the five 90 degree elbows, the first one is in the lake, ten feet below water line, and the pipe from lake for a distance of fifty feet is lower than low water mark. After entering pump house the suction pipe is reduced to three inches, connection from the five inch pipe to the larger pump. Three inch is the size of the suction entrance to this pump. For the smaller pump reduction is to two and one-half inch, and the connection is from the five inch pipe and not from the three. So in all the suction line we have about two feet and a half of two and a half inch pipe. As you will readily understand the party who wrote this letter was misinformed.\n\nRefer to the last sentence of para. 6. We may say that the pumps are regulated to cut in at 45 lbs. pressure and cut out at 65 lbs. Yet this pump will not function at 45 lbs.\n\nPara. 8. Before consulting with your representatives at Halifax, we had a man from the Avon River Power Co. come and test the voltage with a voltmeter. We have no reason to assume that he did not tell the\nYou say that the smaller pump is connected into the same suction line as the larger outfit. This is always considered very bad practice; we have never yet seen two pumps working on a common suction line and both give good satisfaction. Of course, if they never use both together, it will be alright to use one suction line. It is reasonable to expect the smaller outfit to perform fairly well with the 24\" suction line because of its smaller capacity. You do not say whether or not they ever tried to operate both pumps at the same time.\n\nWe feel that the installation, in as far as the suction line is concerned is very bad, and in itself would make it evident that the pump would never work. Then on top of that, we are not at all convinced that the voltage on the electric circuit is all that is stated from the Rev. Mr. MacKay's replies to our questions.\n\nUnless you can get some definite information in reply to our questions, we cannot go any further in the way of recommendations.\"\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE CANADIAN FAIRBANKS-MORSE COMPANY LIMITED.\n\nBy\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This 5\" suction line would reduce your total friction and static suction lift to something about 30 feet. Even with a 6\" suction line you would have too great a suction lift to enable the pump to deliver full capacity.\n\nWe have discussed the suction conditions. We think there is only one real way to ascertain what the pump is doing in as far as the discharge is concerned, and that is to place a pressure gauge in the discharge line and determine accurately the pressure against which the pump is working. You must be sure to get a gauge that is correctly calibrated, as we find many of the gauges about the country are out 10 to 15 lbs. In fact it would be very useful information to put a vacuum gauge on the suction right next to the pipe and see what vacuum is being produced and also know what pressure the pipe is developing. I think that you will find that the pump is delivering against a pressure of least 10 lbs higher than the ultimate pressure in the tank. We assume that the statement that the pump delivers against 65 lbs means that the pressure in the tank is 65 lbs.\n\nIf you find that the pump is delivering immediately at its discharge, 75 lbs or more, it is possible that you are overloading the 5 H.P. motor. We can only guess at this point, until you get somebody to put gauges on this pipe and let us get some real information.\n\nWe note the Rev. Mackey states that the voltage is 220 when the motor is running. This looks like a guess. Does he get that from a voltmeter or does he only assume? The same is true with regard to cycles. We have never yet seen a current that was 100% perfect, as indicated by Mr. Mackey's replies Nos. 9 and 10.\n\nNow in connection with Mr. Mackey's statement that the motor is too light for the pump, if you are only delivering against 65 lbs pressure at the top, the motor is not too light for the job. If you are delivering against higher pressures it is quite possible that it is too light, but until you have definitely established that you are delivering against pressures in excess of 65 lbs, we cannot say that the motor is overloaded. When the motor left here was in a first class condition, it may be that something has occurred which has disturbed its set-up arrangement. If you will make a minor test you can see whether or not the motor is in good order. If you have no voltmeter, and cannot get a volt reading, when the motor is running, you may be able to get an idea of whether or not the voltage is up to 220. If you disconnect the motor from the pipe and just run the motor light and see if it comes up to speed. If it does not come up to speed and running light, you know perfectly well that the voltage is not up and even with the current required to run the motor light. A motor should run at the full 1200 R.P.M. when light, if the voltage is up to 220. If the voltage is below 220 and the motor runs slow, even when running light, you can be sure that when the motor is working to 3/4 or full load, that the conditions will be infinitely worse.\n179 LOWER WATER STREET\nHALIFAX, N.S.\nAugust 25th, 1930.\n\nRev. J. F. MacKay,\nIndian Residential School,\nSMYTHSONVILLE, N.S.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn receipt of your letter of the 5th instant enclosing questionaire we forwarded same along to our Montreal office. We are this morning in receipt of the following letter from them regarding your pumping outfit.\n\n\"Your letter of the 5th, instant received, and we have read same, and also noted the answers to our questions that the Rev. Mr. MacKay has given us.\n\nWe note, in the first instance, that the 2\u00bd\" suction line is 11\u00bd ft. long, that it has five 30 deg. elbows, and that the static lift is 17 feet. The five elbows are equivalent to 25 feet of linear pipe, therefore, the length of the suction is equivalent to 1305 feet. With the pump running at capacity, namely 85 gallons per minute, the friction will be equivalent to 100 feet, and with the 17 feet static lift the total suction lift would be 115 feet. Now, this is an impossible condition, and the pump will never pump to full capacity. The 2\u00bd\" suction line will not give more than 1200 to 1500 gallons per hour through the 11\u00bd feet with 5 elbows and 17 feet static lift. That is to say, with the full vacuum that it is reasonable to expect, this is the maximum amount of water that it can be depended upon to discharge. This condition will cause a self-ailing typhoon pump to hammer badly.\n\nWe had exactly the same condition in the building next door to us with a 5000 gallon typhoon operated by a Fairbanks Morse 1\u00bd H.P. motor operating against a pressure of 100 lbs. The pump hammered and banged and made such terrific noise that we had to do something. We tried two things, and found that both worked. We slowed the pump down so that it would pump only the capacity that the suction line would deliver under normal suction conditions. The pump worked smoothly. However, we did not have enough water, so we enlarged the suction pipe and speeded up the pump, and it worked perfectly.\n\nFrom past experience we are inclined to believe that most of your trouble is due to the suction being far too small. In order that the\n\nMontreal, Quebec, Saint John, Ottawa, Toronto, Windsor, Winnipeg, Regina, Saskatoon, Edmonton, Calgary, Vancouver, Victoria\n179 LOWER WATER STREET\nHALIFAX, N.S.\nAugust 7th, 1930.\n\nRev.

MacKey,\nIndian Residential School,\nSHUBNACADIA, N.S.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe writer has been in communication with our Montreal office in connection with your pumping outfits which Mr. Graham and myself came up to see sometime ago. We are very sorry that we have kept you waiting so long but are unable to give you any definite report until such time as we receive information from our Head Office. We are therefore going to ask you if not too much trouble to try and give us a drawing of the pumping outfits as they are now installed also to answer to the best of your knowledge the questions which we are forwarding along with this letter as this seems to be the information required by our Head Office.\n\nTrusting you will be able to forward this information in the course of a few days and we can then forward same along to our Head office in Montreal.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE CANADIAN FAIRBANKS-MORSE COMPANY LIMITED.\n\nBy\n\nH.

I have gone as far as I can and the office in Halifax say that the matter will have to be taken up with the Branch office where the pumps were bought. As you will note I had two men from the office in Halifax up here. They sent in a report and then I was asked to answer a number of questions. The letter enclosed is their reply to those answers. A representative from the Montreal office was in Halifax when I happened along and he said that he would come up that day and look it over. He never came. I cannot say how many times I have taken the matter up with the Halifax branch, and I feel now that I can do no more. I wanted them to take out the big pump and put in another small one, but the pair in Halifax have washed their hands of the whole affair. The little pump has been doing all the work and doing it well but should it ever go wrong we would be in one terrible mess.\n\nWill you please see what can be done.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

J. P. Mackey of the Indian School at Shubenacadie. My work through the Provinces is visiting such Institutions as yours and checking over their Kitchen Equipment, etc., and I find that there are two items which I am sure will be both a time and financial saving to this Institution, namely, the Potato Peeler and Bread Slicer.\n\nThe Berkel Products are known throughout Canada, the States, and the Old Country as makers of the World's Best Machines. We do considerable Government work in Institutions and I hope within a few days to have the pleasure of showing the Rev. Mr. Mackey an actual demonstration of our equipment when he comes through to Halifax. I would appreciate if any action is taken by your Department in the purchase of such equipment, anything you can do. Although not knowing you personally, I have just recently come from Ottawa and had my office in the same building and am a personal friend of Mr. George A. Connolly of your Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. D. Irvin, Representative,\nP. O. Box 54,\nHalifax, N.

McWilliam,\nMontreal House.\n\nDear Mr. McWilliam:\n\nI am taking the liberty of enclosing herewith file of correspondence regarding some pumps sold by Montreal House through the Department of Indian Affairs for the Indian Residential School at Shubenacadie, N.S.\n\nI am calling your personal attention to the fact that we do not seem to be making much progress toward the cleaning up of what seems to be a very complicated situation as you will note that my letter of July 10th to Mr. Wilson has not been replied to. May I also draw your attention to Father MacKay's letter of August 3rd. I met this gentleman in our Halifax Office in the early spring. He told me the whole story and I thoroughly believe that there is some problem connected with this installation which should be gone into by an expert on the ground. Whether this is a matter for you or the Ottawa Officials to determine is for you to decide.\n\nMeantime, I would like to say that in talking with Father MacKay last spring I told him definitely that, before fall, this problem would be cleaned up, because from what I have seen and heard from our own service men who have visited this installation, as well as what Mr. Ross has told me, and as outlined in the enclosed correspondence, there is a condition there which requires immediate action.\n\nYou will note that a 5000 gallon Unit cannot be used and that Father MacKay has recommended its replacement with a 4000 gallon Unit for the reason that he already has one Unit of this capacity which works satisfactorily. The entire water supply for a very large community is dependent upon this one pump. I understand Father MacKay to say that last winter he carried water for several months and they are almost entirely without fire protection as well.\n\nIt would seem to be a matter for concerted action on the part of the Department's Engineer as well as yourselves. In any case, the good name of our equipment is involved. Father MacKay is an unusually fine type of man and is not making any unusual demands, therefore we believe it is something that you should have thoroughly investigated and the necessary steps taken. As this is a transaction originating and carried through by Montreal House, I do not see why Saint John House should be involved in the discussion beyond giving all the assistance possible in submitting information to Montreal - and this you will note by the correspondence have endeavored to do - but if Montreal refuse to correct the trouble I have given my word of honor to Father MacKay that the necessary changes will be made and it will then become a question of carrying out my promise irrespective of outside consideration.\n\n(over)\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 685, File 285-6, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nMr. Wilson maintains that the two Pumps can operate off the same suction line and that sort of thing. No doubt they were recommended to the Departments. If the installation was not made according to our own requirements, then perhaps the Department will bear the expense.\n\nAs this correspondence has been going on for so long and one Pump has been out of commission entirely during that period, will you not kindly relieve me of the onus of taking steps ourselves which may in the long run be more expensive to the Company than if it were handled by the people who originated this transaction.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE C.

After the sprocket has been changed we trust the performance of this unit will be completely satisfying, and we look forward to hearing from you. In case the motor should still fail to start when the rotor or rotating member is in a certain position, will you kindly communicate with Mr. R.M. Graham of our Halifax Office, who understands the procedure we wish followed in that unlikely event.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEAK/EN\nAugust 7, 1931.\n\nMr. T. H. McWilliam, Mgr.\n\nFollowing are the pertinent facts of this matter:\n\nOur 5000 gal. Typhoon Pump actually has a displacement of 5,364 gals. per hr.\n\nThe original chain drive, of which no record was kept, operated the pump at 285 r.p.m., the maximum being 215 according to factory rating. At a speed of 285, neglecting slip, and assuming a combined efficiency of 65% for the pump and the drive chain, 6-3/4 H.P. motor would be absorbed.\n\nIt was not possible to obtain sprocket with more than 114 teeth and such a sprocket was supplied after my visit. The pump was then not operating as slowly as I recommended, but is running at 191 R.P.M. requiring 6 H.P.\n\nConsidering that the maximum horsepower demand occurs only during the final two or three minutes in pumping up the tanks - they are hydro-pneumatic tanks - a 5 H.P. motor should not be seriously overloaded. That is to say the job ought to be O.K. now, particularly as the above H.P. calculations neglect slip of the pump.\n\nFather MacKey's statement quoted by the Halifax Office to the effect that \"it does not deliver as much water as the 2500 gallon unit\" would indicate that either the suction line is partially obstructed or there is something wrong with the Pump. Unfortunately, there is no specific information as to the speed the pump is running, and the statement of Father MacKey, quoted above, is unlikely to be based on actual measurement of the water delivered.\n\nIt would be an expensive matter to install a 2500 gal. pump in place of the 5,000 gallon. If it is really necessary to still further reduce the capacity a Flex-Mor Drive, ratio 6.96:1 would give a speed of 165 R.P.M. Still, neglecting slip, 148 R.P.M. would require just 5 H.P. with an efficiency of 65% and with the tank at maximum pressure further assuming that the pump pressure exceed the tank pressure by 5%. The Flex-Mor drive would cost about $70.00 at Montreal.\n\nI suspect that either the pump is not just right or the suction line is partially obstructed, so that only the capacity of the smaller pump, 2500 gallons per hour, can pass.\n\nIf I am going to be in Halifax during the next month or six weeks, or so, I believe the best way to take care of this would be to have you ship to me at Shubenacadie, or our Halifax Office, the following:\n\n2 Chain Tongs for 5\" & 6\" pipe\n2 Large Stillsons\n1 Vacuum Gauge\n1 Pressure Gauge of known accuracy\n1 Breast Drill with drill to suit pressure gauge and vacuum gauge conn.\n1 Tap for the same 1-speed indicator\nThis is not exactly a job for a plumber and our mechanics at Halifax are not equipped to handle the pipe. A vacuum gauge applied to both pumps in turn would tell a great deal about the condition of the suction. As the job now stands, and with the information we have, there is no apparent reason for the complaint that the pump is not delivering its capacity and that the motor is apparently overloaded - two contradicting conditions.\n\n(sgd) S A KEP\nAug. 15, 1931.\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs\n\nFumigating Outfit - Shubenacadie, N. S.\n\nMr. T. H. McWilliam, Mgr.,\nMontreal House,\n\nDear Mr. McWilliam:\n\nI regret very much that the contents of your letter of August 13th re above contain no hope for immediate action in connection with this matter which involves the sale of equipment by Montreal House to the Dept. of Indian Affairs at Shubenacadie, N. S.\n\nIn the very first part of Mr. Kemp's report attached to your letter he mentions the fact that the original installation, which you made, was an impossible one requiring a 5 H.P. Motor to develop 3-3/4 H.P. at the Pump.\n\nWe note you consider the best thing to do would be to leave this until Mr. Kemp goes to Halifax. I do not know when we are going to call on Mr. Kemp to go to Halifax and, certainly, we would not bring him down here at our expense in order to go into this matter.\n\nI think Father Mackey is entitled to some definite action on the part of this Company and the onus naturally falls upon yourselves with whom this transaction originated. Won't you please do something of a definite nature at once? In my letter to you of August 4th I told you that I had verbally promised Father Mackey that he could depend upon this trouble being corrected during the Summer and, if Montreal House refuses to assume its own responsibility in this matter, then it will be for us to do so on the understanding that whatever expenses are incurred in making this equipment operate satisfactorily will be charged back to Montreal.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE C.

This was not answered sooner due to the fact that the writer was absent from the City.\n\nIn the first place we want to make ourselves perfectly clear, namely, that if Saint John House incurs expenses without authorization from us, we will not be responsible for same.\n\nMr. Kempe advises that he examined the outfit and same was all right and no doubt the suction line is blocked or there is some impediment which prevents the pump from working. Naturally, we are not responsible for this nor should we be called upon to bear the expense of righting same. This should be made clear to Father Mackey, Head of the School.\n\nIf the Pump is defective we will naturally supply a new one free of charge but if there is trouble with the installation the expense should be borne by themselves.\n\nThe Engineering Dept. of the Dept. of Indian Affairs ordered the outfit and got what they ordered. We would suggest that you put it up to Father Mackey that the Pump can be returned and it will be examined. If found defective, we will supply a new one but we certainly should not be called upon to bear any expense if it is the fault of the installation.\n\nTHE C. F. M. CO. LTD.\n(sgd) T. H.

Since returning here I have had an opportunity of discussing your problem with Mr. E. A. Kemp, Factory Sales Engineer, who is expert in matters of this kind and I am pleased to advise that Mr. Kemp will personally inspect your installation in the very near future. I am merely dropping you this note at this time to assure you that we do not propose to neglect your appeal for assistance.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE CANADIAN FAIRBANKS-MORSE COMPANY LTD.\n\nBY\n\nW.J.H. MAS\nMANAGER\nShubenacadie Indian Residential School.\n\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nSept. 4th, 1931.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed you will find correspondence concerning the pumps. From the very beginning we have had trouble with the larger one, and the latest thing done by the C.F.B. Co., Ltd. was to put a bigger wheel on in order to slow down the pumping. This worked for about a week, but at the same time the bigger pump was not producing as much as the smaller one. Now it is not working at all.\n\nTheir suggestion is that the Dept. of Indian Affairs, since the equipment asked for was supplied to them, send an engineer to look over the pumps, and if the defect is in the pump, and not in the installation then they will make the necessary repairs.\n\nTo us here it is just this, that the five horse power motor, is not of sufficient power to run a 5000 gal. capacity pump. The pump is alright but the power is not there.\n\nThe technical side of the matter is beyond us.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6055, file 265-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nSept. 12, 1931.\n\nDear Mr. McWilliam,\n\nI am today in receipt of a letter from Rev. Father Mackey, Principal of the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School, with further reference to the unsatisfactory condition of the large pump installed at this school. He enclosed copy of the correspondence between your Manager in St. John and the Montreal office.\n\nI may say with reference to the large pump that it has never given good satisfaction. You mention that the suction line might be blocked. This could not have been the case when the pump was installed and at the time of installation it was not working to capacity. Without this pump the conditions at this school are serious, as they depend on the large pump for fire protection.\n\nIn one of your letters to your St. John Manager you state that the department received what they ordered. If you will look back over your correspondence you will find that your Engineer from Montreal submitted a recommendation to me for the equipment required. I specified this equipment and the order was placed in accordance with his recommendations. He also furnished a plan showing the layout of the pumps and all connections and the installation was made in strict accordance with this plan.\n\nI am compelled to take some immediate action to rectify the existing unsatisfactory condition, and before doing so I would be glad to hear from you. A reply by return mail would be appreciated. I may say that when I specified this equipment I felt that I was providing for a pumping installation that would give entire satisfaction for many years.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT. H.

Guerry Orr,\nArchitect for the department.\nOttawa, Sept. 12, 1931.\n\nDear Father Mackey,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the fourth regarding the unsatisfactory condition of the large pump at the school, I am enclosing herewith, for your information, copy of a letter which I am today sending to the Manager of the Montreal branch of the Canadian Fairbanks Morse Co., and if I do not get a satisfactory reply within a few days I will make other arrangements to have this pump put in proper working order.\n\nIf you care to you may send Mr. Hill, Manager of the St. John Branch, a copy of this letter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. GUSKY ORR,\nARCHITECT FOR THE DEPARTMENT.\n\nRev. Father Mackey,\nPrincipal, Shubenacadie Indian School,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nMontreal, Que. September 15, 1931.\n\nMr. R. Gurney Orr,\nArchitect, Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have your favour of the 12th inst. in connection with pumping equipment for the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School and note your remarks re same.\n\nWe attach herewith copy of report which Mr. Gerin, our Sales Engineer, has just handed to the writer re this pumping equipment and we might advise for your information that our Mr. Kemp, Pump Engineer, left for Nova Scotia last night. He will check over this installation while he is down there and as soon as he sends in his report we will advise you further in connection with same.\n\nWe are, however, convinced in our own minds that it is not the fault of the pump and we invariably find that these complaints which are lodged against pumping equipment are the result of faulty installation or some obstruction in the suction line.\n\nHowever, Mr. Kemp will install a gauge on the suction line to see if there is not some stoppage of water there and in the meantime, we will just wait for his report which we should have before very long.\n\nRegretting that you are having this trouble, we remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE CANADIAN FAIRBANKS MORSE CO. LTD.\n\n[Signature]\n\nManager.\nConfirming the different conversations we have had in the last few weeks regarding the pumping station at the above school. I have looked over the recommendations that were made at the time and the different reports that were brought in by our own men, and sent in by the customer, and I cannot see what can be causing any trouble at the station besides the suction line.\n\nThe pump is a positive displacement pump and its capacity cannot be altered by anything but the change in its speed. Mr. Kemp reports the speed has been brought up to exactly what it should be. (I naturally assume that customer has opened the pump to check up if any of the valves or leather cups were in proper shape. It might happen that a suction valve would be broken, although this very seldom happens).\n\nWe have had on several occasions trouble with the suction line on some of our installations and have in some cases found that some of the metal used for galvanizing it partially clogged the pipe. In this case it is not probable that this metal would clog the pipe as it is too large, but it may have got under the flaps of the foot valve or check valve and may prevent it from opening properly. Again there may be some dirt getting in this pipe line, which also would prevent these valves from opening properly.\n\nThere is no reason that I know of why this 5,000 gallon pump should not pump its full capacity when pumping through 5\" pipe as installed. I believe that if the customer would install a suction gauge on his line, he would know right away what is causing the trouble.\n\nM. Gerin,\nSales Engineer.\nDear Father Mackay,-\n\nWith further reference to my letter of the 12th with regard to the unsatisfactory condition of the large pump at the school, I am enclosing herewith for your information copies of letters which I have received from the Montreal office of the Canadian Fairbanks Morse Co. As soon as I hear from them again I will advise you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH. Guiney Orr,\nArchitect for the Department.\n\nRev. Father Mackay,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nOttawa, Oct. 15, 1931.\n\nDear Father Mackey,\n\nI have today received a letter from the head office of the Fairbanks Morse Co., advising me that the Engineer who was sent to inspect the pumping plant has reported that same is now in perfect working order, and that he left the outfit running to your complete satisfaction.\n\nI will be glad to have a line from you as to whether everything is now in good working order.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH. Gurney Orr,\nArchitect for the Department.\n\nRev. Father Mackey,\nShubenacadie Indian School,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nMr. H. Gurney Orr,\nArchitect, Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to your favour to us under date of September 12th and our letter to you under date of September 15th covering the pumping plant at the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School.\n\nAs advised you in our previous letter we sent an engineer to look over this plant and he reports that the pumps are working satisfactorily and found nothing whatever wrong with them, nor did he find anything to indicate that the large pump had ever failed to deliver its capacity, provided, of course, that the motor was run up to speed.\n\nWhat little trouble they have had was discovered in the magnetic switch. The bracket of the solenoid actuating the contact fingers was loose on the panel, two nuts having fallen off behind the panel. Sometimes the solenoid would remain in its place and at other times fall forward, resulting in a weak contact of the fingers. As soon as these nuts were put on and secured tightly everything operated satisfactorily.\n\nOur engineer left the outfits running to the complete satisfaction of Father Mackey.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE CANADIAN FAIRBANKS MORSE CO., LTD.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMontreal, Quebec, Saint John, Ottawa, Toronto, Windsor, Winnipeg, Regina, Saskatoon, Edmonton, Calgary, Vancouver, Victoria\n\nIndian Affairs.

This matter was mentioned last year and some hope was given then that possibly this year something could be done. There is only one house vacant in the village and the rent asked for it is at the lowest twenty-five dollars a month. The matter of providing living accommodations in the School and providing work for the woman is not practical here.\n\nIf we had $2500.00 and were permitted to use the help we have here, I think that we could erect a building in keeping with the other buildings on the property.\n\nI do hope that you will include this item in your estimates for this year and help us out of a very trying situation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I regret that this request did not reach the Department in time for consideration when the Main Estimates for the coming fiscal year were being prepared. I may say that Parliament is being requested to provide $3,500 for the erection of a henhouse, a hogpen and a dairy and for the provision of a mangle at your school. If the residence for Mr. McLeod is more urgent than these improvements, it would not be difficult to make the funds available for that purpose. Upon your return from your holiday, please give this some thought and let the Department have your recommendation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes\nActing Secretary.\n\nRev. J. P. Mackey,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N. S.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of Feb. 30th, 1932, I sincerely hope that your estimate of $3600.00 for buildings in connection with the School has passed.\n\nIf when the time comes for building we could employ Alfred Myrei, who was foreman in October 1930, we feel that the house, hogpen and dairy could be constructed with that amount of money. But if we have to employ all outside help, from past experience, I think the total sum would not complete the house.\n\nWe have quite a number of big boys who would be a great help and would profit not a little for the practical experience. If you think that the matter could be worked that way, will you please let us know, so that we may plan to get the best results.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have just about reached the time when we are in a position to meet our bills and the prospect of a ten percent reduction is to say the least not inviting. As far as I am concerned and the engineer and farmer it will mean a reduction in wages, but with the Sisters receiving only three hundred a year, with ten days allowed for their retreat, to reduce their income seems absurd.\n\nAs far as the building of a cottage is concerned, if you cannot allow us something on it, we will have to make the attempt ourselves. I need not remind you that many things were promised at the beginning, and that for the past year there has not been any money spent by the Department for this school, except medical, stationary and the grant. We realize the need for economy, but a cottage will be built later and I believe it could be built at the present time for much less money. Sincerely hope that you will be able to help us.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 7, 1932.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the first instant, with reference to the deduction in the per capita grant and concerning a cottage for the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School. You will please not proceed with any construction or major improvements at any time, without the concurrence of and instructions from the Department.\n\nI may say that $1,000 will be available this year for improvements at your school. It is at present suggested that a mangle be supplied for the laundry, but, if there is any other improvement where this money could be used, which is more urgent, please let me have a recommendation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. J. P. Mackey,\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N. S.\nShubenacadie Indian Residential School.\n\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nMarch 22nd, 1932.\n\nNo. 51-0-5\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI would not think of building a cottage for the carpenter-engineer without your approval. But I did think that if we had some help, say to the extent of $1800.00, it would be possible for us to add to that from the Grant, $500.00 to $1000.00 and build a cottage similar to the one here. Provided further, that we could hire one first class carpenter, and do the work ourselves.\n\nI am hopeful that the outstanding accounts at the close of this month will not be more than $500.00. Since the 10% reduction does not go into effect till the first of April, then we should have about seven thousand coming to us. From that amount I was hoping that we could manage to use from five hundred to a thousand on the house. If necessary I would give half of my years salary to see the house built.\n\nIf it is impossible for us to have the cottage, and there is available one thousand, I would rather see that amount expended on a dairy and hog-house than on a mangle.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Rhodes Curry Co. had promised to remedy the trouble about the windows, but the work was never done. From the beginning every south-east rain storm has played havoc with the plaster on the front of the building. It becomes necessary under those conditions to place basins and towels to catch the water which drips from the tops of the windows. The condition of the plaster is very bad, so much so, that some of it is down and it is only a matter of a few more storms till much more of it will be down. We had hoped to paint all the first floor this summer but only did half of it, as we considered it a waste of time and material to paint the rooms on the front of the house.\n\nThe enclosed letter will explain itself, and if this work is done we hope it will be the means of saving considerable expense for repairs at a later date.\n\nWill you please let me know if you will have this work done before the cold weather sets in.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

You will readily understand then that anything I say will not in any way concern him personally.\n\nIn the special duties of Mr. Maxner it seems to me that I am placed as a junior clerk, and that my name to any report sent to the Department means nothing, unless the correctness and honesty of that report is certified by Mr. Maxner. Being what I am, my in the past, my name alone has been sufficient to satisfy any party of the correctness or truthfulness of any matter. To make out a report for the Department I must await the signature of Mr. Maxner before it can be accepted. That I honestly think is uncalled for. If I cannot explain in a satisfactory manner any expenditure incurred to the Department, and have my word accepted as final, then I should not be here. Again I am at a loss to know just what is meant by general inspection. The letter as a whole seems to intimate that while I will be on the ground to see to the immediate wants of the school, nevertheless Mr. Maxner will have the final word.\n\nThat Dr. Scott is what I understand from the enclosed letter. It places me in a position which up to the present I did not think possible.\n\nMr. Maxner is coming here tomorrow, that is why I am writing you today. Trusting that you will grant me an early reply, and hoping that you are enjoying good health,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

You will note that Mr. Maxner assumes no responsibility for the financial management or the general conduct of the school. In other words, you are responsible.\n\nAt Indian residential schools where the Department alone is financially responsible, it is the practice to have the principal prepare a quarterly fiscal statement, listing the receipts and expenditures. A local officer of the Department compares this list with the receipted accounts and paid cheques and certifies to its correctness. He also makes a general inspection of the school. Once every year or so, there will be a regular audit of the books of the school. This and Mr. Maxner's certificate on your financial statement will be necessary to your own satisfaction.\n\nIn the expenditure of public money, there are examinations and audits that may seem unnecessary to you at the present time, but which you will welcome as you become familiar with government regulations. Every payment I make is scrutinized by the Auditor General's Department and a receipt or other supporting paper is demanded.\n\nPerhaps Mr. Maxner's visit has already cleared the air, for I hope he has a clear conception of his relations to you and to the school. You have the entire confidence of the Department, and you must not allow yourself to be disturbed by regulations that are associated with public business.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

If you concur, I propose to ask the Chief of the Cattle Division to instruct his local representative, Mr. G. A. Archibald, of Truro, to look after this for us. I do not wish to limit the selection to herds in Hants County, if better satisfaction can be secured elsewhere; but Mr. Archibald could be instructed to give the preference to dealers in your constituency.

The Rhodes Curry Co. did not submit a design as requested as evidently they had previously arranged for the purchase of the boilers. Under the specifications the contractors were entitled to install whatever make of boiler they desired, providing it had the capacity called for in the specifications. The boiler was included, of course, in the general contract and was not purchased direct by the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

There will be one more bill for lumber from Ed. Carr, our friend Mr. O J O'Brien who lives sixteen miles from here, brought the first order of lumber, but could not make the hill, broke through a neighbor's bridge, and decided he would not come again.\n\nThe total so far amounts to $665.29. We will be able to complete the buildings and put a Farmers Boiler in the hog-house but we will not have sufficient funds to install the necessary equipment in the Dairy, especially if we have to have a new upright boiler costing $215.00. We have been trying to locate a second hand one at a reasonable price. With the exception of the Dairy equipment the work will probably be completed this week.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n| DESCRIPTION | NUMBER OF FEET | PRICE | AMOUNT | TOTAL |\n|-------------|----------------|-------|--------|-------|\n| Trap        |                |       |        | $2.01 |\n\nCERTIFIED CORRECT\nSupplies furnished; charges fair and just.\n\nIndian Affairs.

We are sorry that the amount allowed for the work was exceeded by $29.37, but even at that I think we did fairly well. The total for outside help was $56.00 for a carpenter and $3.40 for an electrician.\n\nThe only equipment in the Hog-house costing any money is a Farmer boiler $20.00. In the Dairy we have a good three horse power upright boiler, a large sink for washing cans and milk pails, a hand basin for cleaning up before milking for the boys, a cream separator, and a small cooling room where the milk is kept.\n\nWe are very grateful to the Dept. for allowing us to put up these buildings, and with little exception giving us a free hand. I might say that this way of doing things gives us a lot less worry, and at the same time saves the Dept. considerable money. You will find no item for paint yet both buildings have had two coats. Twenty-one pigs in the hog-house, at the present time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir:\n\nI want to bring to your attention again the matter of a house for the carpenter-engineer. The farmer has a residence on the property, and the question of a house for the carpenter-engineer was spoken of just shortly after the School opened, three years ago. It has been mentioned every year since. The ability of the male help speaks for itself in that there has been no changes since the School opened.\n\nI realize that in the interests of economy expenditure is curtailed, but at the same time I think that we could build the house at much lesser cost this year than at any other time. As in the building of the dairy-ice-house and hog-house, we could do a good share of the work ourselves. The plastering and electric wiring would be the only things requiring outside help.\n\nThe farmers house cost the Dept. four thousand dollars, I think we could build one of the same size for half that amount. We have not bothered you very much except for buildings, and I do hope that in this matter you will do the best you can for us. Please let me know if there is any possibility of having it done this coming summer.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nMany thanks for your letter of the 14th inst. In the meantime I have been scouting around trying to find the amount and cost of things. The amount of lumber exclusive for finnished floors and other inside work would come to 14000 ft. I can buy that here at $16. per thousand, amounting to $194.00. This O'Brion mentioned in the official letter of Sept; 14th, lives eighteen miles from here and would not land lumber here at that cost. He practically said last fall that he did not want any more business unless he could get his price of $20. per thousand. Hot air furnace would cost in the vicinity of $150.00.\n\nIf I were allowed I could buy the water and bath room fixtures in Halifax at much less cost than I can through Watson Smith.

The sum of $1,000 was included in our appropriation for the current fiscal year for necessary repairs at this school and I would recommend that Father Mackey be authorized to expend this amount in the erection of a house for the assistant farmer. A considerable amount of the work will be done by the staff and the padre himself and Father Mackey considers that the amount mentioned will enable him to build a suitable house. I may add that Mr. Mcleod, for whom the house is being built, not only assists on the farm but does all the minor repairs in connection with the heating plant and the plumbing. In this way, he saves the school a considerable expenditure each year and is a valuable member of the staff.\n\nFUTURE REQUIREMENTS: (1) As pointed out above, the house for the assistant farmer is necessary at the present time and, as funds are available, I trust the Board will see fit to authorize Father Mackey to proceed in this matter.\n\n(2) To complete the equipment in the laundry, a mangle is required, but there is no necessity for supplying this at the present time.\n\n(3) There is still considerable seepage of water through the bricks on the south side of the building. Methods of improving this condition have previously been considered but, as yet, no satisfactory results have been obtained. Similar conditions exist in other buildings in Nova Scotia where the same kind of brick is used. When in Halifax I learned that the Imperial Oil Company had been having the same trouble with a large building that they had erected but had been successful in treating the bricks in such a manner as to prevent water seeping through. Father Mackey intends to see the Manager of this company with a view to ascertaining what they used and he will then write the Department.\n\n(4) There is an ample supply of water from the lake and the water works system has been working very satisfactorily. The water is rather hard and it has been found that the steam and hot water pipes are corroding rather quickly. When the school was erected, the heating contractor stated that the pipes should last from ten to twelve years but pipes in the laundry had to be replaced within two years. I feel that this is a matter that should receive attention and I would suggest that the water be analysed with a view to determining what could be done to overcome the corrosion of the hot water pipes.\n\n(5) No hens are kept at this school as there is no suitable building. At the present time, eggs can be purchased quite reasonably and there is no immediate necessity for the erection of a hen house. However, this could be kept in mind and, when funds are available, an appropriation of approximately $250 might be made for this purpose. A manure shed, with granolithic floor, might also be erected at some future date.\nJune 22, 1933.\n\nDear Father Mackey,\n\nI spoke to the Deputy Minister yesterday with reference to the building of a house for the Assistant Farmer, and I think he is favorable to the project.\n\nWill you kindly send me a rough sketch of what you propose building. You must keep in mind, however, that the cost of the building must not exceed $1,000.00. You might also let me know how you propose building this house, and what labour will be required, also the most convenient place to purchase the materials. When this information is received you will be further advised.\n\nI note that you are having trouble with rain seeping through the brick work on the south side of the building, and that you are investigating other buildings having the same trouble. I will be glad to hear from you as to what is being done in similar cases to overcome this seepage.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH. Gurney Orr,\nArchitect for the Department.\n\nRev. Father Mackey,\nPrincipal, Indian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N. S.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 22nd inst. I think the only house we could possibly build is one like the farmer occupies at the present time. That is 24ft. by 28, with the roof over the veranda. The one drive-way would be sufficient for both houses. The post would be 12ft. with upstairs windows built out from roof.\n\nWith the possible exception of outside help for plastering and electric wiring, the carp-eng. here and the boys will do the work. The amount allowed for the house will possibly not be sufficient to buy the material, for we do not want to put up a shack almost in front of the School. For that reason we figure on saving on the labor and using all available money on good material.\n\nAs for the convenient place for buying the necessary material, by all means the cheapest consistent with quality. Wm. Stairs, son & Morrow for all hardware, Spencer Bros. and Turner for windows, doors, flooring, and framing. Comment where the best price, same for roofing and side shingles, and for sand and gravel. Brick at Millers, tile from L.E. Shaw or N.S. Clay Works.\n\nHoping that we will have good news from you soon.\n\nKind regards to you and Mrs. Orr.\n\nYours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

J. Reid & Sons, also an account for $40.00 in favour of James B. Miller. Neither of these firms was mentioned in our letter. Please advise why purchase was made from Reid & Sons and J. B.

Mackey,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N. S.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of August 28th, inst., concerning the accounts of A. J. Reid & Sons and James B. Miller.\n\nA. J. Reid & Sons are the only firm in the vicinity who deal in cement and roofing shingles. In the past these items have been put through Watson Smith. The latter would telephone A.J. Reid & Sons asking them to deliver to the School the amount of cement etc., I had the price from Reid's and it was always increased at least ten percent just for the bother of a telephone call. The figure I have from Mr. Smith for a furnace and kitchen range is $215.00, that is over one-fifth of the total allowed for the house. In view of that I thought that he was being treated fairly, and if we were to build the house at all then we had to make the money go as far as possible.\n\nAs for Mr. Miller in comparison with Shaw's Limited. The latter price on brick for outside purposes was $25.00 per thousand. Mr. Miller's $15.60, the stock brick was the same at $10.00. Before giving the order to Mr. Miller I made inquiries from some members of the local patronage committee and was assured that Mr. Miller was in very good standing and that there would be no complaint if we bought the few brick we needed from him.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

We followed those\ninstructions but Mr. O'Brien would only bring one load, as it did\nnot, he said, pay him for the long haul. The same would apply\nto Spencer Bros. & Turner from whom we bought all finished\nproduct.\n\nWe had from School property about seven thousand feet, milled\nfor us at Kerr's mill. So the cost for the greater part was for\n2x4, and 2x6. So we went to the mill yard and chose the pieces\nwe wanted, thereby saving a good deal of waste. Under like cir-\ncumstances in the past his accounts have been accepted. The mill\nis only a quarter of a mile from the School, and to me it does\nseem a bit queer to twenty miles for the same product and pay\nmore for it.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n| Day of Month | Items                                      | Amount |\n|--------------|--------------------------------------------|--------|\n|              | To wiring house                            |        |\n|              | 1 4-light fixture                          | $6.75  |\n|              | 1 8-light fixture                          | $6.75  |\n|              | 2 brackets                                 | $5.50  |\n|              | 1 hall lantern                             | $3.25  |\n|              | 1 kitchen unit complete                    | $1.50  |\n|              | 1 copper band and bail                     | $1.15  |\n|              | 1 poro. bathroom fixture                   | $.90   |\n|              | 1 brass band and bail                      | $1.10  |\n|              | 1 6-way switch plate                       | $.35   |\n|              | 2 5-way flush toggle switches              | $.00   |\n|              | 1 5-way switch plate                       | $.45   |\n|              | 10 3-way flush switches                    | $2.00  |\n|              | 5 switchplates - brass                     | $.75   |\n|              | 5 duplex receptacles and plates            | $1.30  |\n|              | 3 bakelite switch plates                   | $.30   |\n|              | 3 F.A. sockets                             | $.54   |\n|              | 1 3/4\" bushed cover                        | $.10   |\n|              | 4 ft. 1/2\" conduit                        | $.59   |\n|              | 2 1/2\" locknuts                            | $.04   |\n|              | 1 B.X. connector                           | $.06   |\n|              | 1 1/2\" bushing                             | $.08   |\n|              | 2 loomos connectors                        | $.14   |\n|              | 1 1/2\" F. conductlet                       | $.35   |\n|              | 5 3/8\" canopies                            | $.64   |\n|              | 1 poro. cover                              | $.12   |\n|              | 2 ft. drop cord                            | $.04   |\n|              | 3 keyless sockets                          | $.75   |\n|              | 1 sq.\"D\" switch and combination cutout     | $1.05  |\n|              | 1 30 amp. fuse plug                        | $.06   |\n|              | 10 ft. #10 R.O. wire                      | $.55   |\n|              | 2 15 amp. fuse plugs                       | $.10   |\n|              | 1 meter board                              | $.25   |\n|              | 540 watt lamps = .25 ea. less 10%          | $1.13  |\n|              | 1 solderin 5 car                            | $.25   |\n|              | 1 60 watt lamp = .25 less 10%               | $.28   |\n|              | 1 100 \" \" .40 less 10%                     | $.36   |\n|              | 2 25 watt \" .25 less 10%                   | $1.22  |\n|              | 1 flame lamps .54                          | $.54   |\n|              | (3 men) Labor 11.75 Transportation 5.00    | $16.75 |\n\nTotal: $60.92\nDear Sir:\n\nPlease find enclosed copies of the final account of Arthur & Conn, for electrical wiring and fixtures.

The pipe is not more than ten feet from a large hall burner, which was attended between five and six, the top of the hot water boiler was broken to pieces before seven thirty, P.M. For the past two years we have had considerable trouble with the heater and connecting pipes on account of the corrosion. During a visit by Mr. Thelat, we had repairs to make and showed him a three inch pipe which was so corroded that there was only about an inch space left for the water to pass through. We went into the question of using certain chemicals to remedy this condition but the cost was prohibitive.\n\nWe had to purchase a new hot water heater, and since all the pipe connections are three inch, it would be necessary to have all pipes threaded in Truro or Halifax, and run the risk of mistaken measurements etc. So in order to do the work ourselves we had to have dies, vice, pipe-cutters, and three foot wrench.\n\nIf I am not mistaken this is the first time we have asked the Dept. to pay a repair bill, but I think that this matter should be in the class of major repairs and not minor. Hoping that this will receive favourable consideration.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

If so, the accounts should be forwarded at the earliest possible date, in order that payment can be made from the current year's Appropriation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. J. P. Maskey,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N. S.\nDear Sir:\n\nLawrence Parker the assistant farmer occupies a rented house about two hundred yards from the School. The owner of the house wants to live in it on the first of May and has told Mr. Parker that he must vacate it by that time. As I have made known to you in previous letters, there is no house that could possibly be rented within a reasonable distance of the School, i.e., from one to two miles. The duties of the assistant farmer calls for him to be at the barn for morning milking not later than five fifteen. To do that I think you will admit that he should live near the School.\n\nI realize that last year you built a house for the carpenter-engineer, and that we are asking a lot to have another built this year. But if you can possibly do it I earnestly hope you will, as then the housing problem for the male help, who are all married men will be settled for all time.\n\nHoping that you will give this matter your favourable consideration, and that we will hear from you soon.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 28, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 18th instant, in which you point out the necessity for the erection of a dwelling house for the assistant farmer at the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School.\n\nNo provision for this purpose has been made in the Appropriation for the fiscal year 1934-35, and it is extremely doubtful if the Department will be able to provide the necessary funds. However, you might again bring this matter to our attention about July first, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. J. P. Mackey,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N. S.\nShubenacadie Indian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nFeb. 22nd. 1934.\n\nNo. 51-0-5\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 19th. inst. As for the house of the Carpenter-engineer, there are a few odds and ends, but I don't think that they will amount to very much, and can be cared for from general School funds. So if you will please close up the amount as it stands.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nDear Sir:\n\nOn February 19th, 1934 I wrote you concerning a dwelling house for the assistant-farmer, Mr. Parker. Your reply to that letter on the 22nd said that we might bring this matter to your attention again about the first of July. At the present time Mr. Parker is living in a small house almost two miles distant from the School and I do not ask him to be present for the morning milking, as has happened a morning now and then. Mr. Cooper is unable to be present for morning milking and that leaves the barn work for the boys alone. Needless to say that things do not go well. As I said in the first letter if we had a dwelling for Mr. Parker then the housing problem for the male help would be settled for all time.\n\nHoping that you will be able to have the house built in time for occupation this winter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

A note has been made of your request, and, if possible, funds for the purpose will be provided in the Estimates for the fiscal year 1935-36.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThos.

Separate estimates should be given of the hardware, lumber, cement, window frames, etc.\n\nIf outside labour is required, you should let me know the number of men needed and their trade. In the event of outside labour being required, you might state the wages per day that will have to be paid.\n\nOn receipt of your reply, the matter will be submitted to the Honourable the Superintendent General and, following this, the necessary instructions will be given.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

About $400.00\n\nEdward Kerr, Shubenacadie, for rough lumber, lumber yard about quarter mile from school, not on list, nearest on list about twenty miles distant. Cost $200.00\n\nStairs Son & Morrow, Halifax, wholesale house, water piping, sewage piping, nails, shovels, white lead and oil, set tube, brick, Agents for N.S. Clay Works, H.J. Shaw, Possibly $200.00\n\nArthur & Conn, Halifax, electric wiring and fixtures $100.00\n\nJ.M. Burgess, Truro, plastering, $120.00\n\nPrices are those taken from invoices for house built two years ago, so there may be some variation.\n\nOn account of the necessary farm work, the farmer and assistant will not be able to give very much time to the work, and it also should be taken into consideration the fact that when the last house was built we had about a dozen big boys who were a great help with the excavation. Therefore we should like to employ at least two men to help with the excavation and cement work. The rate of wages, thirty-five cents an hour.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I refer especially to the boys recreation, wash and bath rooms. The walls to within six inches of the floor are the ordinary plaster, and it has been impossible for us to keep them looking half decent. The plaster in many places is broken and even the cork board back of the plaster has been torn away. The only solution I can see is to take the plaster and cork board out and replace them by rough faced brick.\n\nLast year we were informed that there was an amount of $300. for repairs. As it was not used for that purpose I wonder if it would be available for this year. The brick would cost about thirty-five dollars a thousand and I would judge that we would need about six thousand. There would be no extra labor.\n\nWill you please let us know if we may figure on doing these repairs in the late spring or early summer.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

If brick were installed, would you not consider that, owing to the rough surface, it would be dangerous to the pupils in their play? In any event, the department will have no funds during the balance of the present fiscal year to authorize the purchase of the brick or other material for the purpose.\n\nYou might again draw this matter to the attention of the department about the end of April, next, at which time we will be aware what funds, if any, will be available for carrying out the repairs at your school. While our Estimates for the current fiscal year contained an item of $300 for the residence, only, to erect the residence for the Indian farmer, I would point out that, as the cost of the residence was over $1,400, all funds provided for your school year have been utilized.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

I may say that he distinctly points out that this condition is not due to any laxity on the part of the school officials.\n\nIn the current year's appropriation, there has been provided the sum of $400 for repairs and improvements at the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School. Please let me have your report, stating in what manner you consider this amount should be spent. You should give an estimate of the cost of the material and the cost of the labour for the work which you recommend. As soon as your report is received, the Department will give it immediate consideration.

Owing to flooded conditions of reserve could not get the information required and will have to return at a later date.\n\nMr. Wallace the Agent at that point asked my assistance in preparing his reports but when I attempted to do so found the former Agent had turned over to Mr. Wallace no records or information of any kind and that Mr. Wallace himself possessed very little of the required information.\n\nAs Mr. Wallace cannot secure this information without visiting practically every home on the reserve and as the roads will prohibit this for probably two weeks, I assisted in the filling in of what information he had advised the forwarding of them and at the earliest possible moment the securing of the information and the forwarding of a complete report. I pointed out to Mr. Wallace the necessity of holding down expenditures, advised him to check carefully all applications for relief pointing out that he being a new man the Indians would no doubt try to take advantage of him.\n\nWhile I am satisfied Mr. Wallace is honest and will carry on the work to the best of his ability, yet he is timid, fearful of getting entangled with the law, lacks initiative, aggressiveness and in my opinion not at all suited for the position.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd) Thos. Robertson.\nBorden, P.E.I.\nMarch 20th, 1926.\n\nDr. McGill\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir\n\nI beg to report that on March 18th I arrived in Truro called on Mr. Fox, Indian Agent and with him visited the Reserve and school at that point.\n\nWe visited a great many of the Indian homes and I must say was very favorably impressed by the cleanliness and general activities in the homes.\n\nWhile there are quite a number of old people as well as sick who are unable to support themselves on this reserve, among those who are able there seems to be a strong desire to support themselves and while I was there all were busy. That in the past white men have been engaged to build roads and do repairs on the reserve, is resented by the Indians and in my opinion justly so. There is no excuse for it; it only antagonizes the Indian and increases the cost of relief.\n\nIf there is no regulations making it obligatory for Agents to engage Indians (whenever possible) for all work on reserves, I believe there should be and that the regulation should be strictly enforced.\n\nOn our visit to the school we found fourteen pupils present out of an enrolment of 50. Several were at home sick with colds. The Teacher reported regular attendance.\n\nThe children appeared clean, attentive and fairly well nourished. The school room was in my opinion not so clean or neat as it should be, neither was the teacher so neat and tidy in her appearance. I drew this to the Agent's attention.\nattention and he agreed to speak to her.\n\nMr. Fox has had previous experience in social work, I understand. He has made a good start here, he wishes to help the Indian but realizes and also tells them they must help themselves. I shall be much disappointed if Fox does not make a big improvement at Truro.\n\nWould advise keeping an eye on this now as a suitable person as a full time Agent should such appointment be made.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd) Thos. Robertson\n\nRe grocery supplies. In my opinion these prices should be cut at least 10%. Talked with the Agent, he agreed. Think a letter from Dept. to him drawing his attention to necessity of securing better prices might assist him getting it adjusted.\n\n(Sgd) TR.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nApril 1, 1936.\n\nMemorandum: Doctor McGill.\n\nI have read Dr. Robertson's report on the recent inspection of the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School in Nova Scotia.\n\nI note his remarks with reference to the condition of the building and with your approval I will make an inspection of this building in the next two weeks and report as to what is required to remedy the conditions referred to in his report.\n\nArchitect\nfor the Department.\nShubenacadie Indian Residential School.\n\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nMay 5th, 1936.\n\nNo. 51-0-5\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAbout the middle of April, I received a letter from you concerning repairs. I was at the hospital at the time and now I cannot find the letter. There was an appropriation of $400.00 for repairs. I do not think that you intend this amount for the repairs necessary on the southern and eastern exposures, which were mentioned by Dr. Roberson in his report.\n\nIn a letter of Jan. 27th, I referred to necessary repairs in the boys recreation room, wash and bath rooms. My idea was to remove plaster and cork board for about five feet from the floor and replace with rough faced brick. To repair the plaster seems to me would be a waste of money.\n\nI am not certain but the work could be done at a cost of between three and four hundred dollars.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

You will note from this letter that the only amount available for repairs and improvements at the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School during the current fiscal year is $400.00. When you supply the information requested in official letter of the 2nd ultimo, the Department will give your request immediate consideration and you will be advised regarding the procedure we wish followed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.-P. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nEnc. 1:\n\nRev. J. P. Mackey,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N. S.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of April 2nd, concerning the $400.00 available for repairs this year.\n\nAs regards the necessary repairs to the plaster and possibly the wood work on the south and east sides. The fact that the water comes in during a driving rain storm was reported to the department before the building was actually occupied. This report was made by the Inspector, the late Mr. Wm. Growell of Windsor N.S. The contractors, at the time placed the blame on the sub-contractors who did the roofing. But the latter proved to the satisfaction of the former, by taking up part of the roofing, that the leaks did not originate there. In company with the inspector I made the trip between the ceiling of the top floor and the roof to the front of the building about an hour after this heavy driving rain storm had started. We found that the water was not coming from the roof but through the wall. With the aid of flash-lights we saw the water running down the inside of the wall. The caulking done in 1933 around the windows helped but did not eliminate the trouble. I was told that after a few years the pores would fill up and the building would become tight. (But it still has its sprees).\n\nThere are other buildings in the province which have the same trouble and I have talked the matter over with the superintendents of these buildings. None occupy such an exposed position as the building here and hence the trouble is not so extensive. The Capital Theatre, Halifax, Famous players Corporation, built more recently than this school have had trouble of the nature. After spending considerable money a firm from Montreal did a job for them that ended the trouble. (I will stop here till I get the name of that firm)\nMonday May 18th.\n\nThe name of the firm is the Western Waterproofing Company, St. Catherine Street, Montreal. They have done a satisfactory job on the Capitol Theatre, Halifax, and they guarantee their work.\n\nAs for the necessary repairs to the boys recreation room, toilet and wash rooms, \"rick from the floor up five feet seems to me to be the only solution, as it would be a waste of money to repair the plaster. The work as I see it would require about six thousand brick at thirty dollars a thousand. About twenty bags of cement at seventy-five cents a bag, with a few loads of good sand. The work itself could be done by the carpenter engineer. We would have to hire a truck for the brick and the sand, as the distance is too great for horses.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This building was erected in 1929 and reports have been received by the Department during the last year or so that the building was being damaged during periods of heavy rain.\n\nThe survey of the interior of the building showed clearly that rain was penetrating the south wall of the building and doing considerable damage to the plaster and interior finish. The prevailing winds are from the south-east and it appears that the south wall is the only one that is noticeably affected.\n\nI might say that when this school was erected the interior of all the exterior walls was water-proofed with a composition of tar and asphalt. This was applied direct to the hollow building tiles which were used in connection with the face brick in the construction of the outside walls. The face brick used in the building is extremely hard and it is practically impossible for water to penetrate same. The examination shows, however, that in spite of these precautions the rain is being forced through the wall during a driving rain from the south-east.\n\nWith a view to determining the best way of remedying the existing condition I inspected several of the large buildings recently erected in Halifax and in all cases I found that they are experiencing the same trouble. The Nova Scotia Hotel, erected a few years ago by the Canadian National Railway, spent about two years endeavouring to eliminate the trouble on their south wall. The results were all unsatisfactory until the entire outside surface of the wall was waterproofed by the Western Waterproofing Company, who have a\npatented process for this class of work.\n\nThe Bell Telephone Co., the Capital Theatre, the Nova Scotia Light, Heat and Power Co., Bank of Montreal, Moir's Factory and other large buildings in Halifax have been waterproofed by the Western Waterproofing Company and the results have been entirely satisfactory, eliminating in all cases the penetration of rain through the walls.\n\nIt is extremely important that immediate attention be given to the waterproofing of the Shubenacadie School in order to safeguard the building, and I would recommend that arrangements be made immediately with the Western Waterproofing Co. to carry out this work. They guarantee their work for five years and have been strongly recommended to me by those who have employed them for this work.\n\nThe estimated cost is $2,000 and I have been advised that funds are available in the Vote for Indian Education to cover the cost.\n\nAttached to my memorandum are five photos taken at the Shubenacadie School:\n\nNo 1. - A general view of the front of the building, which is the southern exposure and the wall requiring waterproofing.\n\nNo 2. - A detail of the front entrance.\n\nNos 3 and 4. - Interior details of one of the classrooms on the south wall showing the damage to the plaster around the windows.\n\nNo 5. - A view taken from the steps of the School which shows the three bungalows built and occupied by male members of the staff of the school.\n\nArchitect for the Department.\nAugust 15, 1936.\n\nMemorandum: The Honourable the Superintendent General.\n\nAttached hereto is a memorandum from the Architect of the Department with reference to an inspection made of the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School, which is located on the main line of the C. P. R. 40 miles this side of Halifax.\n\nI concur in Mr. Orr's recommendation and would ask for your approval of having this work done.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nR. G. O.\nAugust 13, 1936.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nSchools Branch.\n\nWhile making an inspection last week of the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School, I noted that some outside painting is required.\n\nThe Reverend Principal advised me that if the Department would purchase the material he would be prepared to do the work with the school staff.\n\nI would recommend, therefore, that the Reverend Father Mackey be authorized to purchase the materials required for painting at a cost not to exceed $75.00.\n\nArchitect for the Department.\nAugust 13, 1936.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nSome repairs are required to the interior of the boys' recreation rooms in the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School, and I would ask you to please give me the names of two competent brick layers who may be employed for this work, and also advise if it would be satisfactory to purchase the brick required from the Nova Scotia Clay Works near Ellsmore, N.S. This plant is located a few miles from the School.\n\nThe Shubenacadie Indian Residential School is located in the electoral district of Colchester-East.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nIndian Affairs.

S.\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\n\nMr. Gurney Orr,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nHope you had a good trip back to Ottawa. The night you left a heavy shower of rain levelled the beautiful field of oats we had in front of the school. The next day I looked into the matter of the floor in the driveway of the barn and found it completely rotted. You could take a screwdriver and push it through almost all of the joists. We will have to replace it before we can thrash what grain we have or put in our roots. I am writing to the Secretary asking if the Department could obtain three rails for us. A fellow in the village had three rails; he would not sell them but said we could have them since we need them immediately, but he expects us to replace them for him, as he plans on doing a similar job on his barn in the near future. The Department, I hope, will help us out because I could not get them from the railroad authorities.\n\nI am sorry that you could not get into the root cellar and see the conditions there. For the job, we will require 25 pieces, 15' x 3\" x 12\", and with 3\" flooring making a single floor, will run into about 1750 ft. All told the cost will be heavy. Do you think there is any chance that the Department would pay for material, including about five bags cement? The lumber will cost between twenty and twenty-two dollars a thousand.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

We decided that we would take this at 2500 sq.ft.\n\nIn addition to this Father MacKay pointed out to our foreman that the remaining parapets of the school and the parapets of the Chapel have some very bad leaks in them and are suffering very considerable damage. We dislike very much to leave a job partly finished. We would therefore like to waterproof the joints of these parapets so as to leave the job at least in a safe condition. The cost of this parapet work would amount to about $300.00. You have allowed us $150.00 for travelling expenses on the job, we would be willing to absorb this $150.00 if you would add an additional $150.00 to allow us to take care of the remaining parapets of the school and the parapet walls of the Chapel.\n\nAfter this work is completed, we believe that your school will be in fairly good shape and it will certainly help a lot on the Chapel, and perhaps cure any serious trouble.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nWESTERN WATERPROOFING COMPANY\n\nTCC/TRS\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hot water in the taps is quite rare for the summer months, and care of the sick means travelling over two flights of stairs for even a cup of hot water.\n\nIn coming for treatment Doctors have to bring their own instrument sterilizer and I felt that you might consider the approval of the model shown in the accompanying cut.\n\nFather Mackey would not approve the purchase until he has the written assurance that you are backing the proposal. I guess Father thinks that I was trying to impose on your good nature during his absence.\n\nThe No. 2411 at $133.00 would be ideal for us, so if you give your consent will you please return cut, with your approval.\n\nTrusting that all goes well with you, and that we shall have the pleasure of a visit next year, I am\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Within a very short time I was in the boiler room, the place was full of smoke, and I could see flames behind the boiler near the outside wall. I got the hose off the rack and ran with it to the garage to get away from the smoke. By that time, Father Brown, Stewart Cooper and some of the bigger boys were there. Asking them to get the water turned on, I left to come up to the office, telephoned to the Central Office and asked her to get us what help she could. I went back to the boiler room but they could not get water through the hose. We found out afterwards that any sharp bend in the hose would prevent the water from coming through. Seeing that we were not getting anywhere with that hose, I came back to the first floor and put the hose from that rack out the window in order to get at the fire, which was greatest in the corner made by the Chapel wall and roof of the coal bin. In the meantime, McLeod had gone to the pump house, started the second pump, and stepped up the pressure. We got very little water from the hose on the first floor - no pressure. (Found out afterwards that the bushing that the valve stem turns through was cracked and would allow stem to turn without opening plunger.\n\nWhile this was going on, a great crowd had arrived from the village, including the two members of the R.C.M.P., and all the buckets in the house and other utensils were used. It was not very long before the fire in the boiler room was just smoldering. But the fire had made its way up alongside the small crack between the sheet metal covering of the boiler room, at a point where the sheet metal meets the I beam, and worked its way along the I beam into the two-by-six which rest on edge on the I beam. The only way we could get at it was from above, on account of the sheet metal being nailed to the two-by-six, and this necessitated cutting into the floor of the Chapel. By one o'clock it was a matter of locating those places between floors which were slowly burning.\n\nThe fire wood was put in the boiler room sometime during the month of June, when there was no fire in the boiler, and there is no doubt but that what was left of it, should have been removed when the\nfire was started in the boiler. Nevertheless, there has been wood in\nthe same place year after year and no fire. There are some things\nwhich lead me to believe that the fire was not started from any spark\nfrom the boilers. It has always been a problem to prevent boys from\nmaking their way to the boiler room, in order to have a smoke, and it\nhas happened that whatever they should be smoking, would be thrown\naway, should anyone come along.\n\nAs far as we can find out at this time, Gilbert Francis was told\nto shake up the fire about ten forty-five. At eleven o'clock, Ed\nMcLeod, carpenter-engineer, went to the entrance of the boiler room\nto get the boy, but he was not there and he did not notice any fire at\nthe time. Gilbert Francis was the only boy who was supposed to be in\nthe boiler room that morning. There were a few boys at the barn, but\nas yet I have not had time to check up on them.\n\nBefore closing I wish to express my sincere thanks to the men of\nShubenacadie for the ready response and for their strenuous efforts\nto help us out of a most serious situation.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Gurney Orr, Architect,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nAs for the work on the boys' end of the building, we got the bricklayer, Addison Miller, started on the 31st of October. Mr. Thompson, the other bricklayer, was working and we could not obtain his services. With only one bricklayer at work, the progress was slow. So I got in touch with Mr. Purdy, M.F., and he told me that he would get two men for me. They did not arrive at the time they stated they would, but he telephoned to say that they would be along the first of the next week. Something must have happened for they did not come. The Western Waterproofing people had two bricklayers among their men, and as the weather was such that they could not work outside, I took the liberty of employing them at the rate of pay they were receiving from the Company, viz., fifty-five cents an hour.\n\nWith the exception of some trimming up by McLeod, the work was finished on November 19th, the day of the fire. I think we have had a good job done, although the cost will be in excess of what I thought it would be. Perhaps we here can absorb the wages and help out a little, roughly about $150.00. I am hoping that you will come to look over the fire damage and see the other work also.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Also, in the case of reinforced concrete structures, the water corrodes the reinforcing steel resulting in swelling of the steel and consequent fracture.\n\n18% to 20% of a brick wall surface consists of joints\n\nIt follows then that faulty workmanship, shrinkage and disintegration of mortar cause about 75% of all cases of leaky walls, and it is no wonder when as much as 20% of the surface is subject to mortar shrinkage and disintegration.\n\nRain finds easy entrance, for even during a gentle shower there is a measurable film of water constantly flowing over an exposed wall. But when driven by a strong wind, the flow of water into the cracks is almost as if the water flowed over a horizontal surface.\n\nIn dry cold weather the heat loss through the openings in brick joints is a very serious factor. In wet weather the walls lose a large part of their insulating value.\n\nTHE PURPOSE OF RESTO-CRETE\n\nIt is the purpose of Resto-Crete Material and Service to make walls a \"uniformly dense face of masonry,\" impervious to the entrance of moisture, but permitting of wall \"breathing,\" mentioned later.\n\nIf the material of the defective masonry wall is dense and highly resistant against moisture, then a treatment of the joints only will be necessary.\n\nIf the bricks, stone or other material are soft, porous and show noticeable signs of flaking, checking, or other evidence of water penetration and disruption by freezing or other disintegration, then an overall treatment is advisable.\n\nAll concrete and masonry structures show some disintegration in the course of years. This may be very slow for a great many years, then suddenly accelerate. The location of the cause of disintegration and determination of the cure is the work of a specially trained organization.\n\nThorough examination is of first and vital importance.\n\nWHAT WE DEMANDED OF RESTO-CRETE\n\nAny material and method of restoring disintegrated masonry, to be efficient, must conform to the specifications, laid down more than 75 years ago by a group of scientists, for the requirements of waterproofing materials:\n\n1. The material must penetrate easily into the masonry surface and remain there on drying.\n\n2. The material must not concentrate on the surface so as to form a hard crust, but at the same time it must harden the surface sufficiently to resist erosion. (It must densify the surface by filling the holes and must subsequently become hard).\n\n3. The material must prevent the penetration of moisture, and at the same time allow moisture to escape. This is possible because water as liquid will not penetrate where as vapor it will escape. Furthermore it is possible for a wall to absorb a proper amount of moisture without admitting seepage. This \"breathing\" of a wall is necessary to prevent disintegration or rotting of the material internally. This is probably the most important consideration of a waterproofing.\n\n4. The material must not discolor or in any way alter the original appearance of the surface.\n\n5. The material must expand and contract uniformly with the surrounding surface so as not to cause flaking.\n\n6. The material must be non-corrosive and harmless in use.\n\n7. The material should retain its preservation effect indefinitely.\n\nResto-Crete Embraces ALL the Requirements of a Satisfactory Job\n\nWhen the foregoing specifications for waterproofing materials were laid down, the scientists went beyond the available materials of their day. Some materials accomplished a part of the specifications but none accomplished ALL of them. It was only by making a long study of the merits and demerits of various materials that a compound of materials was discovered that fulfilled ALL the specifications.\n\nRESTO-CRETE MATERIAL\nResto-Crete Material is guaranteed to accomplish ALL the requirements of a satisfactory job.\n\nResto-Crete Material penetrates without concentrating on the surface. It is impervious to seepage but sufficiently receptive to permit the required ingress of air and egress of vapors to insure proper wall breathing. It not only will not discolor a wall, but it perfectly identifies itself with the material of the wall in color and texture, and adds density and permanence. Its coefficient of expansion is made identical with the wall in which it is incorporated, when properly handled. It forms no skin or crust to crack, no oil to dry out is used, no shrinkage of mortar. Resto-Crete does not mar but actually improves the appearance of a building.\n\nThe Western Waterproofing Company for twenty-one years has maintained an organization of specially trained men who have devoted their lives to the solving of all types of waterproofing problems. It was only after Resto-Crete was thoroughly time-tested that it was offered to the public.\n\nThe Western Waterproofing Company's Service is found not only in its material, but in its trained men. They are available for a thorough analysis of your water problems. They are capable of correcting the faults efficiently and permanently by the Resto-Crete Method.\n\nFOR PRESERVATION AS WELL AS RESTORATION\n\nMany architects insure themselves against water troubles that too often discredit a splendid job, by specifying Western Waterproofing Company's RESTO-CRETE treatment for the exterior walls, before the building is turned over to owners.\n\nEfficiency is best served by using that system which meets ALL the requirements of a perfect job.\n\nKinds of Structures\n\nResto-Crete is applicable to brick, stone of all kinds, concrete, stucco, concrete block, Haydite block, etc., The Resto-Crete Material comes in eight standard colors and in white and black.\n\nNo temporary calking, pointing or painting can approximate the lifelong satisfaction to the owner of a building waterproofed by Resto-Crete. Once done, it is permanent.\n\n(See References Back Page)\n\nSERVICE \u2022 WESTERN WATERPROOFING COMPANY\n1440 St. Catherine St. West, Montreal\nREFERENCES:\n\nAmong the many Resto-Crete jobs, covering a wide field, we cite the following where we have had repeat orders:\n\nCanadian National Railways: Express Bldg., Montreal\nHotel & Station, Halifax, N.S.\nHotel, Charlottetown, P.E.I.\n\nCanadian International Paper Co., Mills\nDalhousie, N.B.\nThree Rivers, Que.\n\nThe Bell Telephone Co. of Canada: Exchanges\nLachine, Que.\nQuebec, Que.\n\nNeurological Building\u2014McGill University\nMontreal Harbour Commissioners: Elevator No 2 and many other jobs.\n\nAs an example of repeat business in the waterproofing field over a longer period, we would mention the following jobs done by three American Western Waterproofing Companies associated with us:\n\nSouthwestern Bell Telephone Co.\nSt. Louis, Missouri, office and 50 exchanges.\n\nMichigan Bell Telephone Co.\nDetroit, Michigan, office and 35 exchanges.\n\nSouthern Bell Telephone Co.\nAtlanta, Ga., office and 15 exchanges.\n\nWESTERN WATERPROOFING COMPANY\n\n1440 St. Catherine St. West, Montreal\n\nIRONITE WATERPROOFING, RESTO-CRETE WEATHERPROOFING,\nMASONRY & CONCRETE RESTORATION, GUNITE FIREPROOFING\nA Comparison of Waterproofing Methods\n\nShowing the Real Economy of the Western Waterproofing Company's System Using Ironite\n\nWith Ironite\nNo Joints or Seams.\nIronite Coating Can Be Punctured and Easily Repaired.\nA Leak Can Be Immediately Seen and Remedied.\n\nNo Protecting Wall Required.\nNo Extra Excavating or No Back Filling Required.\nNo Supporting Floor Slab to Carry Waterproofing Required.\n\nCan Brave Outside Forms from Inside.

It is our hope that you will communicate with us on any problems whether more or less involved than these, that we may put our experience at your disposal. Due to the great number and variety of our installations, we have successfully overcome almost every type of waterproofing problem.\n\nDiagram No. 1 shows the manner of carrying the waterproofing into the wall pocket for the basement floor on a multi-basement building. It also indicates how the waterproofing is made continuous when arcaways and arcaway windows are encountered.\n\nNo. 2 is a typical pit waterproofed. Note here that the floor of the pit has no topping over the waterproofing, as no wearing occurs here. On the main floor level, however, the topping appears and is needed for wear.\n\nNo. 3 shows the best way for waterproofing interior stairs by carrying the treatment under and behind the stairs. If necessary the treatment could be applied to the treads and risers of the stairs, but for economy and best results we recommend doing the waterproofing as shown.\nServices\n\nAll work is done exclusively under contract and guaranteed to be and remain watertight. We sell no materials. Each office has a corps of trained mechanics working under the supervision of an engineer.\n\nContracts are taken for Treating Structures of Concrete, Brick or other Masonry, either old or new. Architects or engineers are invited to call our Waterproofing Engineers in for consultation to assist them in the solution of problems involving Waterproofing, Damp-proofing, Oilproofing, Restoring Disintegrated Concrete, etc.\n\nMethod Used\n\nThis system involves the use of Ironite Waterproofing, which is a finely pulverized gray iron containing chemicals. Upon brushing this on the walls with the addition of water, the particles are lodged in the surface pores. Due to the chemicals, rapid oxidation of the iron takes place with the resultant expansion of the iron particles. This swelling completely fills the surface pores and seals them against leakage. Sufficient coatings are applied to thoroughly fill all pores. The early coats make a filling or stuffing for the surface pores, and the succeeding coats form a highly oxidized iron filament. This iron oxide surface is extremely dense and impervious, not alone to the action of water, but also to oils, dilute acids, etc.\n\nThe treatment is applied on either the pressure side or the side opposite. In the latter case it is impossible to force the waterproofing away from the wall as the particles inside the surface pores have expanded therein and are an integral part of the structure.\n\nAdvantages of This Method\n\nOur system is a positive one, requiring no assistance from integral compounds in the concrete. The bond secured between the waterproofing and the structure is so perfect that it will resist any hydrostatic pressure the structure is capable of withstanding. See comparison shown on front page and note the large saving in construction cost.\n\nCharacter of Work\n\nWaterproofing\u2014Basement walls, floors, tunnels, powerhouses, subways, pits, swimming pools, reservoirs, dams, retaining walls, viaducts, etc.\n\nTreatment\u2014Fuel oil tanks, gasoline and lighter oil tanks, molasses tanks, pickling vats, unusual oil containers, etc.\n\nAcidproofing\u2014To resist soaps, greases, fats, etc. Treating floors and walls of packing houses, soap factories, tanneries, dairies and other structures, requiring protection against dilute acids.\n\nResto Crete\u2014A process for restoring disintegrated concrete and preserving it from further disintegration.\n\nSpecifications\n\nIt is our preference to write a separate specification for each specific job. As a general specification the following may be used:\n\nBasements, Tunnels, Pits, Etc.\u2014All enclosing walls and floors and other surfaces in contact with the earth are to be waterproofed on the inside surfaces by the Western Waterproofing Company (fill in here street and town address of nearest office) according to their system of waterproofing (using Ironite), and to be covered by their written guarantee.\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nAll surfaces coming in contact with the earth shall be waterproofed on the inside by the Western Waterproofing Company; the Waterproofing must be applied by their mechanics and under their supervision. All surfaces Waterproofed shall be guaranteed by the Western Waterproofing Company to remain waterproof and watertight for a period of five years from date of completion.\n\nConcrete Walls\nAll outside walls and areas shall be waterproofed in accordance with the Western Waterproofing Company's method\u2014on the inside surface from floor level to one foot above outside finished grade level. This work shall be done before partitions or other obstructions are installed.\n\nInside walls and column footings extending through the basement slab shall be waterproofed or damp-proofed as may be required\u2014up to both sides from the top of the footings to the finished basement level.\n\nBrick and Stone Walls\nAll outside walls and areas shall be waterproofed according to the Western Waterproofing Company's System, on the inside surface and over this shall be applied a plaster coat of thickness as required. This plaster coat shall contain no lime. All partition walls placed on top of basement floor slab shall have the waterproofing applied to this basement floor slab before walls are placed.\n\nFloor Waterproofing\nAfter the rough slab has been poured and sufficiently set it shall be thoroughly cleaned and waterproofed, according to the Western Waterproofing Company's System.\n\nA Few of the Installations made by the Western Waterproofing Company\n\nMontreal\n\nArchitects Building, Montreal\nAmerican Presbyterian Church\nSherbrooke St. E.

The harbor dock walls of the Bickerdike Pier had become badly cracked and broken up through years of wear and tear of shipping and action of the elements. It was decided to repair the dock by completely resurfacing with Gunite and in this operation \"Cinch\" Expansion Bolt-Anchors played an important part.\n\nAll soft, loose and defective concrete was first cleared from the wall faces, cutting away with pneumatic hammers and wire-brushing. A clean, solid, toothed concrete surface resulted, to form a sound base for a solid bond with the Gunite. The amount of defective material removed varied, 2 in. being the minimum. The roughened surface was then given a coating of powdered cast iron mixed with water and an oxidizing agent to prevent the rusting of wire mesh and anchor-bolts by the penetration of dampness or water from the upper dock surfaces, and to bond the Gunite to the structure.\n\nHoles 2 in. deep and \u00bd in. in diameter were then drilled in the surface 20 in. apart and staggered. A \u00bc in. wire nail, secured by calking in two separate \u00bc in. plain unit \"Cinch\" Expansion Bolt-Anchors (described in detail in LEAD, January, 1933), made and supplied by Canadian \"Cinch\" Anchoring Systems Limited, Montreal, was inserted in each hole with the nail ends projecting about 3 in. Steel mesh having 2 in. square mesh made of No. 10 gauge wire was placed over the nail ends which were then bent up and over, securing the mesh firmly to the wall. Gunite was then sprayed on and before setting hard was smoothed off and corners rounded, completing a highly satisfactory and permanent repair job.\n\nAs can be seen from the sketch, lead expansion bolt-anchors utilize the principle of expanding one or more lead alloy cone rings within a hole by calking them over iron cones placed base down on the head of a bolt. The anchorage is also used to anchor the threaded end of the bolt in the hole by using the iron cone tapped with a standard machine bolt thread of any size. They are used for all types of anchorages in concrete and masonry, for installing machinery, motors, shafting, pipe lines, theatre seats, and for electrical, plumbing, heating and ventilating work.\n\nThree steps in re-lacing Montreal docks. At Left, inserting nails secured by lead expansion bolts in concrete; Center, spraying gunite over steel mesh held by nails; Right, the new finished surface.\n\nWESTERN WATERPROOFING COMPANY\n1460 St. Catherine St. West\nMONTREAL\n| NAME OF JOB                  | LOCATION     | ARCHITECT                  | CONTRACTOR                        |\n|-----------------------------|--------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| **BANKS**                   |              |                            |                                  |\n| Bank of Montreal            | Kingston     |                            | John V.

Yet they are the same; the structure being the new addition to the Associated Screen News Building, Montreal, Quebec. The Architects were J. W. Orrock and N. B. Reardon of the Canadian Pacific Railroad, and the contractors were the A. Janin Construction Company. The office in the foreground is of monolithic concrete, and was subsequently treated with a light colored RESTO-CRETE.\n\nMonolithic construction is relatively inexpensive; further, it is admirably suited to the modern tendency in design. However, in the past, the great difficulty has been that concrete surfaces are soon pitted and corners broken off if left exposed to the weather, even when carbonated rubbed. The disintegration is due to the penetration of water, and the subsequent freezing and leaching out of necessary strength-giving constituents of the cement. Add to this the proven impossibility of preventing the ingress of water by painting the concrete with oil and cement paints, or with the so-called \"liquid waterproofings\", and you have one big reason why monolithic concrete has lost some favor in the past few years.\n\nThe Resto-Crete System has superseded these makeshift treatments. By its use it is now possible to insure a permanently beautiful and hard finish, for it has been distinctly designed to permit the wall to breathe and at the same time prevent the ingress of water. This is done essentially by filling the open pores with a non-capillary, yet slightly porous, hard cement material. The method is patented and applied only by Western Waterproofing Company licensees.\n\nAn even more striking example of monolithic concrete construction, with the RESTO-CRETE after treatment, is the new Court House built at Alpena, Michigan, last year. Prior to the Resto-Crete application, an Ironite bonded slush coat was applied to true up corner lines and fill surface holes. This is in contrast to the Montreal building on which the characteristic board marks were retained.\n\nFrom such signs as these we are lead to prophecy renewed activity for monolithic concrete.\n\nCopyright 1936\nPrinted in USA\nNO, THIS BUILDING did not go through an earthquake! It wasn't even improperly built or designed, according to our modern view, and no settling occurred. The condition is only an exaggerated case of what Mother Nature is doing to all buildings, starting at the time of building and continuing until the wrecker comes to haul them away, as our experience with thousands of similar failures proves.\n\nHow long is your brick building going to last? Probably not as long as you anticipate unless you originally figured its depreciation at five per cent per year. For not only is it going to be preyed upon by such elemental forces as the freezing and thawing of accumulated water, and the actual dissolving out of necessary components of the masonry by water, and by atmospheric acids from cool soot but the view now commonly held is that it will crumble to pieces by unequal expansion of mortar and brick units. The building shown above has clearly demonstrated the effects of volume expansion.\n\nVolume expansion, as here referred to, means the actual increase in dimensions of mortar and brick from their taking up water, rather than from temperature variation. For instance, it has been shown that a rich Portland cement mortar will expand as much under a rain of a few hours' duration as it will under a temperature change of 100 degrees Fahrenheit!\n\nSince brick won't expand this much, a shearing force results between brick and mortar, and something must give way. The result of the above treatment was that the wall held and the brick broke in places. If a weaker mortar had been used, a poorer bond would have resulted and the mor-\n\ntar would have crumbled. But, in any event, the degree of this volume expansion would have increased during the years with the continued inflow of water.\n\nBut, you may ask, what of the numerous brick buildings built a century or two ago which are still in good condition?\n\nHere, we answer that they were built with a mortar which did not permit the actual flow of water through the joint. They were fat mortars. As soon as their capillarity was satisfied, no more water penetrated. Again, the old lime mortars have gradually hardened by a natural chemical process which has made them more impermeable.\n\nOur ancestors knew materials by long years of working experience with them. Today, we all are suffering from the misuse of many valuable new materials.\n\nNow look at the picture below, showing the above structure after a year's exposure following the application of the Resto-Crete restorative treatment. Notice that it looks as clean and neat as the day it was built.\n\nWhat is more, the treatment is preventing ninety-nine per cent of the water that would normally enter from doing so, the other one per cent being atmospheric moisture which must be allowed to enter and leave at will for the good of the building. The masonry in this building is not going to expand further, because the protective treatment is noncapillary toward water.\n\nYears of continuous research and practice have proved to us that the Resto-Crete treatment is the answer to the perplexing disintegration problems of today. Applied to a building when first built, it will prevent the development of conditions like the above.\n\nThe Western Waterproofing Company and licensees apply Resto-Crete to all types of masonry structures, under a substantial guarantee. Application is made in the U.S.A. and in Canada, and is fully patented.\nFOURTEEN THOUSAND pounds per square inch! No wonder concrete spalls when this great force is liberated within it by the rusting of reinforcing bars. Concrete is good for only a few hundred pounds in tension. Since steel expands in volume by at least two hundred per cent when it rusts, a tension is produced greater than concrete can withstand.\n\nThis is what happened to the concrete column shown at the left. Moreover, it happens to a greater or less degree to all reinforced concrete structures. Most concrete structures over a few years old show some spalling on the surface, and at least ninety percent of these marks of disintegration are due to the rusting of the embedded steel.\n\nSteel rusts only because a combination of water and carbon dioxide from the air comes into contact with it; and these agencies can reach the imbedded steel only by passing directly through the concrete.\n\nIn other words, the disintegration of concrete from the rusting of reinforcing steel is merely another indication of the greatest need for adequately weatherproofing all masonry surfaces. We often fail to recognize this need because the extent of the damage does not appear on the surface until the condition becomes acute. As an example, the only visible indication of the serious condition of the column at the left was a few surface cracks.\n\nWe wish you could look through our microscope in the laboratory and watch the disintegrating forces of nature at work. You would see a drop of water placed on a masonry surface rapidly work its way through fine capillary tubes into the densest concrete. You would see water causing steel to rust; and would be amazed as you saw the fine rust tentacles pushing out from the main body, filling every crevice, and finally breaking the weaker structure and pushing it out of the way. You would see water dissolving out some of the softer structures. Or, again, you would see a water solution of the common atmospheric acid gas (sulphuric acid) rapidly eating up even the strongest crystal structures. We know that even the most nontechnical observer of these sights would conclude:\n\n1. That the presence of water in the masonry is essential to the operation of these disintegration processes.\n2. That the deep penetration of water, whether rain or dew, depends upon the capillarity of the surface through which it may enter.\n3. That the successful weatherproofing of a masonry surface requires the balancing of many more forces than are usually considered.\n\nWe have discussed in other places the important disintegrating effect of volume expansion of concrete materials as they take up water,* and also the necessity for preserving an evaporating surface on the exterior of all masonry structures.** Many other forces are involved at different times. In fact, there is no single procedure that will work successfully in treating every structure of concrete or of stone or of brick.\n\nParticularly is it true that a job is dependent upon spall and breakage allowances for special handling. It is essential in such a case that a trained engineer be on hand, for steel that is badly rusted must be replaced, the concrete surface must be properly prepared to secure a strong bond between old and new concrete, and strong concrete must be placed. A good job of patching not only gives a good appearance but also restores the original balance of stresses and strains between concrete and steel.\n\nA glance at the restored picture shows the vast improvement achieved here by the Resto-Crete system. Moreover, our mechanics used a technique developed by our engineers in the restoration of this column. It is now good looking on the outside. It is solid and strong all the way through on the inside. And it is permanently protected by the Resto-Crete treatment from further damages by external causes.\n\nOur years of experience and all the resources of our well-equipped laboratory are available for meeting similar conditions in your buildings. Ask for our suggestions.\n\n* The Resto-Creter, March 15, 1936.\n** Technical Bulletin, No. 2, Western Waterproofing Company, 1935\n\nThe Western Waterproofing Company and licensees apply Resto-Crete to all types of masonry structures, under a substantial guarantee.

Sounds silly, doesn't it? Yet your building, and every other structure, road, and sidewalk, literally lives just this life.\n\nFor chemical analysis of the air in New York City alone has shown that approximately 1,000 tons of sulphuric acid gas is discharged into the air every twenty-four hours from the combustion of coal. This gas, in combination with the water vapor in the air, forms sulphuric acid, which in turn is deposited along with soot and other dirt on every square inch of exposed masonry.\n\nEven non-ceramic building material\u2014limestone in particular\u2014is readily attacked by sulphuric acid. The result of this attack is quite obvious on buildings located in cities having high smoke densities as compared with those having low smoke densities. A striking example is to be observed in the case of old cast-iron objects of limestone, which endured for ages in their native climate, but when subjected to a few years' exposure in our city squares showed an amazingly accelerated rate of disintegration.\n\nSulphuric acid disintegration, like other types of disintegration in masonry, is due mainly to the penetration of water; for rain water contains acid in, then below the dissolved salts of the acid backs out and slowly washes them away. As a result the masonry becomes progressively more porous and capillary to water. Then, under proper conditions, ice crystals and crystals from dissolved salts form in the exterior surface layers and the familiar exfoliation or spalling of the surface occurs.\n\nBesides disintegration specifically due to sulphuric acid, a greater destructive agency is the continued inflow and outflow of water\u2014from any source; for water itself, in large quantities, is capable of dissolving out important constituents of limestone. Fortunately, however, in the case of limestone, nature has provided a natural water balance: if not over-exposed to water and sulphuric acid it will gradually build up a hard, dense surface layer which becomes increasingly resistant to natural disintegrating forces. Such surfaces can be found in well-protected areas on most limestone buildings. In fact, there are many complete limestone buildings in existence today which show no disintegration whatever.\n\nA better picture of this may be gained from the right half of Fig. 1. This section of the magnified limestone surface shows the dense, hard particles of \"limestone sandstone\" enclosed by a network of parallel pores forming a porous, sponge-like mass. In newly quarried limestone most of these pores are filled with a loosely packed lime material, which is the basic material employed by nature in building up a resistant surface. This material, if unchanged by nature (as is the case behind the surface layers), is the most easily attacked and, consequently, disintegrated acid.\n\nNow if anyone is used for cleaning, this protective surface is removed and many years may be required to restore it. The disintegration occurring in the meantime alone is enough to condemn it.\n\nSince we cannot control our buildings under the most adverse weathering conditions, we are faced with these facts: (1) Acids in the air and water dissolve out valuable salts from the limestone; (2) Alternate wetting and drying causes volume changes in the individual stones, which tend to break down the mortar bed, thus permitting the entrance of water and acids. Therefore, to preserve our buildings, we must apply the fundamental principles of weatherproofing by synthetically building a dense, hard, non-capillary surface, which retains breathing ability, inertness and strength.*\n\nIn the left-hand half of Fig. 1, and in Fig. 2, these principles are clearly illustrated. Note that the surface characteristics are in no way altered, but that the open pores are completely filled. No wax or paraffin has been applied to melt and collect dust, or to prevent breathing. No oil or glaze has been creosoted to prevent surface spalling by the formation of interior salt crystals. The surface performs in accordance with Natural Laws, at the same time giving protection against the ravages of water and sulphuric acid.\n\nThese characteristics make the Resto-Crete System the only one of its kind in the field for the protection and decoration of limestone.\n\n* \"Indiana Limestone,\" Purdue U.

Printed in U.S.A.\nHOW MUCH MONEY has the above specification cost owners without their having received one penny's worth of permanent protection for their buildings?\n\nGranted that the material and workmanship that go into a good tuck-pointing job are the best (they are still no better than the original materials), and that apparently all of the work required is done, what permanent good has been accomplished?\n\nFrom our knowledge of buildings and their life-expectancy, we are not safe in assuming that the depreciation of exterior wall surfaces is at least three per cent. per year. This deprecation usually takes place in the mortar material, rather than in the masonry units, and it does not mean that on a building five years old fifteen per cent. of the mortar has fallen out. It does mean, however, that the alternate wetting and drying of the wall surfaces, with the carrying into the walls of acids from the air, cause soluble parts of the mortar to be dissolved out and washed away at an alarming rate. Thus, it is left very much depleted in strength and much more porous than it was originally.\n\nIn a tuck-pointing job, only the holes where mortar has fallen out, or is loose, are repaired. The extent of the repairs is left to the good judgment of the man on the scaffold. If defective mortar were not repaired, excellent judgment is used and all visible defects are repaired, the only advantage gained is that depreciation of the repaired parts must start from the beginning again, while unrepaired parts will continue to cause trouble and will require periodic repair. It would seem, therefore, that to say \"\u2014and tuck-point where necessary\" means the beginning of a more or less continuous repair job.\n\nThe cost of a tuck-pointing job is mostly labor, because of the small amount of inexpensive materials used. Tuck-pointing requires only the examination of all surfaces; therefore, to tuck-point repeatedly a part of the joints in a surface adds very materially to the cost of maintenance over a long period. Would it not be better to make all joints and surfaces permanently impervious to moisture under operation, even though the first cost were slightly higher?\n\nIn previous issues of the RESTO-CRETER and in Technical Bulletin No. 3-A, we have discussed the fundamentals of weatherproofing, stressed the use of a non-capillary material, and have cited typical jobs. These ideas are sound unless they are read with understanding and so acted upon.\n\nLet us suppose you are going to have your building repaired. Are you going to write a specification for the work accomplished which leaves the determination of what you want done to the judgment of the laborer on the scaffold in permitting him to \"\u2014tuck-point where necessary?\" Or are you going to be sure that the money you spend will accomplish something? Through can do by providing that every square inch of the entire external surface of your building is weatherproofed according to the fundamental laws for such work; that it is guaranteed to stay weatherproofed; and that the work is to be done by an organization with enough understanding of your problem to insure you an intelligently executed job.\n\nThe Western Waterproofing Co. and licensees apply Resto-Crete to all types of masonry structures, under a substantial guarantee.

Printed in U.S.A.\nMONOLITHIC CONCRETE\n\nAIDED BY\n\nRESTOCRETE FINISH\n\nNew building of Associated Screen News in Montreal provides a striking example of the way in which Architectural Monolithic Concrete is given added beauty and permanence by Restocrete Treatment.\n\nWESTERN WATERPROOFING COMPANY\n1440 St. Catherine St. W.,\nMONTREAL\nMonolithic Concrete Aided by Resto-Crete Finish\n\nTHOSE who know most about concrete are insistent on the fact that, when made properly, it is perfectly waterproof, and therefore water-proof. The difficulty in practice is to get the concrete made well enough to be waterproof. There has been a great improvement in the quality of most concrete work during recent years, particularly since the importance of the subject was more generally known. But really good cement is still so much the exception that a great many concrete surfaces still require to be waterproofed.\n\nWhen concrete is not waterproof the reason generally is that there are voids throughout that make it porous. The obvious way of curing this condition is to fill these voids with cement. It is found, however, that cement alone does not fill the voids perfectly, so many other substances have been tried out. Substances such as oil paint and tar have been used unsuccessfully.\n\nOne of the most satisfactory waterproofing materials so far established in use is iron oxide, which has been employed for about 30 years in foundations and other structures beneath the ground level. It is brushed on the concrete as finely ground cast-iron powder. This oxidizes rapidly and thereby swells, filling the pores of the concrete completely. In some cases a thin protective coating of cement is put over the iron. This is called the \"Ironite\" process of waterproofing concrete.\n\nThe dark colour of the \"Ironite\" waterproofing obviously makes it of little use above the ground level where appearance is an important factor. A prolonged search for a more suitable material that would give a similarly satisfactory result in filling the pores of the concrete was rewarded about five years ago with the discovery of the mixture now known as \"Resto-Crete.\" Portland cement comprises the larger part of the mixture, since cement itself is obviously the best material to use, provided all the requirements are met. To the cement is added a small amount of material to make the concrete water-resistant, sufficient finely ground iron oxide to ensure oxidation that will fill all the voids, and a small proportion of inert material that makes the surface appreciably more resistant to abrasion than cement alone. To this mixture is added sufficient mineral oxide pigment to give the colour tone required. It is important to notice that the same operation that water-proofs the surface gives it a lasting colour of any intensity desired.\n\nThis combination of utility and beauty for the Resto-Crete treatment of concrete has had a rather unexpected result that is of special interest to architects. One of the disabilities of monolithic concrete design has been the difficulty of obtaining clear and lasting arrises. This is particularly important in the modern style of architecture, in which straight lines and shadows play such an important part. The Resto-Crete treatment brings the arrises into relief in a way that is strikingly in contrast to the untreated concrete, and compares well with those building stones most notable for a sharp arris.\n\nA good example of monolithic concrete thus made weather-proof as well as attractive in appearance is the new building of Associated Screen News in Montreal. The former building, put up 18 years ago, also of monolithic concrete but the dull grey of its surface has been distinctly unattractive, though eminently serviceable. In the\nnewing the same economy and enduring quality have been attained by the monolithic design, and to this has been added, at little expense, an exterior that will be extremely attractive. It is intended, by the way, to treat the old building with Resto-Crete shortly, when the present contrast in appearance of the two parts will disappear.\n\nThe new part of the Associated Screen News building on Western Avenue, Montreal, is in two sections, a monolithic concrete office and in the rear a structural steel and brick studio. The concrete structure is of concrete reinforced with welded beams, columns and floors. The floors and roof (which will constitute a floor when and if the building is made higher) were cast by the removable pan system. The floor of the studio is laid directly on the ground surface.\n\nThe walls of the studio have some interesting features. The brick is faced inside with 3\" hollow haydite blocks. Inside this is vertical 2\" furring at 3-ft. centres, then a chicken wire laid on top of the wire horizontal 2\" furring at 16\" centres. Over the chicken wire between the strips are laid pads of mineral wool, and over this is nailed Johns-Manville perforated Transite board, 3/16\" thick. This gives the studio a perfect acoustical quality, as the sound waves, striking the transite board, are broken up by the perforations, behind which they are absorbed by the mineral wool. Mineral wool has the rare quality of \"straight line\" absorption, so that the sounds within the studio are neither echoed loudly from the walls nor distorted in tone. The Transite board and mineral wool constitute, of course, a fireproof wall.\n\nThe concrete for the new building was supplied by Ready-Mix Concrete Ltd., to meet the architect's specifications, which were as follows, the figure in brackets being the average of the tests in each case:\n\nFootings & walls\u20142000 lbs., (2250)\nBeams and slabs\u20145000 lbs., (3000)\nColumns\u20144000 lbs., (3500)\n\nThis firm has an inspector of the Milton Hersey Company constantly at its plant to control the mix and guarantees the performance of the concrete it supplies.\n\nThe Resto-Crete treatment was done by the Western Waterproofing Company of Montreal, which has associates in the principal cities of Canada and the United States. As it is desirable to preserve the impress of the formwork, these are removed fully with a view to the architectural effect, the surface of the concrete is cleaned by grinding very lightly with carborundum stones. This light grinding of the surface gives it a uniform rate of absorption but does not alter its natural quality of refraction. The Resto-Crete mixture, properly diluted with water, is then rubbed on, completely filling the pores of the concrete. When the mixture has hardened to the right degree, the surplus is rubbed off the surface with rags. This leaves the finished surface of the concrete composed largely of fine particles as originally mixed, with the minute interstices filled with the Resto-Crete material. The wall has thus been waterproofed simply by filling the pores with a material essentially the same as the original concrete.\n\nIn the case of the Associated Screen News building, white cement was used and sufficient pigment added to give a colour somewhat like fresh Indiana stone.\n\nThe Resto-Crete treatment is similarly applicable to mortar joints, which leak more frequently than is commonly realized. Many old buildings and some new ones in this country have been thus treated during recent years. Resto-Crete is also used often inside a building to prevent \"sweating.\"\n\nSome of the prominent buildings finished with Resto-Crete recently are as follows:\n\nC.N.R. hotels at Halifax and Charlottetown.\nNeurological Building, McGill University, Montreal.\nInternational Paper Mill, Dalhousie, N. B.\nChequers Court Apts., Montreal.\n\nThe architects for the Associated Screen News building were Messrs. J. W. Orrack and N. B. Reardon, of the C.P.R., and the contractors were the A. Janin Construction Co.\nFUNDAMENTALS OF WEATHERPROOFING\n\nBY\n\nWESTERN WATERPROOFING COMPANY\n\nWESTERN WATERPROOFING COMPANY\n1440 St. Catherine St. West\nMONTREAL\nNECESSITY FOR WEATHERPROOFING\n\nThere is probably no more acute problem facing the building owner than that of weatherproofing. The reasons for this might be listed as follows:\n\n1. The actual disintegration of the building. Offhand this may seem negligible when we think of the massive structures that are built nowadays, but the proof of the statement is witnessed by the great number of buildings showing efflorescence and spalling, and by the vast number of treatments which are offered on the market as panac\u00e9es.\n\n2. The loss of capital investment, due to deterioration shortening the life of the building.\n\n3. Loss of rental income, due to unattractive appearance.\n\n4. Increase in operating cost, due to greater heat loss through increasingly porous exterior surfaces.\n\n5. Increase in interior maintenance cost, due to damage caused by penetration of water.\n\nTherefore from the standpoint of both the investment and the return, a good weatherproofing job is a saving rather than an expense.\n\nTHE CAUSES OF WATER PENETRATION: DISRUPTION\n\nIf it were not for the excessive penetration of water we would not be faced with this problem. The presence of any or all of these conditions cause excessive penetration of water into masonry walls.\n\n1. Structural cracks, and disintegration cracks and holes.\n\n2. Most mortar joints, such as brick, stone, etc.\n\n3. Porous surfaces such as limestone, sandstone, common brick, concrete, etc.\n\nIt is at once obvious that the penetration through all except structural cracks could have been prevented and can be treated. Structural cracks, however, are usually subject to further movement, and hence the treatment cannot be absolute, though the condition may be vastly improved by the use of suitable methods.\n\nIt appears, then, that practically all masonry surfaces will absorb moisture. This is due to the fact that they are composed of many differently shaped crystals, somewhat loosely packed together, whereas metals and glass are extremely dense. Under a microscope, concrete resembles more a mass of snowflakes in density, than the familiar structural mass to which we are accustomed. The voids seem to predominate over the solid matter. Therefore from the standpoint of weatherproofness, the only conceivable type of masonry unit which would be entirely weatherproof would be one with surfaces of the density of glass, and a structure composed of such a material would have to be entirely one unit with no joints, and no structural or other cracks.\nBearing this in mind for a moment, let us now look at the disrupting influences due to water penetration which cause deterioration of the building and which any treatment must withstand. Water causes disruption in four manners:\n\n1. By carrying in corrosive chemicals which dissolve out important salts and deposit them on the surface, in the form of efflorescence. It is not generally considered, but air saturated with rain water carries the bases of the three most powerful acids known to chemistry, Hydrochloric, Sulphuric, and Nitric, and all will disintegrate masonry. Sulphuric acid is the most common, particularly where there is considerable coal smoke in the air. Salts of Hydrochloric acid such as common table salt are also present to some degree, particularly near salt water, and are able to generate this acid. Nitric acid is formed from the action of water upon millions of bodies of the so-called \"nitrifying bacteria\" which live in the air and are deposited upon masonry surfaces.\n\nThere are hundreds of other things which will also dissolve out the important salts in masonry, such as some of the mineral oils, blood, weak acids, alkalis or other chemicals in certain manufacturing processes, in the air, or perhaps in the masonry itself.\n\nWater is the universal solvent, and consequently it is itself capable of dissolving out certain of these salts.\n\n2. By expanding upon freezing. It is obvious that the minute water particles which are locked in a masonry mass will upon freezing exert a tremendous total pressure upon the internal structure of the mass itself; and the results are everywhere apparent as will be noted if one examines more closely the buildings around him.\n\n3. By causing the extraneous growth of certain crystals. This is a physical process involving the addition of water to certain crystals with the resulting expansion of them. Calcium hydroxide is notable in this respect. Its crystals upon taking up water grow in one plane only, and the force released causes serious damage to concrete and other types of masonry.\n\n4. By causing oxidation of steel reinforcing in concrete, etc.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the pressure released by crystal growth, including the formation of ice from water, may approach 14,000 Sq. In.\n\nIn addition to these types of disintegration, the use of soft aggregates in concrete in certain localities renders the building much more liable to the disrupting action of water.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS FOR WEATHERPROOFING TREATMENTS\n\nIt is obvious, therefore, that the main objective of any weatherproofing treatment must be to permanently stop the ingress of water. It is believed that a material which will effectively accomplish this aim must fulfill the following specifications laid down more than 75 years ago by a group of scientists:\n\n1. The material must penetrate easily into the masonry surface and remain there on drying.\n2. The material must not concentrate on the surface so as to form a hard crust, but at the same time it must harden the surface sufficiently to resist erosion. (Obviously, therefore, the material must densify the existing surface by filling the holes, and must subsequently become hard).\n\n3. The material must prevent the penetration of moisture, and at the same time allow moisture to escape.\n\n(This may appear paradoxical, but if condensation water from the inside of the building which is drawn to the exterior of the building by the action of the sun is not allowed to escape, rotting of the masonry immediately behind the exterior surfaces will take place. This may take the form, among other things, of a crystalline growth as explained under Method 3, p.2. Or the rotting may be due to freezing of the condensation water so collected with the results described in Method 2, p.2. In the same manner that the human body must breathe to live, so also, masonry buildings must \"breathe\" to endure. It has been proven in research laboratories that air must be allowed to circulate throughout the masonry mass to prevent rotting; and what is more important, certain components of masonry must continually be exposed to the small amount of water vapor which is in the air to continue chemical processes necessary to the stability of the masonry as a whole. It was stated a while back that a material of the density of glass was the only material which would be entirely waterproof. Since it is impossible, however, to build a structure of such a material in one unit, structural cracks, cracks and holes between mortar and brick or tile, etc., and porous surfaces, are all of them bound to permit the entrance of water, and water from such sources must not be allowed to collect in the pockets, but must be allowed to evaporate freely from surfaces. Disruption due to the above conditions is usually noticed first where a water pocket has been formed by gravitation, i.e., where a great amount of water collects in the wall, such as below window sills or coping stones, at the ground level, and where other masonry masses butt into an adjoining wall).\n\n4. The material must not discolor or in any way alter the original appearance of the surface.\n\n5. The material must expand and contract uniformly with the surrounding surface so as not to cause flaking.\n\n6. The material must be non-corrosive and harmless in use.\n\n7. The material should retain its preservative effect indefinitely.\n\nOLD WEATHERPROOFING METHODS\n\nWith the above objectives in mind let us now consider the various types of treatment on the market:\n\n1. Oil paints, drying and non-drying oils. Oil paints commonly used have either standard fillers, or cement filler. Common drying oils used are China Wood Oil, and Linseed Oil, or combinations of these. Non-drying oils are usually mineral oils, or a combination of a mineral paraffin oil and any number of other oils.\nThe most important objection to these types of treatment is that they form a skin over the surface which does not permit water to escape from the wall, and therefore renders the structure liable to disruption of the type noted in spec. 3, p.3.\n\nIt is also true that no paint will form a perfect skin, but will leave numerous small holes and cracks visible under a microscope, which because of their physical form will allow moisture to penetrate more easily than to escape.\n\nMost of the paints and drying oils in use are also subject to saponification due to the alkaline nature of masonry construction. Saponification causes them to \"chalk\", due to a chemical change in the basic oil which leaves it inelastic and rather soft (particularly in cement base paints, where free lime is present).\n\nPaints and drying oils do not fulfill the objective from another standpoint \u2014 they do not densify the surface but merely bridge over the voids between the pinacles of solid material. Non-drying oils will often penetrate the surface for a distance but are apt to discolor it in so doing.\n\nOf all these types of treatment, China Wood Oil is the least harmful, since it does not collect dirt, and will not cause disintegration of the masonry, but it does not fulfill the main objective.\n\n2. Cement, Magnesite, and other paints and plaster coatings. These are non-elastic, and since they have a difference in coefficient of expansion from that of the surface upon which they are placed, are subject to the formation of a crack between themselves and that surface, and consequently soon peel off. Cement paints are usually apt to dust and shrink, due to the use of clayey admixtures to give flowability, to the use of too much water, and to improper curing. Magnesite, gypsum, sodium silicate, and glue base paints do not have in themselves inherent structural stability for exterior use.\n\nIt is obvious that these treatments do not fulfill the objective as regards densifying the original surface.\n\n3. Waxes and Paraffin. There are two methods of applying these treatments, first, by reheating the surface and painting on the melted paraffin, reheating, and then wiping off the excess; and second, by dissolving them in solvents such as kerosene, turpentine, etc., and applying them directly, the solvent soon evaporating and leaving only the paraffin.\n\nThe effect of sealing the surface as is required by the first method has already been discussed; and with the second it is necessary to get a perfect skin if the treatment is to endure. Otherwise dust will collect in the pores and an opening for water be established. Now when it is realized that only about 10% or less of these solutions is paraffin, it is not surprising that microscopic examination reveals many minute holes through the skin, even after a number of successive treatments.\n\nThere are hundreds of possible combinations of this latter type, and the paraffin, or beeswax treatment is the oldest remedy known. However, no paraffin treatment fulfills the main objective.\nIt is obvious from the above that if any one of the various types of treatment herein enumerated completely fulfill the weatherproofing requirements, it would have dominated the market in the many years that it has been available for such use.\n\nTHE RESTO-CRETE SYSTEM\n\nFrom the above discussion we may conclude that voids constitute a large part of the surface area of masonry structures. In developing a new material, therefore, the problem was to find a material which would simply fill those voids in compliance with the specifications enumerated above. After considerable research, pure Portland cement was chosen as the base, because in its hardened state its physical characteristics more nearly conformed to those of most masonry surfaces. To this was added a small amount of suitable chemicals to give waterproofness, sufficient expansion to lock the material in the voids, workability, and finally an inert material, which laboratory tests proved to be approximately 5% stronger than Portland cement alone, to resist abrasion.\n\nThe method of application on a suitably prepared surface consists of scrubbing on a regulated mixture of the material and water, and at the proper time rubbing it with clean rags to absolutely pack the material into the pores and to remove the excess. The colour of any porous masonry surface may be changed due to the fact that the largest portion of the surface area itself is voids, and to the use of high grade mineral oxide colour in the material with which these holes are to be filled. This method will not destroy physical and colour characteristics of limestone and sandstone surfaces.\n\nThe method has been developed to fit the individual requirements of all masonry surfaces which present a solid base. The list includes the surfaces of Cinder and Haydite block, concrete block, artificial stone, limestone, sandstone, porous granite, common brick, concrete, cement stucco, and granite; and mortar joints between all types of water-absorption, brick, stone, tile and terracotta. In addition a method of treating Cinder and Haydite block to produce a beautifully textured imitation Briar Hill Sandstone has been developed.\n\nThe material is made in eight standard colours and whites, and black, and special matching colours may be formed where necessary.\n\nThe Western Waterproofing Company is one of the oldest waterproofing companies in the country, and in their many years of service have successfully completed millions of square feet of waterproofing and weatherproofing. It is the privilege of the organization to extend the help of the Research Laboratory in the solving of all problems connected with waterproofing and allied fields.\n\nSigned - W. G.

Regarding your building at Shubenacadie, if the brick is waterproof we could cure the water trouble by waterproofing the joints only. Otherwise, it would be necessary to waterproof both brick and joints. In this case the brick would be matched as closely as possible and the joints struck with grey material. Generally it is only necessary to waterproof the joints.\n\nOur procedure is to repoint the building where necessary, replace disintegrated brick, thoroughly clean the surfaces and waterproof by scrubbing into the surface a mixture of cement ground cast iron and certain expanding chemicals.\n\nExclusive of replacing the disintegrated brick and local taxes, if any, the job would run about 20\u00a2 per square foot solid area. This would include the caulking of the window openings, cleaning, repointing where necessary, and waterproofing.\n\nWe would guarantee our work for 5 years.\n\nWe can offer as references the chief architects of the Dept of Public Works, Bell Telephone Co., Canadian National Railways and many others.\n\nYours very truly\n\nT.C.Creaghan\n\nP.S.

In a letter from Ingram and Bell, of December 3, 1936, they say that they will supply the outfit at $133.00 provided there was no duty.\n\nWell, as far as duty is concerned, this is what happened. They shipped the apparatus in two pieces, one part costing $89.00 went to the Customs in Truro, and the other part costing $48.00 went to the Customs in Halifax. I received notice from the Customs Authorities in both places. Not wishing to make the trip into Halifax, I sent invoices, etc., to a friend of mine and asked him to look after it, and the Customs people put everything on that they could, costing him $21.26. I went to Truro to see about the other part, and paid $2.67 excise tax, and $2.47 freight. They did not charge me any duty or sales tax.

Ingram and Bell, Toronto. It is understood that you placed the order for supplying the sterilizer through this firm.\n\nThe account, covering the cost, from the Felton & Crane Company, Detroit, is billed to Ingram and Bell. The Department considers, as the order was placed through this last named firm, they should be responsible for payment to the Felton-Crane Company and render you their account on their own bill heads for the equipment, to the amount of $137.00. I may say that the Department would be in difficulty in forwarding a cheque in payment to an American concern.\n\nRegarding the duty, sales and excise tax and freight, it is necessary that you be responsible for payment of these charges, from per capita grant or other receipts of the school.\n\nI would request that you return the account of the Felton & Crane Company to Ingram & Bell, for this firm to settle with the Felton & Crane Company and bill you with the cost of the sterilizer, to the amount of $137. When you receive Ingram & Bell's account, you should certify it in the usual manner and forward to the Department, when a cheque will be forwarded to the company, in settlement of the account.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nRev.

Today I am sending a box containing short pieces. The worst is the one inch running from the main two inch line, to the girls wash and bath rooms. The other pieces will show you how the pipe becomes pitted and when the attempt is made to disconnect them, they brake.\n\nDuring the last two weeks in March, we renewed the main line from the hot water tank through the laundry, out beyond the kitchen. These pipes were replaced with galvanized iron pipe, we should have done it with copper or brass. Next we had to do the pipe leading to the boys and girls bath rooms, etc. This we are doing with copper pipe. For material only the cost has been over one hundred and fifty dollars. It is only a matter of a short time till all the hot water pipes will have to be replaced.\n\nFor the past two years we have had trouble getting hot water. Both for the girls and boys baths we had to carry hot water from the laundry. While this is an improvement over what the Indian had in his own home, nevertheless with the crowd we have it makes a messy job and takes about every day of the week to see that every child has a bath once a week.\n\nWe also had to replace the top section of the hot water Jacket. If the cost of a hot water boiler with brass tubing were not prohibitive, we would have discarded the hot water jacket.\nThe jacket heaters are only guaranteed to thirty five pounds pressure and that is hardly enough to carry water to the top floor.\n\nWhile we are on the subject of water, I might as well let you know that the water proofing on the outside front wall was not completely satisfactory. On November 22nd, and December 3rd, water poured in through the top of three windows. I suppose these people will be back to go over those sections. Other than in these places there has been no water, but in damp weather, the plaster continues to fall. One would expect that, as in many places the plaster is just holding and that is all. I hope the plaster was included in the appropriation for this year. The other parts of the walls are just as bad as the front, and the occasional rain storm causes the windows to leak. While repairing the Chapel after the fire, we had an easterly rain storm. Where the plaster and cork board was broken you could see the water trickling down on the inside of the tile wall.\n\nIn conclusion, I hope the Department will see a way to help us with renewing the hot water line and that the plastering will be repaired this summer. We cannot do any painting with the walls in the condition they are, and yet the other walls of class rooms, etc., are certainly in need of paint.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I was over in the village and arrived back at the school about 9.45 A.M. I told him the date and windows where the rain came in. As he was anxious to get the next train back to Halifax, he had only twenty minutes until train time. He stood on the granite base of the windows affected and looked up along the wall. Coming back inside he showed me where the mastic which he said had been disturbed by the storm windows, and said that the water could come in there. Of course that was not included in their contract. I never saw the contract and I told him I did not know anything about it, and that point should be settled between the Company and the Department. The place where the mastic was detached was near the bottom of the window and I suppose the rain would come in there, travel to the top of the window and then drop down. As for not seeing the water actually coming in, the few storms we had were during the night and I did not see the water coming in. But today we have had heavy showers with very little wind and the water came in one of the windows of the Community Room. Today on practically every window sill, the powdered plaster is falling. This may be what they would call condensation.\n\nI suggest that you leave things for a while longer and see what happens.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

At a cost of approximately one\nhundred and fifty dollars for pipes, etc., we\nmade these repairs and hope that this will be\nall the repairs for at least a year.

MacKay\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nJanuary 7, 1938.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWhen making up your appropriation for next year's expenditures, we beg that you will consider the following:\n\n1. Addition to the feed room, 30 X 14. When the barn was built ten years ago, there was no feed room, and a small space was taken from the implement shed for that purpose. As you know buying feed in small amounts is more costly than in carload lots. Further, the room is not rat-proof, and year after year, we have had considerable loss from these rodents. What we would like to see is space enough to handle a carload of feed, and have it lined with sheet metal to keep out mice and rats. A few years ago we managed from school funds to have such a room for flour, rolled oats, etc., and it has meant a considerable saving.\n\n2. An addition to the hog house of 20 X 19, with a straw loft above. Some years ago you allowed $1000.00 for the hog house, a dairy, and an ice house. Later one hundred and Twenty-five Dollars ($125.00) was taken from that amount to do calking around the windows and doors of the school, leaving $875.00 for the two buildings. We kept within the amount but curtailed the size of the hog house. As it is now, we have no suitable place for butchering pigs, cows, etc. The last few years we have been buying our beef on the foot for the winter months. In order to butcher them, we have to take them a distance of two miles to a slaughter house. In that way we lose considerable time, and also lose valuable feed for the hogs. So if we had this addition to the hog house, it would enable us to keep more hogs, and have them and the beef butchered on the premises. The cost we estimate of such an addition, would be $450.00\n\nThe estimated cost of the addition to the feed room would not be above $275.00\nThis work we would do without any outside help, thereby giving the older boys a good opportunity to learn carpenter work. The last building done here was in 1935, when a residence was built for the assistant farmer.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6055, file 265-5, part h)\nOttawa, January 11, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of January 7th with reference to certain improvements which you wish to make at the Shubenacadie Residential School this year. Our estimates for the fiscal year 1938-39 were prepared during the month of October and therefore it is not possible at the present time to include the total amount requested in your recent letter.\n\nFor your information I may say that an amount of $500.00 was placed in our estimates for repairs and improvements at the Shubenacadie Residential School. This amount would be more than sufficient for the addition to the hog house, cost of which I note you estimate at $450.00. About April 1st you should write me again in connection with this addition and give me full particulars regarding the material that will be required. I am pleased to note that the building could be erected by the older boys under the supervision of a member of your staff.\n\nWhen writing about the hog house, you might also let me have particulars regarding material required for addition to the feed room and, if funds can be secured, this work will also be authorized.\n\nAll supplies are now secured by the Purchasing Agent and, as a result, very complete information is required regarding any materials that it is intended to purchase.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J.P.

Since you state in your letter that you had placed $500.00 in your estimates for repairs, do you suppose the Department would allow us to exceed that amount by $72.00. If not then we would try to finance whatever was necessary over the $500.00 from school funds. The following will give you a fair idea of contemplated expenditures:\n\n$160.00 ... Lumber from E. Kerr, Shubenacadie, N.S.\n30.00 ... side wall shingles, John Benjamin, Shub.\n25.00 ... windows, door, stock\n50.00 ... cement\n100.00 ... roofing shingles\n180.00 ... galvanized tin, nails, lead, paper .... Wm. Stairs & Son, & Morrow, Halifax, N.S.\n12.00 ... gravel ... anyone we could get it from at the time.\n\n$572.00\n\nAs a number of the bigger boys will be leaving the last of June, if we could have permission to go ahead with the work soon, then we think the greater part of it would be completed before vacation begins. So if you can help things along, we hope you will.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Principal was written on June 27th and the names contained in your memorandum were given to him.\n\nOn July first Mr. Pratt phoned to Mr. Phelan and stated that it would not be necessary to ask quotations from the three firms in Halifax. He also directed that for the names of the Halifax firms we should substitute the name of Edward Kerr, Limited, Shubenacadie, and A. J. Reid & Sons, Shubenacadie. This information was wired to the Principal on July first.\n\nI am in receipt of a letter dated July 10th, in which the Principal states that previous to the receipt of our telegram of July first he had already asked quotations from the Halifax firms mentioned in your memorandum of June 23rd. No quotation was received from the Canadian Creosoting Company, but the Principal did receive quotations from the other firms mentioned in your memorandum of June 23rd and also from the two firms suggested by Mr. Pratt. I enclose all these quotations for your consideration. The materials that are required for the repairs to the outbuildings at the Shubenacadie School are shown on our requisition of May 23, 1938.\n\nAs the school authorities are doing the necessary work and as they wish to do this work during the summer holidays, I should appreciate receiving, at the earliest possible date, your decision regarding the firms from whom the materials are to be purchased.\n\nPP\n\nDirector.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF:\n\nVOTE: Allotment\n\nSHIP TO:\n\nPurpose for which required\n\nNOTE: Requisition for non-consumable equipment, state if New Issue or Replacement.\n\n\" consumable equipment and supplies use columns 1 and 2.\n\n| Quantity | Unit Price | TOTAL |\n|----------|------------|-------|\n|          |            |       |\n\nPage 2\n\n35 Bags cement\n\nNote: The Principal estimates that the above material will not cost more than $525.00.\n\nAs the school management is supplying all the labour free of cost for the repairs we would like to secure the above material as soon as possible as the Principal wishes to use the services of the older boys before they go on holidays early in July.\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and Departmental purposes only.

This amount was quoted by James White of Enfield, N.S.\n\nMay we point out that the width should read 2\u00bd feet, not inches.\n\nWe have interviewed Mr. White this morning, and he will submit a price taking into consideration the fact that the width should be 2\u00bd feet.\n\nMay we also point out that the quotations from local people were on the 2\u00bd foot basis.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I note that you state that the size of each sheet should be 10' x 2\u00bd'. If you refer to your letter of May 16, 1938 you will note that the last entry on Page 1 of your letter read:\n\n\"Sheet galvanized tin 10' x 2\u00bd\" .... 60 sheets\"\n\nConsequently, you will note that we requested the Purchasing Agent to order exactly what you requested.\n\nI note that Mr. White will submit a price on tin 10' x 2\u00bd'. When this is received the Purchasing Agent will no doubt compare it with the prices received from the other firms and will decide to whom the business is to be awarded.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

As soon as this Branch obtains definite information regarding the size of these another requisition will be forwarded to the Purchasing Branch.\n\nOn our requisition of June 15 it was stated that the materials requested were required for the erection of an addition to the barn at the Shubenacadie residential school.

The weight is 240 lbs. to the square, or ten foot square. They are made in three weights, and we have asked for the heaviest, on account of such high winds in this locality. They are made by Brantford, and also by Barrett. They are the same as we have on the other barn, and most outbuildings. The cost is about $8.50 - $75 per square.\n\nHoping that this will clear up any misunderstanding we may have caused,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

We had figured on 10,000 board feet, plains on one side, but in our letter of June 6th we did not include them.\n\nIt was a mistake on our part and we can offer no legitimate excuse.\n\nAlso on the list of material you sent to A.J. Reid & Sons, the item 20,000 roofing shingles 240 lbs to the square was not included. We were wondering if this was an oversight or if you were purchasing them direct from the manufacturers.\n\nBoards at 20.00 a thousand would be a big item for us to absorb here along with other equipment and we hope you will supply them for us.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

In the event of any articles having to be purchased, complete details should be given so that they may be secured through our Purchasing Branch.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend J. P. Mackey,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N. S.\nLime-Spreading Attachment\n\nMost soils require an application of limestone to grow either clover or alfalfa successfully. The lime-spreading attachment built especially for the No. 4-A manure spreader provides an economical and convenient way to spread limestone in quantities up to $3\\frac{1}{2}$ tons per acre.\n\nThe lime-spreading attachment is easy to attach and just as easy to operate. There are two revolving disks with fins set side by side underneath the rear end of the spreader bottom.\n\nWhen the spreader is in motion, the disks rotate and spread the lime toward the rear and produce an approximate spread of 12 feet. The steel retarder rack included as part of this attachment is placed at the rear of the spreader to keep steel prominent from breaking up the lime before it is dropped on the disks below.\n\nThe endgate is equipped with hangers which slip over the top of the steel retarder rack and hold the endgate in place while the load is being hauled to the field. The No. 4-A manure spreader has a capacity of two tons of limestone per load.\n\nEndgate Attachment for Semiliquid Manure\n\nThe liquid portion of the manure is the most valuable part and should be carefully conserved. The endgate attachment is used in hilly sections to prevent waste when hauling semiliquid manure to the fields. It can be conveniently raised from the seat while the spreader is in operation. A semiliquid box rear pan for catching the semiliquid manure may be used either with the endgate attachment or alone where a minimum of litter is used.\nIT IS simply good business to take the time care, caution in purchasing a tractor, not only for your farm. Soil can be spread manure profitably and efficiently by using a good mechanical spreader. The McCormick-Deering manure spreader is an outstanding example of good spreader construction. In its design it is simple, compact, and convenient. It is rust-resisting, non-warping, copiously built. Its capacity of 60 to 70 bushels has been built into manure-spreaders throughout, steel braced frame a combination of light draft, two horse power.\n\nA low, all-steel box makes the McCormick-Deering by hand work easier in draft. Two horses can pull it easily. Twelve roller bearings provide substantial all-steel sides at the rear, assure accurate alignment and ease of operation at all times. The main mechanism is protected by shields against foreign matter, such as stones, dirt, etc., which protect sprockets and chains.\n\nThe levers on both side of the spreader are within reach of the operator. They are easily operated, making it possible to operate the spreader without leaving the seat of the tractor.\n\nIllustration 1 (Above): Looking down into the McCormick-Deering No. 4-A all-steel manure spreader.

You replaced four out of seven five years ago. Besides school work, we have done some Red Cross work:- 69 Hospital Bed Gowns; 12 prs. Pyjamas;\n29 Sailors' Scarfs; 44 Soldiers' Sweaters; 27 prs. Socks;\n2 prs. Wristers.\n\nAs for the Refrigerator, we have one large Kelvinator on the basement flat, and everything, meat, butter, milk, etc., have been going in that. We have been using for twelve years an ice box for refrigerator for supplies for my own table on the second flat.\n\nAs for the lime-spreader attachment to manure spreader. Early this fall we found that it would be necessary to spend at least one hundred dollars in repairs on the original manure spreader. Rather than do that and still have an old piece of machinery, we bought a new spreader at the cost of a hundred and eighty Dollars ($180.00) and hope to pay for it from school funds. The manure spreader is a McCormack Deering, and the attachment should be of the same make.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The southern exposure which was water-proofed is leaking on the top floor. A rain storm from the North-east always causes leaks above each window, on that side of the building. This section was not water-proofed.\n\nIn the laundry, the washer, a wooden affair, in service for eleven years, will have to be replaced within the next year. If at all possible, we hope you will be able to appropriate funds for these necessary expenditures. A new metal washer would cost in the vicinity of Eighteen Hundred Dollars ($1800) and a replacement of the wooden one about Five Hundred ($500).\n\nTo water-proof the walls which so far have not been done would cost somewhere between Four and Five Thousand.\n\nWe, like everyone else, are finding that the Government taxes have greatly increased our costs. We bought our flour a short time ago, costing $26.00 and out of this amount, the Government tax was $107.00. Wool for knitting caps and mittens, costing $150.00, had a tax of $10.00. However, we are not complaining, and hope to keep out of debt.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

With regard to the sewing machines I am unable to decide exactly what you require in view of the price quoted. Do you want the ordinary sewing machine or is it some special kind that you request? We can secure the ordinary machines much cheaper than the cost mentioned in your letter.\n\nI do not think I will have any trouble arranging for the purchase of the attachment for the manure spreader.\n\nRegarding the refrigerator I realize that it would be very advantageous but at the present time it is practically impossible to secure consent for purchase of this type of equipment. Under these circumstances I regret that it will not be possible to favourably consider your request.\n\nIt is quite possible that you will have some other requirement that you can substitute. I will await a further reply.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. J. P. Mackey,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N.

With regard to the Sewing Machines they are an improvement on the old machines, and as far as I understand, they have an adjustment which would do away with many little repairs, which are often necessary on the ordinary machine, sometimes even when they have been in service for only a short time. However, if you are not providing other schools with this improved machine, we would not wish to be considered as an exception, and would be very content to have the ordinary machine.\n\nWe are glad to know that there will be no difficulty about the manure spreader. We do not know of anything to substitute for the refrigerator. We have been doing work in clay for two years, and would like to have a \"kiln\" but we have not as yet been able to get details of construction and cost. We would also like to have a wall and shed for the manure, but if there is no chance for the refrigerator, then there would be less chance for these other things.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

To reach Yarmouth by train it involved my proceeding during the evening to Halifax or Windsor Junction for overnight then getting the Yarmouth train the following morning and...\nspending eleven hours before reaching there with a similar time required to return to Shubenacadie.\n\nMy business here was completed, as far as possible for the day, by noon on the 26th and rather than lose one and one half days in reaching Yarmouth, and a similar delay to return, I requested the use of the School car from Father MacKay to which he gladly agreed.\n\nI reached Yarmouth during the evening of the 25th, completed my inspection during the 26th and until 3 pm. on the 27th at which time I started for Shubenacadie via Shelburne and the South Shore Highway. This highway was taken as the Valley Highway via Kentville was blocked with snows.\n\nOn leaving Yarmouth, driving conditions were good with mild weather prevailing. At a point 5 miles before reaching Liverpool at a fairly close\nturn in the road, a sheet of ice caused the car to skid sharply to the right. A row of guard rails banked the highway at the turn and the right-hand side of the car was grazed heavily by one pole while a second pole was struck by the left front of the car. The impact was fairly heavy with considerable damage being done. No other cars were near at the time. The car did not leave the highway and was not injured. I was driving alone.\n\nI had the car towed to Thompson's Garage at Liverpool and proceeded, by bus the following morning to Halifax. At Halifax I visited the Nash Auto Sales Service and instructed them to send a truck to Liverpool to tow the car to their garage for repairs. I might add there are not any Nash Service Garages nearer than Halifax - it appeared obvious that this company at Halifax have the best equipment and mechanics to complete the necessary repairs. The Nash Service Garage at Halifax...\nare distributors for Nash parts in Nova Scotia and are known to Father MacKay as reliable. The car was purchased from this company.\n\nI have instructed this company to immediately submit an estimate of the cost of repairs and to proceed with same having in mind that the car is required at the School and should delay where difficulty might be experienced securing necessary new parts.\n\nMy driving speed at time of accident was 35 to 40 miles per hour and it happened at dusk just prior to shifting head lamps. Road conditions up to the time of meeting the sheet of ice were reasonably good with highway clear of snow although in parts wet & slushy.\n\nI much regret having to report this accident to the School Car as it is my first after many years of driving Department cars. Yours very truly,\n\nW.E. Cunliffe, Inspector.\nMarch 7, 1942.\n\nDear Mr. Arneil:\n\nI have received your letter of March 4 in which you report an accident involving the Shubenacadie Residential School car. The question of the repairs to the car is being dealt with on another file.\n\nI am sorry to learn of this accident but also very glad to know that you were not hurt in any way.\n\nWith best wishes,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT.R.L.

At this Indian residential school there are 160 pupils and a staff of approximately 15 persons. For your information I may say that there are 77 Indian residential schools throughout Canada. Some of them have a smaller enrolment than Shubenacadie and others have a larger enrolment. I should, therefore, appreciate your forwarding to me a copy of your regulations which govern the securing of sugar at institutions of this kind.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. K.W. Taylor,\nSecretary,\nWartime Prices & Trade Board,\nOttawa, Ont.\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nMay 4, 1943.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe are having a heavy rainstorm today, and on every window on the front of the school, we have pots and pans to catch, and sheets, etc., to absorb the rain that is coming in, dripping, almost running, from the tops of the windows.\n\nSeven years ago this coming Fall, the Department had the front of the building, and part way around each corner, water-proofed. For a few years everything was fine; for the last two years a little rain has been coming in, but now it just pours in. During a storm less than a week ago, we had the same thing happen. It just means, that besides the mess, and the unpleasant smell of wet lime, that the plaster crumbles, and finally the putty coat lets go, leaving the brown undercoat.\n\nWe feel that until the war is over nothing can be done about it, not only on account of the cost, but more so the matter of obtaining the workmen to do a good water-proofing job. The flashing which goes partway under the granite coping on the top of the wall is partly to blame, but there is no doubt about it, that with a strong wind blowing the rain comes through the cement between the bricks, and also penetrates some of the soft bricks than can be found in the wall.\n\nSeven years ago a goodly number of bricks were replaced, but apparently not all the soft ones were removed. A suggestion had been made that the copper flashing should cover completely the top of the wall.\n\nThe situation is not unusual in the Province, as practically every brick building erected in the Province for the past twenty-five years has had the same trouble.\n\nWe are calling the matter to your attention now only that it may be repaired at the convenient time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Principal. As he states in his letter, we had the front of the building water-proofed some years ago and apparently it will be necessary to have some similar procedure followed as soon as conditions permit.\n\nAs Mr. Buck will be in Nova Scotia this summer in connection with the proposed buildings on the new reserves, it would be appreciated if you could arrange to have him visit Shubenacadie and make a thorough examination of the Shubenacadie Residential School and on his return he would no doubt let us know what action he considered should be taken and at the same time supply us with an estimate of the probable cost.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nMay 7, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nRe: Shubenacadie Indian Residential School, Shubenacadie, N.B.\n\nI enclose, for your information, a copy of a letter which has just been received from the Rev.

However, you will recall that Mr. Sparks visited the Eskasoni and Shubenacadie Reserves in connection with the water supply question, and while at Shubenacadie he undertook an examination of the Residential School.\n\nMr. Sparks has reported that he found the situation as regards leaks when southerly and easterly storms occurred was as described in letter from Rev. Father J.P. Mackey, Principal, to Dr. McGill under date of May 4th last, and that considerable damage is being done to plaster work throughout the building, but principally on the top floor. The roof was examined and appeared sound, and it is considered no leakage could be attributed to this source.\n\nAs pointed out by Rev. Father Mackey in his letter of May 4th, it is not unusual in coastal areas for masonry buildings to have trouble of this nature. It will be noted further that Rev. Father Mackey states that some years ago the front of the building was waterproofed, and for a few years everything was fine. However for the past two years conditions have been getting worse again.\n\nMr. Sparks reports that all exterior wall areas and window and door openings were examined, as well as the roof parapet walls and copings. Leaks do not appear to develop under ordinary rain conditions, but only when storms occur. Under these circumstances, and in view of the conditions of the walls as noted during examination, it is Mr. Sparks' opinion that further waterproofing of walls and openings should be undertaken. He further considers that all exterior walls of the structure should be treated as considerable deterioration was noted in masonry previously untreated, as well as around window and door openings.\n\nWhile Rev. Father Mackey advises he feels that until the war is over nothing can be done about repairs it would appear that much damage to the building may result if such repairs are postponed indefinitely. We therefore suggest that approval be given to arranging with a competent waterproofing company for an estimate of the cost of treating the exterior walls of the institution in order that consideration may be given to the possibility of undertaking some repair work at an early date.\n\nJ.

When you obtain this information you will no doubt submit it for our consideration.\n\nDirector.\nSt. John's N.S.\nFeb. 3rd/44\n\nMr. R.F. Hoey,\nActing Director, Ind Dept,\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nThe washing machine, with over fifteen years of continued service, is at the end of its usefulness. The fixture is falling apart, and you can pull strips or pieces of the wood off with finger strength.\n\nThe Canadian Laundry Machinery Co.,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nSerial No. 1215 1/2 - were the makers -\n(M. 7196) May I ask your very early consideration of a replacement as this fixture will go to scrap any time.\n\nSincerely Yours,\nJ.M. Brown\nOttawa,\nFebruary 7, 1944.\n\nDear Father Brown:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, with reference to the washing machine at the Shubenacadie Residential School. To replace this equipment at the present time would involve an expenditure for which no special provision was made in the current year's appropriation. While at certain times of the fiscal year we are able to handle unforeseen expenditures, it is difficult to do so at present, due to the fact that the end of the fiscal year will soon occur and our funds at this period of each fiscal year are usually very low and all allotted.\n\nIf you had found it possible to come to Ottawa last month we could have discussed with you a number of matters with which you cannot be expected to be familiar at the present time. May I point out the following:\n\n1. The fiscal year starts on April 1 each year and runs for a period of twelve months to the following March 31.\n\n2. The estimates for the expenditure during each fiscal year have to be prepared several months in advance. For instance, the estimates for the fiscal year 1944-45, which begins on April 1, 1944, and ends on March 31, 1945, were prepared in October, 1943.\n\n3. We are only allowed a very small amount to cover unexpected expenditures and, as a result, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to provide funds unless the expenditure has been specifically provided for in the appropriation.\n\nRev. J.W. Brown,\nPrincipal, Indian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\n4. We always provide the per capita allowance without any request from the school, because this is a regular expenditure each year and, without any communication from the principal, we know the pupilage for which grant is provided and the rate per capita.\n\n5. When funds are provided for an expenditure purchase is made through our Purchasing Branch and they require very detailed information regarding the articles required, in order to make certain that they secure what is actually needed.\n\nAt the present time I cannot see my way clear to purchase a new washing machine for the Shubenacadie School and I trust that you can arrange to have minor repairs made that will keep this machine in operation for the next few months. Although we have not been previously advised regarding the condition of this machine and, therefore, have not provided any amount specifically in our 1944-45 appropriation for its replacement, we will endeavour to find funds in May or June. This will involve reducing the amount to some other residential school and such procedure always causes us considerable correspondence, if not rather strong protests.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nFebruary 10, 1944.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa\n\nFile 51 - 0 - 5\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour favor of February 7th at hand. I regret that a formal application for washing machine was not made earlier.\n\nMr. MacLeod says that three years ago this washing machine was falling apart. In looking through the files, I find that a representation of the matter was made to the Department under date of October 4, 1940.\n\nWe will try to make the washer hold together until April. Both slats and ends are rotted out, and a bolt comes right through the pulp slats. So you see we are in a bad spot, with a thousand pieces of washing each Monday. Let's hope it holds, and if not, a wire will advise of end of this washer. Coming by freight and its placement would spoil a month. The Purchasing Branch will have gone into the merits of this washer, or a better one, so we could hope for least possible delay, if this unit goes bad beyond repair.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nRev. J.W. Brown.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 15, 1944.\n\nEX'D.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, with further reference to the washing machine at the Shubenacadie School. When you come to Ottawa next month you should have with you full particulars regarding the size and type of the washing machine at present in the school. You should also discuss with Mr. MacLeod the possibility of our securing new slats and installing them in the machine. Possibly the whole machine will have to be replaced, but we have had somewhat similar experiences in other places and when new slats were provided the machine worked satisfactorily for a further period.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

I am therefore submitting report of Mr. Macleod, our carpenter-engineer.\n\nThe pumps here were installed in 1929, consisting of:\n- Only 5000 gal. per hour pump, driven by 1 - 5 H.P. Motor;\n- Only 2500 gal. per hour pump, driven by 1 - 3 H.P. Motor.\n\nThese pumps have been running on an average of eight to eleven hours per day, for the last fifteen years. The pumps start against direct water pressure, cut in at full speed, with no air chamber or varying speeds to cushion strain on same. It is a case of start or break, which we have had plenty of in crank shafts and piston rods. The pumps being out of date, it is impossible to get parts, and we have to revert to brazing, which is not at all satisfactory for running parts.\n\nThe Commutator on armature of 5 H.P. Motor is completely worn out, has been refaced several times; not stock enough for further refacing.\n\nWe have two pressure tanks in pump house, and the pressure is maintained by pumps. We have no storage tank or reserve supply at all. If anything goes wrong with pumps, we are out of water completely until repairs are made. The voltage is irregular here, causing heating and wear on motors.\n\nWould suggest new pumps, and one 5 H.P. Motor; otherwise water supply is going to be some problem shortly.\n\nLeaks in hot water pipes are continuous. The minerals in the water when heated eat right through the pipes and fittings. Some of the pipes have been replaced four times in the last fifteen years. The only remedy here would be copper piping or water softener; the latter not satisfactory under supply conditions.\n\nKelvinator was condemned four years ago by reliable repair man.\n\nAll Motors and machinery are worn, which can only be expected after fifteen years.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

BROWN, Principal.\nOttawa, July 12, 1944.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department has carefully considered your letter of June 14, with reference to the condition of the pumps and motors operating the water supply at the Shubenacadie Residential School.\n\nWith reference to the attached quotation, the Department does not see the advantage of buying the first outfit mentioned for $620.40.\n\nIf you consider two engines are required, the second pump should be another Fairbanks-Morse #2340T.\n\nAccording to the catalogue, the list price of this engine is $345.00, and there would be the further advantage that you would have two engines exactly the same and it would be easier to obtain repair parts.\n\nThe Department approves of your purchasing either one or two Fairbanks-Morse pumps No. 2340T, also the Type Z gasoline engine. This will involve an expenditure running from $648.50 to approximately $1,000.00. In view of the very strong financial position of this school, it is felt that payment for this equipment should be made from school funds. The amount specifically provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at the Shubenacadie School has already been over-expended, due to the purchase of the washer.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

We do not have this amount provided in the current year's appropriation and it is evident from the report we have received that the work should be done at the earliest possible date. In view of the very satisfactory condition in which the finances of the Shubenacadie School are at the present time, I thought that you might agree to take an amount of $3000 from your credit balance in order that the work could be completed at the earliest possible date. Please let me hear from you by return mail.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J.W.

Creaghan & Archibald, Montreal, Agents for the Western Waterproofing Company, in March of this year. This firm had carried out waterproofing on portions of exterior walls and stone copings about seven years ago which eliminated leakages into the building for some time, but it has been reported by the School Principal that for the last two years water has again been finding its way into the interior of the building, and is causing extensive damage to plasterwork.\n\nExamination of the roof by Mr. Sparks in the fall of 1943, indicated that the roof covering was intact and that walls and parapet flashings were sound, but that bed joints below, and vertical joints between the coping stones, were in most cases only filled with broken and loose mortar, permitting water to seep down through voids in the wall between the brick facing and tile backing. Mr. Sparks expressed the opinion that water is also penetrating the brick facing of the wall. The total accumulation of moisture is being expelled at the heads and jambs of doors and windows resulting in the damage referred to.\n\nReporting on the failure of their previous treatment of wall surfaces, Mr. T.C. Creaghan stated that, in his opinion, water admitted at the top of the wall had destroyed adhesion of the waterproofing, and that before further waterproofing would be effective caulking should be repaired. He stated further that he did not believe any asphalt pointing compound would be able to resist constant expansion and contraction, and that for permanent satisfaction, the stone coping should be metal covered. While an estimate had been requested for the work considered necessary, none was received from this firm. We concur in their opinion, however, that caulking the joints of the coping with an elastic asphalt compound, would only be a temporary improvement and would have to be repeated at intervals, while for the permanent satisfaction could only be obtained by a metal covering being applied over the copings. The material used in the Shubenacadie area should be 16 ounce copper.\n\nThis Service contacted Mr. H.H. Foreman, Co-ordinator of Capital Equipment and Durable Goods, Wartime Prices and Trade Board, and was advised that 16 ounce copper would be released to the Contractor if it was decided to use this material.\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10; Volume 6050, file 200-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIt is likely that by installing a copper covering, much of the infiltration of water would be eliminated; but some waterproofing on the brick faces of the building would still be necessary. It is felt, however, that the latter phase of the work might be deferred until the effect of the metal covering could be observed. Mr. Sparkes was requested while in Nova Scotia to obtain competitive prices for the work involved, and was only able to secure a tender from one firm, namely: James Donohue, Limited, of Halifax amounting to $2,746. This firm carried out the roofing and flashing on the school building when it was built. Mr. Sparkes has advised they have a good reputation, that they have the necessary stock of 16 ounce copper, and would be able to give immediate attention to the work.\n\nNo prices have yet been obtained for waterproofing brickwork; but based on the cost of work carried out at the Louisbourg Museum some years ago at a unit price of 40 cents per square foot, applying a clear waterproofing compound to the affected areas, would require an expenditure in the neighborhood of $4,000. Due to wartime labour conditions, this unit price may no longer be applicable. Confirmation from a reliable firm would be necessary before funds were allotted to this phase of the work.\n\nWhile no funds have been made available, it is possible that the Indian Affairs Branch may wish to proceed with some of the work in the near future, under which circumstances, it is recommended that the tender obtained by Mr. Sparkes, from James Donohue, Limited, amounting to $2,746., for applying the covering to the coping be accepted, and that $2,000. should be provided to cover the cost of the work and engineering expenses.\n\nInstructions regarding our further action will be appreciated.\n\nChief Engineer.\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Water penetration Shubenacadie Indian Residential School, Shubenacadie, N.S.\n\nWith reference to your memoranda of May 7th and December 8th, 1943, I may say that this problem has been looked into further and for your information, I enclose copy of a memorandum from Mr. Mills, dated October 21st, which is self-explanatory.\n\nWe concur in Mr. Mills' opinion that the first step that should be undertaken is the covering of the coping with copper and would recommend the acceptance of the tender of James Donchue, Limited at $2,746.00, if funds can be made available.\n\nWill you kindly advise if you wish this work to be proceeded with this year and if so, will you please transfer $3,000 to our Engineering and Construction Service to cover the cost thereof.\n\nJ.M.

This is the price they submitted to the Surveys & Engineering Branch to do the work that the engineers of that Branch consider required. In the contract with the firm you should have a clause reading: \"Work will be subject to inspection during progress and at completion by an engineer of the Surveys & Engineering Branch and it is understood that the firm will carry out their contract to his satisfaction.\" We are arranging to have one of the engineers of the Surveys & Engineering Branch, likely Mr. Sparks, examine the work as it proceeds and at completion and as soon as he advises you that the firm have carried out their contract in the manner specified you should issue a cheque to the firm for the amount mentioned above. In submitting his report, Mr. Sparks expressed the opinion that water is penetrating the brick facing of the wall. To overcome this condition it is proposed to install a copper covering. Mr. Sparks stated that James Donohue Limited are a reputable firm and that they have the necessary stock of 16 ounce copper and are in a position to give immediate attention to the work.\n\nRev. J.W.

Following an interview with Mr. Sparks, on the question of repairs, I phoned the Donohue Co., who had offered to do the work at a cost of $2,746.00, only to learn that they have no copper for the work at this time, and that it would take from ten to twelve weeks to procure some. Also it would be necessary to have a Priority Permit, to be obtained by the Department, before copper could be used on this job.\n\nMr. Donohue also advised the delaying of the work until April, '45, when the weather is more favourable. So the work is off for the winter months, and I will see to it that copper is at hand, and Priority permits arranged for in early March, so as to have no further delays - almost two years now - in this work of caring for our school building.\n\nMy thanks to Mr. Sparks for his interest and help.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This is a reply to an inquiry I made as to the chances we might have of obtaining one W-6 Tractor. This machine is heavier and stronger than the W-4, and for our farm work, because of hills, more serviceable than the lighter tractor.\n\nI have not up to this date made application to the Department for the purchase of this Tractor. I wanted to know our chances of obtaining one, before undertaking Departmental sanction.\n\nWe need a change in our older team of horses. They have done their share of hard work, and are now so far crippled as to be no longer serviceable. A new team would cost $500.00, new harness, etc., about $200 more. The Tractor will do the work of five teams, and outlive several succeeding teams by years. It would be a good economy at about $1200 to purchase the Tractor.\n\nNow, what can the Indian Department do towards having the required permission granted, that we may be allotted one W-6 Tractor. If they are being manufactured, then one can be spared to come East, where we need it so much for our farm.\n\nMay I hope that the Department will consider this invitation to use its influence in having one W-6 Tractor forwarded us at the very earliest moment?\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nREVERED J.M. BROWN, Principal.\nOttawa, March 26, 1945.\n\nDear Father Brown:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, with reference to your decision to purchase a tractor from school funds. I discussed the contents of this letter with Mr. Hoey, and at the present time we do not see what assistance we can give.\n\nIf you can obtain the tractor, we have no particular objection to your doing so. However, as pointed out in the letter from the International Harvester Company, which I am returning to you, it is extremely doubtful if you would be able to secure a new tractor during the current year. As conditions are at the present time, it would appear advisable to postpone the purchase for another year, unless it is absolutely essential that you should have it for this year.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEncl.\n\nReverend J.

For over three years, extra heavy rainstorms, from the south and east, have come through to the ground floor, damaging ceilings, walls, and floors.\n\nMaking another examination today, Mr. Donohue, and his crew man, with our Mr. McLeod, declares it is no use to go on with the copper repair work, ordered last Fall. Winter storms have so destroyed the roof, making many new leaks; thus, making utterly useless the proposed repairs.\n\nWhat we need at once is a complete new roof job, and then the copper placed under the coping -- not over the coping, and down on to the leaking roof. That means all the granite coping must be removed, the copper placed or set on bricks, and then run down and under the new roofing, in such measure as to turn aside any water present from our severe wind and rain storms, coping then to be replaced. In our original plans, two inches of copper was directed to go under the roofing. There may be places where such would keep out the rain, but no good, on our hill, where the winds are strong. The old roofing has done its time at seventeen years, and is no longer a fit covering, to protect the building, or health of teachers and children.\n\nThe cost for proposed repairs was to have been paid from \"House Money\" the savings in seventeen years by Father Mackey and Sisters, for replacements in machinery within the building and on the farm.\n\nNow, this proposition is entirely new and a much greater cost. May I suggest that it is a Capital expenditure and that our \"House Money\" should not be now expected. However, it is Department Money, and may be placed in its spending as the Department may direct.\nThe Repairs to the building has been on the Order Sheet for over three years. If longer delayed it will mean a major cost for repairs to the main building.\n\nMay I ask that some very definite action be undertaken at once.\n\nIf the Department thinks an Architect should visit and investigate roof conditions, may I suggest someone who knows of our maritime winds and rainstorms? Be that as it may, I hope for some early results; as all too hurriedly our fall storms will be our visitors.\n\nI beg to enclose Mr. Donohue's estimate of cost for new roofing, and cost of copper work would be much less than former price submitted.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

BROWN,\n\nPrincipal.\nIndian Residential School\nShubenacadie, Nova Scotia\n\nOctober 18, 1945.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nWith report of costs going along to the Department, it is a good time to report conditions over our property, and suggest one most urgent and costly repair.\n\nOur roofing repairs are being carried on as directed. Repairs to cracks, not included in specifications, will be cared for while the men are on the job. We hope to have a waterproof building, and can begin the interior repairs to ceilings and walls brought on by years of delay in undertaking the present repairs.\n\nIn general, may I suggest that all our units are going wrong, breaking up and blowing out, at quite the same time.\n\nIn 1945 we had to renew our boiler, at a cost of $590.00 which provides hot water and steam for the laundry. It just simply quit. We forwarded it to Matheson Co., New Glasgow. No repairs possible, and I ordered a replacement. Same is on duty now.\n\nAgain, the large house storage hot water boiler just went bad. It opened up enough to make repairs impossible. The condition of the boiler plate is such that - through chemical internal destruction - the whole unit is ready to quit any moment. We had the Matheson Co., Engineer come, measure the old boiler, and I ordered a replacement at a cost of $375.00. The small boiler for house hot water is a wreck, and will have to be renewed very soon.\n\nI wish to advise also, that thousands of feet of piping through the building, hot water or steam, is in poor condition, and should be renewed with some other more resisting pipe.\n\nThe shingles on the barn had to be renewed at a cost of $349.00. We had a guarantee of fifteen years good service. The Company replaced the shingles at a considerable reduction in cost. This just had to be cared for in July, since Mr. Parker declared it was no good to put hay in the barn with the shingles in such condition.\nOttawa, October 31, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\nSURVEYS AND ENGINEERING BRANCH.\n\nRev. Shubenacadie Indian Residential School.\n\nThe following report has just been received from the Rev.

We cannot live here without water; we just must have it, and the Department will, I hope, arrange for the work of replacement, so that it may be undertaken at any date, if it was so required\".\n\nIn view of the above, it appears very desirable to have a qualified engineer inspect the water intake and pipes at this school as soon as possible, and to submit a report to this office regarding what is required. I trust that you will be able to give this matter early attention.\n\nDirector.\nMr. Harris' report on the Shubenacadie Agency dated Oct. 27 - Nov. 1\n\nSHUBENACADIE RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL -\n\nThis institution is one of the best managed schools that I have yet inspected. The Sisters in charge are competent teachers. The discipline is good, the children are well-behaved, well-dressed, and well-fed. I inspected the repairs that were being done to the roof. The stone coping was being lifted and replaced on a copper sheeting that would deflect the water off the wall. The workers were doing a good job, and I feel certain these repairs will prevent the water from seeping down the walls. The walls that were damaged will have to be replastered in some places, and then the damaged areas redecorated. Father Brown informed me that he had ordered - by express - seven lengths of 5 inch pipe, 18 feet long, to replace damaged pipes in the water system. Repairs were made without the new pipe. The seven lengths have arrived and are at the Shubenacadie Station. I am of the opinion that Father Brown was too hasty in ordering the pipe - especially asking that delivery be made by express. The cost of express, I understand, is approximately $35.00.\n\nFather Brown has purchased, at different times, two - five acres of farm land adjoining the school property for $200.00 and $750.00, respectively, with the registering of the deeds in his own name of approximately $1,200.00. Again I must condemn Father Brown for his hasty action. I consulted Father Mackay, the former principal, on the need of this additional land. He advised that the school could undoubtedly get along for many years without the additional ten acres of farm land; but with it there would be twenty acres of land for root crops which would make it possible to raise five acres each year on a four-year rotation plan - which is necessary. Consideration should be given to the purchase of this ten acres from Father Brown. Note, vegetables have been grown on this land during the past year and, I understand that Father Brown has been paid, or expects to be paid, $75.00, for the use of the land this year.\nNovember 24th, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nRe: Shubenacadie Indian Residential School Water Supply.\n\nWith reference to your request of the 12th instant for an inspection and report on the above as asked for by memorandum dated October 31st addressed to you by the Director, Indian Affairs Branch, Engineer R. R. Ross, of this Service, advises that he looked over this system when he was in Shubenacadie recently in connection with the Indian Agency Development.\n\nThe water system supplying the Residential School was installed in 1929 and consists of a 5 inch suction main approximately 1150 feet long from a lake north of the school farm to a pump-house located on the farm and a 4 inch pressure main approximately 750 feet long from two 1100 gallons Hydro Pneumatic pressure tanks in the pump-house to the school. The pump-house is about 14 feet above the level of the lake and there is an additional rise of about 15 feet to the school. Approximately 425 feet of the suction main at the lake is on property held by the adjoining land owner and the right to construct and maintain the main is covered by an agreement dated October 22nd, 1929. Besides the tanks, the equipment in the pump-house consists of two reciprocating pumps, renewed during the past summer, of capacities of 1500 and 3500 gallons per hour respectively at 100 pounds pressure. These pumps are electrically driven with a gasoline engine stand-by and are automatically controlled to maintain water under pressure in the tanks.\n\nThe piping is of galvanized steel and when dug up during the fall, to replace the foot valve in the lake, were found to be extensively pitted under tubercles on the inside. The pipe was not only then cut and lined with lead but some tubercles with adhering flake of metal that had been removed were examined and these verified the description of corrosion as given by the farm foreman making the repairs. Although galvanizing was not noticed on the outside of the pipes when they were dug up, no serious exterior corrosion was found.\n\nIt appears that the corrosion of the pipe has reached a critical depth and at any time the pitting may extend through the metal which is about 1/4 inch thick. Since this is a suction main, or intake, any leakage will deprive the pumps of\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\n(over)\ntheir prime which amounts to seven or eight hundred gallons in this length of pipe. With the pumping system out of order not only is the Residential School without water, but water under pressure is essential for the furnaces.\n\nUnder the circumstances it is recommended that the intake main from the lake to the pump-house as well as the pressure main from the pump-house to the school be renewed during the coming summer at such time when the existing system is not operating. It is considered that cast iron pipe should be used for this purpose on account of its non-corrosive qualities. Since 4 and 6 inch sizes are standard for cast iron pipe, it is recommended that 6 inch be installed for the suction main instead of 5 inch as at present and the present size of 4 inch retained for the pressure main.\n\nRegarding the suggestion to remove the pumps to the lake it is understood the pumps in their present location gave satisfactory service in the past until the foot valve failed through corrosion. It is felt that with an intake main without leakage the system will continue to operate satisfactorily as presently laid out. The land at the lake is not owned by the Department and the pump-house at this location would be farther from the other buildings for operation and electric service.\n\nAn estimated cost for carrying out this work is given as follows:\n\n| Materials | $2,600.00 |\n|-----------|------------|\n| Excavation, backfill and laying pipe | $2,050.00 |\n| Contingencies | $350.00 |\n| **Total** | **$5,000.00** |\n\nIt is suggested that the materials be ordered at as early a date as possible in order that they may be on hand to replace the present system early in the spring should failure take place during the winter. The distances given above are only approximate and it is suggested the Reverend Principal of the school be asked to check the distance between the inlet of the main and the pumps and also between the pumps and the school before an order for pipe is placed.\n\nChief Engineer.\nOttawa, December 4, 1945.\n\nDear Father Brown:\n\nI enclose, for your information, copy of a report just received from the Surveys and Engineering Branch regarding the water supply at the Shubenacadie School.\n\nYou will note the information they require as mentioned in the last paragraph of their memorandum.

I did not suspect that the costs would have been so high, or I would have applied for the permission to go ahead with the work.\n\nThe necessity for this work goes back years, when the boys cut the copper covering, with the shovels, while putting in the coal. That caused a leak, and a fire in the coal bin was blamed on the coal being wet, during a very hot summer. Then two years ago, the roofing of copper blew off, and I decided it must be replaced. The enclosed snap shows the roof, the copper placed on, and the work about finished. Then to save it from harm, we placed a wooden covering over the copper, and that should make it secure from the outside for about fifty years.\n\nI regret the cost, since I would have applied, had I known it would cost half as much. We can still pay it from our Bank money, if you so desire to have the cost protected that way.\n\nI have not been so advised from your Department, but it seems large amounts are to be forwarded by Mr. Rice, as Agent. That was not the custom preceding my coming to the school, or up to recently. It does not make any difference to myself, yet I would like to be advised of such changes.\n\nNo word, or sign of work on the main roofing job at this time even though Donohue promised Mr. Morris he would begin last Monday.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nREVEREND J.A.

I went over to the school today while a new pressure tank was being installed over the boilers in the boiler room, and on examining pipes including 2 and 3 inch sizes found them full of corrosion so bad that hardly a lead pencil would pass through. I feel sure with the pressure increased the pipes throughout the school, which are no doubt in the same condition, will burst. I do not know whether this has ever been brought to your attention before or not, but feel that there should be an inspector brought in to examine the whole water and heating piping system, as it does not seem possible to heat this building this winter with the pipes in their present condition. Also the water pressure is very low and feel that it is on account of the corrosion in the water pipes. This must be caused from some kind of chemical substance in the water, also the water should be tested for vegetable matter, etc. Regards the building after roof had been repaired this building still continues to leak very bad, coming through windows, also bricks as well, and ruining inside finish. I understand there is a product called Aquella that will overcome this leak on the brick, but this in turn would change the color from brick red to white. Kindly advise with respect to above.\n\nH.C.

At the same time we advised him that we were requesting the Canadian representatives of the Western Waterproofing Company, in Montreal, to arrange for an inspection of the exterior walls by their local representative, and to furnish him with their recommendations and an estimate of cost for waterproofing treatment. We have been advised in the interim between our memorandum of September 13th and the present, by the distributors, that the introduction of Cactizone into the domestic hot water system does not eliminate the need for water softening equipment, but merely prevents solidification of deposits on the piping of chemical elements present in the water. Final consideration of the matter must, therefore, include water softening equipment.\n\nUnder date of October 8th last, we received a letter from Messrs. Creaghan and Archibald, of Montreal, Canadian representatives of the Western Waterproofing Company, stating that they had inspected the School, had taken numerous photographs, and were preparing to study the problem, with a view to recommending procedure to be followed, and the preparation of an estimate of cost for the work. Mr. Ross had suggested to them that, upon completion of their study, one of their officers should visit our Chief Architect and present their findings with consent of their executive of Messrs. Mr. Buck. In their letter Creaghan and Archibald indicated they would follow this action but, to date, this Service has not been contacted. Such work is slow and costly and we must be prepared to receive an estimate of considerable proportions. We will contact Messrs. Creaghan and Archibald regarding the matter very shortly and report their recommendations, and estimate of cost to you for transmission to the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nUnder cover of a letter dated November 6th, Mr. Ross has furnished us with consent and a tender, resulting from an examination of the domestic hot and cold water system, by W. J. Christie, Plumber and Steamfitter, of Truro, Nova Scotia, involving an expenditure of $8,300. Mr. Christie confirms our opinion that most of the water piping is not only corroded but is also so filled with encrustation that a severe drop in pressure is occurring on the upper floor. He also recommends, however, removal of certain pieces of equipment, and replacement of many plumbing fixtures, regarding which we have had no previous complaint or report.\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\n(over)\nOur preliminary study of the mechanical services in the School indicates that some of the present equipment could be retained with advantage, but we are doubtful if any reliable opinion could be obtained without sending our Mr. Hargreaves to Shubenacadie to inspect the system and to submit a report.\n\nIn a brief discussion of the situation at this building between our Chief Architect and Mr. Phelan, in which the likelihood of an emergency developing was pointed out, the latter officer of the Indian Affairs Branch indicated that it was not likely that any funds for work on the Shubenacadie Residential School would be included in their 1947-48 estimates.\n\nUnder such circumstances, we do not propose taking further action, other than reporting on comment from Creaghan and Archibald, unless requested to do so.\n\nChief Engineer.\nOttawa, December 2, 1946.\n\nMr. Hoey,\n\nRe: Indian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, Nova Scotia.\n\nEnclosed is a copy of a memorandum from the Engineering and Construction Service summarizing several reports which have been received concerning certain critical conditions existing at the above mentioned school.\n\nIn view of the considerable expenditure that seems to be involved, it is proposed to have an inspection made by an officer of our architectural division who will see just what is necessary in the way of repairs and replacements. We will advise you further in due course.\n\nDirector.\n\nEnc.\nIndian Affairs Branch;\nOttawa., Ont.\n\nWith reference to attached requisition for sinks used for Dish Washing at the Residential School.

Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training\n\nOn the occasion of my visit to the Shubenacadie Residential School on February 7th, Indian Agent Rice, Sister Superior and myself visited all parts of the building.\n\nAs you are aware from previous report, there has been considerable trouble caused by water coming into the building following rain storms. They had a very severe storm in Nova Scotia last week and as a result a very large quantity of rain came through the south wall and also through the east and north walls. The condition has become so serious that actual damage has been caused to the building to say nothing of the fact that practically all the top floor will have to be replastered.\n\nWe took up this matter with the Surveys & Engineering Branch some months ago and yesterday I phoned to the architect, Mr. Buck, who stated that he had sent experts there and has recently received their report. He promised that he would submit it to us in the near future.\n\nIt is probably going to cost in the vicinity of $15,000. to treat the walls of this building in such a way to prevent further damage by water.

S. Mills - Chief Engineer.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nIn answer to your communication of September 15/46 and with reference to interview which the writer and our Mr. Pleckan had with your Mr. Buck in Ottawa on January 10th., we wish to submit the following proposal for weather-proofing all exterior walls (exclusive of stuccoed passageway) of the complete building referred to above from roof flashing down to grade on all elevations.\n\nScope of Work:\n\n1. After thoroughly washing down the surfaces we would apply one coat of iron waterproofing over all surfaces of the brickwork applied by brush. This iron would form a bond between the masonry and cement coats which are later referred to and would also give a more even density of surface over the areas so that any water taken out of the cement plaster coats would be evenly distributed. This iron coat would be allowed to oxidize thoroughly before any further operation takes place.\n\n2. The next operation would consist of the application of a base coat of cement and sand containing a small percentage of iron bonded to the iron waterproofing coat. This coat would be scratched and approximately one-quarter inch in thickness.\n\n3. A final cement finish coat would then be applied and wood floated to true surface of a maximum thickness of one-quarter inch.\n\n4. A further and final application would consist of brushing two coats of our Resto-Crete Weatherproofing treatment over all surfaces of a colour to suit the client. We believe that a pure white colour might be very suitable for this purpose but that is a matter of choice.\nContinued:\n\n5. All stonework would be repointed and weatherproofed with Resto-Crete.\n\n6. We also include for checking over all openings and resmilking same using mastic placed by gun.\n\nIn quoting the figures as below mentioned we assume that the owners would supply us with the necessary water to allow us to carry out these operations.\n\nFor the work as above specified we quote a lump sum price of Thirteen Thousand One Hundred Dollars ($13,100.00) and assume that if this work were to be done that same should be started and completed during good weather periods.\n\nGuarantee: We guarantee that if, at any time, within 5 (five) years from date of completion, it should happen that leakage develops in the surfaces treated by us, due to defective work on our part, we will upon request promptly make repairs thereto at our own expense. Defects in the structure, or other causes beyond our control, resulting in fracture, are not covered by this guarantee. Roof and roof flashings to be properly maintained by others during period of guarantee.\n\nAs mentioned to your Mr. Buck, if the base coat referred to under item No. 2 was applied under pressure by the use of a gunite machine the coat would be slightly harder. This would cost an additional Fourteen Hundred Dollars ($1400.00) due namely to getting a compressor and the equipment on the job with additional use of more material.\n\nIn submitting this proposal it is our belief that same would give you the best protection to overcome troubles which you are now having, although you have furnished new roofs and new flashing over the copings. We would have to fix up some of the brickwork at the main entrance before applying any plaster coats and this would be taken care of.\n\nWe trust that this proposal will receive your serious consideration and should we be favoured with your order same will have our every attention.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCREAGHAN AND ARCHIBALD LIMITED\n\nE. B. Archibald\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6050, file 205-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMarch 21st, 1947.\n\nMemorandum\n\nRe: Water Infiltration, Indian Residential School, Shubenacadie Indian Agency, N.S.\n\nWe have had in our hands since January 22nd, 1947, a proposal submitted by Messrs. Creaghan and Archibald Ltd., of Montreal, Canadian representatives of the Western waterproofing Co., of the United States, following a thorough inspection of the above school building carried out in company with our Mr. Ross, about October 1st, 1946.\n\nYou were advised in our memorandum of October 8th last, that Creaghan and Archibald, after a study of data assembled on the site, proposed having their Mr. Archibald visit our Chief Architect to discuss the matter before submitting a proposal. This visit and discussion took place on January 10th, 1947, following which the proposal referred to above was submitted.\n\nAs Mr. Phelan, Chief of the Indian Affairs Training Division had indicated that no funds for work on the building were to be included in the 1947-48 estimates, we have deferred reporting on the matter until the present, when time from more pressing commitments, could be found.\n\nIn the discussion referred to, Mr. Archibald stated that the condition at the school, was not an uncommon one in coastal areas in Canada, where violent storms occur resulting in great horizontal precipitation as vertical, hence sufficient force to drive water through brick jointing, and even through brick unless special precautions are provided for in specifications. Mr. Archibald as might be expected, recommends that cement containing water retarding lime should be employed in brickwork, which in turn should be laid by such specialist firms as themselves, who while limiting a guarantee of their own work to five years, consider such masonry construction to be completely satisfactory for the lifetime of the building. It is our opinion that this is advice well worth following, in coastal masonry construction.\n\nMr. Archibald stated that the brickwork at Shubenacadie appears to be as well laid as an average specification demands, and that while the cement mortar used, appears strong and hard, it gives definite evidence of shrinkage, leaving cracks at the vertical and horizontal edges of the joints. In our opinion this fault indicates a mortar containing too much cement and too little or possibly no lime. Even in cement mortar a percentage of lime paste is essential to retard moisture absorption by the brick, while the set and bond is taking place.\n\nJ.M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 0050, file 203-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nHis examination, which is supported by Mr. Ross, convinced Mr. Archibald that jointing faults are so numerous over all faces of the building, that pointing work only would be very expensive and unsatisfactory, and that any applied film of transparent waterproofing would require replacement at intervals.\n\nMr. Archibald stated that the new built up roof on the school and the new copper flashing, which were installed by Indian Affairs, from funds under control of the Reverend Principal are well executed, and prevent water infiltration from the roof.\n\nOn the basis of his opinions, Mr. Archibald has now submitted his proposal, which includes an estimate of cost, which for the complete building amounts to:\n\n(a) With cement base coat applied by hand with brush \u00a313,100.00\n(b) \" \" \" \" \" \" under pressure \u00a314,500.00\n\nA copy of the report is attached for transmission to Indian Affairs with this memorandum.\n\nIt is imperative that at some time in the near future, funds must be provided for the improvement of conditions at the school, if it is to be kept in operation and after a thorough analysis of the situation, we feel that no better proposal is likely to be forthcoming, than the attached.\n\nIt is quite likely that, if funds cannot be made available until the 1948-49 estimates are approved, the cost will be higher.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nEnc.\nOttawa, April 2nd, 1947.\n\nMr. Hoey\n\nRe: Water Infiltration, Indian Residential School, Shubenacadie Indian Agency, N.S.\n\nIt will be recalled that considerable difficulty on account of water infiltrating the walls of this school which was erected in 1929, has been reported from time to time. The front of the building apparently was given a waterproof treatment in 1936 and considerable repairs to the roof, including covering the coping with copper were undertaken in the fall of 1945.\n\nAs these repairs did not wholly correct the conditions complained of arrangements were made for an inspection of the school last fall by Messrs. Creaghan and Archibald Limited of Montreal, Canadian representatives of the Western Waterproofing Company.\n\nEnclosed for your information are copies of a memorandum from Mr. Mills, dated March 21st, and of a proposal from Messrs. Creaghan and Archibald Limited, dated January 21st, which are self-explanatory.\n\nFrom these reports you will note that Messrs. Creaghan and Archibald have proposed two alternative but closely similar schemes for waterproofing the walls of the school at $13,100.00 and $14,500.00 respectively.\n\nWe are of opinion that a satisfactory result as far as waterproofing is concerned and at considerably lower cost might possibly be obtained by applying one coat of concrete with a\ngunite machine. This, however, would be very drab in colour. If you wish us to do so, we will investigate further possibilities along this line.\n\nJ. M.

At the point of entry to the building this line is reduced to a 2\" and is run in black steel pipe to the boiler room equipment and to the distribution system. The distribution mains are progressively reduced as they are connected to the various fixtures and risers.\n\nDomestic hot water is heated through a boiler-the-water-line type of heater connected in series to both low pressure heating boilers. There is also a jacket heater, originally intended for summer service. All the foregoing equipment was installed originally. The storage tank has been replaced within the last year due to the failure of the original unit.\n\nThe water, while potable and certified by the Dominion Analyst as being satisfactory for human use, has attacked all the black and galvanized steel pipe and as a result a heavy formation of sludge which has been analyzed as containing 85% iron oxide, has almost completely clogged the lines. This has retarded the flow to a mere trickle on the upper floor and in a small amount of water permitted to reach the lower floor and basement fixture. On both floors the pressure is raised to an abnormal level of 50 to 60 p.s.i.d., in order to serve bath tubs on the top floor. This is done at the risk of a major collapse of the mains and risers. On occasions, some pipes have burst, resulting in flooding of certain areas. Normal pressures not exceeding 40 p.s.i.d. are necessary if the fixtures and taps are to be protected against damage. Some branches have been replaced with copper pipe, and an examination showed these lines to be entirely free of sludge and scale.\n\nThe heater was disconnected and found to be completely blocked and 3\" pipe connections between the heater and tank were examined and found to be plugged with sludge so badly that a pencil could hardly be inserted.\n\nIn short, it can be definitely stated that the entire distribution system within the building including risers, is in a hopeless state and is in need of complete replacement.\n\nNon-ferrous piping should be used in the re-design, and it is recommended that type K hard drawn copper be used for the mains with streamlined copper branches and risers.\n\nJ.M. Hardie, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6050, file 20p-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe indirect heater is of the copper tube, and cast iron shell design. The element is plugged and could not be cleaned. The shell could be cleaned and a new element inserted. This heater, while somewhat undersized, could be made to do the work for several years. In about 5 to 10 years, the present boilers will in all probability have to be replaced and at that time a new heater of a different type could be incorporated into the new arrangement.\n\nNo complaints were received about the heating. Some questionable elements of design were noted, however and will be filed away for future reference.\n\nGeneral observations showed that the boiler room personnel possessed only rudimentary knowledge, and this has resulted in mediocre care and maintenance, which always contributes to earlier failures of equipment.\n\nWhen instructed, we will prepare a layout for a new domestic hot and cold water system as staff assignments permit.\n\nUntil a layout can be made, it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the cost of the work outlined. It can be assumed that an expenditure of $6500.00 will be necessary to cover this project.\n\nChief Engineer.\nOttawa, June 19th, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, SURVEYS & ENGINEERING BRANCH\n\nRe: Indian Residential School, Shubenacadie, N.S.\n\nReference your I.A. 1156-4-2 of June 13th.\n\nWe have read your memorandum containing the report submitted by Mr. Hangreaves on the domestic hot and cold water system at the above school. It has been noted that a complete new layout will be required at a cost of approximately $6,500.\n\nIncluded in our 1947-48 estimates is the following item:\n\n\"Shubenacadie Residential School - Renew Heating and Plumbing System - $8,000.\"\n\nThis amount was included upon receipt of your memorandum of similar file of November 20th. Therefore, it will be in order for you to carry out the repairs as required.\n\nHowever, as you have been already informed, this will leave only $1,500, to carry out the work required at this school to prevent water infiltration, (see your memorandum of March 21st)\n\nIt is presumed that the replacement of the domestic system is of more immediate importance than the work on the brick at this school.\n\nDirector\n\nBFN/MDG\nc/o to Indian Agent H.C.

Rice, Indian Agent,\nShubenacadie, Nova Scotia.\n\nRepairs to Shubenacadie Residential School\n\nTo carry out a reconditioning and waterproofing job on the brick walls of the above school, we are faced with two alternatives:\n\n(a) To do a temporary waterproofing of the walls by applying special preparation at a cost of approximately $8,000.00;\n\n(b) To do a permanent waterproofing of the walls by applying a concrete layer over the whole building at a cost of approximately $17,000.00.\n\nUpon the recommendation of our Surveys and Engineering Branch and because of the lateness of the season and our lack of funds, it has been decided to adopt course (b) early next Spring. This sum will be included in the estimates which we will submit to the Minister's office for the 1948-49 fiscal year.\n\nWe have already requested the Surveys and Engineering Branch, therefore, to proceed with the other repair job required at the above school, namely, the repairs to the heating system. Mr. Ross should shortly be hearing from his head office regarding these repairs. It would be appreciated if you could keep us informed as to when these repairs begin and the progress made by the plumbers in carrying out the contract.\n\nBernard F.

Rice, Indian Agent,\nShubenacadie, Nova Scotia.\n\nOutbuildings for Shubenacadie Residential School\n\nYou will recall our recent conversation with the Reverend Father Brown, Principal of the above Indian School. Could I please be advised as to whether you would wish a purchase order placed for the materials required for the workshop or whether you would wish me to send an accountable advance for the amount of $200.00 as required.\n\nHave you had an opportunity as yet of following up the lead on the manual training instructor?\n\nBernard F. Neaky,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nFredericton, N. B.\nOctober 7, 1947.\n\nReverend Father Brown,\nIndian Residential School,\nHalifax, N. S.\n\nDear Reverend Father:\n\nI have received your letter of October 2, in which you ask the cost per bushel of potatoes, which I wish to ship for your school.\n\nI did not know what the cost would be, so I thought arrangements had been made, or would be made at Ottawa regarding this. Potatoes, in this area at the present time are selling to shippers at $2.25 per barrel, which would be .75\u00a2 per bushel. You state, you may not need 400 bushels, but I am afraid I would not be able to spare that many anyway. A part of my potato field was damp, and the crop there was not as good as expected. I could, however, spare you 275 or 300 bushels, but the freight on these would be very high, as they would weigh much less, than the minimum weight of freight for a car.\n\nMay I hear from you further regarding this.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nEdward J. Whalen,\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dep't. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nAttention: Mr. J. E. Morris:\n\nForwarded for your information.\n\nEdward J. Whalen, Indian Agent.\nOttawa, October 14, 1947.\n\nMr. Edward J. Whalen, Indian Agent,\nFredericton, N.B.\n\nWe have received a copy of your letter of the 7th instant to the Reverend Principal of the Shubenacadie Residential School.\n\nIn your letter you refer to the fact that you consider arrangements should be made at Ottawa regarding the securing of potatoes for the school mentioned.\n\nIn this regard I may say that the principal of a residential school purchases the food supplies and also pays the accounts from the funds that he receives for the maintenance of the Indian pupils attending the school and, consequently there is no action this Department needs to take in this particular matter.\n\nBernard F.

Christie for $7,250 for repairs and replacements at the above school.\n\nMr. Morris, Acting Inspector of Indian Agencies, has just returned from Nova Scotia and he was informed recently that the contractor is having difficulty in obtaining the materials he requires to carry out the work and consequently does not expect to start until some time in March. We are extremely anxious to have the work at the Shubenacadie Residential School completed at the earliest possible date, not only because the repairs are urgently required but the funds for the work are included in the current year's appropriation.\n\nWe would appreciate it very much if your Branch could give some assistance to the contractor in securing materials so that the necessary work may be completed before the end of March, 1948.\n\nBernard F. Henry\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nJanuary 5, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. Scully:\n\nIn our main estimates for the fiscal year 1948-49, we are requesting funds in connection with resurfacing the exterior of the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School and also for connecting the Fort Alexander Indian Residential School with the Manitoba Hydro line.\n\nBoth of these projects appear under the heading \"Repairs to Buildings\" in our estimates, but as they will have to be carried out under contract, I thought it advisable to enclose schedule for each of them.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDeputy Minister.\n\nV.M. Scully, Esq.,\nDeputy Minister,\nDepartment of Reconstruction and Supply,\nOttawa.\nMemorandum\n\nRe: Indian Residential School, Shubenacadie, Nova Scotia.\n\nWith reference to your notation dated the 23rd ultimo on the memorandum dated December 19th from Col. Neary of the Indian Affairs Branch relative to the above, it was assumed that a telephone conversation between Mr. Sinclair and our Mr. Buck covered the points raised.\n\nConfirming what was said at that time, you are advised that there are no restrictions in effect on any materials the contractor is obligated to use in his work on the contract, and this Division can be of no assistance in expediting delivery of materials in short supply, for execution of a lump sum contract.\n\nOur engineer who dealt with the matter when the contract was awarded contacted Christie before his return to Ottawa from Nova Scotia. From his analysis of the contractor's remarks Mr. Ross formed the opinion that the material situation has improved, and that no serious delay in obtaining materials is likely to occur.\n\nFor your information. It would appear that the contractor is now having more success in the way of securing the required materials. You will appreciate that in cases like this when priorities are off that it is pretty well up to the contractor to look after the securing of supplies.\n\nR.A.

Rice, Indian Agent,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\n\nWhen Mr. Morris was in Ottawa recently he advised that he had been informed that the contractor who was doing the work at the Shubenacadie Residential School was having difficulty in securing needed materials.\n\nWe took up the matter with the Director of Lands and Development Services with a view to ascertaining if any assistance could be given to the contractor in securing materials.

You should state a catalogue number and the name of the firm from whom it can be secured. As soon as I have this information I will submit it to the Purchasing Branch.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. Sister Mary Charles,\nShubenacadie Indian Res. School,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\n\nPP/MGD\nThe Toledo Chopper is available in both the popular \"12\" and \"22\" sizes... also in the heavy-duty \"32\" size... each powered to more than meet highest requirements. Illustrated is Model 212. Base dimensions 14\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)\" x 11\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)\". Overall height 19\".\n\nFood Store Machine...\n\nClean As A Whistle\u2014after chopping you see, inside the Toledo cylinder, bright shining metal, not a residue of meat. Efficient spiral flutes.\n\nOver-size Working Space\u2014the pan occupies the entire top of the machine. Cylinder opening at corner for efficient feeding.\n\nConvenient Switch Location\u2014Switch is at in natural accessible position. Illustr shows open-bowl cylinder (optional).\nThe following pages introduce a variety of tried and proven chopped meat formulas that will be of great assistance to the meat retailer who wishes to prepare from various meats cuts and sells, and trimmings. It is not suggested that the retail meat dealer merchandise at one time all the different chopped meat items in this book. It would be more satisfactory to select a few formulas in line with the meats that are moving slowly and from accumulated trimmings on hand.\n\nEvery formula should be tried out from time to time and the retailer can then concentrate on the ones that prove the most popular with the trade served.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that a profitable volume of business cannot be built up permanently unless the buying public receives fresh, wholesome meat. Trimmings should be used only when fresh, and should not be allowed to accumulate or they may become tainted or discolored. An excellent idea to follow is every morning, or at least once each day, check the refrigerator and then plan chopped meat sales according to the cuts on hand that are available for sale.\n\nThe cost price of chopped meat, ready for sale, depends upon the quality of meat used, the amount of fat, and whether or not binders, seasoning, ice and water are used. The cost price should be determined at the time of making, taking into consideration the value per pound of the various materials used.\n\nThe formulas in this book are generally given in amounts up to 100 pounds of meat. These can be increased or decreased according to sales volume. Seasoning and binders should, of course, be used in proportion.\n\nWhere the less tender cuts, or combinations of different kinds of meat are used, best results and a more uniformly blended product will usually be obtained by chopping through the coarse plate first, then mixing thoroughly, and rechopping through the fine plate.\n\nBINDERS\n\nBinders (cereals or fillers) are used to bind or hold chopped meats together, and when used in sufficient quantities should be added to make mixing easy; they also hold the natural juices of the meat and absorb moisture. The addition of a binder improves the texture of chopped meat, making it compact yet smooth.\n\nThe principal binders in use are soya bean flour, corn flour, rice flour, potato flour, dry skim milk, crackers, dry bread, and blends of these and similar materials.\n\nThe cost of binders varies but per 100 pounds of meat averages about $6 and is governed by state regulations.\n\nIn certain localities the use of binders is prohibited unless there is a poster displayed which reads, \"sausage with cereal added.\"\n\nThere are also weights and measures laws which govern the sale of food. In some localities, for example, it is not permissible to sell any meat by weight; it must be sold by the pound.\n\nEvery merchant should be familiar with all such laws and regulations and operate strictly in conformance with them.\n\nFORMULAS FOR SPECIALTIES\n\nIn addition to display in bulk, chopped meats today are in increasing demand in \"specialty\" forms, such as loaves, rosettes, and patties.\n\nCHOPPED BEEF ROSETTES\n\nChopped beef rosettes are made from lean chopped beef with the aid of a transparent tumbler or tea cup of a size that will hold about \u00bc pound of meat. The meat is first chopped through the coarse plate. The fine plate is used for the second run to make the rosettes.\nIndian Residential School\nShubenacadie, Nova Scotia\n\nMay 14, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nYour letter asking for further information regarding the meat grinder, I shall reply to at once.\n\nMr. Harold Reid, of this town, has a grinder, bought June 25, 1947, for $310.00 from the Canadian Toledo Scale Company, of Toronto.

Due to advanced costs their price at this time would be $15,065.00 instead of $13,100.00.\n\n2. If the base coat of cement and sand is to be applied under pressure by the use of a gunite machine the extra price at this time would be $1610.00 instead of an extra of $1400.00 previously quoted.\n\nIt is recommended that we be authorized to engage the firm of Creaghan and Archibald Limited to carry out the work of water-proofing of the exterior walls of the school, exclusive of stuccoed passageway, having the material applied under pressure. Adding the above figures their quoted price for doing this work by this method is now $16,675.00.\n\nWe are of the opinion that no purpose would be served by advertising this work as the firm mentioned above specialize in water-proofing buildings and other similar work and as far as we are aware, are the only firm in a position to do the required work at Shubenacadie.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nR.

S.\n\nThe house occupied by the Resident Farmer at the captionally noted School is urgently in need of the following repairs:\n(1) Complete renewal of roof shingles.\n(2) Building of new flue.\n\nIt will also be necessary to replace some rough boards and rafters in this house. It is estimated that the total cost will amount to $500.00. The lumber in connection with this repair can be supplied from the Agency Saw Mill, the account being credited to the 1948-49 Welfare Vote.\n\nRev. J. W. Brown, Principal, also advises that the Root Cellar is in need of a new roof. It was suggested by him that a metal roof would be most satisfactory. However, Sheet Metal Roofing is still in short supply, although there is an aluminium roofing on the market at the present time that is highly recommended. The Galvanised Sheet Metal Roofing if obtainable is listed slightly under \u00a35.00 per square and the aluminium is listed at \u00a312.00 per square.\n\nShould it be the desire of the Branch to use wooden shingles on the Root Cellar, we have an excellent spruce shingle manufactured in the Agency Saw Mill which would be quite suitable. This account could also be\n\nCon. Sheet # 2.\ncredited to the Welfare Vote 1948-49.\n\nMay we be advised of your decision in these matters.\n\n(H. C.

It is understood that the obstruction is located approximately 10 feet from the side of the building where all the sewer lines from building enter into the main line running into the River.

Our inspecting officer furnishes comment on both contracts as follows:\n\n(a) Domestic Hot and Cold Water Revisions -\n\nOur officer met Mr. W.J. Christie, Plumbing and Heating Contractor, who has completed revisions and additions to the Domestic hot and Cold Water System at the school, and the work was carefully examined.\n\nThe installation has been carried out in a most satisfactory and workmanlike manner, and in accordance with the plans and specifications prepared by this Division; and to the satisfaction of the school authorities and Indian Superintendent H.C. Rice.\n\nUnder the circumstances, we have accepted the work, and are returning the security deposit to the Contractor.\n\n(b) Waterproofing Contract -\n\nWhile our officer was in Shubenacadie, he inspected the waterproofing work carried out by Messrs. Creaghan and Archibald. Their Halifax representative Mr. Peitkin, under whose supervision this work was executed, reviewed all phases of the work with our officer, and explained, in detail, how the various operations included in the contract, were carried out.\n\nThe caulking around the window and door frames was carefully examined, and appeared to have been well done. The finish over the entire wall surface was put on under pressure, and it is evident that no pains were spared to make a thoroughly good job.\n\nThe colour is a medium grey, and some areas are slightly darker than the main surface. It was explained that this was due to varying weather conditions at the time the finish was being applied. The opinion was expressed, by Mr. Peitkin, that the weathering effect will ultimately result in a solid colour throughout. While the general appearance of the building is quite different from its original colour, it is not unpleasant.\n\nSeveral severe rainstorms have occurred since this was completed, and there has been no evidence of any filtration of water through the walls. The Principal and Indian Superintendent H.C. Rice, both, expressed complete satisfaction. Under the circumstances, the work has been accepted and we are releasing the Contractor's security deposit.\n\nR.A.

At the time, it was impossible for him to know exactly where the leaks were originating but requested that during the next severe rain storm, he be contacted at his Halifax headquarters at which time he will proceed to Shubenacadie in an effort to trace the leaks.\n\nIt should be pointed out that at the time the leaks appeared in this building, we were experiencing one of the worst rain storms in recent years, and it is quite possible that these leaks might not show up again for some time. However, the work is definitely defective to some degree and as it is a guaranteed job for five years we will see that the situation is rectified.\n\nDue to weather conditions during the next few months, it will be impossible to carry on any work of this nature until Spring. However, should we have a severe enough rain to call this Representative, he will mark the leaks in order that his Company can proceed with the necessary alterations in the Spring.\nYours very truly,\n\nH. C. RICE, Superintendent,\nShubenacadie Indian Agency.\nOttawa, 20th January, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, LANDS & DEVELOPMENT SERVICES BRANCH\n\nWith reference to my memorandum of 10th January, 1949, regarding Shubenacadie Indian Residential School, we are enclosing for your information a copy of another letter which has just been received from Indian Superintendent Rice.\n\nPP/ST\nEncl.\n\nDirector.\nMICMAC, N. S.\nJanuary 18, 1949.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont., Canada.\n\nRe: Blanket for the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School.\n\nI am just in receipt of a letter from Rev. J. P. Mackey, Principal of the above noted school.\n\nWill you kindly advise what action you wish me to take?\n\nIn checking over the blankets for the school, I find they are in very bad shape and need replacing. You are aware of the financial standing of this school, and if at all possible this charge could be made direct instead of taking it out of his per capita grant, I would recommend it.\n\nH. C. Rice\nSuperintendent\nSHUBENACADIE INDIAN AGENCY.\nIndian Residential School\nShubenacadie, Nova Scotia,\nJanuary 17, 1949.\n\nDept. of Mines and Resources\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nPaying a visit to some of the youngsters laid up with chickenpox, gave me an opportunity of inspecting the bed blankets. Needless to say they have been in use for many years and with washing and wearing they are very thin.\n\nOur financial position being what it is, it is impossible for us to go out and replace these blankets. We understand that Supt. Rice has a large number of blankets from the War Assets.\n\nWould it be possible that he might allow us one hundred and thirty-five, being one for each child? If Supt. Rice is to pay for them, could we have that number at the same price he is to pay for them?\n\nThe chickenpox will clear up in a few more days.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nRt. Rev. J. P. Mackey.\n", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-06", "created": "2025-10-06", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_sask_test/c-8160.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4",
