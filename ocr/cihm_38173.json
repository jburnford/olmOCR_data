MORGAN.\n\nQUEBEC, January, 1862.\n\"The worth of a state in the long run is the worth of the individuals composing it.\"\u2014J. S. Mill.\n\n\"It is very certain that no man is fit for everything; but it is almost as certain too, that there is scarcely any one man who is not fit for something, which something nature plainly points out to him by giving him a tendency and propensity to it. Every man finds in himself, either from nature or education (for they are hard to distinguish), a peculiar bent and disposition to some particular character; and his struggling against it is the fruitless and endless labor of Sisyphus. Let him follow and cultivate that vocation, he will succeed in it, and be considerable in one way at least.\"\u2014Lord Chesterfield's Miscellaneous Works.\n\n\"The chief use of biography consists in the noble models of character in which it abounds. Our great forefathers still live among us in the records of their lives, as well as in the acts they have done and which live also; still sit by us at the table, and hold us by the hand; furnishing examples for our benefit, which we may still study, admire, and imitate. Indeed, whoever has left behind him the record of a noble life has bequeathed to posterity an enduring source of good, for it lives as a model for others to form themselves by in all time to come; still breathing fresh life into us, helping us to reproduce his life anew, and to illustrate his character in other forms. Hence a book containing the life of a true man is full of precious seed; to use Milton's words, 'It is the precious life-blood of a master spirit, embalmed and treasured up on purpose to a life beyond life.' Such a book never ceases to exercise an elevating influence and a power for good. It may not have the power of the living life of a man; but it is a record of greatness which we cannot help admiring, and unconsciously imitating while we admire.\n\n\"The solid foundations of liberty must rest upon individual character, which is also the only sure guarantee for social security and national progress.\"\u2014Dr. Smiles.\nPREFACE.\n\nThe present work has been written during short intervals, which we have been enabled to snatch from office hours, and in the short space of a few months.\n\nWe do not presume to advance any claims to originality with respect to a great portion of its contents, derived as they have necessarily been from various home and local publications, a list of which is subjoined; nor do we claim for it anything like perfection. We are sensible that it is imperfect, not only in its details, but in the exclusion from its pages of numerous names which ought to have figured in and graced the work; nor has justice, we fear, been done to many whose biographies do appear. These circumstances must not be ascribed to any intentional defect on our part; but we must plead in excuse the inexperience and incapacity of youth in matters with which we have, perhaps, prematurely grappled, the difficulty of obtaining accurate information, and the long period of time which the work covers.\n\nIn a work of the kind where so much has to be inquired into, studied and examined, in a short space of time, we have laid ourselves under many and deep obligations to numerous persons\u2014noblemen and gentlemen who have kindly responded to our enquiries, and occasionally come to our assistance, aiding us in our adventurous undertaking; and we cannot overlook the material assistance rendered to us by Professor Andrew, M.A., of Quebec. To these parties we return our most sincere and hearty thanks. It is our hope\nthat a second edition will shortly appear, when any errors which may have crept into this will be rectified. Lastly, as to these and all such errors, we pray the kind indulgence of our readers for the reasons assigned in another portion of this preface; these imperfections must not be ascribed to the heart, but rather to the head and judgment.\n\nQUEBEC, January, 1862.\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nWhen we first conceived the design of compiling a work of this description, we were not aware that any previous work had been written on the subject, and were quite surprised when M. Bibaud's \"Pantheon Canadien\" was placed in our hands. Upon examination, however, of this little book, we found that many of our greatest men had been excluded from notice, and many obsolete characters flourished therein who had hardly any claim to be mentioned at all; and above all that it was devoted nearly altogether, or in a great measure, to one portion of the community. Observing this, we determined to pursue our undertaking, with what success, we must leave the candid, discriminating and indulgent reader to say.\n\nThe great object which has actuated us in writing these series of biographical notices or sketches, has been to place on record, in as simple and unostentatious a manner as possible, the services of those men who have fought, bled, and served in this province, and with whose names history has made us familiar, but with regard to whose private career it is silent; we trust that hereby some worthy names and memories may not be allowed to pass into oblivion. From these annals it will appear that we have had and do possess men as truly great, talented and devotedly loyal as any other kingdom, not excepting the mother country herself. We may also be able to convince the youth of this rising nation, that their sires, grandsires, and great-grandsires, had names associated with great deeds and glorious efforts in the cause of freedom and loyalty. We have endeavored, perhaps,\nwithout success, to render this work as complete as possible, so as to satisfy both portions of the communities in which we live, and to be as unprejudiced and dispassionate in our opinions as we could. What we have written has been written in no cringing or servile spirit, but in honest sincerity, and comes impartially from the heart. A just pride, an intense love of our native country, and an ardent hope and desire for its future greatness, have alone enabled and prevailed on us to go through a task of great mental labor, yet to us one of love. Our only regret is, that the work is not sufficiently perfect; and that we have not done sufficient justice to those characters whose portraits and careers we have endeavored to portray.\n\nBOOKS CONSULTED\nBY THE AUTHOR IN WRITING THIS WORK, AND TO WHICH HE IS INDEBTED FOR INFORMATION.\n\nCot\u00e9's Political Appointments; Bibaud's Pantheon Canadien; Smith, Garneau, Christie, Rogers and McMullen's Histories of Canada; Buchanan's National Unthrift; Gordon's Biographical Dictionary; Appleton's Cyclop\u00e6dia of Biography; Norton's Life of Bishop Stewart; Cannon's Historical Records of the British Army; Burke, Dodd, Debrett, and Playfair's Peerages; Penny Cyclop\u00e6dia; Canadian News, (London); Colonial Magazine; Mountain's Sermons; Van Cortland's Records of Ottawa City; Hayden's Book of Dignities; Journals of Education, C.

The first to discover Canada, and to plan out a great country; the first to colonize it, though on a small scale; and the first to take an interest in and endeavor to advance her interests and welfare, even at the sacrifice and expense of his own.\n\nTo us the career of such a man from whom we have sprung, and to whom the province owes its existence, is full of material interest. He was the founder and discoverer of this country, and although it was then a vast wilderness, and sparsely peopled by barbarians, yet as he glided up the placid and limpid waters of the St. Lawrence, he was forcibly struck with the beauty and the variety of the scenery, and with the excellent spots which nature had formed to be inhabited by more civilized beings. Cartier predicted that this would become a great country in time, and his prediction has been verified. Con-\nsider the history of the period, extending from 1534 to 1861, and mark the result; it is wonderful, it is magical! Although in one sense it may appear a long time; yet for an infant colony how short does the space seem for the achievement of such miracles? The country was not colonized for fifty years after Cartier first discovered it, and then very sparsely; and so it continued for many successive years. When the conquest took place, there were very few settlers or settlements in Upper Canada; yet, in the present day, we have cities and towns and villages and hamlets, and cleared lands and farms, from one end of the country to the other; commerce and trade allied together, and active business carried on everywhere; railroads cross our country at every point; rivers are connected by magnificent bridges; steamers, propellers and river craft traverse our lakes and rivers from the Gulf of St. Lawrence to Lake Superior; valuable public works are constructed so as to make the most distant points available to trade; and nearly every nook and corner of the province has been explored and found or made useful for settlement; hidden treasures have been brought to light that would gladden the heart of an Eastern Nabob. The country is peopled by a population of nearly three millions, which will soon be doubled. The population is becoming an enlightened and intelligent people, active and energetic, anxious and willing to advance the country; in fact, there is no country which, for its size (and we might nearly put England in one of our counties), is possessed of such superior privileges and such valuable sources of wealth. Who could have foreseen all this as Cartier sailed tranquilly up the St. Lawrence? Did he, in his \"mind's eye,\" think of it, and raise up before him the happy settlements, cleared lands, and large, thriving and gay cities and towns, and crowded and teeming, industrious populations? We fear not; notwithstanding his prediction, he could never have dreamed that the country just discovered by him could be brought to such a state of perfection and magnificence, and become such a source of wealth and prosperity to the nation that held it; yet, such is the case, and the name of Cartier will undoubtedly be ever allied with the discovery of this country, and be entwined in unison with that of Champlain, as our national benefactors, and as the establishers of a young and vigorous nation.\n\nUnfortunately, in this present sketch, we are unable to give any more information concerning the interesting and erratic history of the adventurous navigator than has already been given in several biographical works.\n\nHe was celebrated in France as an enterprising mariner and pilot, and was a native of St. Malo. After the voyage of the Cabots, who discovered Newfoundland and the mouth of the St. Lawrence, the French perceived the value of the recent discoveries; and in a few years began the cod fishery upon the banks of Newfoundland.\nThe Baron de Levis is said to have discovered a part of Canada about 1518. In 1524 John Veranzza, a Florentine in the service of France, ranged the coast of the new continent from Florida to Newfoundland. From a subsequent voyage, in 1525, he never returned, and it is supposed that he was cut to pieces, and devoured by the savages. His fate discouraged other attempts to discover the new world, till the importance of having a colony in the neighborhood of the fishing banks induced Francis I. to send out Cartier in 1534. That monarch, tradition has it, said: \"The Kings of Spain and Portugal are taking possession of the new world, without giving me a part; I should be glad to see the article in Adam's last will which gives them the whole of the fine continent of America.\" Cartier sailed from St. Malo on the 20th April, with two ships of sixty tons, and one hundred and twenty-two men. On the 10th of May he came in sight of Bonavista, on the Island of Newfoundland; but the ice obliged him to go to the south, and he entered a harbour at a distance of five leagues, to which he gave the name of St. Catherine. As soon as the season would permit, he sailed northward and entered the Straits of Belleisle. In this voyage he visited the greater part of the coast which surrounds the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and took possession of the country in the name of the king; he discovered a bay, which he called Baie des Chaleurs, on account of the sultry weather which he there experienced. He sailed so far into the great river, afterwards called the St. Lawrence, as to discover land on the opposite side. 15th August, he set sail on his return to France, and arrived at St. Malo on the 5th of September.\n\nWhen his discoveries were known in France, it was determined to make a settlement in that part of America which he had visited. Accordingly, in the following year, he received a more ample commission, and was equipped with three vessels. When he was ready to depart, he went to the Cathedral Church with his whole company, and the bishop gave them his benediction. He sailed 19th May, 1535. He encountered a severe storm on his passage; but in July he reached the destined port. He entered the Gulf, as in the preceding year, being accompanied by a number of young men of distinction. He sailed up the St. Lawrence, and discovered an island, which he named L'Isle de Bacchus, but which is now called Orleans, in the neighborhood of Quebec. This island was full of inhabitants, who subsisted by fishing, &c. He went on shore, and the native Indians brought him Indian corn for his refreshment. With his pinnace and two boats he proceeded up the river as far as Hochelaga, a settlement upon an island, which he called Mont Royal, but which is now called Montreal. In this Indian town were about fifty long huts, built with stakes, and covered with bark. The people lived mostly by fishing and tillage. They had corn, beans, squashes and pumpkins.\ntwo or three days he set out on his return, and arrived 4th October at St. Croix, not far from Quebec, now called Jacques Cartier's river. Here he passed the winter. In December the scurvy began to make its appearance among the natives; and, in a short time, Cartier's company were seized by the disorder. By the middle of February, of one hundred and ten persons, fifty were sick at once, and eight or ten had died. In this extremity he appointed a day of humiliation. A crucifix was placed on a tree; a procession of those who were able to walk was formed, and at the close of the devotional exercises, Cartier made a vow, that \"if it should please God to permit him to return to France, he would go in pilgrimage to our lady of Roquemado.\" The sick were all healed by using a medicine, which was employed with success by the natives. This was a decoction of the leaves and bark of a tree. The liquor was drank every other day, and an external application was made to the legs. Charlevoix says the tree was that which yielded turpentine, and Dr. Belknap thinks it was the spruce pine. In May, Cartier set sail on his return to France, carrying off with him Donnacona, the Indian king of the country, and nine other natives, all of whom, except a little girl, died in France. He arrived at St. Malo, July 6, 1536.\n\nAt the end of four years, a third expedition was projected. Fran\u00e7ois de la Roque, Lord of Roberval, was commissioned by the king as his Lieutenant-Governor in Canada; and Cartier was appointed his pilot, with the command of five ships. His commission, which may be seen in Hazard's collection, was dated Oct. 17, 1540. He sailed, however, May 23, 1540, to Newfoundland and Canada. August 23, he arrived at the haven of St. Croix, in the river St. Lawrence; about four leagues above that place, on a cliff, at the east side of the mouth of a small river, he built a fort, which he called Charlesbourg; this was near Quebec. In the spring of 1542, he determined to return to France, and accordingly in June he arrived at St. John's, in Newfoundland, on his way home. Here he met Roberval, who did not accompanying him in his voyage, and had been detained till this time. He was ordered to return to Canada, but he chose to pursue his voyage to France, and sailed out of the harbour privately in the night. Roberval attempted to establish a colony, but it was soon broken up, and the French did not establish themselves permanently in Canada till after the expiration of half a century.*\n\nCartier published memoirs of Canada after his second voyage. The names which he gave to islands, rivers, &c., are now entirely changed. In this work he shews that he possessed a large share\n\n* \"In acknowledgment of his rare merits, it is said that he and his race were ennobled by his royal master. Few of the mariners, upon whom that distinction was conferred in France, merited it so much as Jacques Cartier, master mariner of St. Malo.\"\u2014Garneau.\nof the credulity and exaggeration of travellers. Being one day in the chase, he says, he pursued a beast which had but two legs, and which ran with astonishing rapidity. This strange animal was probably an Indian, clothed with the skin of some wild beast. He speaks also of human monsters of different kinds, of which accounts had been given him; some of them lived without eating.\n\n---\n\n**Sir John Cabot.**\n\nSir John Cabot, the discoverer of the continent of America, was a Venetian, who embarked from Bristol in 1497 with a commission from Henry VII. to conquer and settle unknown lands, and to find out a north-west passage to the East Indies. In latitude 58\u00b0, floating ice compelled him to pursue a more southerly direction; and, on the 24th June, he came in sight of some part of the coast of Nova Scotia or Newfoundland. He followed the line of coast to the north-east till he reached the latitude of 67\u00bd\u00b0, when he changed his course to the south, and never saw land till off Florida. A mutiny, owing to the scarcity of provisions, now compelled him to go back, without turning his discovery to any practical account. Columbus did not see the coast of America till the following year; but as his previous discoveries had prompted the voyage of Cabot, to him after all belongs the honor of having unveiled the New World to the gaze of mankind.\n\n---\n\n**Sebastian Cabot.**\n\nThe celebrated Sebastian Cabot was a navigator of great eminence and ability. He was born at Bristol, about the year 1477; and was the son of the John Cabot, mentioned above. Sebastian was early instructed in the mathematical knowledge required by a seaman; and, at the age of seventeen, had made several voyages. In 1495, John Cabot obtained from Henry VII. Letters Patent, empowering him and his three sons\u2014\nLewis, Sebastian, and Sanctias\u2014to discover unknown lands, and conquer and settle them. In consequence of this permission, the king supplied one ship, and the merchants of London and Bristol furnished a few smaller ones. In 1496, John and Sebastian sailed to the north-west, and in July of the same year, discovered Newfoundland, and explored up to 67\u00b0 lat. The accounts of his voyage are attended with much obscurity; but it seems that, in a subsequent voyage, the father and son sailed as far as Cape Florida, and were actually the first who saw the main land of America.\n\nLittle is, however, known of the proceedings of Sebastian Cabot for the ensuing twenty years; but it seems that, in the reign of Henry VIII., by the patronage of Sir Thomas Peart, Vice-Admiral of England, he procured another ship to make discoveries, and endeavored to make a voyage to the East Indies by the south, in which attempt he failed. This disappointment is supposed to have induced him to quit England and visit Spain, where he was treated with great respect, and appointed Pilot-major. An opulent company of Spanish merchants soon after gave him the command of a projected expedition to the Spice Islands, through the newly discovered Straits of Magellan. Accordingly, in 1525, he sailed from Cadiz to the Canaries and Capo de Verd Islands, and failing from the opposition of his crew in his view of reaching the Spice Islands, he proceeded to the river La Plata, where he discovered St. Salvador, and constructed a fort there. He subsequently reached the great river Paraguay, and remained on the American coast a considerable time, with a view to forming an establishment.\n\nBeing disappointed in expected aid from Spain, he ultimately returned home with all his crew, but was not very favorably received, owing to his failure in respect to the Spice Islands, and his severe treatment of the mutineers of his crew. He, notwithstanding, continued in the service of Spain for some years longer, but at length returned to England towards the latter end of the reign of Henry VIII. At the beginning of the reign of Edward VI. he was introduced by the protector, Somerset, to the young king, who took much pleasure in his conversation, and settled a pension on him as Grand Pilot of England. From that hour he was consulted on all questions relating to trade and navigation; and in 1552, being governor of a company of merchant adventurers, he drew up instructions, and procured a license for an expedition to discover a passage to the East Indies by the north. These instructions, which are preserved in Hakluyt's collection of voyages, form a very honorable proof of his sagacity and penetration. He was also governor of the Russian company, and was very active in their affairs. He is supposed to have died in the year 1557, at a very advanced age, leaving behind him a high character, both as a skilful seaman, and as a man of great general abilities. He was the first who noticed the variations of the compass; and besides the ordi-\nnances to be found in Hackluyt, he published a large map of the world, as also a work under the title of \"Navigatione nelle parte Septentrionali, per Sebastiano Cabota,\" Fol., Venice, 1583.\n\nDONNACONA.\n\nDonnacona was an Indian Chief, whom Cartier carried away with him to France, after his discovery of Canada, in order to prove to Francis I. that what he had stated of the people inhabiting this country was perfectly true. He was brought to the French court, and had an audience of the king, and underwent a great ceremony on the occasion of his baptism at Rouen. The climate of Europe, however, was unfavorable to him, and he died shortly after his public admission into the Christian Church.\n\nSIEUR DE ROBERVAL.\n\nJean Fran\u00e7ois de la Roque was a nobleman of Picardy, and the first person who attempted to colonize New France after Cartier. He was a soldier of distinction, and had obtained the king's consent to govern and colonize the territories recently discovered by Cartier. He was to have set out for New France early in the summer of 1541, but he did not start until the following year. He reached his destination in safety, and wintered at Stadacona (now Quebec), sending home two vessels to ask for provisions; but these were never sent. The nations then being too much engaged, in fact upon the eve of war, Roberval started on an expedition of discovery into the interior of the country, but was not successful in his attempt. Great misfortunes occurred to him: fifty-eight of his men perished at Quebec, and one of his ships was sunk. The king, instead of sending the desired succor to him, commanded Cartier to bring him home, as his valuable services were required in Picardy, where war then existed. Having performed several gallant exploits in his native province, Roberval,\nafter the death of the king in 1547, sailed a second time for Canada, with a large and valuable expedition, accompanied by a great number of emigrants, who were destined never to see the country in which they had intended to settle. They all perished, the fleet of vessels being wrecked on the passage.\n\nCHAMPLAIN.\n\nSamuel de Champlain, a name rendered illustrious in our annals from his services in not only founding the ancient city of Quebec, but in establishing Canada; in spreading civilization, repelling the attacks of the hordes of Indians, and thus saving the lives of the early French settlers; in exploring the country and its valuable resources, and thus bringing its name conspicuously before not only his own nation, but many others.\n\nHe was of a noble family of Brouage, in the Province of Saintonge, in France. He commanded a vessel, in which he made a voyage to the East Indies, about the year 1600, and acquired a high reputation as an able and experienced officer. After an absence of two years and a half, he returned to France, at a time when it was resolved to prosecute the discoveries which had been commenced in Canada by Cartier. The Marquis de la Roche, and Chauvin, Governors of Canada, had endeavored to establish a colony, and the latter was succeeded by De Chatte, who engaged Champlain in his service in 1603. Champlain sailed March 16, accompanied by Pontgrav\u00e9, who had made many voyages to Tadoussac, at the entrance of the Saguenay into the St. Lawrence. After their arrival at this place, 25th May, they in a light batteau ascended the St. Lawrence to the Falls of St. Louis, which bounded the discoveries of Cartier in 1535. This was in the neighborhood of Hochelaga; but that Indian settlement was not now in existence. After making many inquiries of the natives, and exploring much of the country along the St. Lawrence, he sailed for France in August. On his arrival in September, he found that De Chatte was dead, and his commission as Lieutenant-General of Canada given to the Sieur De Monts. This nobleman engaged him, as his pilot, in another voyage to the New World.\n\nChamplain sailed upon his second voyage March 7, 1604, and arrived at Acadie, May 6. After being employed about a month in the long boat, visiting the coast, in order to find a proper situation\nfor a settlement, he pitched upon a small island about twenty leagues to the westward of St. John's River, and about half a league in circumference. To this island De Monts, after his arrival at the place, gave the name of St. Croix. It lies in the river of the same name, which divides the United States from the Province of New Brunswick. During the winter, Champlain was occupied in exploring the country, and he went as far as Cape Cod, where he gave the name of Malebarre to a point of land, on account of the imminent danger of running aground near it with his bark. Next year, he pursued his discoveries, though he did not pass more than ten or twelve leagues beyond Malebarre.\n\nIn 1607, he was sent out on another voyage to Tadoussac, accompanied by Pontgrav\u00e9. In July, 1608, he laid the foundation of Quebec. He was a man, who did not embarrass himself with commerce, and who felt no interest in traffic with the Indians, which proved so profitable to many engaged in it. Being entrusted with the charge of establishing a permanent colony, he examined the most eligible places for settlement, and selected a spot upon the St. Lawrence, at the confluence of this river and the small river of St. Charles, about four hundred and ten miles from the sea. The river in this place was very much contracted, and it was on this account that the natives called it Quebec; (although various surmises are advanced by historians and others as to the origin of the name.) Here he arrived on the 3rd of July. He erected barracks, cleared the ground, sowed wheat and rye, and laid the foundation of the \"Gibraltar of America.\" The toil of subduing the wilderness was not very acceptable to all his company; for some of them conspired to put their leader to death, and to embark at Tadoussac for France. The attempt to destroy him was to be made by poison and by a train of gunpowder; but, the apothecary having discovered the scheme, one of the conspirators was hanged, and others were condemned to the galleys. During the winter his people were afflicted with the scurvy. Champlain sought after the medicin\u00e9 which had been so successfully used by Cartier; but the tree, which was called Auneda, was not now to be found. From this circumstance it was concluded that the tribe of Indians, with which Cartier was acquainted, had been exterminated by their enemies.\n\nIn the summer of the year 1609, when the Hurons, Algonquins, and others, were about to march against their common enemy, the Iroquois, Champlain very readily joined them; for he had a keen taste for adventures; and he hoped, by a conquest, to impress all the Indian tribes with strong ideas of the power of the French, and to secure an alliance with them. He did not foresee that he should force the Iroquois, who lived in what is now called the State of New York, to seek the protection of the English and Dutch. He embarked on the river Sorel, which was then called\nthe Iroquois, because those savages usually descended by this stream into Canada. At the Falls of Chambly he was stopped, and was obliged to send back his boat. Only two Frenchmen remained with him. He ascended with his allies in the Indian canoes to the lake, to which he gave his own name, which it retains to the present day. The savages whom he accompanied, hoped to surprise the Iroquois in the villages, but they met them unexpectedly upon the lake. After gaining the land, it was agreed to defer the battle till the next day, as the night was now approaching. In the morning of 30th July, Champlain placed a party with his two Frenchmen in a neighbouring wood, so as to come upon the enemy in flank. The Iroquois, who were about two hundred in number, seeing but a handful of men, were sure of victory. But as soon as the battle began, Champlain killed two of their chiefs, who were conspicuous by their plumes, by the first discharge of his firelock, loaded with four balls. The report and the execution of the fire-arms filled the Iroquois with inexpressible consternation. They were quickly put to flight, and the victorious allies returned to Quebec with fifty scalps.\n\nIn September, 1609, Champlain embarked with Pontgrav\u00e9 for France, leaving the colony under the care of a brave man, Peter Chauvin. But he was soon sent out again to the New World. He sailed from Honfleur, April 8, 1610, and arrived at Tadoussac on the 26th. He encouraged the Montagnais Indians, who lived at this place, to engage in a second expedition against the Iroquois. Accordingly, soon after his arrival at Quebec, they sent him about sixty warriors. At the head of these and others he proceeded up the river Sorel. The enemy were soon met, and after a severe engagement, in which Champlain was wounded by an arrow, were entirely defeated. He arrived at Quebec, from Montreal, June 19, and landed at Rochelle, August 11. After the death of Henry IV, the interest of De Monts, in whose service Champlain had been engaged, was entirely ruined, and the latter was obliged to leave a settlement, which he was commencing at Mont Royal, or Montreal, and to go again to France in 1611. Charles de Bourbon, being commissioned by the Queen Regent Governor of New France, appointed Champlain his lieutenant, with very extensive powers. He returned to Canada in 1612, was engaged in war with the Iroquois, and made new discoveries. His voyages across the Atlantic were frequent. He was continued Lieutenant-Governor under that distinguished nobleman, the Prince of Cond\u00e9 and Montmorency. In 1615, his zeal for the spiritual interests of the Indians induced him to bring with him a number of Jesuit Fathers, some of whom assisted him in his warfare. He penetrated to Lake Ontario, and, being wounded while assisting the Hurons against their enemies, was obliged to pass a whole winter among them. When he returned to Quebec in July, 1616, he\nwas received as one risen from the dead. In July, 1629, he was obliged to capitulate, on account of the sparseness of his forces, and the exhausted state of his men through famine, to an English armament under Sir David Kertk. He was carried to France in an English ship; and there he found the public sentiment much divided with regard to Canada; some thinking it was not worth regaining, as it had cost the government vast sums without bringing any returns others; deeming the fishery and fur trade great national objects, especially as a nursery for seamen. Champlain exerted himself to effect the recovery of this country, and Canada was restored by the treaty of St. Germain, in 1632, with Acadie and Cape Breton.\n\nIn 1633 the company of New France resumed all their rights, and appointed Champlain the Governor. In a short time he was at the head of a new armament, furnished with a fresh recruit of Jesuits, settlers, as well as all kinds of necessaries for the welfare of the revived colony. His attention was now engrossed by the spiritual interests of the savages, whom it was his principle object to bring to the knowledge of the Christian religion. The number of ecclesiastical missionaries, exclusive of lay brothers, was now fifteen, the chief of whom were Le Jeun\u00e9, De Nonc, Masse, and Breboeuf. A mission was established among the Hurons; the colony was gaining an accession of numbers and strength, and an attempt was just commencing to establish a college in Quebec, when the Governor died, and was succeeded the next year by De Montmagny.\n\nChamplain merited the title of the father of New France. Though he was credulous, he possessed an uncommon share of penetration and energy. His views were upright; and, in circumstances of difficulty, no man could make a better choice of measures. He prosecuted his enterprises with constancy, and no dangers could shake his firmness. His zeal for the interests of his country was ardent and disinterested; his heart was tender and compassionate towards the unhappy; and he was more attentive to the concerns of his friends, than to his own. He was a faithful historian, a voyager who observed everything with attention, skilful in geometry, and an experienced seaman. He appears to have been fond of good cheer; for, in the early part of his residence in Canada, he established with his associates an order, \"De bon temps,\" which contributed not a little to the gratification of the palate. By this order every one of the same table was in his turn to be steward and caterer for a day. He was careful by hunting to make a suitable provision, and at supper, when the cook had made everything ready, he marched at the head of the company with a napkin over his shoulder, having also the staff of office, and wearing the collar of his order, and was followed by his associates, each of whom bore a dish. At the close of the banquet he pledged his\nsuccessor in a bumper of wine, and resigned to him the collar and staff. It may not be easy to justify Champlain in taking an active part in the war against the Iroquois. It is even supposed by some, that his love of adventures led him to arouse the spirit of the Hurons and to excite them to war. His zeal for the propagation of religion among the savages was so great, that he used to say \"that the salvation of one soul was of more value than the conquest of an empire;\" and that \"kings ought not to think of extending their authority over idolatrous nations, except for the purpose of subjecting them to Jesus Christ.\"\n\nHe published an account of his first voyages in 1613, in 4to; and a continuation in 1620, in 8vo. He published an addition to these in 1632, in one volume, entitled, *Les voyages de la Nouvelle France occidentale, dite Canada*, in 4to. This work comprises a history of New France from the first discoveries of Verazzani to the year 1631. There is added to it a treatise on navigation, and on the duty of a good mariner, with an abridgment of the Christian doctrines, in the Huron and French languages.\n\n---\n\n**ADMIRAL SIR DAVID KERTK.**\n\nA French refugee in England, who entered into her naval service during the reign of Charles I. He had previously been a master mariner at Dieppe, in France. He is mentioned in our history as the commander of a very successful expedition against Canada during the French occupation of this country. The Duke of Buckingham, to gratify a private pique against Richelieu, had taken advantage of the hostility entertained for the French by the English, on account of the persecution of the Huguenots by the Cardinal, and induced the king to declare war against France. The resolution was accordingly taken to deprive him of his American dependencies. Kertk therefore was placed in charge of a formidable expedition, and, accompanied by his two brothers, sailed for Canada, or rather New France. He arrived at Tadoussac, then the only considerable trading place in the country, in the middle of the summer of 1628; and, after destroying the stores, &c., sent a summons to Champlain to surrender, which the latter, although his works and forces were in a very weak condition, refused to do. Kertk, thinking that Quebec was strongly fortified, and that Champlain had a large force within it, did not proceed\nany further up the river, fearing a defeat, but contented himself with capturing a French convoy on its war to Quebec, and several fishing and peltry vessels, and proceeded to England. In July of the next year, however, having learnt his mistake, he returned, and for the second time demanded Champlain to surrender, threatening otherwise to capture the city by assault. Champlain being in a weaker condition than ever, after consulting the other authorities of the place, resolved to capitulate. He did so, and the French were allowed to march out with all the honors of war. Kertk, leaving his brother, Lewis, in command of the city, proceeded to England, taking Champlain and some others with him as prisoners of war. He afterwards captured Cape Breton, which was re-captured by Captain Daniel. These events took place two months after peace had been concluded between England and France, and therefore could hardly be recognized by either nation.\n\nLEWIS KERTK\n\nWas the first military commandant of the city of Quebec, or the province, in the employ of the English government. On his brother capturing the city in 1629, he left Lewis in command until his return, or until a successor should be appointed. The restoration of Canada to the French by the treaty of St. Germain-en-Laye, rendered that measure unnecessary. Kertk, from what we can learn from history, was a wise and good man, and treated the conquered people so well, that but few left the province during the interval which elapsed between the capitulation and the restoration.\n\nM. DE MONTMAGNY.\n\nM. De Montmagny succeeded M. De Ch\u00e2teauffort in the government of New France in 1636. De Montmagny was a knight of Malta, and a gentleman of estimable qualities of mind and heart.\nSeveral important events signalized his administration of affairs; such as the establishment of the Island of Montreal, and the commencement of the ruin of the Hurons, which was consummated under the administration of his successor. The Jesuits extended their explorations very far during his time, towards the north and in the west. Father Raimbault even formed a design of penetrating as far as China, evangelizing all nations by the way; and thus completing the circle of military stations around the whole globe. Although the opening up of heathendom by the indefatigable propagators of the faith were transactions apart from the action of the government, they threw a lustre on the administration of M. de Montmagny, and gave him personally a certain celebrity throughout Europe.\n\nThis governor had sought to imitate Champlain's policy in regard to the aborigines; and if the insufficient means put at his disposal did not always enable him to put a curb on their pugnacious tendencies, he contrived nevertheless, by a happy union of firmness with conciliation, to make his authority respected among all tribes, and to suspend, for a considerable time, the blow which at last fell upon the luckless Hurons. He was succeeded by d'Aillebout, in 1647.\n\n---\n\n**His Grace Fran\u00e7ois de Laval, Bishop of Quebec.**\n\nHis Grace Fran\u00e7ois de Laval de Montmorency, Abb\u00e9 de Montigny, first Roman Catholic bishop of Canada, and a most able, talented and zealous prelate, was born at Laval, in Maine, France, on the 23rd March, 1622. He was ordained priest at Paris on the 23rd of September, 1645, and was made archdeacon of Evreux in 1653. He was consecrated Bishop of P\u00e9tr\u00e9e in partibus infidelium, and appointed Vicar Apostolic of Nouvelle France, by Pope Alexander VII., on the 5th of July, 1658. He arrived at Quebec, for the first time, on the 16th June, 1659; and returned to France in 1662. On the 26th March, 1663, he founded the seminary of Quebec, a measure which was afterwards duly confirmed by Louis XIV., by letters patent, dated at Paris in the month of April following. He returned to Canada during the same year, and arrived at Quebec on the 28th September. He consecrated the\nParochial Church of Quebec, on the 11th July, 1666, the second Sunday of that month. He returned to France in 1674, and was named Bishop of Quebec, a suffragan Bishop of the Holy See, by a bull of Clement X., dated 1st October of the same year. On this occasion the revenues of the Abbey of Meaubec, in the diocese of Bourges, were united to the Bishopric of Quebec.\n\nOn his return to Canada, he established his board by a decree of the 6th November, 1684, and entrusted it to the care of the rectory of Quebec. The 14th of the same month, the board resigned the care of the rectory, and it devolved upon the Seminary the same day. His Grace De Laval afterwards returned to France to obtain permission to retire, and with the view of choosing a successor. Choice fell upon the Abb\u00e9 de St. Vallier, to whom was given the title of Grand Vicar, in which quality he was sent to Canada to exercise his zeal. His Grace De Laval resigned his Bishopric of Quebec, in Paris, on the 24th of January, 1688. He left that city some time after to return to Quebec. He arrived there in the spring of the same year, and retired to his Seminary, to which he made over the whole of his effects, and had the mortification to see the same twice burnt before his death. In fine, full of years and honors, a prelate, by his virtues and zeal, worthy of the church, over which he had presided, he died at Quebec on the 6th of May, 1708, at the advanced age of 86, and was buried near the principal altar in the Cathedral.\n\nM. Garneau, in his History of Canada, thus speaks of this celebrated man:\n\n\"The first Bishop known in Canada was Fran\u00e7ois De Laval, titular of P\u00e9tr\u00e9n, a scion of the illustrious house of Montmorency. To his high descent he owed much of the influence which he exercised in the civil as well as the ecclesiastical affairs of the colony, making and unmaking its governors at will. He had great talents and much activity, while his overbearing spirit brooked no opposition. His naturally obstinate character, hardened rather than subdued by religious zeal, caused constant dissensions between himself and the public functionaries with whom he had to deal; he also got into trouble with the heads of the local religious communities, and even with private individuals. He was firm in the belief that in whatever he did for the supposed weal of the church, in any contingency, he could not err; and firm in this persuasion, he did some things, in a colonial sphere of action, which would have been deemed exorbitant in Europe.\n\n\"After mounting the episcopal throne, he set about disciplining his clergy as if they had been soldiers of a spiritual militia, just as the Jesuits were passively subject to the orders of their general. He sought even to make the civil power the creature of his will\u2014causing the Sovereign Council to decree the revocability of the curacies, and to ordain that tithes should be paid to his Seminary.\"\nbut some of his projects, as contrary in sound principle as they wore to all established usage in France, had no ultimate success. He found invincible antagonists in successive governors, all more or less jealous of the undue influence which he already possessed; and these, individually, were often kept in countenance by public sentiment, which veered fitfully for or against the people's two absolute masters, lay and spiritual. The complacent recognition of such references to popular feeling seemed to solace the minds of the colonists somewhat, under the oppression of the double yoke they had to bear.\"\n\n---\n\nDE MAISONNEUVE.\n\nPaul Chomedey De Maisonneuve was the founder of the City of Montreal in 1642, where he had already settled some French colonists, and was appointed governor. In 1647, he was advanced to the governorship of the whole province, and succeeded in getting M. D'Aillebout appointed in his stead, when he retired.\n\nA violent jealousy or vindictiveness existed on the part of M. De Mesy against De Maisonneuve; and to him is ascribed the causes which led to his retirement.\n\nA pension was conferred upon him by the Seminary of Paris, in consequence of his important services to the Church of Rome in Canada.\n\n---\n\nSIEUR D'AILLEBOUT.\n\nM. Louis D'Aillebout succeeded M. De Montmagny in the government of Canada in 1647. He was the descendant (according to a note in Garneau's History of Canada, taken from a MS. of M. De Gasp\u00e9) of a German family, which at some time had migrated to France. He originally came to Canada, some years anterior to his appointment to the government, with colonists for the Island of Montreal; had administered that settlement during the\nabsence of M. de Maisonneuve, and afterwards was promoted to the government of Three Rivers. He endeavoured to amalgamate his forces with those of the Governor of New England, so as to put a stop to the encroachments and attacks of the Iroquois, but without avail. Replaced in 1651, he settled in the country, and died at Quebec in 1660. According to Bibeau, jeune, some of his descendants are still living, and are residing, some in the District of Three Rivers, others at Red River, and in the Hudson's Bay Territory.\n\nVISCOUNT D'ARGENSON.\n\nPierre de Voyer D'Argenson, who succeeded M. De Lauzon, as Governor of New France, in 1658, and retained that appointment until 1661, was the descendant of a very high and talented family. He was born in 1626, and originally was intended for the church; circumstances altered the decision arrived at by his family, and he became a soldier. His name is mentioned honorably in the military annals of his country, as having distinguished himself at the siege of Bordeaux, and at the battle of Lens. After having held the office of Reeve of Touraine, he was appointed Governor and Lieutenant-General of New France, and was sworn in as such on the 27th of January, 1657. Beyond some progress made in discovery on one side in the country beyond Lake Superior, among the Sioux; on another in the Esquimaux country, on Hudson's Bay, his government seems to have consisted of little else than \"barbaric invasions and civil and religious quarrels.\" Disease and misunderstandings at length compelled him to solicit his recall. He died about the year 1709.\n\nBARON D'AVAUGOUR.\n\nPierre Du Bois, Baron D'Avaugour, succeeded Viscount D'Argenson in the government of New France, in 1661. He\nwas a military officer of some talent, and had gained distinction in the wars of Hungary. He was of a resolute temperament and unbending character; and brought into the affairs of Canada the rigidity that he had contracted in the military service. He was therefore not the man to submit to the dictation of the clergy of the colony; and during the whole time he held office in New France, he had constant disputes with Bishop Laval, principally with reference to the liquor traffic, which the latter wished to prohibit. At length, through the bishop's representations, D'Avau-gour was recalled in 1663. After a short stay in France, he entered the service of the Emperor of Germany, and was killed in 1664, while bravely defending the fort of Serin, on the Croatian frontier, against the Turks, under the Grand-Vizier, Koprouli, shortly before the famous battle of St. Gothard.\n\nM. JEAN TALON.\n\nM. Talon, or rather Baron D'Orsainville, a title conferred upon him by king Louis XIV. of France, was the second Intendant of the French Government in Canada, and in 1663, was appointed to the office of which he was a bright ornament. He created a military aristocracy in Canada, and opposed the India Company, against which he addressed a luminous memorandum to the French Ministry. It is said everything in Canada prospered under his fostering care; and certainly he did much for the country, patronising industrial pursuits, maratime discoveries, and scientific enterprizes. He established, moreover, an excellent Judiciary system; and was entitled to the high distinctions and honors conferred upon him by his sovereign. In 1671 he was created a French nobleman, by the title of Baron des Islets; and in 1675, Baron d'Ormale, which latter honor was extended to his posterity, both in the male and female descent.\nMARQUIS DE TRACY.\n\nAlexandre de Prouville, Marquis de Tracy, was Viceroy of New France in 1663. He was a Lieutenant-General in the French army, and had served on the Continent with much distinction. Previous to coming to Canada in 1665, he had proceeded, according to the commands which he received, to the bay of Mexico, where he retook Cayenne from the Dutch, and brought several islands of the contiguous archipelago under French domination. He was one of the most popular as well as most able French officials that had ever been sent to Canada. He only remained eighteen months in the colony; yet, during that short time, he did much more for its welfare than many would have done in years. He established a military aristocracy, fortified the country against the encroachments of the Iroquois, and, to allow the people peacefully and without hindrance to cultivate their grounds, and so maintain themselves, vanquished that hitherto invincible tribe, and concluded a peace with them, which lasted eighteen years, and proved of more benefit to the people and country, long harrassed with the sanguinary inroads of the savages, than can easily be conceived.\n\nCOUNT DE FRONTENAC.\n\nLouis de Buade, Count de Frontenac, twice Governor of New France (Canada), under the French dominion, was a bold and valorous soldier and a most successful administrator. He was born in France in 1620, and early entered the military service of his country, in which he was greatly distinguished and covered, himself with scars and honors.* He first came to Canada in 1672, as the successor of M. de Couroelles, but principally on account of some despotic acts, he was recalled in 1682. During the first year of his administration, he built Fort Frontenac (Kingston), which was afterwards rebuilt of stone by La Salle. In 1678, De\n\n* Bibaud mentions that he was a Colonel of horse at seventeen, and a Lieutenant-General after twelve years service.\nFrontenac was reappointed governor, and carried on a vigorous war against the English settlements in New York, and against their Indian allies, the Iroquois. The English retaliated, and the Iroquois made various successful inroads into Canada. In 1690 he defeated Admiral Sir William Phipps and the English fleet before Quebec, and thereby achieved a great victory, so much so that Louis XIV. caused a medal to be struck in commemoration of it. He died in 1698, and was inhumed in the Recollet church of Quebec, which no longer exists.\n\nAn eminent French writer, speaking of him, says:\u2014\"He had all the qualities of a great man, the firmness which commands men with the mildness and magnanimity which made him beloved. He was generous, straightforward, and as ostentatious as a king. He was at Quebec a worthy representative of Louis XIV. at Versailles; a single look of his electrified the Canadians, he was the love and delight of New France, the terror of the Iroquois, the father of the allies of the French; his activity had for its equal only his courage.\"\n\nLA SALLE\n\nThe name of this distinguished, self-sacrificing, adventurous and chivalrous man will ever be remembered by his countrymen with feelings of love and admiration, blended with deep regret for his sad and melancholy fate whilst so nobly earning for himself a name which will be carried down to posterity with honor and distinction.\n\nRobert Cavalier de la Salle was a native of Rouen, where he was born about 1635. He was thoroughly educated by the Jesuits, having been intended to be a member of that community. He left it, however, and, about the year 1667, proceeded to Canada, in the capacity of a merchant. In this career he appears to have been eminently successful; but he aimed at still higher objects, having formed to himself the magnificent scheme of opening a way to China and Japan through the lakes of Canada, which he, not unreasonably for that time, imagined must send off navigable waters into the Pacific Ocean.* Mr. Bibaud, author of a late history of this country, says, \"He was learned, active, enterprising, and\n\n*The account of this voyage we take from the celebrated work of Jared Sparks, Esquire.\nanimated with the double desire of rising to fame and to fortune.\" In this attestation Charlevoix concurs, but adds other qualities of a less favorable nature. The particulars of his life indeed show that his reserve bordered upon distrust, his discipline upon culpable severity, and his ardent perseverance upon obstinacy; and these defects of character were the leading causes of his misfortunes. Yet without the qualities themselves, he would not have had the name he bears, nor have engaged in the schemes which he formed and executed.\n\nAfter experiencing a degree of prosperity suitable to his ability and exertions in mercantile transactions, and receiving distinguished marks of favor from the governor, Count Frontenac, he visited his native country in 1677. On his return, he set about executing the great scheme he had long meditated, of tracing the river Mississippi, or Colbert, as it was then sometimes called, to its outlet in the Atlantic, or, as it might be, in the Gulf of Mexico. For this purpose he caused to be constructed a vessel of sixty tons burden, about two leagues above the Falls of Niagara. On the 7th of August, 1679, this vessel, with thirty-four persons on board, a suitable proportion of whom were priests for the instruction of the Indians, was launched on Lake Erie, and steered towards Mackinaw. In this unknown and most hazardous navigation, De la Salle displayed unbounded resolution, and not less address, both in cheering on his own men amidst all their labors and perils, and still more in securing the favor of the savages, with whom, to his everlasting honor be it mentioned, he was never in all his lifetime, except once, in danger of coming to a rupture. He arrived at Mackinaw on the 27th of August, and, in a few weeks after, anchored at a small island in the mouth of Green Bay. Here he loaded the vessel with furs, and dispatched her to the head of the Falls. To his irretrievable loss and mortification, she was never seen or heard of again.\n\nEntertaining no doubt, however, of her eventual safety, he proceeded himself in canoes along the eastern and southern shores of Lake Michigan, to the St. Joseph, then called the Miami, a name now appropriated to the river, falling into the south-western angle of Lake Erie. All the preparations being made, they took their departure from the island on the 19th of September. Nightfall came on before they reached the nearest part of the continent, which was twelve miles distant. Darkness thickened, the waves rose, and the water dashed into the canoes; but they contrived to keep together and to find a landing place in the morning. Here they were detained four days in a barren spot, till the lake became calm. A single porcupine was the only trophy that rewarded the hunters' fatiguing rambles, which, Father Hennepin says, afforded a savory relish to their pumpkins and corn. Trusting their fragile canoes again to the waves, they were soon overtaken by new\ndisasters. Clouds gathered over them, winds blew angrily, and deluged with rain and sleet, they were glad to seek safety on a naked rock for two days, and no other shelter than their blankets. At the end of another day they were in so great danger in attempting to land, that the Sieur de la Salle leaped into the water with his men, and assisted them to drag his canoe ashore. His example was followed by those in the other canoes. They landed somewhere in the neighborhood of the river Milwaukie.\n\nBy this time the provisions were exhausted, but they had seen Indians, and presumed their habitations were at hand. Three men were sent with the calumet of peace, to search for corn. They came to a deserted village, where they found abundance of corn, of which they took as much as they wanted, and left such articles as the natives valued in exchange. Before night the Indians hovered suspiciously around the party at the canoes; but when the calumet of peace was presented, they showed themselves friends, and entertained their visitors with dances and songs. They were so well satisfied with the goods left in the village, that the next day they brought more corn and a supply of deer, for which they were amply rewarded. This proof of human sympathy, even in men called savages, was a sunbeam in the path of the weary voyagers.\n\nAfter some further adventures of the same nature, La Salle and his company arrived, on the 1st of November, at the mouth of the St. Joseph, where they spent the remainder of that month. On the 3rd of December they ascended the river in canoes, with a view to reach the portage leading into the Kankakoo, or eastern branch of the Illinois. On the 1st of January, 1680, they reached Peoria, situated on the last named river, and set about constructing a fort. At last, after several changes, they found what they considered a favorable position, and built upon it Fort St. Louis, which may be considered the head quarters of La Salle during the remainder of his wanderings. The faithful Tonty generally held the command during the long and frequent occasions of his own absence. On the 28th of February, La Salle set out on an over land journey to Frontenac, now Kingston, still bent on making further preparations for his voyage of discovery on the Mississippi. Various disagreeable incidences occurred on this long and perilous journey; but the chief calamity that befell him was the murder of his faithful attendant, Father Gabriel, who fell a sacrifice to the cruel suspicions of the Indians. Three young warriors belonging to a tribe hostile to that whose friendship the travellers had gained, met the venerable Father in one of his solitary rambles, and murdered him in cold blood.\n\nOn arriving at Fort Frontenac, he appears to have spent several months in making further preparations for his expedition to the south, and also in making proper arrangements with his creditors, with whom his extended schemes of discovery brought him some-\ntimes into difficulty, but whose claims he satisfied by suitable sacrifices of his property. When finally prepared, he proceeded to join his people at Fort St. Louis by the same route, in canoes, which he followed two years before in the Griffin, taking the round of the lakes Erie, Huron and Michigan. Having on these various journeys and voyages spent the year 1681, he assembled his people, 54 in number, at Chicago, on the 4th of January, 1682, and by ascending this stream, entered the Illinois by a shorter and more direct route than he had done two years before. On the 6th of February, they at last floated their canoes on the bosom of the long sought Mississippi. On the same day they passed the mouth of the Missouri, distinguished by its powerful current and muddy waters. Father Zenobo, whose notes are incorporated in Le Clercq's Etablissement de la Foi, is copious in his description of the various tribes of Indians whom they found on the banks, and whose friendship they were careful in cultivating. They passed the mouth of the Arkansas. On the 6th of April, they arrived at a triple partition of the river, soon after which the water became first brackish, and then salt, when the broad Gulf of Mexico appeared in view. The ceremony of taking possession of the country is thus described by Sparks: \"The following day was employed in searching for a place, removed from the tide and inundations of the river, on which to erect a column and a cross. This ceremony was performed the next day. The arms of France were attached to the column, with this inscription: 'Louis the Great, King of France and Navarre, reigns; the 9th of April, 1682.' All the men were under arms; and, after chanting the Te Deum, they honored the occasion by a discharge of their muskets, and cries of 'Long live the King.'\"\n\nNotwithstanding the formality and undoubted veracity of this deed, it is nevertheless true that the valley of the Mississippi had been traversed 140 years before by Ferdinand de Soto, one of the followers of Pizarro, with a force of at least 500 men. (See Bancroft's History of the United States.)\n\nHe founded the Fort of St. Louis, and gave to the adjacent lands the name of Louisiana.\n\nHe retraced his steps, delayed a year among the lakes, and reached Quebec, in November, 1683. He embarked for France, was welcomed by Seignelay as \"the delight of the New World,\" and received a commission, according to which all the French and natives of the country, from Fort St. Louis to New Biscay, were placed under his authority. An expedition for the colonization of Louisiana, with four vessels and two hundred and eighty persons, departed from Rochefort, August 1, 1684; but dissensions immediately arose between La Salle and the naval commander, Beaujeu. They passed the coasts of Florida, and must have been near the mouth of the Mississippi on January 10, 1685; but La Salle mistook their position, and the fleet passed on. A few days later\nhe discovered his error, and wished to return; but Beaujeu persisted in advancing west even to the bay of Matagorda. There he determined to end the dissension by abandoning his associate. He disembarked with two hundred and thirty colonists; most of his munitions were lost in a gale, and the fleet returned, leaving them almost without resources. Thinking himself near the Mississippi, he fortified the post of St. Louis, and made some attempts in agriculture, which were defeated by the ravages of beasts and the neighbouring tribes. Excursions over land and by canoe were alike ineffectual in bringing him to \"the fatal river,\" which he continued to seek. He traversed a wilderness towards New Mexico, in a vain search for gold mines. The misery of the colonists increased, and Beaujeu's example of revolt began to be followed. La Salle, whose courage and energy had never failed, no longer sought to govern or to animate his followers by gentleness, but made himself a terror to them. Their numbers were reduced by manifold losses to 37; when, in despair of subduing their opposition, or of carrying out any plan with such auxiliaries, he determined, January 12, 1681, to seek by land the country of the Illinois, and thence to pass to Canada. He set out with sixteen men, following the track of the buffalo, passed the basin of the Colorado, and reached a branch of the Trinity river. They went in groups; and the malignity of two men, Duhan and L'Archev\u00eaque, who had embarked their capital in the enterprise, found an opportunity for gratification. They quarrelled and murdered a nephew of La Salle. He suspected the fact, and asked one of them respecting the fate of his relative, when the other fired upon him from an ambush, and he fell dead. \"Such was the end,\" says Bancroft, \"of this daring adventurer. For force of will and vast conceptions; for various knowledge and quick adaptation of his genius to untried circumstances; for a sublime magnanimity, that resigned itself to the will of Heaven, and yet triumphed over affliction by energy of purpose and unfaltering hope, he had no superior among his countrymen.\"\n\nSIEUR JOLLIET.\n\nFor the few particulars hereafter given of this ingenious traveller and discoverer, we are indebted to Shea's History of the Mississippi.\nNeither his birthplace nor epoch has, as far as the present writer knows, been ascertained. His education he owed to the Jesuit College of Quebec, where, unless I am mistaken, he was a classmate of the first Canadian who was advanced to the priesthood. Jolliet was thus connected with the Jesuits, and apparently was an assistant in the college. After leaving them, he proceeded to the west to seek his fortune in the fur trade. Here he was always on terms of intimacy with the missionaries, and acquired the knowledge and experience which induced the government to select him as the explorer of the Mississippi.\n\nThis choice was most agreeable to the missionaries, and he and Marquette immortalized their names. They explored the great river, and settled all doubts as to its course. On his return, Jolliet lost all his papers on the rapids above Montreal, and could make but a verbal report to the Government. This, however, he reduced to writing, and accompanied with a map drawn from recollection. On the transmission of these to France, he without doubt expected to be enabled to carry out such plans as he had conceived, and to profit, to some extent, by his great discovery; but he was thrown aside by more flattered adventurers. The discoverer of the Mississippi was rewarded, as if in mockery, with an island in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. This was the rocky, barren and sterile Anticosti; and here Jolliet built a fort and a dwelling for his family, and houses for trade. They were not, however, destined to be a source of emolument to him. His labors were devoted also to other fields. Thus we find him, in 1689, in the employment of the Government, rendering essential service in the west.\n\nTwo years after his island was taken by the English fleet, and he himself, with his wife and mother-in-law, probably while attempting to reach Quebec, fell into the hands of Phipps, the English commander. His vessel and property were a total loss, but his liberty he recovered when the English retired from the walls of Quebec.\n\nOf his subsequent history there are but occasional traces, and we know only that he died some years prior to 1737.\"\n\nPERE MARQUETTE.\n\nA sketch of the life of the first explorer of that great body of water known as the Mississippi, must prove interesting to all classes\nof society, particularly when it is allied with the sacred calling of him who devoted the best part and energies of his existence, not only to its discovery, but also to bring within the pale of civilization and religion the hordes of barbarians that invested the country during the early portion of the history of America.\n\nJames Marquette was born in the town of Laon, France, in the year 1637, and was descended from an ancient and time-honoured French family, who resided there. As early as seventeen years of age, detached from the world and all its bright allurements, he entered the Society of Jesus; and after completing his studies and examination, proceeded of his own free will to Canada. There he ardently hoped to enter on an active and busy career in the sacred discharge of his duty. He landed at Quebec on the 20th of September, 1666; and after studying the language of the Montagnais at Three Rivers, where he remained until April, 1668, he was placed on the Ottawa mission, as it was called, but which extended considerably further west than the Ottawa valley. He journeyed up through that splendid scenery to Lake Huron, and across to Sault Ste. Marie, and here he erected a mission; and on being joined by another holy father, they built a church, rude, it is true, yet none the less sacred and holy. He now entered fully upon the most active era of his erratic life, but his stay here was not of long duration. A mission was wanted at Lapointe, and on M. Marquette being selected, he departed thither in 1669. Here his labours were great; his zeal for the cause of which he was a devoted servant, however, was never exhausted. Although careworn and harrassed, his noble nature and strict sense of duty rose predominant over all, and he worked long and well in the execution of his functions. Here again he was not destined to remain long; war was declared among the native Indians, and those of Lapointe trembled from fear and inferior numbers. They removed to Mackinaw, near Lake Huron, and M. Marquette accompanied them. His first care on reaching this station was to erect a chapel, so that the spiritual welfare of the people should not suffer while he was amongst them. He remained here for some time, until, at his earnest solicitations to be appointed to a wider field, he was chosen to accompany Jolliet in his mission. On the 17th of May, 1673, the expedition of discovery embarked in canoes at Mackinaw, and proceeded to Green Bay, through Fox River to the Wisconsin, and thence by portage to the Mississippi. They were the first explorers of this mighty sheet of water, having descended to the Arkansas, and proven by experience the navigability of the river and its mouth. In returning they ascended the Illinois, proceeded thence across to Lake Michigan to Green Bay, and came back to the mission in September, without any serious accident. On this expedition Marquette proved himself invaluable; he prepared a map of the route,\nand his buoyant spirits, activity and watchfulness, together with his piety and earnest supplications to the men, insured, no doubt, its success, even at the loss of his health, which from that time forward failed rapidly, and prostrated him for some time at Green Bay; but scarcely had he risen from his bed of sickness, ere this noble-minded man again proceeded, working vigorously as ever in the furtherance of the cause to which he devoted all his best energies. Orders came for him to open a mission on the upper waters of the Illinois, in the settlement of the Kaskaskia; and thither he departed on the 23rd of October, 1674. But now, through the privations and hardships which he had endured, his fine and vigorous constitution gave way a second time, and his malady returned with more fierceness than ever. He was again prostrated, in the forest; and, through the kind attentions of the Indians, restored to a feeble state of existence. He proceeded to the settlement, and, in a short space of time, administered the duties of his high office, and gave the natives such instruction as he was able to do; but, finding that the term of his existence was rapidly drawing to a close, he left Kaskaskia, hoping to be able to reach Mackinaw, there to lay his wearied head among his proselytes, and die in peace. But fate ordained otherwise; for on the way his disease returned again with increased virulence, and his hour had come, which he hailed with ecstacy, thanking Heaven for allowing him to die a Jesuit, a missionary, and alone. This event occurred on the 18th of May, 1675, on the river that bears his name. Shea says of him: \"He was of a cheerful, joyous disposition, playful even in his manner, and universally beloved. His letters show him to us a man of education, close observation, sound sense, strict integrity, a freedom from exaggeration, and yet a vein of humor which here and there breaks out in spite of all his self-command.\"\n\nFATHER HENNEPIN.\n\nThis celebrated man, early connected with the history of the province, and an adventurous and intrepid traveller, deserves to be placed on a par with the distinguished Charlevoix. He was a French Recollet friar, famous as a missionary and traveller in North America. He was born in Flanders about 1640. His inclination for travelling led him to Italy; and he\nwas afterwards a preacher at Hall, in Hainault. He then went into a convent, and being sent by his superiors to Calais and Dunkirk, the stories which he heard from the sailors inspired him with a desire to visit distant countries. At length he embarked for Canada, and arrived at Quebec in 1675, in the same ship as Bishop Laval and the Chevalier La Salle. Between that period and 1682, he explored the region now called the State of Louisiana, and first saw the Falls of St. Anthony. Returning to Europe, he published an account of his researches, entitled: \"Description de la Louisiane nouvellement d\u00e9couverte au sud-ouest de la Nouvelle France, avec la Carte du pays, les m\u0153urs et la mani\u00e8re de vivre des Sauvages.\" Paris: 1683. 12mo. He afterwards produced other works, containing fuller descriptions of the result of his observations. He was appointed guardian of the convent of Renty, in Artois; and refusing to return to America, after some disputes, he was permitted by his superiors to retire into Holland in 1697, where he found protectors at the court of William III., and accompanied that monarch to England. Though he adopted the secular habit among the Dutch, it does not appear that he relinquished his religion or his profession, as he always added to his signature the title of Missionary Recollet and Apostolic Notary.\n\nHe died in Holland about the year 1700. Bancroft says, referring to some discoveries which Hennepin claims to have made, that he was not merely a light-hearted, ambitious, daring discoverer, but a boastful liar.\n\n---\n\n**Sir WILLIAM PHIPPS.**\n\nThe history of this celebrated and distinguished gentleman is a remarkable one. Raised, one may say, almost from nothing, he attained, through his energy, perseverance and peculiar abilities, the highest honours; and having been appointed commander of the gallant expedition against Quebec in 1690, deserves a high place in this work.\n\nOur information is chiefly derived from Allen. Sir William Phipps was born at Pemaquid, now Bristol, Maine, on the 2nd of February, 1651. His father, James Phipps, was a gunsmith in\n\n* Many writers aver, among them Dr. Smiles, that this was the founder of the House of Normanby, while as many contradict it.\nhumble circumstances; and his mother had twenty-six children, of whom twenty-one were sons. After living in the wilderness till he was eighteen years of age, he bound himself as an apprentice to a ship-carpenter for four years; at the expiration of this time he went to Boston, where he learned to read and write. He had determined to seek his fortune upon the sea; and after a variety of adventures, he discovered a Spanish wreck on the coast of Hispaniola, from which he fished up plate and pearls and jewels, amounting in value to \u00a3300,000 sterling. With this treasure he sailed to England in 1687; and such was his honesty, and so liberal was he to his seamen, that his own share amounted only to \u00a316,000. At this time he received the honor of knighthood, which was conferred upon him by King James. Returning to Boston, he was, in 1690, admitted a member of the North Church, being baptized and professing repentance of his sins. He then commanded an expedition against Port Royal, which place he captured. Later in the same year, the English colonists forming the patriotic intention of capturing Canada from the French, Phipps was intrusted with the command of the expedition by sea, which consisted of thirty-four vessels of different burthen, and was manned by nearly fifteen hundred of the \"hardy sailors of New England,\" with thirteen hundred militia under the command of Major Walley. This formidable armament appeared before the walls of Quebec on the morning of the 5th of October, and on demanding, in the name of King William III., the surrender of that city, the brave De Frontenac, nothing daunted, replied: \"I do not acknowledge King William, and I well know that the Prince of Orange is a usurper, who has violated the most sacred rights of blood and religion. I will answer your master by the mouth of my cannon.\" To this Phipps replied by sending a tremendous broadside into the town, and the siege, if it can be called such, commenced. Walley landed on the St. Charles, and defeated a body of French troops, which had stationed themselves there to obstruct his movements. But, notwithstanding this advantage, the fire from the batteries was of such a terrific nature, and so injurious to the fleet, that, on the 11th, Phipps at a council held on board his ship, resolved to abandon the enterprise; and accordingly during the night, carried his determination into execution. But a terrible storm arising in the Gulf, nine of his ships were wrecked. He arrived at Boston on the 19th of November, considerably distressed at his defeat, which had, however, partly arisen from the lateness of the season in which the expedition had been undertaken.\n\nWhen the new charter of Massachusetts was obtained, he was nominated governor. In this capacity he arrived at Boston, May 14, 1692. He soon put a stop to prosecutions for witchcraft. In August, he sailed with about four hundred and fifty men to Pema-\nquid, where he built a fort. In 1694, in a dispute with the collector of the port, Sir William was so far carried away by the passion of the moment as to have recourse to blows to settle the controversy. He was soon afterwards removed; and he sailed in November for England, where he received assurances of being restored; but, being seized by a malignant fever, he died in 1695, at the premature age of forty-four.\n\nSir William, though his origin was very humble, was not elated by the change in his circumstances. He was a man of uncommon enterprise and industry, of an excellent disposition (though he did not always retain the command of his temper), and of perfect honesty and integrity. He exerted himself to promote the interests of New England.\n\n---\n\n**MAJOR WALLEY,**\n\nAn English colonist, born 1644. In the year 1690 accompanied Sir William Phipps as commander of the troops on board his fleet to capture Quebec, at which place he did good service, repulsing a body of French troops to the number of 300, on the banks of the St. Charles. On his return to Boston, he published a narrative of the expedition, which is to be found in Hutchinson. Afterwards was appointed a Judge of the Superior Court of Massachusetts, and a member of the Council. Was one of the principal founders of the town and church of Bristol, U.S., and a man of merit and ability; zealous in his country's service, and a good Christian. Died at Boston, January 11, 1712.\n\n---\n\n**M. LEFEBVRE DE LA BARRE.**\n\nM. de la Barre was Governor of New France from 1682 to 1685. He was a marine officer, who had distinguished himself in action against the English in the West Indies, having taken from them the islands of Antigua and Montserrat. However brave his\nAND PERSONS CONNECTED WITH CANADA.\n\nconduct may have been there, according to the record of history, it was quite the reverse in Canada. He not only had not the courage to confront a few wild and uncivilized hordes of Iroquois; but he sacrificed a small and valuable army in making some attempts to do so, to the infinite disgust of the people of the colony. His general management of affairs was extremely bad, and being recalled, he left the province without the regret of any of its inhabitants.\n\nMARQUIS DE DENONVILLE.\n\nJACQUES REN\u00c9 DE BRISAY, Marquis de Denonville, Governor of New France from 1685 to 1689, was at once a brave officer, and a man of a religious turn of mind. He was also imbued with a lofty sense of honor, and was polished in his manners. Yet he was often liable to receive wrong impressions of things; and his imperfect knowledge of the relations, subsisting between the French and the savage races, caused him to commit acts which violated the principles of equity, and brought about that retribution which never fails to follow, sooner or later, violations of the laws of nature and of nations.\n\nBy not following up a victory, which he achieved over the Iroquois, and striking a decided blow on the whole confederation, he inspired the savages with a glow of triumph, and a sense of contempt of what they deemed his cowardice. He likewise kidnapped a number of their chiefs, and sent them to France to work at the galleys, at a time when they were bound on a peaceable mission to himself. He thus excited against himself and the French a spirit of hate and detestation in the heart of the \"Red men\"\u2014a feeling which only terminated by the frightful \"Massacre of Lachine.\"\n\nHe certainly had sound ideas on many points; but he had a speculative, rather than an energetic mind, and was not prompt in action. Few governors of Canada ever set down on paper more sage maxims for its proper administration, yet fewer left it in a sadder plight.\nBISHOP DE ST. VALLIER.\n\nHis Grace Jean Baptiste DeLacroix Chevri\u00e8res De St Vallier, born at Grenoble en Dauphin\u00e9, the 14th November, 1653, was chaplain to Louis XIV. When Bishop Laval went to France in 1684 to obtain a successor, on the recommendation of that prelate, it was agreed that he should succeed him in the Bishopric of Quebec. Bishop De St. Vallier arrived in Canada, for the first time, on the 30th July, 1685, in his quality of Vicar-General to Bishop Laval, by letters from the latter, dated at Paris the 8th May of the same year. He left for France on the 3rd November, 1687, and was consecrated Bishop of Quebec, under the pontificate of Innocent XI., on the 25th January, 1688, at St. Sulpice de Paris, by Nicholas Colbert, Archbishop of Carthage and Coadjutor of the Archbishop of Rouen. His bulls were dated at Rome the 7th July, 1687. Bishop de St. Vallier returned to Canada on the 15th August, 1688. He founded the General Hospital of Quebec in 1693, and the Ursulines of Three Rivers on the 8th October, 1697. It was under his episcopacy that Louis XIV. confirmed by Letters Patent, given at Versailles in the month of October, 1697, the erection of the Bishopric of Quebec, and the union of the Rectory to the Seminary, as well as the union of the revenues of Labbaye de Meubec to the said Bishopric. His Grace De St. Vallier, after making several journeys to France, for the benefit of his diocese, died at the General Hospital of Quebec, on the 26th December, 1727, and was buried there on the 2nd January, 1728.\n\nCHEVALIER DE CALLI\u00c8RES.\n\nLouis Hector de Calli\u00e8res, a wise and prudent Governor of New France, and a gallant French military officer. Originally from Torigny in Normandy, he came to Canada as a member of the Montreal Company, and afterwards became Governor of that place. He exhibited great wisdom during the war, and in his relations with the Iroquois, with whom he concluded a peace in 1701, at Montreal. He succeeded De Frontenac in the government of the country in 1698, and continued to hold his appointment until 1703.\n\nCharlevoix does not hesitate to proclaim him one of the best generals Canada ever possessed under French rule.\nLEMOINE D'IBERVILLE.\n\nA CANADIAN navigator, who began the colonization of Louisiana, born in Montreal in 1642, died in Havana, July 9, 1706. He was one of seven brothers, who were all active in Canadian affairs in the latter half of the seventeenth century. He early went to sea, and distinguished himself for bravery and ability as a volunteer in the midnight attack on Schenectady; as commander of the expedition which recovered Fort Nelson from the British (1686), and with it the control of the Indian commerce of the region of Nelson's river; as a successful invader of the English possessions in Newfoundland, and as a victor in naval contests (1697), in spite of icebergs and a shipwreck, in Hudson's Bay. He was reputed the most skilful naval officer in the service of France, when in 1698 he was commissioned by the French Government to explore the mouth of the Mississippi, which had never yet been entered from the sea, and to erect a fort near it. With two frigates, two smaller vessels, a company of marines, and about two hundred settlers, he set sail from Rochefort, October 17, 1698; was welcomed at St. Domingo, found Pensacola preoccupied by Spaniards, and cast anchor, February 2, 1799, on the Island of Massacre, near Mobile. Accompanied by his brother, Lemoine de Bienville, a Franciscan, who had been a companion of La Salle, and forty-eight men, in two barges, and with provisions for fifteen days, he sailed thence to seek the Mississippi, which they entered 2nd March, and ascended to the village of the Bayagoulas. They also visited the Oumas, among whom they found a letter written by Tonty to La Salle, in 1684, and they probably reached the mouth of the Red River. Returning to the bay of Biloxi, Iberville erected a fort as a testimony of French jurisdiction, the command of which he entrusted to his two brothers, Sanville and Bienville. He himself sailed for France, but returned when the French supremacy on the Mississippi was endangered by British aggression, and the French Protestant refugees were seeking there an asylum after their exile from France. He again ascended the Mississippi (1700) as far as the country of the Natchez, while his brother explored western Louisiana, crossed the Red River, and approached New Mexico. Bilious fevers desolated the colonists at Biloxi; Sanville was a victim to it, and the chief command devolved on Bienville; and when Iberville arrived with reinforcements, July 22, 1701, there were but one hundred and fifty of them alive. Soon after, this fortress was transferred to the western bank of Mobile river, the first European settlement in Alabama. Iberville also constructed fortifications on\nthe Island of Massacre, which he named Dauphine Island, and which became the centre of the colony. Attacked by the yellow fever, he escaped with broken health. In 1706, in command of three vessels, he made a descent upon the English Island of Nevis, which he captured; and he died at Havana, on board of his ship, on the eve of an expedition against Jamaica.\n\nCHARLEVOIX.\n\nPETER FRANCIS XAVIER CHARLEVOIX, a celebrated traveller and writer, was a member of the order of Jesuits, and was born at St. Quintin, in 1684. He taught languages and philosophy with some reputation. He was for several years a missionary in America, and more particularly in Canada. On his return he had a chief share in the \"Journal de Trevoux\" for twenty-four years. He died in 1761, greatly esteemed for his high moral character and extensive learning. His works are: \"Histoire et Description G\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Japon,\" \"Histoire G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Paraguay,\" \"Histoire de l'Isle de St. Dominique,\" \"Vie de M\u00e8re Marie de l'Incarnation,\" and \"Histoire G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la Nouvelle France.\" Of these, the latter is the most valuable, describing his own experience, and the manners and customs of the native Americans. He is often quoted as a writer of good authority. His style is simple and unaffected; but not always perfectly correct.\n\nMARQUIS DE VAUDREUIL.\n\nPHILIPPE DE RIGAUD, Marquis de Vaudreuil, a lieutenant-general in the French army, and Governor of New France for the space of several years. He was a brave soldier, and had distinguished himself at the siege of Valenciennes. He was sent to Canada as commander of the forces, and brought with him eight hundred men. With three hundred of these he went to the relief of Montreal during the massacre of Lachine, and served under De\nAND PERSONS CONNECTED WITH CANADA.\n\nFrontenac in the grand expedition against the Iroquois. In 1690, he was engaged in the defence of Quebec against the attack of Admiral Phipps. Three years afterwards, he surprised and defeated La Chaudiere Noir, the most terrible and cunning of the Iroquois. But he gave up the military for the naval service; and in 1702, before inheriting his father's title, he obtained a seigniory, and was appointed Governor of Montreal.\n\nHe succeeded M. de Calli\u00e8res in the government of Canada in 1703. He was married at Quebec to Louise Elizabeth Joybert de Soulange, daughter of Chevalier Joybert de Soulange. This marriage was viewed with dissatisfaction by the French ministry, who did not wish him, nor any of their colonial governors, to ally themselves with the residents.\n\nHe displayed great activity in 1710, in the defence of Quebec\u2014the expense of which, however, was mainly borne by its inhabitants; and he made preparation for the relief of Montreal.\n\nAfter the accession of Louis XV., he effected in the colony numerous reforms, which were much required, and the most important were those of improved education and civilization. He died at Quebec on the 10th of October, 1725, universally regretted by the people of the colony. His administration was tranquil; and his measures, whether civil or warlike, were usually crowned with success.\n\nADMIRAL SIR HOVEDEN WALKER.\n\nFrom the few particulars we have at hand, we learn that this celebrated naval officer entered the British service at an early age, and speedily attained to the highest honors. For his gallantry and bravery, in 1711, he was knighted by Queen Anne. He is connected with our history in having been the commander of the ill-starred expedition which sailed for Quebec, to wrest Canada from the French, in the same year. Everything connected with this lamentable epoch in his life is well known, as it forms part of our history. The French did all they could to prevent the squadron ascending the river, which in those days was not so easy to navigate as at present, the St. Lawrence not having the benefit of light-houses, buoys, &c.; and they were successful, aided also by a storm which overtook Walker. Half his ships were wrecked on Isle aux C\u0153urs, in the St. Lawrence, and he was compelled to return to England. It is useless now to speculate on the consequences to\nthis country if he had succeeded in gaining our harbour; suffice it to say, that the French were so reduced in numbers by ill-health, disease and famine, that it would have been a comparatively easy matter to overcome them.\n\nWalker, on his return to England, suffered more reverses; his splendid ship, the Edgar, of seventy-six guns, blew up at Spithead, and nearly all the crew perished; the officers were nearly all on shore. Sir Hoveden was blamed for some negligence in this matter, and not having recovered his good name by his loss at Quebec, was dismissed the service in 1715. He published in 1720, \"A Journal or full account of the late expedition to Canada, &c.\", in his defence, but without avail; previous to which, however, he had proceeded to South Carolina, where he settled upon a plantation. He died, actually broken-hearted, in 1725.\n\nMARQUIS DE BEAUHARNOIS.\n\nCharles, Marquis de Beauharnois, succeeded M. de Vaudreuil in the government of New France in 1726, and held that appointment for more than twenty years\u2014a fact which goes far to prove his fitness and capacity for such a high office. He was commodore in the royal navy of France, in which he had gained distinction in bygone years, and had filled some important posts besides.\n\nDuring the long and critical period in which he exercised the gubernatorial functions in Canada\u2014although inundations and earthquakes, dearth, famine, war and sickness prevailed and had to be contended with\u2014the French ministry had never cause either to reproach him for remissness of duty, or correct him in his general administration of affairs, except once, when he took part in the quarrel between the clergy and the Chapter on the occasion of the collision of those parties relative to the burial of the body of Bishop de Valli\u00e8res.\n\nIn consequence of the sanguinary inroads which the Outagamis were making on the unprotected colonists throughout the country, he found it necessary, during the early part of his administration, to give a sudden and decided check to their proceedings. A small army was organized composed of the colonists, who pursued the savages as far as where the city of Chicago now stands, and the Mississippi. They met in with the Indians, and signally defeated them; besides destroying their huts and plantations, they indeed nearly exterminated the cruel and unrelentless red men of the tribe of the Outagamis, while they avenged the death of their country-men. It was a just retribution.\nWhen war was declared between England and France, and the conquest of Canada and the other French colonies resolved on by the former, and when only a small and feeble force was at his disposal, he fortified and strengthened the several weak positions of the country, and founded the impregnable Crown Point. By his representations and entreaties, he at length prevailed on the French ministry to send an expedition to recapture Cape Breton, and to drive the English from the West Indies. Had this expedition been commanded by a competent and able officer, great damage would certainly have been done to our sea and land forces. As it happened, the French fleet was annihilated by fierce and violent storms, which the inexperienced D'Auville was unable to contend against. Beauharnois was succeeded in 1746 by M. de la Jonqui\u00e8re.\n\nSIEUR DE LA VERENDRYE.\n\nPierre Gauthier de Varennes, Sieur de la Verendrye, was the discoverer of the great mountain range known as the Rocky Mountains, in 1731. The expense of this achievement (although it had been projected by M. de Beauharnois), was borne entirely by M. Verendrye himself. It added great lustre to his name, and the king conferred upon him the Cross of St. Louis. He was a native of France, and had been previous to his undertaking (which was an attempt to reach the Pacific), engaged in trafficking in peltry with the natives. He died at Quebec on the 6th of December, 1749, just as he was about, by the king's desire, to resume his journey to the Pacific.\n\nHe once related to Mr. Kalm, a Swedish savant, who was on a visit to Canada, that he had discovered, in one of the remotest of the countries which he had reached, at a spot nine hundred leagues beyond Montreal, some massive pillars, each formed of a single block of stone, resting one against the other, or superimposed, as are the courses of a wall. He concluded that, thus arranged, the pile must have been formed by human hands. One of the pillars was surmounted by a much smaller block, only one foot high and a few inches across, bearing on two sides graven characters of an unknown language. This stone was sent to Paris. Several Jesuits who saw it in Canada, said to Kalm that the engraving which it bore resembled the Tartaric characters. This opinion, in Kalm's estimation, tended to confirm the hypothesis of\nan Asiatic immigration to America, and the real origination of a portion, at least, of the native races found in possession of its two continents and islands.\n\nMICHEL SARRASIN,\n\nA most learned French savant, who resided at Quebec, when this province was a dependency of France. He was a member of the Academy of Sciences of Paris and of the Superior Council of the province, and held the office of what was termed, \"Physician to the King.\" To the Sovereign Council he was keeper of the King's Seal, in 1733, after Counsellor Delino. He contributed many papers to various learned societies; among them, \"Description of the Cantor,\" in the memoirs of the Academy of Sciences for the year 1704; \"A Letter on the Mineral Waters of Cap de la Magdelene,\" in the memoirs of Trevoux, 1736; \"Description of the Water or Musk Rat of America,\" in the Paris Documents; and a description of the plant which he discovered and called *Sarracenia purpurea*.\n\nCharlevoix was surprised to find such a learned man in the colony. He married, in Canada, Mlle. Marie Anne Hazeur, by whom he had a son, who died in 1739, in Paris. His decease took place on the 9th of September, 1734, at the age of 75 years.\n\nCOUNT DE LA GALLISSONNIERE.\n\nROLAND MICHEL BARRIN, Count de la Gallissonni\u00e8re, administrator of the government of New Franco from 1747 to 1749, during the imprisonment in England of Admiral de la Jonqui\u00e8re, the governor.\n\nHe was a distinguished marine officer, active, energetic, and enlightened as a civilian; and spent in scientific pursuits such leisure as his public duties allowed him. He governed Canada only two years; but he gave, during that brief time, a strong impulse\nto its administration, as well as much good counsel to the French ministry, which, had it been followed, would no doubt have preserved, for some time longer, this fine dependency to France. His administration is chiefly marked by some disputes with the English and their colonists in the other provinces, relative to their right of way in and about the peninsula of Nova Scotia and the Ohio region. He made extensive defensive fortifications throughout the whole of the province, and formed the project of settling the Franco-Canadians, who had hitherto lived on the peninsula, on the northern shores of the Bay of Fundy\u2014a project which received the approbation and assistance of the French ministry, and was carried into effect.\n\nHe afterwards went again into active service, and in 1756, was charged to transport land forces to Minorca, for the siege of Fort Mahon. His fleet was met, in returning, by Admiral Byng's squadron; and an action took place, which, however, the French cannot call a victory, as all that Gallissonni\u00e8re could do was to force Byng to retire\u2014for which act, the latter was tried by court martial, on his arrival in England, sentenced and shot. The former did not long survive this event: always delicate in bodily constitution, he undertook his last expedition only from an over sense of duty, and against the advice of his physicians, who foretold that the fatigues which he must undergo would kill him. Accordingly, October 26, 1756, having halted at Nemours, on his way to Fontainebleau, where Louis XV. then was, he died. The king, who had not even conferred upon him the grade of vice-admiral, afterwards alleged (but his assertion may be doubted), that he had called his deceased servant to court, in order to create him a marshal of France. His loss was much felt in the French royal marine; by the sailors more especially, whose affections he gained by attending to their interests with paternal affection and kind regard.\n\nHis administrative and scientific talents even surpassed his genius for active war. The former shone conspicuously in New France; and while he was military commandant of Rochefort, when the commissariat for marine was organized, he had the direction of that establishment. Men of science lost a brother by his decease, for he was a devoted student of natural history, being especially attached to those departments of knowledge most contributing to man's well-being. Thus, whatever foreign localities he visited, he endowed with the most useful plants of old France, and rendered to her, in exchange, whatever was likely to enrich her from the New World, and other foreign parts. La Gallissonni\u00e8re had a great heart and a beautiful mind, seated in a mean body, for he was both low in stature and deformed in person.\nMARQUIS DE LA JONQUIERE.\n\nJACQUES PIERRE DE TAFFANEL, Marquis de la Jonquiere, governor of Canada from 1749 to 1752, was born about 1686, in the Chateau of La Jonquiere, Languedoc, and was the descendant of a high family of Catalonian origin. He served in the War of the Succession, assisted in the reduction of the Cevennes\u2014that is, he actively persecuted the French Protestants in the south, thrusting them out with fire and sword,\u2014and also in the defence of Toulon against the Savoyards. He had accompanied Duguay-Trouin to Rio Janeiro, and fought along with La Bruyere de Court against Admiral Matthews, in 1744, and had risen to the rank of admiral in the service. His government was marked with considerable firmness, and he generally carried out the policy of the energetic and talented La Gallissonniere. He solicited his recall in 1751, in consequence of some charges relative to the monopoly of the peltrey traffic, preferred against him by the Jesuits, to which the ministry gave credence; but before he could receive it, his bodily powers, severely affected by mental irritation, and impaired by age and the fatigues of an over active career, gave way, and he died at Quebec on the 17th of May, 1752. France lost in him one of the ablest of her naval officers. He was of an indomitable spirit in action\u2014a precious quality at a time when the war marine of France was overmatched in physical strength by that of her rival. His person was well formed, but he was low in stature. He had an imposing air; but his mental acquirements, it is said, were not great. He tarnished his reputation by an inordinate love of wealth, and his avarice laid him open at last, after accumulating a large fortune, to the attacks which hastened his death. Although possessed of millions, he denied himself, it may be said, the veriest necessities of life, even in his last moments.\n\nLORENZO DU PONTE.\n\nLORENZO DU PONTE, a native of Canada; was born there in 1749, and died at New York, 1838. He was an Italian poet and translator of some repute. Part of his early years were spent\nin Venice. His amorous verses forced him to fly from that city, and he went to Goritz in Austria, where he raised up new enemies, and left for Dresden, with an introduction to Salieri, the composer. For Salieri he wrote the libretto of the opera of the \"Dana\u00efdes,\" and others. He then visited France and England, Holland, and finally the United States of America, where he tried various schemes of living without success; and in 1806, after getting into debt and arranging with his creditors, obtained a subsistence by teaching his native language and by translation. He also wrote his adventures from 1823 to 1827, in four volumes, which were published at New York.\n\nMARQUIS DUQUESNE DE MENNEVILLE.\n\nA brave and judicious governor of New France, who, during three most important years (from 1752 to 1755) while he governed the country, pursued such a firm and rigorous policy as called forth the admiration of the people of this and his native country, France. He was a captain in the royal marine service, and had been recommended to his appointment by the distinguished De Gallissonni\u00e8re. He was descended from the greatest Duquesne, grand-admiral of France, under Louis XIV. He introduced great reforms in the colony, placed the colonial troops on a par with the European by constant drilling and study; he erected forts in the far west for the protection of the country and his countrymen, and he resisted the encroachments of the English and colonial troops. Whether it was that he found the \"speck of war,\" which was at that time rising on the horizon too great a task for him to resist with the means at his disposal, or whether he had some prophetic warning of the ultimate destiny of New France, and so wished to give up so great a responsibility, we are not able to say; but he solicited his recall on the plea that he wished to return to active duty.\nMARQUIS DE VAUDREUIL.\n\nPierre Fran\u00e7ois, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnal, the last governor of Canada under French domination, and undoubtedly one of the best. This latter assertion will be readily granted, particularly when the trying and arduous circumstances under which he labored are taken into consideration. He was a son of the former governor of New France, of the same name, and was born at Quebec, in 1698. Having joined the military service he rose to the rank of major in the marine corps. In 1733, he was appointed governor of Three Rivers, and in 1743, of Louisiana, in both of which situations he was greatly popular. In 1748, he succeeded to his father's title; and in 1755, was elevated to the high and responsible appointment of governor of New France,\u2014an appointment, which, if Montcalm and he had acted in concert, and the former had paid more attention to the plans of the latter, he would certainly have held for a much longer period than he did. The jealousy, or rather the contempt, with which Montcalm regarded M. de Vandreuil and his valuable suggestions, certainly tended, in a great measure, to hasten the downfall of the French nation in America. M. de Vandreuil ever studied the welfare of Canada, and was devotedly attached to his sovereign. He would rather have died, and sacrificed all he possessed, than tarnish the glory and honor of the arms of his country. He was a true Frenchman, bold and energetic in his measures, and yet wise and judicious in carrying them out. This was clearly manifested when he capitulated to Amherst at Montreal, notwithstanding the intention of the valorous De Levis to hold out with his scanty forces to the last; a determination which De Vandreuil saw was hopeless, and would involve the needless destruction of Montreal, and the loss of many valuable lives. He therefore pursued the wisest, and indeed the only course open to him, and no one can justly impeach his loyalty or patriotism in so doing.\n\nAfter his return to France he was imprisoned in the Bastille, on some charges preferred against him by the friends of Montcalm, but a trial before the Ch\u00e2telet de Paris exonerated him from these, and from all blame in his administration of the affairs of Canada. He was released from imprisonment, but stripped of nearly all his worldly possessions. He died in 1764.\nBARON DIESKAU.\n\nJohn Harmand, Baron Dieskau, celebrated as the commander-in-chief of the French forces in this country during the time anterior to Montcalm, and for the active part he took in the wars between the English and French during that period. His last act was when he commanded the expedition sent up to defeat and drive off that of the English which was advancing to invade Canada in 1755. On this occasion he achieved a brilliant victory over the army of Colonel Ephraim Williams, but on the same day met that of the celebrated Sir William Johnson. A second battle ensued, which resulted in the total defeat of Dieskau, he himself being made prisoner, and also seriously wounded. He was conveyed to New York, where his wounds were dressed, and he recovered, but only for a short time. His decease taking place at Surenne, in France, September 8, 1767.\n\nM. DE VAUQUELIN.\n\nA brave and chivalrous French naval officer, who commanded the French ships at Quebec, at the time of the conquest. M. Garneau says that \"he fell, sword in hand, into the enemy's power, covered with honorable wounds, after an heroic combat of two hours, maintained against several frigates, opposite Point aux Trembles.\" Almost all his officers were killed or wounded, as well as most of the scanty crew of l'Atalante, aboard which vessel he had hoisted his flag, and would not strike it.\n\nBrave as he proved himself to be, Captain Vauquelin was ill received at court when he returned to France. The Moniteur de la Flotte of 1857, in an article on this brave sailor, recounts the following touching particulars:\n\n\"It is well known that Jean Vanquelin, the celebrated naval captain, highly reputed for his rare merit and admirable intrepidity, after distinguishing himself greatly in defending Louisiana, and afterwards the city of Quebec, was, through some dark intrigues, disgraced and put in prison. Despite his reclamations and those of his family, he died in the year 1763, without having had his...\"\ncase tried. Some authors even say that he was assassinated in the prison; but this report seems not to be sufficiently attested.\n\n\"He left behind him a son, Pierre Vanquelin, who devoted himself at an early age to the study of African history and geography; his researches in which obtained for him a prize, in 1776, from the Academy of Lyons.\n\n\"This young savant, highly recommended by a brave officer who knew his connections (the Marquis de Vaudreuil), was, in 1774, placed by Turgot in the admiralty office, where he occupied his leisure time in drawing up a memorial, narrating the career and services of his father, in the hope of his merit being acknowledged and his memory cleared of blame. A circumstance occurring fortuitously, came in aid of this work of filial piety.\n\n\"In 1775, Queen Marie Antoinette was present at the first communion of some young girls of the Commune de Meudon; and after the ceremony was over, one among them, chosen by the others, presented to her Majesty a fine nosegay of white roses; reciting at the same time a complimentary address, prepared beforehand, thanking the Queen for the honor she had done the rude parishioners by condescending to come among them.\n\n\"The young girl charged with this duty was Mlle. Elizabeth Vauquelin, then aged thirteen, who lived with one of her aunts at Meudon. She greatly pleased the Queen, who after embracing her, asked whether she could do anything for her.\n\n\"The young lady, not disconcerted, yet with tears starting from her eyes, replied, 'I make bold to solicit your Majesty that you would cause justice to be rendered to the good name of my grandfather.'\n\n\"The noble heart of the Queen was softened on hearing this appeal. She again embraced the girl, and promised that her request should not be neglected. Nor was it; for that very day she informed the king of what had passed. Louis XVI., ever good, ever just, ordered M. de Sartimes, then Minister of Marine, to make inquiries regarding Jean Vauquelin, and let him know the result.\n\n\"The inquiry was entered upon at once. Among the witnesses examined were Lapeyrouse, the Marquis de Vaudreuil, and members of the family of the Marquis de Montcalm, the hero of Canada. The inquiries made were eminently favorable to the memory of Vauquelin; they attested the glorious services which he had performed as a French naval officer, and proved the injustice of the accusations which had been brought against him in his later years.\n\n\"Louis XVI. caused the son of the deceased to be presented to him; and letting M. Vauquelin know the result of the inquiry, told him that his father's services would not be forgotten. The latter presented to the king a copy of his memoire on the geogra-\nAND PERSONS CONNECTED WITH CANADA.\n\nphy of Africa. Some months afterwards Louis sent him on an important mission to Morocco, in which he acquitted himself admirably. In 1777, the ministry having decided to establish permanent relations in the farthest east, Vauquelin was appointed king's consul in China, and obtained an exequatur as such from Kien-Long, the reigning emperor. This fact has never obtained publicity till now. M. Vauquelin rendered great services, and left a good personal repute in China.\"\n\nCOUNT DE VAUDREUIL.\n\nThe Count de Vaudreuil mentioned in the deed, after the death of Pierre Fran\u00e7ois, and lieutenant-general of the naval forces, was born at Quebec in 1723. He entered the French naval service in 1741, and commanded L'Artilleuse in 1756. He gave battle to two English frigates on the C\u00f4te de Bretagne, and did not surrender until he had saved the fleet which he had under convoy. The English not only requested him to retain his sword, but sent him to France without exacting an exchange. At the commencement of the American war, in answer to an offer made to him by the king of the government of St. Dominique, he said: \"No, sire, the only post suitable to a seaman in war time, is that of a commander of a ship.\" He commanded the Fendant at the conquest of Grenada, under D'Estaing, took six millions worth of prizes during the cruise, and captured the Senegal in 1779. He was present, in his quality of general officer, at five naval engagements. That of D'Ouessant against Admiral Keppel was undecided; that of Martinique against Hood was a disappointment, as was the encounter between Comte de Guichen with Admiral Kempenfeldt; but that of the Chesapeake against Graves was a victory, which resulted in the capitulation of Lord Cornwallis. He was present at the two engagements with Rodney, under the Comte de Guichen, as well as under the Comte de Grasse Tilly. Seasam, who commanded the Triumphant, and who conducted the advance guard, spared nothing to be beforehand respecting the fate of Paris, and thereby saved twelve ships. The Council of War assembled in 1784 rendered entire justice to his able retreat; and Louis XVI. in person thanked him. Already a Commander of St. Louis, he was created Grand Croix in 1789. During this notable period he was led to the \u00c9tats G\u00e9n\u00e9raux. Threatened in 1792, he defended the\nTuileries,* and afterwards emigrated. The minister, Bertram, wrote to him inviting him to resume his post. Las Casas, in the \"M\u00e9morial de Ste. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne,\" speaking about the emigration of Comblentz, says that the councillors of Monsieur were M. M. d'Avary and de Jancourt, the Marquis de Vaudreuil and the Bishop d'Arras, and Marquis le Comte d'Artois. Madame de Genlis pronounces a eulogy on him in her M\u00e9moires. He entered France with eagerness under the consulate, and died in 1802. He must not be blended with the Comte de Vaudreuil, his contemporary, the same perhaps to whom Charlevoix was preceptor, who pursued Nelson during the American war, and who was chief of the squadron at Dominique, where he commanded the Sceptre, as well as in the engagement against Admiral Hood. He was wounded on the 12th of April.\n\n---\n\nCHEVALIER DE VAUDREUIL.\n\nPierre Fran\u00e7ois Rigaud, Chevalier de Vaudreuil, another member of that illustrious family, and brother to the last governor of Canada, successively lieutenant-governor of Quebec and governor of Three Rivers and Montreal, was born in that city on the 8th of February, 1704, and married on the 2nd of May, 1733, at Quebec, Louise Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Fleury de La Gorgendi\u00e8re. According to the author of the memoirs, published by the Historical Society at Quebec, he was a brave soldier, not very ingenious, plain, affable, beneficent, and capable of risking everything for the service of his sovereign. He took Fort Massachusetts, achieved a victory over Colonel Parker on lake St. Sacrement, sunk twenty bateaux, and took five officers and one hundred and sixty men; destroyed the preparations of a campaign under the bastions of Fort George; went to France, where he prevailed on the French ministry to despatch Montcalm, De L\u00e9vis, Bourlamaque and Bougainville to this country; assembled at St. John the army which besieged Oswego and Ontario, and slid in between the forts, during the siege, in spite of a corps of troops which were there established to keep open the communication of these two fortresses. The last attempt to detach from the English the Iroquois cantons, was made through his ministry in 1757. Rigaud de Vaudreuil\n\n*But for the intrepid defence of the body-guard, and the exertions of the Marquis de Vaudreuil, who succeeded in reviving in the French guards some sparks of their ancient loyalty, the king himself and the royal family would have fallen a prey to the assassins. (Alison's History of Europe, Vol. I.)\nleft with nine canoes loaded with presents; and the chief of the Ounnagagu\u00e9s came to meet him with twenty warriors; they saw him near Oswego. Each chief was saluted with three volleys of musketry; a tent was struck, and the two chiefs were brought together. There is found in the \"M\u00e9moires sur le Canada,\" as well as in the \"Sagamos Illustr\u00e9s,\" the remaining description of the conference, which, however, had no effect. He was still living with his wife, at St. Germain-en-Laye, in 1770.\n\nMONTCALM.\n\nLOUIS JOSEPH DE SAINT V\u00c9RAN, Marquis de Montcalm, celebrated in history as a brave, bold and intrepid French military officer, and as the last commander of the French troops in America, previous to what is termed the conquest of Canada, was distinguished for the masterly manner in which he executed the command confided to him by his sovereign, and more particularly for the stout and resolute resistance which he made to the English under Wolfe in 1759, when they attacked the city of Quebec. He was the descendant of a noble French family (members of which are still living), and was born in the Chateau of Caudiac, near N\u00eemes, in 1712. He entered the army when fourteen years of age, served in Italy as early as 1734, distinguished himself in Germany under Belle Isle during the war for the Austrian succession; Italy again became the scene of his exploits, and there he gained the rank of colonel in the disastrous battle of Piacenza (1746). In 1756, being then a brigadier-general, he was appointed to command the French troops in Canada. He arrived in this country about the middle of May, and soon after began operations against the English with great activity and success. Fort Ontario at Oswego was carried on 14th August, after a brisk and well-conducted attack. The next year he forced Fort William Henry at the head of Lake George, which was held by a garrison of over two thousand five hundred men, to surrender at discretion, and thus became possessed of forty-two guns and large stores of ammunition and provisions, which were invaluable to his nearly destitute army. Scarcity of food had been one of his greatest difficulties; the harvest in Canada had failed, and the French government was reluctant to send out supplies, which were liable to be captured by the English cruisers. Montcalm had, besides, to oppose an enemy far superior in numbers and discipline to his own troops, which consisted in a great measure\nof Canadian volunteers. Notwithstanding these disadvantages he held his ground firmly, when, in the campaign of 1758, the English under Abercrombie, marched from the south toward the French dominions. Montcalm occupied the strong position of Ticonderago, made it still stronger by entrenchments, in constructing which he worked with the common soldiers, and, at the head of about three thousand six hundred men, awaited the attack of over fifteen thousand. After a fierce battle, which lasted four hours (July 8, 1758), the British retreated in disorder. The personal bravery which Montcalm had evinced, increased his popularity among his soldiers; and it is believed by many, that if he had received timely reinforcements, he could have maintained the supremacy of the French in North America, or held out for a much longer period; but the want of energy on the part of the home government, the scarcity of food all over New France, and personal dissensions between the governor and the military commander, forbade him to look for much assistance; and in the midst of victory he expressed his conviction that in a few months the English would be masters of the French colonies in America. Resolved, however, to struggle to the last, and, as he himself said, \"to find his grave under the ruins of the colony,\" he actively prepared for the campaign of 1759. The English, on the other side, spared no exertions to make their conquest sure; troops were sent from Europe, the colonial regiments were thoroughly re-organized, and a strong fleet was to co-operate with the land forces. While Amherst and Prideaux were manoeuvering to dislodge the French from their posts in the vicinity of Kingston, General Wolfe, at the head of eight thousand chosen troops, supported by the fleet in the St. Lawrence, presented himself before Quebec. The success of the whole campaign, or more properly the conquest of Canada, depended upon the taking of that city; and to protect it, Montcalm had concentrated his principal forces on the banks of the Montmorenci river. Being attacked in front by Wolfe, on July 31, he repelled him with considerable loss. Wolfe then changed his plans; he prudently landed his troops by night on the left bank of the St. Lawrence, above Quebec, climbed the table land that overhangs the city, and on the morning of 18th September, appeared with his whole force on the heights of Abraham, in the rear of the French army. Montcalm flew at once to oppose his advance; and by ten o'clock the two armies, nearly equal in numbers, each having fewer than five thousand men, were drawn up in front of one another. Montcalm led the attack in person, but his troops soon broke before the deadly fire and unflinching front of the British; and when Wolfe, placing himself at the head of the 28th and the Louisbourg Grenadiers, gave the order to charge with bayonets, the French fled in every direction. The gallant British general fell in the moment of triumph. Montcalm, having received one musket ball\nearlier in the action, was mortally wounded while attempting to rally a body of fugitive Canadians, a few moments after Wolfe was borne from the field. On being told that his death was near: \"So much the better,\" he said, \"I shall not live to see the surrender of Quebec.\" He died next morning; and his death was followed by the loss of all Canada, \"where his career,\" as Bancroft observes, \"had been a wonderful struggle against inexorable destiny.\" He was buried in the Ursuline Convent, on Garden street, Quebec.\n\nA public monument to the memory of both Wolfe and Montcalm was erected at Quebec in 1827, chiefly through the influence of the Earl of Dalhousie, then governor-general of Canada.\n\nThe following inscription and epitaph which we give, was written by the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles Lettres of Paris in 1761, and was inscribed on a monument which that body had designed to erect in Quebec, but which never reached that city, the vessel on which it had been embarked having been lost at sea:\n\nHERE LIETH\n\nIn either hemisphere to live forever,\n\nLEWIS JOSEPH DE MONTCALM GOZON,\nMarquis of St. V\u00e9ran, Baron of Gabriac,\nCommander of the order of St. Lewis,\nLieutenant General of the French army;\nnot less an excellent citizen than soldier,\nwho knew no desire but that of\n\nTRUE GLORY;\n\nHappy in a natural Genius, improved by literature;\nHaving gone through the several steps of military honors\nwith an uninterrupted lustre;\nskilled in all the arts of war,\nthe juncture of the times, and the crisis of danger;\nIn Italy, in Bohemia, in Germany,\nan indefatigable general:\nHe so discharged his important trusts,\nthat he seemed always equal to still greater\nAt length, grown bright with perils,\nsent to secure the province of Canada\nWith a handful of men,\nhe more than once repulsed the enemy's forces,\nand made himself master of their forts\nreplete with troops and ammunition.\nInured to cold, hunger, watching and labours,\nunmindful of himself,\nhe had no sensation but for his soldiers:\nAn enemy with the fiercest impetuosity;\na victor with the tenderest humanity,\nAdverso fortune he compensated with valour;\nthe want of strength with skill and activity; and, with his counsel and support, for four years protracted the impending fate of the colony.\n\nHaving, with various artifices, long baffled a great army, headed by an expert and intrepid commander, and a fleet furnished with all warlike stores, compelled at length to an engagement, he fell\u2014in the first rank\u2014in the first onset, warm with those hopes of religion which he had always cherished; to the inexpressible loss of his own army, and not without the regret of the enemy's,\n\nXIV September, A.D. MDCCLIX.\n\nOf his age, XLVIII.\n\nHis weeping countrymen Deposited the remains of their excellent General in a grave which a fallen bomb in bursting had excavated for him, recommending them to the generous faith of their enemies.\n\nLORD AMHERST.\n\nJeffrey, Lord Amherst, the commander-in-chief of an army in America at the conquest of Canada, and one of the bravest and most experienced officers that ever the nation had the good fortune to possess, was born in Kent, England, January 29, 1717. Having early discovered a predilection for the military life, he received his first commission in the army in 1731, and was aid-de-camp to General Ligonier in 1741, in which character he was present at the battles of Dettingen, Fontenoy, and Rocoux. He was afterwards aid-de-camp to His Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland, at the battle of Laffeldt. In 1758, he received orders to return to England, being appointed for the American service. He sailed from Portsmouth, 16th March, as major-general, having command of the troops destined for the siege of Louisbourg. On the 26th of July following, he captured that place, and without further difficulty took entire possession of the Island of Cape Breton. After this event, he succeeded Abercrombie in the command of the army of North America. In 1759, the vast design of an entire conquest of Canada was formed. Three armies were to attack at\nnearly the same time all the strongholds of the French in this country. They were commanded by Wolfe, Amherst and Prideaux. General Amherst, in the spring, transferred his head-quarters from New York to Albany; but it was not till the 22nd July that he reached Ticonderago, against which place he was to act. On the 27th this place fell into his hands, the enemy having deserted it. He next took Crown Point, and put his troops in winter quarters about the last of October. In the year 1760, he advanced against Canada, embarking on Lake Ontario, and proceeded down the St. Lawrence. On the 8th of September, M. de Vaudreuil capitulated, surrendering Montreal and all other places within the government of Canada.\n\nHe continued in the command in America till the latter part of 1763, when he returned to England. The author of the letters of Junius was his friend, and, September 1760, wrote in his favor. In 1771, he was made governor of Guernsey, and in 1776, he was created Baron Amherst of Holmsdale, in the county of Kent. In 1778, he commanded the army in England. At this period Lord Sackville, to whom the letters of Junius have been ascribed, was one of the king's ministers, and he had been intimate with Amherst from early life. In 1782, he received the gold stick from the king; but, on the change of the administration, the command of the army and the lieutenant-generalship of the ordnance were put into other hands. In 1787, he received another patent of peerage, as Baron Amherst of Montreal. In January, 1793, he was again appointed to the command of the army in Great Britain; but in 1795 this veteran and very deserving officer was superseded by H. R. H. the Duke of York, the second son of the king, who was only in the thirty-first year of his age, and had never seen any actual service. The government on this occasion, with a view to soothe the feelings of the old general, offered him an earldom and the rank of field-marshal, both of which he at that time rejected. The office of field-marshal, however, he accepted in July, 1796. He died without children, at his seat in Kent, August 3, 1793, aged eighty years.\n\nWOLFE.\n\nIf the hearts of the English people and of British Canadians ever beat with feelings of gratitude, joy or emotion, it is at the mention of the name of the gallant, brave, able and generous\nyoung general, who was appointed to command the expedition destined to wrest from French power one of the finest countries on the globe. It has been appropriately called \"the brightest jewel in Britain's crown\"\u2014the most valuable and loyal province among her Majesty's possessions. This renowned hero braved all dangers to lead on his gallant army to victory, and died the soldier's death\u2014on the battle-field, the field of glory, the classic ground known as the Plains of Abraham. Wolfe has established for himself a name and an immortality of fame which can never be tarnished while the British empire endures. He is our hero; he won for us all that we possess; and Canadians should ever gratefully regard the memory of him who first brought their country under the sway of constitutional monarchy.\n\nJames Wolfe was born at Westerham, Kent, on the 15th of January, 1726. His father, Edward Wolfe, was an officer in the British army\u2014some biographers call him lieutenant-general; his son's monument at Greenwich styles him only colonel.\n\nA commission was obtained for James at an early age. In 1747 he was present at the battle of Laffeldt, and had the good fortune to distinguish himself by his presence of mind at a critical juncture. The treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle restored peace to Europe in the course of the next year; but Wolfe found means to keep alive the favorable impression which he had made on the minds of his superior officers in action, by the skill and attention evinced by him in the irksome routine duties of training and preserving discipline. The precision with which the six British battalions of infantry performed their evolutions on the field of Minden (1759), and the firmness with which they kept their ground, when exposed, in consequence of Lord George Sackville's dilatoriness in bringing up the cavalry, were in a great measure attributed to the exertions of Wolfe. During the seven years of peace which succeeded 1748, he gradually rose to the rank of lieutenant-colonel.\n\nHostilities re-commenced between France and Great Britain in 1755; and, in 1757, Wolfe was appointed quartermaster-general to the forces, under Sir John Mordaunt, intended to attack Rochefort. While the military and naval commanders of that mismanaged expedition were wasting time in idle controversy, Wolfe landed, one night, and advanced two miles into the country. His report of the absence of any obstacles to a descent, and his urgent recommendations that it should be made, were disregarded; but they became known to the great Pitt, and were the main reason for his afterwards selecting Wolfe to command in Canada.\n\nIn 1758, Wolfe was sent, with the rank of brigadier-general, on the expedition against Cape Breton, in which Boseawen commanded the sea, and Amherst the land forces. The brunt of the French fire in landing before Louisbourg was borne by the left division under Wolfe, the attacks by the centre and right divisions\nbeing mere feints to distract the enemy. The subsequent operations of the siege were also, in a great measure, conducted by Wolfe; and it was an honorable trait in the character of Amherst, that, in his dispatches, he allowed his brigadier the full credit of the action. The landing was effected on the 8th of June; Louisbourg surrendered on the 26th of July. Wolfe soon afterwards returned to England.\n\nIn 1759, the memorable expedition which afterwards shed such lustre on the British arms, was fitted out against Quebec by Pitt, who had resolved to deprive the French crown of its most important settlements in America. The command of the sea forces was entrusted to Saunders; the command of the land forces (7,000 men including provincials), to Wolfe. The expedition arrived at the Isle of Orleans on the 26th of June; the fort of Niagara had been surrendered to the English under Amherst the day before. In August Wolfe issued a proclamation to the Canadian peasants, informing them that the forces were masters of the river; while a powerful army, under General Amherst, threatened their country from the interior; calling upon them to observe a strict neutrality during the struggle between the French and English crowns, and promising to protect them in their possessions and in the exercise of their religion. These promises he most faithfully kept. Montcalm had concentrated all the forces he could raise in the province of Quebec, and had completed his fortifications in a masterly manner. The months of July and August were spent in repeated unsuccessful attempts to drive the French from their advantageous post at the Falls of Montmorenci; and here the English suffered a repulse, on attempting to effect a landing in the vicinity.\n\nOn the night between the 12th and 13th of September, 1759, Wolfe landed his troops immediately above Quebec, and, favored by the night, ascended the steep acclivities to the Plains of Abraham, which command that city from the west. Montcalm, when he learned that the English were in possession of these heights, saw at once that nothing but a battle could save the city; and he took his measures accordingly. The battle was strenuously contested, but the French at length gave way. The carnage was frightful; both sides suffered severely; but, from all accounts, we believe the French most; this is attributed to some negligence of the French officers, and to the feebleness of their men, who had long suffered from want. Indeed, the French government never took much pains to retain so valuable a dependency. They never knew how precious Canada really was, until they lost it. But to return to the fight. Both Montcalm and Wolfe fell in the action, and their seconds in command were both dangerously wounded, and were obliged to leave the field before the fate of the day was decided. Montcalm lingered for a day or\ntwo; but the young, gallant and intrepid Wolfe, expired almost immediately. Tradition and history have it, that, while he lay wounded on the field of battle, the cry, \"They run!\" arose along the line. As he was raised from the ground he asked, \"Who run?\" \"The French,\" was the reply. He seemed to feel satisfied; he had accomplished the purpose for which he had been sent. \"The French!\" (then he added) \"I die happy!\" And falling down, he instantly expired.\n\nFive days after the action, Quebec capitulated, and Canada was forever lost to France.\n\nThe feature of Wolfe's character most dwelt upon by his contemporaries, was his ardent and fearless spirit of enterprise. His skill as a disciplinarian, however, the pains he took to ascertain the real state of affairs at Rochefort, and the arguments by which he supported the proposal of a descent\u2014and, above all, his letter addressed to the prime minister from his head quarters at Montmorenci, on the 2nd of September\u2014show that this quality was combined with an observant and deliberate mind. Enterprise was with Wolfe the result of perfect and laboriously attained knowledge of his position.\n\nIt is to be regretted that the correspondence of Wolfe, which is known to exist, has not been given to the world. It would be instructive to military men; for his character as a soldier was almost perfect, though the field in which his talents were developed was a narrow one. The task of writing his life was undertaken by Southey, and afterwards by Gleig; but relinquished by both from unexplained difficulties which intervened. Michaud, jeune, is in error when he says, in the \"Biographie Universelle,\" that the \"Life and Correspondence of Wolfe\" was published at London in 1827; it was only announced. The author of the article, \"Wolfe, James,\" in the \"Encyclopedia Americana,\" has, without acknowledgment, copied Michaud's sketch, and has retained this mistake with others. The only correct materials for the Life of Wolfe are contained in the first three volumes of the \"Annual Register,\" (edited by Burke), in a very shallow \"Life of General James Wolfe,\"\u2014\"attempted according to the rules of eloquence,\"\u2014by a writer who designates himself \"J. P.,\" published in 1760; and in a work published at Montreal a short time since, by John Lovell, and written by Mr. Andrew Bell.\n\nThe death of Wolfe made a deep impression in England. The most touching instance is mentioned by Burke. A little circumstance was talked of that time, and it deserves to be recorded, as it shows a fineness of sentiment and a justness of thinking in the lower kind of people, which is rarely met with even amongst persons of education. The mother of General Wolfe was an object marked out for pity by great and peculiar distress; the public wound pierced her mind with a peculiar affliction, for she had in him\nexperienced the dutifull son, the amiable domestic character; whilst\nthe world admired the accomplished officer. Within a few months\nshe had lost her husband; she now lost her son, her only child.\nThe populace of the village, where she lived, unanimously agreed\nto admit of no illuminations or fireworks, or any other sign of\nrejoicing whatever, near her house; lest they should seem, by an\nill-timed triumph, to exult over her grief. There was a justness\nin this; and whoever knows the people, knows that they made no\nsmall sacrifice on this occasion. But in mostly all other parts of\nthe United Kingdom great rejoicings took place at the fall of\nQuebec, saddened though they were by the death of the conqueror.\n\nJames Wolfe fell in his thirty-fourth year. His remains were\nconveyed to England, and interred at Greenwich. A monument\nwas erected to his memory, in 1760, by the gentlemen of his native\nparish; a public monument in Westminster Abbey was voted by\nthe House of Commons, and opened to the public in 1759,* a\nmarble statue was voted by the Assembly of Massachusetts; a\nmonument was erected by the Province of Lower Canada on the\nspot where he fell on the Plains of Abraham; and, on its decay,\nanother (still standing) was raised by Sir B. D'Urban, the then\ncommander-in-chief of the forces in Canada, and other military\nofficers in the colony.\n\nPONTIAC.\n\nPontiac, a celebrated chief of the Ottawa tribe of Indians,\nwho, removing from the valley of the great river of that name,\nsettled near Michilimackinac. An ally of the French, he resisted\n\n*In this the major-general is represented as endeavoring to close, with his\nhand, the wound made in his breast, while he is supported by a grenadier. An\nangel is seen in the clouds, holding a wreath ready to crown the expiring hero.\nOn the pyramid is represented, in relief, the faithful Highland sergeant who\nattended him; and his sorrow at witnessing the agonies of his dying master\nis so pathetically expressed, that a spectator can scarcely view the sculpture\nunmoved. In the front, in alto-relief, is depicted the landing at Quebec, with a\nview of the precipices which the troops had to ascend before the enemy could be\nattacked. The inscription is as follows:\u2014\n\n\"To the memory of James Wolfe, Major-General and Commander-in-Chief of\nthe British Land Forces on an expedition against Quebec, who, after surmounting,\nby ability and valour, all obstacles of art and nature, was slain in the moment\nof victory, on the 13th of September, 1759, the King and the Parliament of\nGreat Britain dedicate this monument.\"\nthe efforts of the English to gain possession of their forts, after the fall of Quebec in 1759-60. In June, 1763, he matured a bold and comprehensive plan for the extinction of English power, by the simultaneous capture of the extensive chain of forts reaching from lake Michigan to the Niagara. Nine forts were attacked on the same day, and their garrisons either massacred or dispersed. Detroit was besieged by Pontiac himself; but the attack failed, an Indian woman having discovered the plot and revealed it. The siege was, nevertheless, maintained for nearly twelve months, until the garrison was relieved by Colonel Bradstreet. Niagara was not attacked, and Pittsburg was saved by Colonel Boquet. Pontiac afterwards professed friendship for the English; but an English spy having discovered in a speech symptoms of treachery, stabbed him to the heart and fled. His loss was greatly deplored, for he was a man of singular sagacity, daring courage, and statesmanlike views. The county of Pontiac in Lower Canada is called after this renowned chief.\n\n---\n\n**Admiral Sir Charles Saunders, K.B.**\n\nThis distinguished naval officer, whose name is allied with that of the ever glorious Wolfe, in the memorable undertaking of the siege of Quebec, as the commander of the squadron destined to act in connection with that of the army, was descended from a good Scottish family; and being destined both by nature and fortune for the sea, he early entered into the navy of his country. He fought his way onward nobly, mastering every difficulty, surmounting all obstacles, until he finally rose to the highest honors in the service. He was one of the most gallant, intrepid and brave officers in his Majesty's navy, a fact which is verified by his being one of Lord Anson's lieutenants, and taking part with that highly distinguished nobleman in many of his most daring and distinguished actions. Sir Charles was celebrated for his great bravery and for his gallant defense of the Yarmouth, while in her command in 1747. This it was that gave him his well-earned reputation, and ensured the command of the brilliant fleet destined for the capture of Quebec in 1759. It was one of the finest armaments ever fitted out in England, and well able to cope with the dangerous service in which it was employed. It rendered the greatest assistance to Wolfe in his undertaking,\u2014bombarded the\ntown and nearly shattered it to pieces. Every one must admire the remarkable skill of the admiral as he combatted with the numerous dangers which French ingenuity set forth,\u2014particularly when the fire-ships were dispatched to destroy his fleet. All must award to him the merit of being one of the most devoted and loyal servants of his king. Happily his services met with their reward. His Majesty, in the following year, appointed him Lieutenant-General of Marines; in 1765, a Lord of the Admiralty, and in 1766, First Lord of the Admiralty. He was also returned to Parliament. His death occurred in December, 1775.\n\nBOURLAMAQUE.\n\nA Brigadier-General of Montcalm, and a most chivalrous soldier. He came to Canada as colonel of engineers. He commanded the left wing of the army at Carillon, (where he was wounded), as well as at Montmorenci, the Plains of Abraham and at St. Foy. He afterwards was elevated to the governorship of Guadeloupe, where he died.\n\nMAJOR-GENERAL BRADDOCK.\n\nEdward Braddock, a brave and able, but unfortunate officer, who was commander-in-chief of the British army in America in 1755. The disastrous event which has made his name memorable in history, was owing to his contempt of the enemy, and his neglect to provide against surprise. Conducting in person the expedition against Fort Du Quesne, he was attacked on the 8th July, when about seven miles distant from the fort, by a concealed enemy, who fired upon him from the shelter of the tall grass and the surrounding trees. The attempt to rally the troops was fruitless. All his officers except, George Washington, fell. He himself received a mortal wound, and expired a few days after at Dunbar, forty miles distant from the field. The entire loss of the British was seven hundred men.\nJOSEPH FRANCIS LAFITAU.\n\nA celebrated French ecclesiastic and missionary, who was a native of Bordeaux, and was employed as a missionary among the savage Indian tribes in Canada and North America, during the French occupation of this country. On his return to Europe, he published a work entitled \"M\u0153urs des Sauvages Am\u00e9ricains compar\u00e9es aux M\u0153urs des premiers Temps;\" Paris, 1734: 4 vols. 4to. He died in 1740. His brother, Peter, also a Jesuit, became a celebrated man in his native country.\n\nADMIRAL CHARLES HOLMES,\n\nA brave and experienced naval commander, who fought many gallant battles, and served his country for a lengthened time before he gained a flag. In 1758, he displayed great skill, tact, shrewdness and courage, in forcing the French and Austrian garrison to abandon the city of Embden. For this he received many marks of royal favor, and in the next year, in conjunction with Sir Charles Saunders, was appointed to the command of the naval squadron destined for the capture of the ancient city of Quebec, in which he performed good service, and in 1760 was entrusted with the command of the station at Jamaica, where he died in 1761.\n\nBOUGAINVILLE.\n\nLouis Antoine Bougainville, a French navigator, distinguished for his maritime discoveries. He was born at Paris in 1729. He studied at the university with a view to practising at\nthe bar, and was admitted a counsellor of the Parliament of Paris. He paid particular attention to the study of mathematics, and in 1752 he published \"Trait\u00e9 du Calcul Int\u00e9gral, pour servir de suite \u00e0 l'Analyse des Infiniments Petits;\" 2 vols. 4to. In 1753, he entered as an adjutant in the provincial battalion of Picardy, and he became aide-de-camp to General Chevert, who commanded the camp of Sarre-Louis in 1754. He then went to London as Secretary of Embassy, and was made a Fellow of the Royal Society. On his return he rejoined Chevert, and afterwards served in this country under the Marquis de Montcalm. He was sent to France, in 1756, to demand reinforcements for the defence of the colony, and he returned to Canada in 1759, having received the rank of colonel, and the decoration of Knight of St. Louis. At the capture of Quebec he distinguished himself to a great extent, and afterwards returned home, and in 1761 he was employed in Germany as aide-de-camp to M. de Choiseul Stainville. Peace taking place, he engaged in the naval service. In 1763, he was employed to make a settlement at the Malouine Islands, but this project was frustrated in consequence of their being claimed by the Spaniards; Bougainville was therefore charged with the duty of restoring them to Spain, for which purpose he sailed with a small fleet from St. Malo, November 15, 1766. Having executed his mission, he sailed into the south seas, and visited the Society Islands, the New Hebrides, New Guinea, and other places; and he returned to St. Malo, March 16, 1769, having enriched geography with a great number of discoveries. His relation of his voyage round the world was published in 1771. He commanded with distinction ships of the line in the American war; in 1779, he was made a commodore, and the following year he obtained further promotion. He was employed to allay the disturbances at Brest in 1790, but his services on that occasion were ineffectual. At length he retired from professional employment, after having served his country in the army and navy with great reputation, during more than forty years. In 1796 he was elected a member of the geographical section of the Institute, and afterwards a member of the Bureau des Longitudes. He was made a senator on the creation of that body by the state. His death took place August 31, 1811. Commersau, who accompanied him in his voyage round the world as botanist, gave his name to a new genus of plants, Buganvillaea, of the family of nyctogena, or night-blowing flowers.\nSIR JAMES DOUGLAS, BART.,\n\nA celebrated naval commander, who took part in the first battle of Quebec, was deputed to convey the news of the surrender of that city to the king, and on that occasion his Majesty knighted him for the welcome news. Douglas commanded the fleet at the Leeward Islands in 1761; had a broad pendant at the siege of Martinico in 1762; was created a baronet for his eminent services in June, 1786; and died in 1787.\n\nMAJOR-GENERAL BRADSTREET.\n\nJohn Bradstreet, a major-general in the British army, who fought in this country and distinguished himself as a brave and gallant officer in the first American war, was in 1746 Lieutenant-Governor of St. John's, Newfoundland. He was afterwards distinguished for his military services. It was thought of the highest importance, in the year 1756, to keep open the communication with Fort Oswego on Lake Ontario. General Shirley accordingly enlisted forty companies of boatmen, each consisting of fifty men, for transporting stores to the fort from Schenectady, and placed them under the command of Bradstreet, who was an active and vigilant officer, and incurred to the hardships to which the service exposed him. In the beginning of the spring of this year, a small stockaded post, with twenty-five men at the carrying place, was cut off. It became necessary to pass through the country with large squadrons of boats, as the enemy infested the passage through the Onondaga river. On his return from Oswego, July 3, 1756, Colonel Bradstreet, who was apprehensive of being ambushed, ordered the several divisions to proceed as near each other as possible. He was at the head of about three hundred boatmen in the first division, when, at a distance of nine miles from the port, the enemy rose from their ambuscade and attacked them. He instantly landed upon a small island, and with but six men, maintained his position until he was reinforced. A general engagement ensued, in which Bradstreet with gallantry rushed upon a more\nnumerous enemy and entirely routed them, killing and wounding about two hundred men; his own loss was about thirty. In the year 1758 he was entrusted with the command of three thousand men, on an expedition against Fort Frontenac, which was planned by himself. He embarked at Oswego, on Lake Ontario, and on the evening of August 25th, landed within a mile of the fort. On the 27th it was surrendered to him. Forty pieces of cannon, and a vast quantity of provisions and merchandise, with one hundred and ten prisoners, fell into his hands. The fort and nine armed vessels, and such stores as could not be removed, were destroyed. In August, 1764, he advanced with a considerable force towards the Indian country, and at Presque Isle compelled the Delawares, Shawnee, and other Indians, to accept terms of peace. He was appointed major-general May 26, 1772. After rendering important services to this country, he died at New York, October 21, 1774.\n\nMAJOR-GENERAL PRIDEAUX.\n\nMost of our readers are no doubt aware that when the campaign of 1759 was resolved on by the great statesman, Pitt, four general officers were selected by him to attack the country at four separate parts. Amherst was to have the general command, and assault Montreal by way of Lake Champlain and the Richelieu; Wolfe was destined to enter by the broad St. Lawrence, and take Quebec; Stanwix to conquer the French posts between Pittsburgh and Lake Erie; and to Prideaux was entrusted the important command to reduce Fort Niagara, then one of the most formidable in the country. In selecting these four officers, nearly all of a young age, Pitt was actuated by no influence or feeling except his deep sense of the fitness, ability and merit of each for the command and service entrusted to them; and he was not wrong in his calculation, as history assures us: each proved himself well worthy of the confidence that extraordinary man placed in them. But, sad to relate, Wolfe, although having achieved a brilliant conquest, expired in the moment of victory, and did not live to receive the honors that would have been awarded him by a grateful king and country, had he returned to England. Unhappily, such was also the fate of the brave and gallant Prideaux, a young and distinguished officer, having been born in the year 1718, and descended from an old and time-honored family of the county of Devon,\nEngland. His career was excessively brilliant. He early entered the army, and served with the 1st Regiment of Foot Guards (now Grenadier Guards), and was present at the battle of Dettingen. His bravery, skill and ingenuity, were of such an elevating character that he speedily attained the high rank he held at his death, and was colonel of the 55th Regiment.\n\nWhen the expedition to capture Canada was decided on, he had risen for one so young to such eminence in his profession that Pitt himself selected him as an officer to whom he could entrust the command of one division of the army, for the purpose before mentioned.\n\nThe campaign was opened by General Prideaux's movement on Niagara. This fortress, situated at the mouth of the river of that name, as we mentioned before, was one of the strongest the French possessed, and was commanded by M. Pouchet, who had a superior force within, but not sufficient to meet those of Prideaux.\n\nThe British army effected a landing on the 7th July, notwithstanding the harassing fire of the enemy, and at once summoned Pouchet to surrender, which he refused, having secretly sent for reinforcements to Frontenac and Detroit previously. Nothing remained for the young general but to compel him to do so by all means in his power, and he opened a tremendous fire with his artillery against the fort. On the 11th he defeated a sortie, and on the 19th, when the aid arrived from Frontenac, compelled the schooner which carried it to remain out on the lake, for fear of his artillery. He had planned a form of operations, and was busily carrying a portion of them out, on the evening of the 19th, in the trenches, when he was killed by the bursting of a cannon,\u2014the command falling on Sir William Johnson, the second in command, who subsequently carried the fort, following out the operations laid down by his predecessor.\n\nBy the death of this brave and distinguished officer, the king lost one of his best subjects, and the country one of its ablest soldiers and defenders. His premature loss inflicted a heavy blow on those whom he left behind him; as, independently of his high military character, he was a person of eminent merit both in his social as well as his professional life, and his family were bereaved of a parent before his children could well appreciate the severity of their loss.\n\nHe had married Elizabeth, daughter of Colonel Rolt, and sister of Sir Edward Bayntum Rolt, Bart., R.N., by whom he had three sons and one daughter.\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL STANWIX.\n\nJohn Stanwix, one of the general officers selected by Pitt to accompany the expedition for the capture of Canada, in 1759.\n\nHe had entered the army in 1706, and served in it thirty-nine years before he obtained the rank of lieutenant-colonel. He had been deputy quartermaster-general; and, just prior to his proceeding to America, had been made major-general. To him was entrusted the conquest of the French posts from Pittsburg to Lake Erie, in which he greatly distinguished himself; so much so, indeed, that in 1761 he was appointed a lieutenant-general, and became colonel of the king's regiment. He was also returned to Parliament. He unfortunately lost his life in 1766, on his passage from Ireland to England, and was deeply regretted by his many friends in and out of the army.\n\nLORD VISCOUNT HOWE.\n\nIn writing the present work on the lives of the celebrated men who have at any time been connected with Canada, we would be doing a grievous wrong and infringing the object and rules of the work, were we to neglect to insert a notice of the above brave, intrepid and distinguished officer, who gave up his life's blood to conquer this colony, and preserve it to the king whom he served so nobly and so constantly, and who, in point of youth and ability in the expedition, was second only to the immortal Wolfe.\n\nGeorge Augustus Viscount Howe was the eldest son of Sir E. Scrope, the second Viscount, and of Sophia Charlotte, daughter of the Hanoverian Baron of Kielmansegge, and Master of the Horse to George I. He early entered into the military service, and speedily rose to distinction. On the several expeditions sent out to America with the object of conquering Canada from the French, Lord Howe was selected to command one of the divisions, and he accordingly accompanied them out, and for some time, in 1757, commanded at Halifax; but on Abercrombie being so injudiciously appointed to the commandership-in-chief, Howe was attached to his army in command of a party, and would, no doubt,\nspeedily have risen to the highest honors which his king and his country could have bestowed upon him (having already displayed great courage, skill and efficiency in the dangerous service in which he was employed), had not cruel fate ordained otherwise. On the 5th July, 1758, the rash Abercrombie determined on assaulting and taking Fort Ticonderago\u2014a post well armed, and with a superior force within it; but his ambition was roused, and not heeding the wise counsels of his aids, persisted in his obstinate course. He failed, and miserably so, and by his failure entailed a heavy loss in his ranks; besides, the brave, intrepid and youthful Howe had fallen, whilst doing his utmost to carry out the wishes of his commanding officer. The grief of all for this young officer's loss was inconsolable, and not a few of those whom he had commanded shed bitter and sad tears over his early bier, to think if he had lived what he would have been; his talents were of such a high character, and his services were held in such grateful remembrance, that monuments were erected on the place where he had so gallantly fallen, and in Westminster Abbey, by the State of Massachusetts.\n\nMARQUIS TOWNSHEND.\n\nField-Marshal, the Right Honorable the Most Noble, the Marquis Townshend, was a distinguished nobleman, upon whom fell the command of the army on the fall of Wolfe, was the eldest son of the third Viscount Townshend, whom he succeeded as fourth Viscount, in May, 1767. He was born on the 28th of February, 1724, and was godson to King George I.\n\nHe entered the army at an early age, and served and fought under George II. at the battles of Dettingen, Fontenoy, Culloden, and Laffeldt; and when the expedition to Canada under Wolfe was named, he was appointed to command a division. After the first battle of Abraham's Plains and the death of Wolfe, he took command of the army, and saw it safely within the walls of Quebec, and chiefly promoted the capitulation of De Ramsay. He then returned to England, and left the command in the able hands of General Murray. He afterwards attained the rank of a field-marshal and colonel of the second regiment of Dragoon Guards; was also a privy councillor, high steward of Tamworth, Yarmouth and Norwich, governor of Jersey, and master-general of\nthe Ordnance. He also administered the government of Ireland as lord-lieutenant, in 1767.\n\nHis lordship married twice; firstly in 1751, to Lady Charlotte Compton, only surviving daughter of the Earl of Northampton. Her ladyship died in 1770; secondly, in 1773, Anne, daughter and co-heir of Sir William Montgomery, Baronet, by both of whom he had a numerous family. His demise took place on the 14th of September, 1807.\n\n---\n\n**HON. ROBERT MONCKTON.**\n\nLieutenant-General the Honorable Robert Monckton, a brave and distinguished general, who led one of the divisions, and was wounded at the battle of the Plains of Abraham in 1759; upon him the command should have fallen when General Townshend proceeded to England, had it not been for his wound, and his having to go to New York to a more genial climate. He was the second son of the first Viscount Galway, by Elizabeth, daughter of John, second Duke of Rutland.\n\nGeneral Monckton did not return to Canada, but became governor and commander-in-chief of New York, and subsequently governor of Berwick and Holy Island. His demise occurred on the 3rd of May, 1782.\n\n---\n\n**HON. JAMES MURRAY.**\n\nOf all the men who have served and fought for Canada, no one deserves more highly to be remembered, or is more entitled to our esteem and gratitude than the brave and valorous general, whose name graces the head of this notice. But for him and his judicious, manly and exemplary conduct, Great Britain would not so easily have obtained possession of Canada.\n\nGeneral Murray was a son of the fourth Lord Elibank. He early entered into the service of his country, and served for some\ntime on the continent of Europe. On the expedition being fitted out for the conquest of Canada, he was included in it, and led a brigade at the battle of the Plains of Abraham, and the siege of Quebec. In this high position he did much to contribute to the brilliant victory which the British arms achieved. On the taking of Quebec, Wolfe being dead, Monckton wounded, and the Marquis Townshend having to depart for England, the command of the city and forces was judiciously intrusted to General Murray. He accordingly assumed the charge, and at once did everything which he possibly could for the defence of the city against the anticipated attack of General De L\u00e9vis. Twelve redoubts and outposts were erected around Quebec, and he laid in an ample supply of provisions for the ensuing winter. These were all wise and prudent measures, and were no mean proof of the skill and foresight of the general. Indeed, it required all his vigilance to preserve the city. The first days of spring brought De L\u00e9vis and his army, consisting of twelve thousand men, while that of Murray amounted only to three thousand five hundred, two-thirds of whom had been enfeebled with disease. Nevertheless, his gallant and chivalrous spirit did not shrink from encountering such a superior force, and on the 28th of April, he sallied bravely forth from the gates and ancient battlements of Quebec to offer the enemy battle. De L\u00e9vis was encamped and taken by surprise, but he speedily formed his men in column, and a general battle took place, now known as the \"Second Battle of Quebec.\" This contest was even more fiercely maintained than the first, and the raking fire kept up by the superior force of the French army under the able leadership of De L\u00e9vis, produced such telling effect, that Murray ordered a retreat, carrying with him all his wounded, to the number of seven hundred, but leaving his guns behind. He has been much condemned for sacrificing his men, and attacking such a large and superior force, and has therefore been designated \"rash\" and \"hot-headed\"; but whoever surveys that record of our history calmly and dispassionately, cannot but admire the man and his brave and intrepid conduct. He did his duty, and performed it better than could have been expected; for he left eighteen hundred of the enemy dead on the field, and only lost about three hundred of his own men, his coolness and self-possession having much intimidated the French. Now, however, he had a greater care entrusted to him, the number of wounded, and the defence of the city, with a small and decreased force within the walls, and an overwhelming one without, battering away at the devoted walls of the ancient city to compel him to capitulate. Yet he lost not his self-possession, but, as gallantly and devotedly as before, took all measures and precautions to secure the city; that was now his sole thought\u2014that his sole object; and his efforts were crowned with success. Aid arrived from England, and the French were compelled to beat a\nprecipitate retreat, while the gallant Murray still held Quebec. On the 14th of June he left that city and proceeded to Montreal, there to join Lord Amherst with the main army, and to force the remnant of the French to capitulate, and thus sever the connection of France with Canada forever. They succeeded, and the French forces were allowed to march out with all the honors of war.\n\nShortly after Murray's return to Quebec, he was appointed the first governor-general of the province, and he continued in this high office till 1767. During his administration, the form of government and the laws to be observed in the new colony were promulgated; the many evils that arose therefrom caused much dissatisfaction among the French people, and Governor Murray did all in his power to alleviate the discontented feeling, but with only partial success. Nevertheless, he won the good will and esteem of the whole French race in Canada, and lost that of a part of his countrymen, because he would not conform to their prejudices against the poor natives and those of French origin. He left for England on leave of absence; but when he arrived there he was appointed to a much better field for his talents and abilities, and he accordingly resigned his connection with Canada.\n\nGeneral Murray was subsequently distinguished for his gallant, though unsuccessful defence of Minorca, in 1781, against the Duke de Crillon, at the head of a large Spanish and French force. De Crillon, despairing of success, endeavored to corrupt the gallant Scott, and offered him the sum of one million sterling for the surrender of the fortress. Indignant at the attempt, General Murray immediately addressed the following letter to the duke:\n\n\"FORT ST. PHILLIP, 16th October, 1781.\n\n\"When your brave ancestor was desired by his sovereign to assassinate the Duke de Guise, he returned the answer which you should have thought of when you attempted to assassinate the character of a man whose birth is as illustrious as your own, or that of the Duke de Guise. I can have no further communication with you but in arms. If you have any humanity, pray send clothing for your unfortunate prisoners in my possession; leave it at a distance to be taken up for them, because I will admit of no contact for the future, but such as is hostile to the most inveterate degree.\"\n\nTo this the Duke replied:\n\n\"Your letter restores each of us to our places; it confirms in me the high opinion which I have always had of you. I accept your last proposal with pleasure.\"\n\nIn June, 1794, he ended a long and honorable career in the service of his country, in which he had risen to much distinction; but perhaps not more than his services, high talents and abilities deserved. As a soldier he stood foremost in the army, and had\nwon his way by his own merit and his own good sword, owing nothing to influence. As a genuine Christian officer, he was esteemed by all good men, and ever distinguished for his humanity and readiness to relieve the oppressed.\n\nA singular incident is related by Haydyn, in his \"Book of Dignities,\" concerning this good and honorable man. He says that after his death, on his corpse being opened for the purpose of being embalmed, many bullets, by which he had been wounded both in Germany and America, were extracted. His remains were privately interred in Westminster Abbey.\n\nGENERAL THOMAS GAGE.\n\nThe last appointed Governor of Massachusetts by the king. He accompanied General Braddock to America, and was present when that officer was killed. In 1760 he was made Governor of Montreal, and in 1763 was appointed commander-in-chief of the British forces in North America, in succession to General Amherst. In 1774 he was appointed Governor of Massachusetts, in which office he rendered himself very obnoxious to the people by his arbitrary proceedings; and in the following year the Provincial Congress disqualified him from serving as governor. Soon after he returned to England, where he died in 1787.\n\nDUC DE L\u00c9VIS.\n\nMarshal Duc de L\u00e9vis, although only \"Chevalier de L\u00e9vis\" during the time he fought under Montcalm in this country, held the rank of second in command. He was a most brave and chivalrous general, whom Garneau declares superior in many respects to Montcalm; born in 1720, at the Chateau d'Anjou en Languedoc, the same birthplace as Levy de Ventadour, who was Viceroy of New France in 1625. He had early adopted the glorious profession, to which he was an honor and a credit; he energetically mastered\nAND PERSONS CONNECTED WITH CANADA.\n\nevery difficulty that lay in his way, or obstructed the fulfilment of his desire to become a perfect soldier; and the result showed how well he had accomplished the task which he had imposed on himself. He took part at the battle of Carillon, where he commanded the right division; as also at Montmorenci, where the French repulsed Wolfe in his endeavor to gain the fortified camp that covered Quebec. He was, however, absent at Montreal, when the first battle of Quebec was fought; and therefore, when Montcalm fell, could not take the command. This was an unfortunate circumstance for the French, as they had no one in whom they could place so much confidence as in their recognized leader, De L\u00e9vis; the army, consequently, fell into confusion, and the English gained the victory. At the second battle of Quebec,* which took place near St. Foy, and where he had gathered the remnant of the French army with the ostensible purpose of wresting Quebec from Murray's hands, he commanded, and achieved a victory over Murray; but this so-called victory was not so complete as to prevent the latter from still holding the city. De L\u00e9vis, elated by his success, still kept near Quebec until spring, when, on reinforcements arriving from England, he had to beat a hasty retreat to Montreal; and even there he would have held out against the English until the very last, had not De Vaudreuil wisely capitulated. He returned to France, and again sought active service. In 1762 we find him at the battle of Johannissbourg, where the Prince of Cond\u00e9 obtained a signal victory over the forces of Prince Ferdinand. In 1783, the government of Artois, as a reward for his services, created him a French Marshal, and in the next year, a Duke and Peer of France. He died in 1787, whilst endeavoring to uphold the State of Arras.\n\nGENERAL SIMON FRASER,\n\nBetter known in Canada as Colonel Fraser of Fraser's Highlanders, was the son of the celebrated thirteenth Lord Lovat, who was beheaded at Tower Hill, in 1747, for his participation in the Scotch rising of 1745. General Fraser, in his earlier days, had been himself an adherent of Charles Edward; but subsequently obtaining a free pardon, and the seventy-eighth regiment, or Fraser's Highlanders having been formed of the Scottish clans, he joined\n\n*A very handsome monument has been erected at St. Foy, principally through the efforts of Dr. P. M. Bardy, Quebec, to commemorate this battle.\nthem as their lieutenant-colonel, bringing with him into the regiment seven hundred of his clan. They served at Louisbourg, and at Montmorenci and the Plains, where their bravery and gallantry were conspicuous; indeed, the victory achieved by England on the Plains of Abraham was not a little owing to the hardy Highland regiments led on by Colonel Fraser. In 1762 they were engaged in the defence of Portugal, where they gained fresh honors. In 1782 the General died, having attained the high rank he held, and distinguished himself as a brave and gallant officer.\n\nHON. CHIEF-JUSTICE GREGORY.\n\nWilliam Gregory was the first chief-justice of the province of Quebec. Little or nothing is known of him; whether he came from the English colonies or England, we are unable to tell. His commission bears date 24th August, 1764; and Smith, in his History of Canada, says he was recalled during the year by order of General Murray. There was a William Gregory in 1775, an associate judge for the Superior Court in South Carolina, under the royal government, and it is likely that he was the same individual. He was succeeded here in the chief-justiceship by William Hey, September 25th, 1766.\n\nBARON MESERES.\n\nThis literary veteran was born in London, 15th December, 1731, of a family originally French, but settled there on the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. His grandfather was one of five brothers, who were unequally divided, when the call was made on them for an avowal of their religious principles, three of them adhering to the Protestant faith, the other two, the head of the family and the physician, quitting it for the doctrines established by law: and what is remarkable, the three who thus distinguished themselves were officers in the French king's service. The baron's\ngrandfather was well received by William the Third, served under him in Ireland, and was employed by him in important services in Portugal; but he attained no higher rank than that of colonel. His father was a physician in Broad-street, Soho, London, which residence he quitted for one in Rathbone-place, occupied by his widow after his decease, then by his son John, at whose death it came into the possession of the baron, who out of term time used to dine, though he never slept there. He received his education at Kingston-upon-Thames, under the Rev. Mr. Wooddeson, after which he became a member of Clare Hall, Cambridge, where he took his degrees of B.A. in 1752, and M.A. 1755.\n\nIn 1752 he obtained the first classical medal at the first institution by the Duke of Newcastle, then Chancellor of the University, which he received from the Chancellor in person; the second being conferred on Porteus, then of Christ's, afterwards Esquire Bedell of the University, and Bishop of London.\n\nWhile fellow of his college in 1758, he published \"A Dissertation on the Negative Sign in Algebra; containing a Demonstration of the Rules concerning it:\" the design of which is, to remove the difficulties that deter beginners in Algebra in the use of this sign which is considered by the baron in no other light than as the mark of the subtraction of a lesser number from a greater. Hence he denied the propriety of such expressions as negative roots, impossible roots, generation of equations, &c., &c., and would never read those works in which they were introduced. The celebrated Dr. Waring found him tenacious on this point; for having presented to him his \"Miscellanea Analytica,\" and called on him at a suitable time afterwards, he found that the baron had not got to the second page of his work. The difficulty of understanding it was stated as the excuse, and the doctor attempting to remove it, was stopped by the simple remark, that in the first page an expression occurred, implying that the greater number should be taken from the less. This was assented to by the doctor, and the baron not allowing that such a process could ever take place, there was an end to all further discussion. The first part of the work contains the Demonstrations of the several operations of Addition, &c., in the way of using the negative sign; the second part, the doctrine of quadratic and cubic equations.\n\nFrom the University Mr. Mascres removed to the Temple, where, in due course, he was called to the bar, and went the Western Circuit with little success. His first appointment was that of Attorney-General of Quebec, where he distinguished himself by his loyalty during the American contest, and his zeal for the interests of the province. On his return to England he was made Cursitor Baron of the Exchequer, in August 1773, which office he filled with great reputation till his death. He was also on his return from Quebec, agent to the Protestant settlers there, in which ca-\npacity he wrote a letter to the Lord Mayor, expressing the sincere and hearty thanks of the settlers for the city's mark of their fraternal regard, testified towards them by their address to the king in their behalf, and requesting the Lord Mayor, &c., once more to exert themselves, in order to recover the civil and religious rights of a no inconsiderable number of honest and enterprising subjects of the crown, &c.\n\nIn 1779 the Recorder of London appointed Mr. Maseres his deputy, and in 1780 the Court of Common Council appointed him senior judge of the Sheriff's Court in the city of London; which office he resigned in 1822.\n\nIn 1784 he took an active part with Bishop Horsley and others in the contest in the Royal Society, occasioned by displacing Dr. Hutton.\n\nIn 1800, the baron published tracts on the Resolution of Affected Algebraic Equations, by Dr. Halley, Mr. Raphson, and Sir Isaac Newton. This volume also contains Col. Titu's arithmetical problem; and another solution, by Wm. Frend, M.A., Fellow of Jesus College; with the baron's observations on Mr. Raphson's method of solving affected equations of all degrees by approximation.\n\nIt was to the liberal and enlightened patronage of Baron Maseres that the public are indebted for the Rev. John Hellins' valuable translation of Donna Agnesi's \"Institutioni Analytiche.\" It had been translated many years before by the then late Professor Colson, the ingenious commentator on the Fluxions of Newton. Baron Maseres, who in early life had known Colson, and had reason to infer from his conversation that he had written a treatise on the higher geometry, which he had never published, was desirous of discovering this MS., and of giving it to the world. In his search he found, not the work he looked for, but Colson's translation just mentioned; and after removing some pecuniary difficulties, which without such generous assistance would probably have forever withheld it from the world, he obtained a copy of it, and put it into the hands of Mr. Hellins, who undertook to become its editor, and under whose inspection it was published in 3 vols., 4to. 1802.\n\nBesides the publications of the baron, noticed above, he is either the author or editor of the following:\n\n\"The Elements of Plane Trigonometry, with a Dissertation on the Nature and Use of Logarithms,\" 1760, 8vo. \"An Account of the proceedings of the British and other Protestant Inhabitants of the Province of Quebec, in order to obtain a House of Assembly,\" 1775, 8vo.\u2014\"The Canadian Freeholder, consisting of Dialogues between an Englishman and a Frenchman settled in Canada,\" 1779, 3 vols., 8vo.\u2014\"Montesquieu's View of the English Constitution translated with notes,\" 1781, 8vo.\u2014\"The Principles of the Doctrine of Life Annuities,\" 1783, 1 vol., 4to.\u2014\"The Moderate\nReformer; or a proposal to correct some abuses in the present establishment of the Church of England,\" 1791, 8vo.\u2014\"Enquiry into the extent of Power of Juries, on trials for Criminal Writings,\" 1792, 8vo.\u2014\"Scriptores Logarithmici,\" 1791-1807, 6 vols. 4to.\u2014\"James Bernoulli's Doctrine of Permutations and Combinations, with some other useful Mathematical Tracts,\" 1795, 8vo.\u2014\"Appendix to Frend's Principles of Algebra,\" 1799, 8vo.\u2014\"Historiae Anglicanae Monumenta,\" 4to.\u2014\"Occasional Essays on various subjects, chiefly Historical and Political,\" 1809, 8vo.\u2014\"May's History of the Parliament of England which began 3rd Nov. 1640, a new edition with a preface,\" 1813, 4to.\u2014\"Three Tracts published at Amsterdam in 1691, and two under the name of Letters of General Ludlow to Edmund Seymour, and other persons, a new edition, with a preface,\" 1813, 4to.\u2014\"The Irish Rebellion; or a History of the attempts of the Irish Papists to extirpate the Protestants, by Sir John Temple, a new edition with a preface,\" 1813, 4to.\u2014\"The Curse of Popery and Popish Pains to the Civil Government and Protestant Church of England;\" reprinted in 8vo., 1807. In 1820 he published a new edition of Dr. James Welwood's \"Memoirs of the most material Transactions in England, for 100 years preceding the Revolution in 1688,\" 8vo.\n\nIn 1815 he published a collection of \"Select Tracts relating to the Civil Wars in England, temp. Chas. I. and Cromwell's Usurpation,\" 2 vols. 8vo.\n\nThe baron also wrote numerous articles in the \"Philosophical Transactions,\" and in vol. II. of the \"Arch\u00e6ologia;\" \"View of the Ancient Constitution of the English Parliament;\" which produced some observations from Charles Mellish, Esq., F.S.A., in the same volume.\n\nFrom the above list of publications will be seen the general tenor of the baron's studies, in which he was assiduously engaged from the time that he left the University. His great work, the \"Scriptores Logarithmici,\" is of a nature from which no pecuniary advantage was to be expected, and his liberality in presenting a copy of it to various public bodies, and to individuals, was such, that he was very much out of pocket by the publication. But he never regarded expense either as to his own works or those which he patronised of others, and he was never wanting in assisting authors whose works he deemed worthy of being submitted to the press. In this case it was common with him to take upon himself the whole expense of printing and paper, leaving the author to repay him when it suited his convenience, or he gave him the printing and paper. In one case he advanced about fifteen hundred pounds, of which he did not receive a farthing in return for nearly twenty years. But perhaps there never was a man so little attentive to the accumulation of property, and yet at his death it was much greater than he himself was aware of. His only guide\nwas his banker's books, and after defraying the expenses of his chambers and his houses at Reigate and Rathbone-place, and the generally heavy article of printing and paper for himself and others, the surplus of his revenue was invested in the three per cents., without regard to price, and he thought nothing more of the matter.\n\nHis manner of life was uniform; a great part of the year was spent in chambers, dining in the Temple hall in term time, at his house in Rathbone-place out of term, and the remainder of the year he passed at Reigate, where he spent a good deal of his time, and generally had a friend or two with him. Some years anterior to this remarkable man's death, he vested money in the three per cents. in the names of the incumbents of four parishes adjoining Reigate, in trust, to pay half a guinea to the clergyman who should preach an afternoon sermon on Sundays, and if there was not a sermon, the half guinea for that day was to be applied by the trustees to the benefit of the poor of their own parishes. The occasion of his benefaction was this: the late vicar of Reigate kept a curate, and many inhabitants of that large parish wished to have a sermon on Sundays in the afternoon, there being many farmers whose servants could not attend church in the morning; they raised a subscription for the curate, who accordingly preached an afternoon sermon. The present vicar did not keep a curate, and claimed the benefit of the subscription; but the subscribers would not agree to his having it, and the afternoon service was discontinued. The trustees have had several opportunities of giving unclaimed half guineas to their poor. He kept a very hospitable table, at which most of the eminent mathematicians who visited the metropolis were at one time or other to be found. His great delight was to have three or four friends with him, where every subject of science, literature and common topics of the day was treated with the utmost freedom of discussion. When his faculties were in full vigor, his conversation was replete with anecdote and information. No one was better acquainted with the history of his country, from the invasion of Julius Caesar to the present age; and when this has been mentioned to him, he used frequently to attribute it to the task he set upon himself early in life, to read through with the utmost attention \"Rapin's History,\" and to make occasional use of the authorities referred to in that work. The period between the years 1640 and 1660 was particularly impressed on his memory, and when he began to complain of its failure, by referring back to any distant event, the power of it was seen in its fullest extent. In his latter days this was remarkably observed; for though passing events left no impression on his mind, so much so that in the evening he forgot that he had had a party at dinner, yet by leading his mind properly back to a distant period, it seemed to renew its pristine energy.\n\nIn his profession of the law the Baron did not make a great\nAND PERSONS CONNECTED WITH CANADA.\n\nfigure, and he used to relate with great good humour his want of success in the Western Circuit; but government was sensible of his services as attorney-general in Canada\u2014an office which he filled with great dignity, and in a manner highly beneficial to the province. He was rewarded by an appointment to the office of Cursitor Baron, more honorary than profitable, but as it made no great inroads on his time, and was occupied chiefly in a routine of technical details, he was more at leisure to pursue his favourite studies. Few, however, possessed in so high a degree a knowledge of the laws of England, considered as a science; and in questions of great moment the members of both houses have frequently availed themselves of his judgment and his superior information.\n\nIn politics he was a staunch Whig, bordering more on the Reformer than is supposed to be suited to the present principles of that party. For the constitution as settled at the revolution, and the principles which placed the present family on the throne, he was a strenuous advocate. But every thing that led to the domination of the mob, was his utmost abhorrence; and for this reason he looked with horror on the extravagances committed by the French in their revolutionary career. In all his views of reform, he respected the rights of the present generation, conceiving that, what it derived from its predecessors was not to be wantonly sacrificed for adventurers, and imaginary good to successors, and too frequently for immediate gain to those who could be considered in no other light than robbers and plunderers. The government by parliament, appeared to him in the highest degree favorable to sound liberty, but the innovation in the time of Henry VIII., in his estimation introducing sessions by propagations was an injudicious measure. He would have parliament meet on a fixed day, continuing to sit until all the business brought before it was finished, or it was dissolved by the Crown. And the elections for members of parliament were to be also on one fixed day, to be concluded in a few hours in that day, by the persons assembling for that purpose at a convenient distance from their habitations. The present confusion at elections seemed disposed only to promote the interest of agents, and ale-house-keepers, and to destroy the morals of the electors and the elected. So different were his feelings from those of the House of Commons in the case of libel, that he considered the courts of law as the only places in which it could be tried; that a member was responsible to the house only for the language he used within it; and he commissioned a common friend to express to Sir Francis Burdett his approbation of the pamphlet which occasioned his confinement in the Tower, and his sorrow for the measures which it had produced.\n\nHis moderate reform shews him not to be inimical to a church establishment, on which he was strenuous for one improvement, namely, that no clergyman should have more than one cure of souls;\nand he could scarcely be brought to believe, that a bishop could have placed a clergyman in possession of a living, to hold it till his own son was of age to take it, as he considered the preferments vested in them as sacred trusts to be administered with a view not to their private interest, but the advancement of pious and learned clergymen.\n\nWith the most liberal views of toleration on religious opinions, not excluding the deist or atheist from civil employments, the baron was an anti-catholic, and this sentiment he used to justify in few words. It is a tenet of the Roman Catholic religion to burn heretics; and they, who will not tolerate others, ought not to be allowed to possess civil employments, which may gradually give them an influence in the state. But his abhorrence of these intolerant sentiments, which he attributed to them, did not extend to the persons of the Romish persuasion: for his house was open to the refugees from France, where were to be seen archbishops and bishops, and numbers of distinguished clergymen, driven from their homes by the atheistical bigotry of the times. His purse and his house were open to them, and a member of the Parlement de Paris, who had been banished by Louis the Fifteenth with his brethren, for refusing to ratify the edict of that monarch, and who, notwithstanding, was one of the most zealous adherents to his successors, was one of his most intimate friends, and had the use at all times of his country house for himself and family.\n\nHis religious creed was contained in a very narrow compass, and his surviving friends will never forget the solemn manner in which he used very frequently to introduce it. \"There are three creeds,\" he would say, \"that are generally acknowledged by the Christian world, contradictory in several respects to each other, and two of them composed by nobody knows whom, and nobody knows where. My creed is derived from my Saviour, and the time when, and the manner in which it was uttered, gives it a title to pre-eminence. A few hours before his death, in an address to his Father, Christ says, this is eternal life, to know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent. This is my creed, and happy would it be for the Christian world if it had been content with it, and never laid down any other articles for a common faith. Hence, almost all the disputes which set Christians at variance with each other, and arise chiefly from scholastic terms, misunderstood and misapplied, he would confine to the closet of the learned, convinced that the Gospel was proclaimed to the poor originally, and was never intended for learned themes of discussion in the pulpit.\" Under the influence of this creed he was animated with a sincere piety towards his Maker, when he served as a kind and benevolent father, and with unfeigned charity for all his fellow creatures, whom he considered as equal objects of the love and care of the great Supreme.\nThe mathematical principles of Sir Isaac Newton were not to his taste, and he thought them very improper for academical studies. The positions of this great author, that quantities are some greater, and others less than nothing, and the ultimate equality of quantities, which in no one period of their existence are equal, appeared to him the acme of absurdity. To these he attributed the wildness that now prevails in what may be called the French school, which aims at generalizations, and, however advantageous it may sometimes be to the mere artisan, is very unfit to lead the mind to true science and philosophy. Huygens and Galileo were, in his opinion, better models for imitation, the one for purity of demonstration, the other for explaining philosophical subjects in a popular manner.\n\nThe classical studies of his early years continued to delight him to the latest period of his intellectual career, and he might be said to know Homer by heart; next to him, Lucan was his favorite author, and Horace was of course at his finger ends. Among the moderns, Milton held the highest place, and from the three poets, Homer, Lucan, and Milton, he to a very late period repeated long passages occasionally with the utmost propriety and emphasis. With the works of the philosopher of Malmesbury he was particularly conversant, and many of the reproaches on his memory he considered entirely without foundation. French was the language of his paternal roof, and he spoke it with the utmost fluency and propriety, but it was the French of the age of Louis XIV., not of modern times, and it was amusing to contrast his pronunciation with that of the refugees. He himself used to mimic with great success the Parisian dialect, which disfigures a language that in itself is meagre, and made worse by modern corruptions.\n\nBut of the intellectual attainments of the baron sufficient proofs are before the public; his private excellencies were confined to a much narrower circle, and the cheerfulness of his disposition, his inflexible integrity, the equanimity of his temper, his sincere piety, will long live in the memory of his surviving friends. Not a particle of pride entered into his composition, and a dogmatising spirit was his aversion. In this latter respect he was a complete contrast to the celebrated Dr. Johnson. Their common printer brought the two authors together to his house to spend the evening, when the doctor fulminated one of his severities against Hume and Voltaire, creating such a disgust in the baron's mind, that he declared he would never willingly be again in that man's company, and they never met afterwards. On the equanimity of his temper a celebrated chess-player used to say of the baron, who was very fond of that game, that he was the only person of his acquaintance, from whose countenance it could not be discovered whether he had won or lost the game.\n\nIn stature the baron was rather below the average height. His dress was uniformly plain and neat, and he retained to the last the\nthree-cornered hat, tye-wig, and ruffles, and his manners were in correspondence with those of a gentleman of the last age. At his table he always said grace with his hands clasped together, and a voice and countenance denoting thankfulness for all the blessings he received. The table-cloth was not removed, and on retiring to coffee, he in the same manner returned thanks to the great Supreme, of whom he never spoke but with the utmost reverence.\n\nHe died at his seat, Reigate, Surry, on the 19th of May, 1824.\n\nQuando ulium inveniam parem?\n\nCOLONEL DES BARRES.\n\nJoseph Frederic Wallet Des Barres, an English military officer and hydrographer, who served and was connected with America for a lengthened period. He was born in 1722, and was the descendant of the Protestant branch of a noble French family, which emigrated to England after the revocation of the edict of Nantes. He received his education under the Bernoullis, entered the royal military college at Woolwich, and was offered the choice of a commission either in the royal artillery or corps of engineers. Preferring immediate active service, he embarked in March, 1756, as lieutenant in the 60th Regiment of Foot, for America, where, having raised above three hundred recruits in Pennsylvania and Maryland, he was ordered to form and discipline them as a corps of field artillery, which he commanded until the arrival of one of the battalions of the royal train from England. In 1757, he commanded a detachment of volunteers against the Indians who had committed depredations in the neighborhood of Schenectady and other frontier towns, surprised the chiefs, whom he made prisoners, and soon after gained their confidence so completely, that they not only were restrained from further acts of hostility, but became useful to the army, in which a corps of them continued to be employed to the end of the war. In 1758 he was engaged in the expedition against Louisbourg, where he had the good fortune to effect a landing in a violent surf, and to take from the enemy an entrenchment, by which the debarkation of the army was greatly facilitated. At this siege he was on a critical occasion ordered to the duty of an engineer, and after the capitulation he employed himself in drawing a chart on a large scale, from papers and plans obtained there, which was found very\nuseful in the next spring, as the navigation of the river St. Lawrence was then known only to a few Canadian pilots. At the siege of Quebec he served under Wolfe as an aide-de-camp, and was making his report when that great hero received his mortal wound, and fell dying in his arms. By the sad havoc which was made in our army in the campaign of 1759 and the ensuing winter, and in the unsuccessful battle fought by General Murray, 28th April, 1760, it was reduced to two thousand men fit for duty. The fortifications of Quebec being in a dismantled state, the preservation of what had been acquired, as well as the expectation of future conquests, seemed to rest on the operations for its actual defence. The conducting of these operations fell to Des Barres as directing engineer, and here, and subsequently in the reduction of Fort Jacques Cartier and other strong places which completed the conquest of Canada, his endeavors proved highly successful. He afterwards proceeded to Nova Scotia to assist General Bastile in making designs and estimates for fortifying Halifax. In 1762, he served as directing engineer and quarter-master-general in the expedition for retaking Newfoundland, and was honored with public thanks, as having essentially contributed to the recovery of that island. After making surveys of some of its principal harbors, he was ordered to repair to New York, to proceed on reconnoitering excursions, and report observations on the expediency of establishing a chain of military posts throughout the British colonies. In 1763 Lord Colville was instructed to employ him on the coast survey of Nova Scotia, a post in which he continued until 1773; and on his return to England in 1774, the king expressed his commendation of the manner in which his work had been performed. Previous to this, many of the fine harbors of Nova Scotia were known only to fishermen, and Sable Island was a terror to all navigators. The want of correct charts of the coast of North America, for the use of the fleet engaged in carrying on the American revolutionary war, began at this time to be felt; and on Earl Howe representing the immediate necessity of their being prepared, Des Barres was selected to adapt the surveys of Holland, De Brahm, and others, to nautical purposes. These he published in 1777, under the title of the \"Atlantic Neptune,\" in two large folio volumes. In 1784 he was constituted governor of the Island of Cape Breton, with the military command of that and Prince Edward's Island; and soon after he commenced building the town of Sydney, and opened and worked the valuable coal fields at the entrance of the river. From his official position, he was engaged in aiding and removing the royalists from the United States after the war of the revolution. In 1804, he was appointed lieutenant-governor and commander-in-chief of Prince Edward's Island, being then in his eighty-second year. In person he was short, and at the age of ninety-five lithe and active; about which time he talked of making the tour of the United Kingdom, to which\nhe allotted two years; this performed, he was to commence that of Europe, which he calculated would take three years more; after which it was his intention to return to his native place, and there spend the remainder of his days. He was Captain Cook's teacher in navigation. His death occurred at Halifax, Nova Scotia, on 24th October, 1824, he being then in the one hundred and second year of his age.\n\n---\n\nMR. WILLIAM BROWN.\n\nTo exclude the name of this enterprising and industrious individual who, in conjunction with Mr. Thomas Gilmore, started the first printing press in Canada, would, to say the least be a gross act of injustice to his memory and to the Canadian press.\n\nNothing is known concerning these two men, except that they came from Philadelphia to Quebec in 1763, having formed the idea of starting a newspaper in this country; that innumerable difficulties beset them in their arduous undertaking, not the least of which was that Mr. Brown had to proceed to England for the proper materials\u2014press, ink and paper; but finally overcoming all obstacles, they brought out the first number of the \"Quebec Gazette*\" on the 21st June, 1764, with one hundred and fifty subscribers, and thus were the means of establishing \"a new and potent element of civilization.\"\n\n---\n\nCOLONEL PAULUS \u00c6MILIUS IRVING,\n\nWho administered the government of Quebec after the departure of Murray in 1765, and until the arrival of Carleton, was the son of William Irving, Esquire, laird of Bonshaw, Dumfries, and born there on the 23rd September, 1714. He married Judith,\n\n*This paper still exists, being published at Quebec by Messrs. Middleton and Dawson.\ndaughter of Captain William Westfield of Dover, who died 3rd May, 1798, and by whom he had issue Paulus \u00c6milius Irving, who joined the army, rose to the rank of general, greatly distinguished himself, and was made a baronet of the United Kingdom; and two daughters, Amelia Susannah, who married at St. George's, Hanover Square, in October, 1796, Joseph Dacre Appleby Gilpin, M.D., who was afterwards knighted; and Judith, who married Lieutenant-Colonel John Irving of the first West India Regiment, whose daughter, Julia Frances, married Sir William Ouseley, the distinguished Persian and oriental antiquarian.\n\nColonel P. \u00c6. Irving entered the army at an early period, and in September, 1759, was at the siege of Quebec, under General Wolfe, as major in command of the 15th Regiment of Foot, and was wounded on the Plains of Abraham. On the 30th June, 1765, then being commander-in-chief, he assumed the duties of president of the province of Quebec, in the absence of the Honorable James Murray; subsequently, in 1771, he was appointed lieutenant-governor of Guernsey, and afterwards governor of Upnor Castle, Kent. He died 22nd April, 1796.\n\nGENERAL LORD DORCHESTER, K.B.\n\nIf we owe to Wolfe a deep debt of gratitude for the brilliant achievement which added new lustre and victory to our arms, and planted the ensign of Great Britain on this glorious dependency of the empire, where he fought and bled and sacrificed a life his country could ill spare; we assuredly, also, owe much to those brave and gallant men who preserved this land when conquered, through dint of hard toil, watchful vigilance and loss of blood and life. Yes, we are confident the majority of our readers will also coincide with our feebly expressed opinion that we are assuredly, as true and loyal Canadians, under many and deep obligations to them, and in the category which history brings under our observation, we are sure none is more entitled to be fondly and deservedly remembered than he whose name heads this brief and ill-written notice, and whose life we may say was spent in fighting for the cause of his king in this country, and in anxious thought for the welfare of this province.\n\nSuch being the case, the name of Dorchester deserves to be mentioned with the greatest eulogy and praise, for the great services he\nrendered Canada in the two capacities in which he served her interests, as commander-in-chief, and as her governor and the preserver of her high destinies.\n\nGuy Carleton, Lord Dorchester (the saviour of Quebec, as he is called) was the descendant of an ancient and honored family, which had lived in Cornwall, England, five centuries previous to the Norman conquest. He was born about the year 1725, and being destined for the army, entered its ranks after completing his studies, and speedily made his way upward in the service. He accompanied Wolfe's expedition to Canada, and was present at the first and second battles on Abraham's Plains, in both of which he displayed such skill and precision in commanding the part of the army under his command, as to leave no doubt on the minds of his superior officers that he would rise to distinction in the profession he had chosen.\n\nBeing, we believe, specially mentioned in the dispatches of both Townshend and Murray, and having continued under the command of the latter, was promoted to the rank of brigadier-general. In 1767, General Murray having to proceed to England, the government of the Colony devolved on Carleton, who was much liked by the French Canadians and the English (of whom there were then few) generally. In 1770, he proceeded to England on leave of absence, and whilst there, the celebrated Quebec Act passed the Houses of Parliament, and some ascribe it in a great measure to representations he made to the home government respecting Canada, it being well known that he carried home a compiled form of the French civil laws, or *Coutumes de Paris*, for the consideration of the imperial authorities. In 1774, General Carleton returned to Canada, and took prompt measures to carry out the provisions of his new instructions relative to the act just passed. He had, however, little time to think or act upon this matter, for the next year the Americans, having declared their independence, entered Canada in large forces, with the hostile intention of wresting it from the hands of the English; but they made a sad mistake in their estimate of the man they had to deal with; brave and gallant, and of chivalrous courage, and yet perfectly cool and self-possessed in the greatest and most critical moments, Carleton, although with but 800 men at his disposal\u2014all attempts to coax or coerce the natives to assist him proving fruitless\u2014at once took measures to prevent the meditated attack. On the 17th September, Montgomery with his army, amounting to 2000, arrived at Isle-aux-Noix; the fall of Chambly and St. Johns followed, and Carleton, in his endeavor to succour the latter, received a check from a part of the Americans near Longueuil, which compelled him to retreat to Montreal. Here, anticipating the intention of Montgomery to take possession of the town, he burnt and destroyed all the public and valuable stores, and left the city one way, just as the American general was entering at the other. During the night, he had a narrow escape from\nthe enemy, who was encamped at Sorel, and whose sentinels he had to pass in an open boat; this he accomplished with the aid of muffled oars, and arrived at Quebec on the 19th November, to the great joy of the people. He hastily made the most judicious arrangements in his power, for Arnold and Montgomery were advancing, and expelled from the city all those he thought were disaffected, who would not volunteer to defend it, and assist in strengthening the works.\n\nThe united forces of Montgomery and Arnold succeeded in gaining the city on the 4th of December, and after concocting their plans, divided their forces so as to attack the city in several places; this Carleton, nowise intimidated, became cognizant of, and on the Americans raising the siege, took renewed measures for the safety of the place. On the 31st, Montgomery was killed; Arnold and Morgan's forces were routed at first and captured afterwards, and the remnant of the American army compelled to retreat to some distance from the city. On being reinforced, however, during the winter they made a stand for another attack on Quebec, but disease and famine at last compelled them to retreat, being actually chased towards Sorel by the gallant Carleton. In the spring, when the reinforcements arrived from England, he possessed himself of Crown Point, and launched a fine fleet on Lake Champlain, which after several actions, completely annihilated that of the Americans.\n\nIn 1777, upon Burgoyne being appointed commander-in-chief in America, Carleton, thinking that he had been slighted by the government after his brilliant successes, at once demanded his recall, and proceeded to England. His suspicions, although well-founded, were notwithstanding, unjust; for on his proceeding to England, he was well received by his sovereign, who conferred upon him the honor of knighthood.\n\nIn the year 1782, he was appointed as the successor of Sir Henry Clinton, commander-in-chief of all his Majesty's forces in America. He arrived at New York with his commission, in the beginning of May. After the treaty of peace was signed, he delayed for some time the evacuation of the city, from regard to the safety of the loyalists; but on Nov. 25, 1783, he embarked, and withdrew the British ships from America. In 1786, on returning to England, his grateful sovereign was pleased to raise him to the peerage as Lord Dorchester, and Parliament voted him a pension of \u00a31000 per annum during his own life, and the lives of his wife and two elder sons; and towards the latter end of the same year, he was again appointed governor-general and captain-general of Quebec, and commander-in-chief of the forces therein. His re-appearance in Canada was hailed with delight by the majority of the people. He continued to govern the province until 1796, and during that time did much towards the welfare of the country, particularly in ameliorating the laws.\nOn his final departure, the unfeigned regret that was expressed was universal, and many were the addresses presented by the inhabitants to the good old general, conveying their heartfelt gratitude for all that he had done, and prayers for his eternal welfare.\n\nHis lordship, although, it appeared, a very strict disciplinarian in the execution of his duty, was as humane and kind of heart as any man that ever breathed; indeed, his kind treatment of the French Canadians during his government, and of the American prisoners during the American war, evinces that in the highest degree. He was, besides, a man of honor and a gentleman, a sincere Christian, and a devoted soldier and servant of his country. He married, in 1772, Lady Maria, daughter of the second Earl of Effingham, by whom he had many children. His death occurred on the 19th November, 1808, in the fine old age of eighty-three.\n\nHON. CHIEF-JUSTICE HEY.\n\nWILLIAM HEY, Esquire, an English lawyer of some distinction, and a member of the House of Commons, succeeded Chief-Justice Gregory on his recall. His commission is dated the 25th of September, 1766. He took part in all the great discussions of those days relative to the government of the country and the establishment of its judiciary, and there is not a doubt that he assisted very materially in the government of the province and in guiding its destinies. Although General Murray had full power to convene a local legislature; the Chief-Justice in conjunction with Messrs. Carleton, Maserees and De Lotbini\u00e8re, advised him against it, representing that the people were too illiterate, and not yet ripe to so great and sudden a share of liberty and of legislative power. In 1773, he proceeded to England on public business in connection with the bill \"making more effectual provision for the government of the province of Quebec in America,\" and on its passage in 1774 through the House of Commons, when such great efforts were made to quash it, he was examined before the special committee appointed on it, and the important evidence which he and M. De Lotbini\u00e8re gave, may be ascribed its successful passage. Being still in England, early in 1775, by command of the Earl of Dartmouth, secretary of state for war and the colonies, who had witnessed with the whole English people, the dissatisfaction which the Quebec act gave, desired him to prepare the draught of a provincial\nordinance, to be carried over to be submitted to the governor and Legislative Council. By this draught the English laws relating to habeas corpus, and to the trial by jury in civil cases, and likewise the English laws relating to commercial matters, were to be re-established. Chief Justice Hey arrived at Quebec with it in June, 1775, and in the following month of September laid it before the Council. This, we believe, was the last public act of his life in Canada, and shortly after (war taking place with America) he left for England, although not succeeded in his office until May, 1777.\n\nHe had, in 1774, been returned to parliament as member for Sandwich in Kent, but vacated his seat in 1776, on being appointed a commissioner of customs, an office which he continued to fill till his death, which occurred in 1797.\n\nHe was a great favorite of the then Lord Chancellor, and was dining with him when the great seal was stolen in 1785. He married, but had no issue.\n\nADAM LYMBURNER, Esq.,\n\nA merchant of Quebec, 1791, and a gentleman of rare endowments and high attainments, was principally known as the party selected by the merchants and others of Canada, to proceed to England and advocate their rights before the Imperial Government, and for the admirable and lengthy speech which he made on behalf of the Canadians at the bar of the House of Commons. This speech has been considered as a splendid piece of argumentative logic and rhetoric, and as taking a sound and excellent view of the affairs of this country. Although Mr. Lymburner did not gain the object of his mission, he at least had the satisfaction of knowing that he had brought the position of Canada prominently before the home government, and that much good would eventually result from his efforts to benefit the country.\n\nMr. Lymburner returned to Quebec, lived, and, we believe, died there. He was a respected and enterprising gentleman, and was held in high esteem by the people.\nSir William Grant, another great man connected with Canada during the time posterior to the conquest, and third attorney-general of the province of Quebec, an eminent lawyer, was descended from the Grants of Beldernie, so long distinguished in the history of Scotland. He was born in 1754, at Eliehies, on the banks of the Spey, in the county of Elgin, and was partly educated in the grammar school of Elgin, from which he removed to the old college of Aberdeen, where he completed his education, and then repaired to London, and entered at Lincoln's-Inn, where he pursued the study of the law. His whole mind was engrossed in the endeavor to obtain a knowledge of his profession, and of the various business of life; and so successful were his efforts, that at the age of twenty-five, he was considered competent to fill the situation of attorney-general of this province, to which he was appointed, and he quitted England without having been called to the bar. His commission bears date 10th May, 1776. On his return to England, some time after, he engaged in practice in the courts of common law, and joined the home circuit. Being naturally of a reserved and retired turn, he travelled the circuit for several years without obtaining a single brief; but happening to be retained in some appeal from the Court of Session in Scotland to the House of Lords, Lord-Chancellor Thurlow was much struck with his powers of argument, and having learned his name, observed to a friend, \"Be not surprised if that young man should one day occupy this seat.\" That this prophetic opinion was not exactly fulfilled, has been attributed to his having refused that high office. He subsequently left the common-law bar and practised solely in the Court of Chancery. At the general election in 1790, Mr. Grant was returned to Parliament for the borough of Shaftesbury, and soon distinguished himself as a powerful coadjutor of Mr. Pitt. He seldom spoke, and never but on questions with which he was fully acquainted; but his talents and intelligence were soon so generally recognised as to render his assistance essentially valuable, and on one occasion in particular, when the question for a new code of laws for the province of Quebec, excited much discussion. Mr. Grant's local information, and his great professional skill, particularly in the civil law, powerfully strengthened his reasoning; and it was then that the celebrated Mr. Fox, after warmly complimenting him, saluted him as one of his most formidable antagonists. It was in 1791 that he thus distinguished himself in the great debate relating to the laws of Canada; and in 1792 he made a most able\nacute and argumentative speech in defence of the ministry on the subject of the Russian armament. He was called within the bar with a patent of precedence in 1793, and in the same year was appointed a Welsh judge, when a new writ was ordered for Shaftesbury, on the 20th of June; but he was not re-elected; however, a vacancy for Windsor happening in the following January, he was selected for that borough; he was at that time solicitor-general to the Queen. In 1796, he was chosen knight of the shire for the Scottish county of Banff. In 1798, he was appointed chief-justice of Chester. In 1799, he succeeded Lord Redesdale as solicitor-general, and, as is usual, obtained the honor of knighthood on his promotion; and on the 20th May, 1801, in consequence of the elevation of Sir Pepper Aiden to the chief-justiceship of the Common Pleas, he was nominated Master of the Rolls. In 1802, Sir W. Grant made a speech in Parliament in favor of the definitive treaty of peace with France. In February, 1805, he supported the address to the crown in defence of the war with Spain; and in the course of the same year he opposed Mr. Whitehead's proceedings against Lord Melville, and the subsequent motion for the impeachment of that nobleman for his conduct while treasurer of the navy. He opposed the American intercourse bill in 1806, and received the thanks of a committee of merchants of the city of London for his conduct on that occasion. In 1807, he animadverted at some length on the bill brought into the House of Commons by Sir Samuel Romilly, the object of which was to alter the law as to the claims of creditors on the landed property of their debtors. Sir W. Grant continued to represent the shire of Banff till the dissolution of Parliament in 1812. During a period of more than sixteen years did he fill the judicial chair in the Roll's Court, with undiminished ability and reputation. At length he became anxious to retire while yet in full possession of his faculties. This purpose he carried into effect towards the close of 1817. During the last two years of his life he lived chiefly at Barton House, Dawlish, the residence of his sister, the widow of Admiral Schank; and at that place he died, May 25, 1832.\n\nSir W. Grant is spoken of in Mr. Charles Butler's \"Reminiscences\" in the following terms:\n\n\"The most perfect model of judicial eloquence which has come under the observation of the reminiscent is that of Sir William Grant. In hearing him it was impossible not to think of the character given of Menelaus by Homer, or rather by Pope, that 'He spoke no more than just the thing he ought,' but Sir William did much more: in decompounding and analyzing an immense mass of confused and contradictory matter, and forming clear and unquestionable results, the insight of his mind was infinite. His exposition of facts and of the consequences deducible from them, his discussion of former decisions and shewing their legitimate\nweight and authority, and their real bearing upon the point in question, were above praise; but the whole was done with such admirable ease and simplicity, that while real judges felt its supreme excellence, the herd of learners believed that they should have done the same. Never was the merit of Dr. Johnson's definition of a perfect style, 'proper words in proper places,' more sensibly felt than it was by those who listened to Sir William Grant. The charm of it was indescribable; its effect on the hearers was that which Milton describes when he paints Adam listening to the angel after the angel had ceased to speak; often and often has the reminiscent beheld the bar listening, at the close of a judgment given by Sir William, with the same feeling of admiration at what they had heard, and the same regret that it was heard no more.\"\n\nGENERAL BURGOYNE.\n\nJohn Burgoyne, an English general, officer and dramatist, connected with this country in the former capacity, was the natural son of Lord Bingley, and entered early into the army. In 1762, he commanded a force sent into Portugal for the defence of that kingdom against the Spaniards. He also distinguished himself in the first American war by the taking of Ticonderago; but was at last obliged to surrender with his army to General Gates at Saratoga. For this act he was much censured and condemned by all the English people. He was elected into the English Parliament for Preston, in Lancashire; but refusing to return to America pursuant to his convention, was ignominiously dismissed the service. He endeavored to exonerate himself, but without avail, in some pamphlets he published in defence of his conduct. As an author he is more distinguished for his three dramas of the \"Maid of the Oaks,\" \"Bon Ton,\" and \"The Heiress,\" all in the line of what is usually called genteel comedy: they forming light and pleasing specimens.\nGENERAL SIR WILLIAM JOHNSON, BART.\n\nThis celebrated and distinguished military commander, who rendered so much service to the British in the early wars of this country, in subduing and civilizing the wild Indian tribes upon the Mohawk, and in founding through his bravery and greatness, the house of Johnson of Twickenham, England, was descended from an ancient Irish family of Smithtown, in the county of Meath, Ireland, where he was born in the year 1715. He was a near relative of the celebrated naval hero, Sir Peter Warren, K.B., who subsequently adopted him; he went out with him to North America, joined the army, and rose to the rank of colonel, and subsequently of major-general in the militia of New York.\n\nSir Peter, having married a lady in New York, was induced to purchase large tracts of land upon the Mohawk river, and the more interior parts of the country, whence he sent for his nephew, to take charge of his affairs. Young Johnson accordingly took up his residence upon a certain tract on the Mohawk, about thirty miles from Albany, and cultivated an acquaintance with the Indians. He learned their language; he studied their manners, that he might be able to conciliate their regard; his situation upon the river, between Albany and Oswego, presented a fine opportunity for trade, and he carried on a large traffic with them, supplying them with such goods as they needed; and received in return, beaver and other skins. At length he acquired an influence over them, which no other man ever possessed. In 1755, he was intrusted with the command of the provincial troops of New York, and marched to invest Crown Point, while Shirley proceeded towards Ontario, according to the plan of the campaign. General Johnson, after the defeat of a detachment under Colonel Williams, which he had sent out, was himself attacked in his camp on Lake George, 8th September, but as soon as his artillery began to play, the Canadian militia and Indians fled with precipitation to the swamps. The French troops were repulsed, and Baron Dieskau, their general, was taken prisoner. The advantage, however, which was thus gained, was not pursued, and his conduct in not proceeding against Crown Point has been the subject of reprehension. Even the success of the battle is to be attributed to the exertion of the brave General Lyman. But Johnson, who was wounded, in the engagement reaped the benefits of the repulse of Dieskau, which was magnified into a splendid victory. About this time also, he was appointed superintendent of Indian affairs in New York. In the year 1759, he commanded the provincial troops under Brigadier-General\nPrideaux, in the expedition against Niagara. While directing the operations of the siege, Prideaux was killed by the bursting of a cannon, 20th July; but Johnson prosecuted the plan which had been formed with judgment and vigor. On the 24th of July, the enemy made an attempt to raise the siege, which was defeated through the excellent disposition and the courage of Johnson; next day, the fort was taken, and about six hundred men were made prisoners of war. This event broke off the communication, which the French intended to establish between Canada and Louisiana. When Amherst embarked at Oswego in June, 1760, to proceed on the expedition to Canada, Johnson brought to him at that place, one thousand Indians of the Iroquois or five nations, which was the largest number of Indians ever seen in arms at one time in the cause of England. For his gallant and signal services in the cause of the king, his Majesty, on the 27th November, 1755, was graciously pleased to raise him to the dignity and honor of a baronet of the United Kingdom; and, at the same time, conferred upon him a very large and handsome pension, we believe about \u00a35,000.\n\nSir William died at his seat at Johnson Hall, New York, about twenty-four miles from Schenectady, on the Mohawk river, 11th July, 1774.\n\nAllen says of him, \"that he possessed considerable talents, as an orator; and his influence over the Indians was not a little owing to the impression made upon them by means of elocution. It has been represented that he was envious towards Shirley, and endeavored to thwart him in his plans, by discouraging the Indians from joining him, and that in his private conduct he paid little respect to those laws, the observation of which only can insure domestic peace and virtue.\"\n\n\"He was zealous in supporting the claims of Great Britain, which excited such agitation in the colonies a few years before his death, and he exerted himself to promote the interest of the Church of England. He published a small work on the customs and languages of the Indians.\"\n\n---\n\nMAJOR-GENERAL SIR JOHN JOHNSON,\n\nThe only son and heir of the celebrated Sir William, was also well known as a military commander of some repute and a celebrated negociator with the Indians. Having succeeded his father\nin the title, he was also appointed to the rank which his father held, namely, that of major-general.\n\nAt the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, when only 13 years of age, he joined the army of his country as a volunteer, and fought under her flag; and he persuaded the Mohawks and the settlers on his large estates (the latter numbering 700) to come over and settle in Canada, whence, under his leadership, the Indians made awful ravages on the enemy in the State of New York. He raised and commanded a regiment of two battalions in Canada. In August, 1777, he invested Fort Stanix and defeated Hermiker. But in October, 1780, he suffered a defeat at Fox's Mill, at the hands of General Van Ransselaer.\n\nHe had been knighted by the king at St. James' Palace, London, on 22nd November, 1765. After the war he was appointed superintendent-general of Indian affairs in British North America as also colonel-in-chief of the six battalions of the militia of the Eastern Townships of Lower Canada, and a member of the Legislative Council, and resided at Montreal. He married in June, 1773, Mary, daughter of John Watts, Esq., for some time president of the Council, New York; and by her he had issue one son, William, who became colonel in the army, and was killed at Waterloo.\n\nSir John's death occurred at his seat, Mount Johnson, Montreal, on the 4th of January 1830, in the 60th year of his age.\n\n---\n\nREAR-ADMIRAL CHAMBERS,\n\nBorn in 1747, died at Rugby, in England, September 28, 1829. He was the fifth son of the late Thomas Chambers, Esq., of Studley in Warwickshire, at which place, and at Tanworth in the same county, his family have resided on their own estates ever since the reign of Edward the Third. He entered the naval service in 1758, as a midshipman, on board the Shrewsbury, 74 guns, under the auspices of Captain (afterwards Admiral) Sir Hugh Palliser, with whom he served at the reduction of Quebec, in 1759, and until the conclusion of the war, in 1763.\n\nDuring the ensuing peace he served in the Preston of 50 guns, commanded by Captain Allan Gardner, and bearing the flag of Rear-Admiral Parry, Commander-in-Chief in the Jamaica station: he subsequently joined Commodore Gambier in the Salisbury, and\nby that officer was made a lieutenant into the Mermaid frigate, on the coast of North America, in 1771.\n\nAt the commencement of the American war, he was appointed second lieutenant of the Active frigate, one of the squadron under Sir Peter Parker, destined to act against Charleston, in South Carolina; which ship had the honour of leading her consorts to the attack made on Sullivan's Island, June 28, 1776. The Active on that occasion had her first lieutenant (Pike) killed, and eight men wounded. From the Active he was removed, as first lieutenant, into the Montreal frigate, Captain Douglas; and in June, 1778, he was nominated to the command of the flotilla on lake Champlain, where he continued till the peace in 1783, when he was sent home with despatches from Sir Frederick Haldimand, the military commander-in-chief; through whose recommendations he was immediately promoted to the rank of commander; and a statement of his meritorious conduct on many trying occasions being subsequently laid before the king, he was rewarded with a commission as post-captain, dated 15th August in the same year. His superannuation as a rear-admiral took place November 21, 1805.\n\nF. A. VASSAL DE MONVIEL.\n\nLieutenant-Colonel F. A. Vassal de Monviel, late adjutant-general of the militia of Lower Canada, was one of the few remaining individuals who figured in the most stirring and memorable scenes of the history of this province. He was born in 1758, the year before the conquest of Canada by the British army, and had for godfather the celebrated seaman and soldier, De Bougainville. His father, captain in the Royal Roussillon, was descended from one of the old noble families of France, and fell whilst fighting at the side of Montcalm on Abraham's Plains; his grandfather was killed at the battle of Caprouge the ensuing year, and was buried at the General Hospital. During the American Revolution, Mr. Vassal, the object of this notice, took arms in the army of Burgoyne, and made this campaign under the immediate order of General St L\u00e9ger, and was of the besieging party at Fort Stanix. From that period, with the exception of a few years, he continued in the British service, served in Holland, and was at the expedition of Plattsburg, during the late war, under General Prevost, as adjutant-general,\nand as such attended the commander-in-chief during the campaign in Upper and Lower Canada. He died at Quebec on the 25th of October, 1843, at the advanced age of 85 years, in the possession of an irreproachable character for high minded honor, integrity, and loyalty.\n\nGENERAL Sir T. BLOOMFIELD, BART.\n\nHe was born on the 16th of June, 1744, and was the eldest son of the Rev. Thomas Bloomfield, M.A., rector of Hartly and Chalk in Kent, and chaplain to the Duke of Dorset. His father originally destined him for the naval profession, and sent him to sea in the Cambridge, under the command of his intimate friend, Sir Percy Brett; but as he entertained a decided preference for the army, in 1758 his father procured for him a cadetship in the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich. His abilities and conduct there, very soon attracted the notice of the celebrated Muller, then Professor of Artillery and Fortification, who ever after distinguished him by his particular friendship and regard. In the unusually short period of eleven months, he obtained his commission, and soon after at the early age of fifteen, he was appointed to the command of a bomb vessel, at the bombardment of Havre de Grace, under Admiral Rodney, and subsequently in the same year joined the fleet in Quiberon Bay, under Sir Edward Hawke, engaged in blockading the French force under M. de Conflans.\n\nIn 1762 he went to the West Indies with Admiral Rodney, and was present at the capture of Martinique and the Havannah, and subsequently of Pensacola and Mobile. In 1771, he had the good fortune of being introduced to the notice of General Conway, then master-general of the Ordnance, who appointed him his aide-de-camp, and received him into his family upon terms of parental kindness. Upon Lord Townshend becoming the master-general, he continued him in the same appointment till the year 1776, when he joined his company, which was ordered to embark for Canada, although the situation of aide-de-camp would, according to the established usages of the army, have exempted him from the necessity of leaving England.\n\nIn a letter written by him at that time, to a very near relative at home, he says, \"General Phillips took the earliest opportunity after my arrival of appointing me major-of-brigade, a post exceedingly\neligible in my situation, as it puts it in my power to render myself useful, though at the expense of my ease, which in my case I do not in the least regret; for had that been my object, I might have possibly remained at home. I am happily attached to a very genteel, intelligent, active man, and as every detail of the service passes through my inspection, and my duty is my first and sole object in coming over, I am rather to be envied than not; for, however captivating a town life may be to many, I declare I feel greater pleasure in the bustle of a camp than in the dull round in which I should have been involved; and which nothing but the society of those I esteem could give a relish to.\"\n\nUpon his arrival in Canada, he was employed in the construction of floating batteries upon the lakes, which he had planned before he left England, and he continued at the same time, by his own desire, to do his regimental duty in the field, until upon the army going into winter quarters, he returned to England.\n\nThe following letter was written at that time by General Phillips to the master-general:\n\n\"Camp at St. John's, 17th November, 1776.\n\n\"My Lord,\u2014Captain Bloomfield, your Lordship's aide-de-camp, having served the campaign in Canada, returns to attend your lordship's orders in England. I could not, in respect to your lordship, do otherwise than mark attention to this officer, who very gallantly as very properly urged his desire of serving with his company; and I requested of him to accept of being my major-of-brigade for the campaign. I have been sufficiently repaid, not only by much personal attention to me, but great advantage derived from his knowledge in his profession. I will be free to hope, that you will, my lord, allow Captain Bloomfield to return to this service in the spring: I think his own honor is concerned in his doing so, but a still more material reason may be given, that the king's service will suffer by his absence. I need say no more on the occasion. Captain Bloomfield is charged with many things relative to this service, which I hope will meet with attention. I am, &c.,\n\n\"Wm Phillips.\"\n\nEarly in the following spring he again sailed to Canada, taking out with him a gun and carriage, which he had constructed in the interval, by the particular desire of Sir Guy Carleton and General Burgoyne, calculated for the double purpose of land and water service. He was actively engaged with the army under General Burgoyne, during the whole of that campaign, until the action which preceded the unfortunate convention of Saratoga, when he received a most severe wound from a musket shot through the front part of his head, and was for some time left on the field\nof battle; but his life was providentially spared, and in the spring of 1779, he returned to England, and resumed his duties as aide-de-camp to Lord Townshend, who in the following year appointed him to the situation of inspector of artillery, which together with the inspectorship of the Royal Foundry, he held until his death.\n\nIt may not be unimportant to remark, that previously to this time, the construction of ordnance, more especially of that intended for the naval service, together with the mode of its examination and proof, had been in a very defective state. The bursting of a gun, and the consequent loss of life among those who served it, were events of too frequent occurrence; and a system of concealing defects, even in cannon cast in the Royal Brass Foundry, under the immediate eyes of the officers of government, had been pursued to a great extent, and till then escaped detection. It was therefore his first object, by visiting the various foundries in the kingdom, to ascertain the comparative excellence of the metal used in them, and the supply which they were capable of affording. His attention was next directed to the construction of ingenious instruments which might apply the severest test to the strength and accuracy of the guns which were brought before him, and he established regulations for their reception into the service, to which he ever after adhered with inflexible and persevering firmness.\n\nThe advantages resulting from this newly organised system were soon so sensibly felt, that in the year 1783, a new department was created by the king's warrant, and the whole of its duties placed under his immediate direction as inspector of artillery, which had before been performed at an immense expense to the country, with a divided responsibility, and consequently in a very inefficient manner. From these causes it may with truth be asserted, that the ordnance of Great Britain has been brought to a state of perfection beyond that of any other power in Europe. The substitution of iron instead of brass ordnance, rendered practicable by successive improvements has also led to a most important saving in expense, and the many naval actions which occurred during the late wars, as well as the sieges of Copenhagen and in the Peninsula, where the mode of battering assumed a rapidity of firing unknown on former occasions, abundantly testified the just confidence of his brother officers in the weapons placed in their hands.\n\nThe last and most important military service in which he was engaged, was the siege of Copenhagen in 1807, upon which occasion he commanded the British and German artillery, under the Earl of Cathcart; and whatever difference of opinion may exist respecting the policy of that expedition, it has never been doubted that its objects were prosecuted with the utmost vigor, and crowned with the most complete success. He was rewarded for his services upon this occasion with the dignity of a baronet, and the thanks of both Houses of Parliament; and in his answer to a very\nhandsome letter from the master-general, he thus expresses himself:\u2014\"I cannot find words to convey my sentiments of the most respectful gratitude for the very distinguished honor his Majesty has been pleased to announce his gracious intention of bestowing upon me, so much above any merits I can claim, having done no more than my duty, in the performance of which I was so ably assisted. The beneficial consequences derived from it to our country at this eventful period, are alone the source of the highest gratification, and I most fervently hope and trust, that with the Divine assistance, our exertions will long secure the independence of the most favored nation upon earth.\"\n\nHe died at Shooter's Hill, Kent, England, on the 24th August, 1822.\n\n---\n\nJOSEPH BRANT.\n\nJoseph Brant, a celebrated Indian Chief, of pure Mohawk blood, who was at the head of the Six Nations. About the year 1756, he was sent by Sir William Johnson to Dr. Wheeling's Indian Charity School, in Connecticut. He there received a good education, and was employed on public business. In 1762 he acted as interpreter to Smith, a missionary. He visited England in 1775, where his attainments in learning attracted attention. In the war he acted on the British side, and destroyed the settlement of Minisink, in Orange County, on the 22nd July, 1779. In the engagement that ensued, forty-four Americans fell beneath the tomahawk of the Indian. The destruction of the settlement of Wyoming has been ascribed to him by Campbell, as well as by other writers, but proofs were presented to the poet, in 1822, by one of the sons of Brant, proving that he was not concerned in that dreadful massacre. He visited England after the peace. The saddest event of his life was the death of a son, whom he killed in self-defence, when making a drunken attempt to murder him. He never recovered from the sorrow and remorse occasioned by this act, and as an expression of penitence for a deed which was perhaps unavoidable, he resigned his commission in the British service, and surrendered himself to justice, but Lord Dorchester, the governor of Canada, would not accept his resignation. He translated the book of Common Prayer and the Gospel according to St. Mark, into the Mohawk language, which was published in London, 1787. He died in 1807, at the age of 65 years.\nCOLONEL LE COMTE DUPR\u00c9.\n\nThis gentleman commanded the Canadian militia during the siege of 1775-6. He had first received a commission from the Marquis Duquesne, governor-general of Canada, as captain. In June, 1755, he was appointed major, and in the following November, lieutenant-colonel. In consequence of his behavior during the siege, on the 4th March, 1778, he was appointed colonel-commandant for the city and district of Quebec, by General Sir Guy Carleton. He continued in this extensive command for more than twenty years, and his conduct deservedly obtained the friendship, confidence and gratitude of all the militiamen of the district. Hawkins in his \"Picture of Quebec\" relates the following anecdote of him, which occurred in November, 1775.\n\n\"The enemy was at the gates of the city, when three sergeants of the Canadian militia formed a conspiracy to admit the Americans through a small wicket near the powder magazine, where one of them commanded a guard. Colonel Dupr\u00e9 going his rounds one night about eleven o'clock, became suspicious, and soon discovered this plot, and communicated it to Lieutenant-Governor Cramahe. The sergeants were secured, and kept in prison until the following May. They were then tried, and admitted that the city had been saved by the sagacity of Colonel Dupr\u00e9. The Americans enraged at the discovery of the plot, did all the damage they could to the colonel's property. Four hundred were quartered at his house and land near Quebec, which they ruined. At his seigniory they destroyed his flour, and broke in pieces his furniture. On being offered a grant of land as a reward for his services, and as a compensation for his loss, he refused to accept it, saying, that he served out of regard to his country and his king, and required no remuneration.\"\n\nADMIRAL SCHANK.\n\nJohn Schank, a distinguished naval officer, born in Fifeshire, Scotland, in 1740. He went to sea in the British service when young, and in the first American war he was employed on the lakes\nof Canada, where he displayed great talents both as a seaman and engineer.* Returning home on peace taking place, he obtained the rank of post captain. He devoted his leisure to the improvement of naval architecture, and in 1793 he published a treatise on a method which he had invented of navigating vessels in shallow water by means of sliding keels. He contributed to the foundation of the society for the encouragement of naval architecture, and in 1794 he was nominated agent of transports. He subsequently was employed as an engineer in superintending the defence of the eastern coast of England. On the establishment of the Transport Board, he was made one of the commissioners; in 1805 he was raised to the rank of admiral; and in 1822 to that of admiral of the blue. His death took place at Dawlish, in Devonshire, in February, 1823. Admiral Schank distinguished himself by several ingenious inventions, and he wrote some works on ship building.\n\n---\n\nHON. PETER RUSSELL\n\nOf this gentleman, upon whom devolved the government of Canada West, on the resignation of Major General Simcoe, in 1796, nothing is known except that he came to Canada with General Simcoe as inspector-general, and became a member of the first Parliament of that section of the province, and also of the Executive Council; and subsequently as the senior member of that body, took Governor Simcoe's place, the duties of which he fulfilled until 1798, when General Hunter arrived as duly appointed successor.\n\nDuring his administration, several sound and healthy measures for the province were passed in the Legislature; and among these may be enumerated the act incorporating the legal profession, and that for establishing trade with the United States.\n\n*He built at Quebec, and commanded the Inflexible, 18 guns, and fought her against the revolted colonies on Lake Champlain, October, 1776. Many of her upper timbers were quite new, having been growing in the forests only ten days before the battle.\nSIR JOHN HAMILTON, Bart.\n\nAnother name which deserves to be honorably mentioned in connection with the early history of the province, and whose owner was raised to rank and affluence through such connection, is that of Sir John Hamilton, an able naval commander, and who during the defence of Quebec, in 1775-6, in command of the Lizard, displayed such bravery, skill and energy in repelling the American invaders, and in assisting Sir Guy Carleton in doing so, that the king in 1776 conferred upon him the honor of a baronetcy, which he long enjoyed.\n\nJOSEPH QUESNEL, Esq.,\n\nA Canadian poet, dramatist and composer, &c., of some repute, was born in France in 1750, and died at Montreal on the 3rd of July, 1809. He obtained letters of naturalization from General Haldimand. In 1788 he produced \"Colas et Colinette, ou le Bailli Dup\u00e9,\" a comedy in three acts, printed at Quebec, and performed at Montreal in 1790; \"Lucas et C\u00e9cile,\" a musical operetta; \"Les R\u00e9publicains Fran\u00e7ais,\" a comedy. In 1805 he wrote a treatise on the dramatic art, for the Quebec amateurs; and, at different times, several musical compositions, all of more or less merit. These pieces were extremely popular with, and widely read by the French Canadian people.\n\nHis sons made some figure in the political history of the lower province. The Hon. Jules Quesnel, who died in 1842, was one of the chiefs of the opposition party before the union, and became a member of the special committee; while the Hon. F. A. Quesnel, Q. C., was a talented pleader at the bar, and a member of Parliament. He opposed the union in 1823, and, in 1848, was appointed a member of the Legislative Council.\nSIR CHARLES DOUGLAS,\n\nAn eminent naval officer; he was a native of Scotland and first obtained employment in the maratime service of Holland. This circumstance operated to his disadvantage on entering into the English navy; however, at the commencement of the American war, he had the command of a squadron destined to act in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. His conduct on that station, in 1776, having forced his way up that great river, in the spring of the year, when nearly filled with drifting ice, to the relief of his countrymen in Quebec, procured him honors and promotion. On the prospect of a rupture with Spain, in 1787, he was raised to the rank of a rear-admiral. He died in 1789. Independent of his merit in the practice of the more immediate duties of his profession, he deserves notice on account of his important improvement in the mode of firing guns on board ships, by means of lock instead of matches. It is said that he was acquainted with six European languages, and could speak them correctly.\n\nHis grandson is the present General Sir Howard Douglas, G.C.B.\n\nCOLONEL DE PEYSTER.\n\nColonel Arent Schuyler De Peyster, a name well known in Upper Canada, having been connected with that province in its infancy, in various ways, but principally in his profession as a military officer, was the grandson of the celebrated Colonel Abraham De Peyster, and was born in New York, on 27th June, 1736. He entered the 8th or King's Regiment of Foot in 1755, served in various parts of North America under his uncle, Colonel Peter Schuyler, and commanded at Detroit, Michillimackinac, and various places in Upper Canada, during the American revolutionary war. The Indian tribes of the north-west were then decidedly hostile to the British Government, but the judicious measures adopted by Colonel De Peyster, tended to conciliate and finally to detach them entirely from the American cause. To his influence over the Indians, several American missionaries and their families\nwere, on one occasion, indebted for the preservation of their lives. Having risen to the rank of colonel, and commanded his regiment for many years, he retired to Dumfries, Scotland, the native town of his wife, where he resided until his death. During the French revolution, he was instrumental in embodying and training the 1st Regiment of Dumfries Volunteers, of which Robert Burns was an original member. He was on terms of friendship with Burns, who addressed to him one of his fugitive pieces, and with whom he once carried on a poetical controversy in the columns of the Dumfries Journal. He died as full of honors as of years, having held the king's commission upwards of 77 years, and being probably at the time the oldest officer in the service, in November, 1832.\n\n---\n\nHON. H. T. CRAMAHE.\n\nThis gentleman administered the government from 1770 to the latter part of 1774, during the absence of the governor, Sir Guy Carleton. It was a most critical time, namely, the passing of the \"Quebec Act,\" and required great vigilance on the part of the person in charge of the government to watch over its interests,\u2014what with the indignation of the English community and the subtilty of the English colonists settled in what is now the United States.\n\nMr. Cramahe performed his high duties with great care and judiciousness, and his conduct, on the occasion of the English people demanding a legislature to be convened, deserves great credit. We believe he was a French Swiss by birth, and a member of the Executive Council.\n\n---\n\nHON. CHIEF-JUSTICE LIVIUS.\n\nMr. Livius, the occupant of this high office, during our early history, was a foreigner, and was born abroad about the year 1727. He resided for a considerable time previous to the independence\nof the United States at Portsmouth, New Hampshire; was a member of the Council under the Royal Government; but was proscribed by the act, 1778. Of the members of the Council of New Hampshire, in 1772, seven were relatives of the governor. Having been left out of a commission as a justice of the Common Pleas, on the division of the province into counties, when new appointments were made, and dissenting from the views of the Council as to the disposition of reserved lands in grants made by a foreign governor, Livius went to England, and exhibited to the Lords of Trade several and serious charges against the administration of which he was a member. These charges were rigidly investigated, but were finally dismissed. Livius appears, however, to have gained much popularity among those in New Hampshire, who were opposed to the governor, and who desired his removal; and was appointed by their influence chief-justice of the province. But as it was thought that the appointment, under the circumstances, was likely to produce discord, he was transferred to that of this province, then called Quebec. His commission bears date May 31, 1777; and we believe he served until about 1786, when he retired to England where he died in 1795. Sabine says of him, \"Livius would seem a gentleman of strong feelings.\" He possessed a handsome fortune; was educated abroad, but received an honorary degree from Harvard University, in 1767.\n\nSIR FREDERICK HALDIMAND, K.B.\n\nFrederick Haldimand, lieutenant-general in the British army, and once governor of Canada, a native of Yerdon, County of Berne, Switzerland, was one of those heroes who owed their elevated dignity solely to their marked superiority of talent.\n\nThose who have had the advantage of serving under him and sharing in his fatigues and perils, cannot have failed to have made known his eminent qualities, and the preference of the English nation, who confided to him the government of such an important colony as Canada in the then trying and precarious times, must justify forever the high opinion entertained of him. He first entered into the service of the king of Sardinia; and, prompted by a noble ambition to instruct himself in the school of the king of Prussia, he joined his service, where after about three years\nhe was admitted as a lieutenant in the Guards, with the rank of lieutenant-colonel.\n\nIn 1754 he finally entered the British army, together with his friend Bouquet, both with the rank of colonel, to serve in the Royal Americans, which had lately been raised.\n\nThe war of 1755, between France and England, offered divers occasions for distinguishing himself and developing his talents.\n\nHe distinguished himself most signalily at the unfortunate attack made on the retrenchments of Ticonderoga, defended by Lieutenant-General Montcalm, on the 8th July, 1758; but where he achieved the greatest merit was in the defence of Oswego, on Lake Ontario, and although little notice was then taken of his exploits, nevertheless, it should not be lost sight of at the present moment, no more than those of Captains Steiner, de Zurich, Marc, Provost, de Gen\u00e8ve, Viuilliamoy de Sausconne et Du Fez, de Meridon, all experienced officers serving under Colonel Haldimand. The British army, who was preparing to lay siege to Niagara in 1759, converted Oswego into a depot for provisions as well as of munitions of war for the campaign, and was confided to Colonel Haldimand. The governor-general of Canada, the Marquis de Vaudreuil, being informed of this, sent an army of 4000 men under the orders of Chevalier de la Corne, to attack that post, defended only by about 1000 men. The fate of the whole army depended upon maintaining this position, otherwise the army besieging Niagara would not only have been in danger of being surprised by the Chevalier, who would have marched directly, but of finding itself placed between cross fires, by another force of equal strength, who, in concert with the first, would have met at the same time to combat the British. Even supposing that they could have resisted this double shock, they would have remained without provisions, exposed to hunger, and at a distance of 200 miles from any English habitation.\n\nThe Chevalier de la Corne on appearing before Oswego found it very well entrenched, Colonel Haldimand being aware of the importance of this post, took the necessary precautions, as an able and intelligent officer ought to do, and this led to his safety, and that of the British army at a distance of 60 miles.\n\nThe attack commenced by 600 Indians, who extended themselves partly in front of the entrenchments. The chevalier attacked in column with his whole force. He was repulsed several times, and although he persisted, he was not more successful. The battle lasted most part of the day, while an attack during the night was contemplated by the French, who having passed the night under arms, the chevalier ordered a retreat. The colonel persuaded, as well as his officers, that death or glory must ensue, caused a second inside entrenchment to be made during the night as a last resort. He sustained his reputation during the remainder of the war, as may be\njudged by his conduct at the siege of Montreal, as well as on the expeditions which followed, between July and September, 1760, when that city by its capitulation rendered the British masters of all the Canadas.\n\nSome writers on Canada contend, that without any knowledge of the country, on account of his being a foreigner, (which was untrue), he was totally unfit to govern a country of this description, no matter what his reputation was as a soldier. Nevertheless, he held the post assigned him until 1785, and having very meagre records of the time of his administration, we are not prepared to say anything either to his credit or disadvantage. It is clear, however, that he did nothing very outre from what we can learn, the time was occupied principally in settling the country with the United Empire Loyalists, and the disbanded troops, and in making provision for their sustenance, until they should be enabled to support themselves.\n\nSmith says of Haldimand:\u2014\u201cVarious have been the opinions respecting this gentleman\u2019s administration. If we are to give credit to the assertions of some, his government was marked by severity; and on the other hand, it has been represented as having been conducted by a wholesome discipline, necessary at that time, to preserve the public tranquillity. On the score of his being a foreigner, many excuses may be made for the errors of his administration. Several actions for damages for false imprisonment were instituted against him in England; the persons who had been imprisoned, recovered judgments against him, which were paid by government.\u201d\n\nHe was recalled, and succeeded by Henry Hamilton, Esquire.\n\n---\n\n**DUCALVET.**\n\nPierre Ducalvet, one who figures most considerably in the political annals, acquired a large fortune in the fur trade under the French domination, and remained in the country after the conquest. Canada was administered according to the French laws until the peace of Versailles, in 1763. The ensuing year, it was administered according to the English laws; and the Canadians were removed from their offices by reason of their religion. Being a Huguenot, Ducalvet did not share in this, and was appointed a justice of the peace and magistrate. His compatriots could not\nbe admitted to practice at the bar; to remedy this injustice he tried, as did the Intendent Raudot in former times, to reconcile the parties. The tribunal under his jurisdiction was the soul of justice, and this was denied to the Canadians everywhere. But it was mostly as mover of the constitution that Ducalvet became so celebrated. He declared open war against the administrative system, which reigned under the Legislative Council, and which he thought was infected with despotic doctrines, as well as against Sir Frederick Haldimand, the governor, personally; he demanded for the Canadians the rights of British subjects as he understood them; and drew up a plan of a constitution in every respect like that which was granted in 1791, but without the university and the regiment of two battalions clauses. He boldly prosecuted Haldimand in England, who afterwards incarcerated him for treason, merely upon documentary evidence; and at the same time reclaimed of Benjamin Franklin, at Paris, the payment of what he had furnished Congress. He published in London the \"Letter to the Canadians,\" and the \"Appeal to the Justice of the State,\" addressed to the king, the Prince of Wales, and the ministers and members of Parliament. His writings are powerful, and possess a sharp though unpolished eloquence. The ex-Jesuit of Quebec, (Roubaud) is believed to have assisted him in his labors. Ducalvet went twice to England; the first time in 1783, accompanied by his only son, born in 1773, aged 10 years; his wife, Louise Jusseaume had died in 1774. He left his child in London. He remained in Canada from 1785 to 1786, and returned to England in the month of January, for the purpose of continuing his accusations against Haldimand, but it appears that the ship in which he sailed foundered at sea. P. Ducalvet, the son, remaining in London, was still living in 1796. It was ascertained that he had not been thrown overboard, and his mother escaped from becoming distracted with such cruel terrors, as were imagined by M. Barthe. The world will not pass judgment on Ducalvet in the same point of view. Those, whose loyalty to government is established beyond doubt, will be against him; while those who do not admire the British Constitution, or who deplore the results, which had been or may be derived therefrom in Canada, may be little thankful to him; although they should remember that to demand it he allied himself with the British of the colony and the loyal Americans. Those, on the other hand, who admire that form of government, may consider themselves as indebted to him; they will remember that it was to obtain this for them that he sacrificed his fortune, and that he even perished in furtherance of his efforts in this political struggle. \"Small in stature, of good figure, noble appearance, and of a warm heart, he partook of the character of the great men of Rome and Sparta in their best times;\" so says one of his friends.\nHENRY HAMILTON, Esq.\n\nThis gentleman became lieutenant-governor of Quebec, on the recall of Sir Frederick Haldimand, in 1785. Previous to his connection with Canada, he had served in the British army, but had retired from the service, on peace being concluded between England and the European powers.\n\nHe administered only one year, but that year brought forth a good deal that was beneficial to the province, such as the first entering on the Statute Book of the law of *Habeas Corpus*, which gave general satisfaction, not only to the English, but also to the French portion of the community.\n\nMr. Hamilton was succeeded by Sir Guy Carleton, who had been raised to the peerage as Lord Dorchester, and came to govern Canada for the second time. He returned to England, but shortly afterwards was appointed governor of Dominica, an office which he filled with great ability and integrity. He died at Antigua in September, 1776.\n\nHON. CHIEF-JUSTICE SMITH.\n\nHon. William Smith was born at New York on the 25th of June, 1728. His father, a lawyer of eminence in that province, became a member of his Majesty's council, and was afterwards appointed judge of the court of King's Bench. Judge Smith left many children, the eldest of whom is the subject of this memoir.\n\nMr. Smith was thus descended from a respectable family in the province, and his father perceiving that he evinced considerable talent in his youth, sent him early to a grammar school at New York. At school he was an extraordinary proficient, and, when sufficiently instructed, was sent to Yale College, at New Haven, in Connecticut, where he distinguished himself so much by his learning and assiduity, that he obtained the degree of A.M. at a very early age. He was well acquainted with the ancient writers, particularly with the Greek philosophers, whose history he read in their native language, while he understood sufficient of the Hebrew to become familiar\nwith many things in the Rabbinical learning. He made the study of divinity a chief pursuit, and those who read what he had written on this important subject, were astonished at his knowledge of the scriptures, while to many it appeared incredible that one man should have acquired in a few years such variety of knowledge in matters unconnected with his immediate avocations.\n\nHe had great readiness in arithmetic, was an excellent mathematician, and in medicine was so well informed, that several eminent physicians of his native state have declared that in answer to several questions propounded to him on this science, he had discovered great judgment, as well as minute knowledge; indeed he understood almost as much of the general principles of the healing art as speculation without practice could enable him.\n\nHe was a devout Christian, a sincere Protestant, and tolerant and just to those from whom he differed most. He used constantly to worship God in his family, performing its duties always himself.\n\nHaving spent several years at college, Mr. Smith repaired to his native city, where he studied law, and after being called to the bar, he entered it with a very extensive practice; he was above the mean appetite of loving money, for if he saw a cause was unjust, he would state that it was so, and if the litigant parties persisted in their respective views, he would desire them to seek another counsellor; if he found the cause doubtful, he always advised his client to compromise. When differences were referred to him, which he settled, he would receive no reward, though offered it by both parties, considering himself in these cases as a judge; observing that \"a judge ought to take no money.\" He was an eloquent speaker, remarkable for the soundness of his law opinions, many of which are collected and recorded in a book by Chalmers, entitled \"Opinions of Eminent Lawyers.\" He was the intimate friend of Robertson the historian of America, and of many other literary characters of that day.\n\nHe was appointed a member of his Majesty's council as early as the year 1769, where his attendance was regular, his integrity unquestioned, and his loyalty firm to his king; and when the lowering clouds, caused by the Stamp Act, began to spread over the continent, he saw the danger likely to result from the measure, and drew up a plan of union of all his Majesty's colonies, which if it had been then adopted, might have prevented the civil war that ensued, and the dismemberment of the British Empire in America.\n\nThe direct tax that was devised by Parliament in 1764, was the origin of the controversy; both countries resorted to the constitution for arguments in support of tenets diametrically opposite to each other; on the part of America there was a claim set up to all the rights of Englishmen, and it was inferred that no tax could be laid upon them without the consent of their assemblies. Great Britain on the other hand attempted to justify her measures by admitting the principle, but denying the consequence; she con-\ntended that America was virtually represented by the Commons of Great Britain. Mr. Smith proposed a plan of union of all the colonies friendly to the great whole, and linking them and Great Britain together by the most indissoluble ties; all requisitions for aid and supplies for general purposes, had been formerly addressed to the several provincial assemblies; it was now proposed this should be made to the general government. It was not, however, intended to emancipate the assemblies, but that there should be a lord-lieutenant as in Ireland, and a council of at least twenty-four members, appointed by the Crown, or the House of Commons, consisting of deputies chosen by their respective assemblies, to meet at the central province of New York, as the parliament of North America. To this body it was proposed all the royal requisitions for aids were to be made, and they were to have authority to grant for all, to settle the quotas for each, leaving the ways and means to their separate consideration, unless in case of default. The members of the council were to depend upon the royal pleasure, but, to preserve independency, they were to be men of fortune, and hold their places for life, with some honorable distinction to their families, as a lure to prevent the office falling into contempt.\n\nThe number of deputies was to be proportioned to the comparative weight and abilities of the colonies they represented. The two Floridas, Rhode Island, Nova Scotia, and Georgia, to have five each; New Hampshire, Maryland, North Carolina, and Quebec, each seven; South Carolina and New Jersey, each eleven; New York, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut, each twelve; and Massachusetts Bay and Virginia, each fifteen. The whole house would thus consist of one hundred and forty-one members, a small number when the importance of the trust was considered, but to be increased when the colonies became more populous and desired it. The Crown to retain its ancient negative, and the British Parliament its legislative supremacy in all cases relative to life, liberty, and property, except in the matter of taxation for general aids, or for immediate support of the American government. A dignified government like this, it was supposed, would produce unspeakable advantages by making the colonies better known, and that it would correct the many disorders that had crept into some of the colonial constitutions, dangerous in some instances to the colonists themselves, and their British creditors, and derogative of the first rights and many of the prerogatives of the Crown, most friendly to peace and good order.\n\nThe minister, G. Grenville, approved of the plan, but never brought it forward in Parliament; and thus things remained until Great Britain, in 1775, determined to tax the colonies without their consent. Mr. Smith deeply deplored the contentions that afterwards took place, and long before the civil war broke out, exerted every means in his power to avert it.\nGeneral Tryon, the governor of New York, finding it no longer safe to remain in the city, embarked on board the Duchess of Gordon, signifying to the council that he would not meet them again in public business; leaving each member to retire when he pleased. Mr. Smith then repaired to his country seat at Haverstraw, about forty miles from New York. He was not long there before he was summoned, 3rd June, 1777, to attend the council of safety at Kingston, and being introduced before them, he was asked whether he considered himself a subject of the Independent States of America? To which he replied, that he did not conceive himself discharged from his oaths of fidelity to the Crown of Great Britain; upon which an order was immediately made by the board, of the 7th of June, ordering him to be confined within the manor of Livingston, where he remained until he was sent into New York, by a flag, under the superintendence of Colonel Burr, by order of General Washington.\n\nMr. Smith remained at New York till the evacuation of that city by the king's troops, and went to England with Sir Guy Carleton, the then commander-in-chief. He there remained until he was appointed chief-justice of Canada, in November, 1786, and continued to hold that station until he died, on the 3rd November, 1798. He thus held his office as chief-justice for seven years, managing the court and all proceedings in it, with singular justice. It was observed by the whole country, how much he raised its reputation; and those who held places and offices in it, all declared, the impartiality of his justice, his generosity, his vast diligence, and his great exactness in trials. It was customary before his time, that all prisoners should be brought into court, in the custody of a party of soldiers; he disapproved of this, and established, for the first time, the appointment of constables, ordering them to be provided with their batons of office, which has been continued ever since. He was taken with a shivering fit in court, and it was succeeded by an ardent fever, which no medical skill could arrest or destroy. A day before his death, he desired one of his children to send round to the clergymen of each communion a declaration to be read in the several churches, of his firm belief in the Divinity of his Saviour.\n\nAs a Christian, he was one of the greatest patterns of the time in which he lived; and, in his public employments, either when at the bar, or on the bench, was equally distinguished as a model of Christian perfection.\nSIR ALEXANDER MACKENZIE.\n\nThis ingenious and energetic traveller and discoverer was originally a Canadian merchant. The date of his birth is not known; but he was a native of Inverness, and a traveller of considerable talent and perseverance, connected with the North West Fur Company, in the employ of Mr. Gregory. In 1789, he set out to explore the country to the north, nearly midway between the Pacific Ocean and Hudson's Bay, from a station at the head of the Athabaska Lake. He discovered the great river, which bears his name, falling into the Polar Sea. He undertook a second journey three years afterwards, to reach the Peace River; he succeeded, and was the first European who ever crossed from sea to sea, the whole breadth of the vast American continent to the northward, which he completed from Fort Chipiowyan in eleven months.\n\nWILLIAM BERECZY, Esq.\n\nWilliam Berczy, a name well known in Upper Canada, was born in Saxony, about the years 1747-8. While he was still quite young, his father removed to Vienna with his family. We find by the copy of a letter, in his own hand-writing, dated at Hanover, 13th February, 1792, that he was not of an \"indifferent\" family, well known in Germany; that his father was employed in the diplomatic corps of the German Empire, and that others of his relations were, at that time, and had been previously, members of the supreme tribunal of the Empire, and that his uncle had been for more than forty years minister of the house of Brunswick, at the Imperial Court of Vienna. He studied at the universities of Leipsic and Jena, and was destined by his father to follow in his path; but imbued by a feeling of independence, and the ideas prevalent in those days, he preferred choosing a career for himself. He left his home, travelled in Poland, Hungary, Croatia, and the adjoining countries. From thence he went to Italy and Switzerland, where he became acquainted with Miss Charlotte Allemand, whom he married on the 15th of December, 1785. She was of\nrespectable parentage in Switzerland, several of her paternal uncles being men of letters, of some celebrity, one of them a professor of the university of Leyden, and another a professor of a literary institution at Lausanne, of whom favorable mention is made by the celebrated historian, Gibbon, in his Memoirs. After his marriage, he returned to Italy, from whence, in the year 1790, he went to London, in England, when his son William was born, 6th January, 1791. Here he was engaged as agent by an association, of which Sir William Pultney (afterwards Earl of Bath,) was the principal, who were owners of a large tract of land in Genesee county, in the State of New York, in America, to procure people from Germany, to settle on those lands. Having procured a number of emigrants, in the year 1792, he set sail from Hamburg with about sixty German families, and after a tedious passage, landed them at Philadelphia. From thence he was to convey them to their place of destination, on the Genesee lands; but as a great part of the country he had to go through was still uninhabited, he opened a waggon road by the aid of his people, of upwards of one hundred miles in length, through the forests, and finally established them on their lands in the autumn of that year. Differences having arisen between Mr. Berezy and a Mr. Charles Williamson, the chief agent of the association, he felt himself compelled, in the year 1793, to institute an action of damages against that agent, and the proprietors of the Genesee lands, which having resulted in his favor, he determined to withdraw his people, and settle with them in Upper Canada, where he had learned, through the proclamation of the governor of that province, published in 1792, as well as from other sources, that advantageous offers were made to leaders of families desirous of settling there. He, in consequence formed an association with some gentlemen at New York, for the purpose of bringing out emigrants from Germany, if favorable arrangements could be effected with the Canadian government. Immediately after he proceeded to Niagara, in Upper Canada, at that time the head-quarters of the government, called on Governor Simcoe, to whom he proposed, not only to bring the people he had already at the Genesee, but to introduce a much larger number from Germany, if he could get lands for their settlement, on such conditions as would indemnify the associations of which he was a member for their outlay in carrying out their project. Having pitched upon the townships of Markham, in the rear of the town of York, he brought his people from the Genesee, amounting to sixty-four families. The town of York, now Toronto, at that period, was scarcely inhabited, and the whole country back, was a dense wilderness; he therefore, had to find a way to convey his people and their effects to their future residence, and at once set to work in opening the road, as far as Gwillimbury, now known as Yonge Street, and from there to his township. As it may be\ninteresting to some persons at this time, to know who was the actual projector of that road, we insert below, a letter from Mr. (afterward Sir) David William Smith, then acting surveyor-general, dated at York, 11th of October, 1794, in which he writes to Mr. Berczy.\n\n\"Dear Sir.\u2014In order that you may be acquainted with the method which has been taken in opening Dundas street, I enclose to you Mr. Jones's letter on that subject, in hopes it may be of assistance to you in the opening of Yonge Street.\"\n\n(Signed) \"D. W. Smith,\nActing Surveyor-General.\"\n\nThe survey of the township of Markham having been completed in May, 1795, Mr. Berczy applied for the government patents for his land; he was however put off at first by being told that his settlers being aliens, could not yet receive their deeds, and subsequently, other reasons were alleged, until, in the year 1797, all grants of a similar nature were rescinded, on the plea that the grantees had not complied with the conditions of settlement required by the government. Having, in vain, endeavored to obtain a reversal of this order, which ought not to have applied to his particular case, as he had been the only one of the numerous grantees who had complied with the conditions of settlement, he, as a last resort, in the year 1799, went to England, to lay his case before the Imperial Government; and after a delay of nearly two years, at last brought his business to a favorable termination; but in this also, he was ultimately disappointed, for he never obtained the titles to the lands he had so dearly bought by years of toil, and great outlay of money, not all his own, it is true, but all that he did possess.\n\nOn his return from prosecuting his claim in England, in the autumn of 1801, the vessel in which he sailed, was unfortunately forced by stress of weather, to put into the Bay of Chaleurs, in the province of New Brunswick, where he had to remain until the middle of February, 1802, when, at the age of about fifty-five years, he set out on snow shoes, a mode of travel he had never before practiced, and crossed the wilderness, on his way to Quebec, which he reached on the 8th of March following.\n\nHis efforts to obtain the justice, to which he considered himself entitled, after his return to Upper Canada, having failed, he finally left that province, to reside at Montreal, in the year 1805.\n\nThe expenses caused by his unfortunate undertaking, having principally fallen on him, as the only responsible person in this country, he found himself, after settling with his creditors, left without means of support; he was consequently forced to avail himself of his talent for painting, to earn by that means a living for himself and his family.\n\nIn the spring of 1812, he left Montreal, on a journey to New\nYork, in the hope of obtaining some indemnification from his former associates, in the land business already mentioned, some of whom were still living in that city, and also with the view of publishing a statistical account of the provinces of Upper and Lower Canada, which he had completed, during the leisure moments allowed him, from his other almost incessant occupations. When he left Montreal, he had just partially recovered from a severe attack of illness, the seeds of which he carried with him on his journey, and from the effects of which, in the winter of 1813, he died at New York, having been kindly cared for by some of his old friends, during his last illness.\n\nIt does not appear that he realized the projects he had in view, by going to New York, which probably failed, owing to his state of ill health; nor did the family find among the papers they recovered, after the termination of the war, between Great Britain and the United States, his work on the Canadas, which possibly may have been appropriated by some person unknown to them.\n\nThus ended the career of a gentleman, who had devoted many years of his life, in the hope of benefiting his countrymen in Germany, by removing them to America, where they might enjoy freer institutions and greater liberty than in their native land, while, at the same time, he had hoped to realize a competence for himself; but who, through the jealousy and injustice of some of his fellow creatures, had his life embittered by disappointment and pecuniary difficulties.\n\nHis son was the late Charles Albert Borezy, born at Niagara, C. W., 22nd August, 1794. He entered the commissariat during the war of 1812, and rose to be acting deputy assistant-commissary-general. He afterwards became a justice of the peace and postmaster of Toronto, where he died in June, 1858, after a life of usefulness and honor. He was one of the first projectors of the Northern Railway and a large stockholder. He married Miss Anne Eliza Finch, daughter of the late Joseph Stace Finch, Esq., of Greenwich, England, an officer in the Field Train. She, with a large family, survives him.\n\nSIR ALURED CLARKE, G.C.B.\n\nThis gallant soldier and gentleman, who administered the government of the province of Quebec, as lieutenant-governor, from 1792 to 1793, during the absence of Lord Dorchester, was a\ncelebrated military commander, who afterwards rose to the highest honors and distinction, in the service of his country. He was probably of the family, one of whom was Alured Clarke, D.D., who died Dean of Exeter, in May 1742. His stay in Canada was not a long one; he opened and closed one session of parliament, did some good public business, and that was all. Smith says of him, that \"his administration was a mild one, and his deportment that of a gentleman.\"\n\nPrevious to his connexion with us, he had been governor of Jamaica; after he left Canada, he was intrusted with the command of an expedition against the Cape of Good Hope, which he reduced, and was knighted by the king. In 1795 he proceeded to India, and was appointed commander-in-chief of Madras. In 1797, he gave up that command to take that of Bengal, as also the governorship, and commanded the army in Lucknow, which deposed the Nabob, Viser Ally, and placed Sandut Ally on the musnad of Oude; shortly afterwards in September, he was named to the high and honorable post of governor-general of India, and only resigned in April 1798, to Lord Mornington, when in May of the same year, he was appointed commander-in-chief of the forces in India. This distinguished mark of honor he resigned in 1801, and on returning to England in 1802, was raised to the rank of general. In July, 1830, he was made a field marshal; and in September, 1832, closed a long and distinguished life, in the services of his king and country, after having raised himself to one of the proudest positions in England.\n\n---\n\nHon. JOHN HALE.\n\nThe subject of this brief notice, who died in December, 1838, was a member of the Lower Canadian Legislative Council, and receiver-general of that province.\n\nMr. Hale belonged to an ancient and distinguished family in the north of England, and was allied by marriage, to the family of the late Lord Amherst, commander-in-chief of the British forces in America, who received the capitulation of Canada, at Montreal, in 1760. He was brother-in-law, we believe, of the late Earl Amherst, late governor of India.\n\nWe do not know exactly when Mr. Hale came to Canada, but he was here in 1794, with his late Royal Highness Prince Edward.\nAfter some absence from Canada, Mr. Hale returned as paymaster-general of the forces, which office he held till it was merged in the duties of the commissariat. He purchased from the De Lanaudi\u00e8re family, the seigniory of Ste. Anne de la P\u00e9rade, and lived some years at the domain, on the best of terms with the inhabitants, amongst whom he introduced several improvements. In 1824, he was appointed acting receiver-general, which office he held till the time of his death, the duties being discharged during the infirmities of his last illness, by his son, Jeffrey Hale, Esquire.\n\nMr. Hale was of the old school, with the usual liberality and independence of an English gentleman; he had some strong hereditary feeling about the duties of a public officer, which, we apprehend, were better securities than the strictest laws and superintendence in those times when offices were frequently sought and obtained through intrigue and popular favor. No one even doubted Mr. Hale's correct discharge of the duties of his situation. He neither gave nor asked for favors, ever prepared and punctual to do all that he was authorized to do, according to the regular course and the responsibilities of his office.\n\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL SIMCOE.\n\nLieutenant-General John Graves Simcoe, the first governor of Upper Canada, and the chief instrument in settling and establishing that most flourishing and prosperous of her Majesty's dependencies. He was born at the town of Cotterstock, Northamptonshire, England, in 1752, and was the son of Captain John Simcoe, commander of H. M. S. Pembroke, who was killed at Quebec, in the execution of his duty, in the year 1759, whilst assisting the ever glorious Wolfe in his siege of that city. He died at the comparatively early age of 45, leaving a wife and two children to mourn and lament the loss of \"an indulgent husband, a tender parent, and sincere friend.\"*\n\nFrom a memoir prefixed to Colonel Simcoe's Military Journal, Bartlett & Wilford, New York, 1844, we make a few extracts concerning the illustrious father of the subject of this notice.\n\n\"Though bred in the navy, and highly esteemed as an excellent officer, Captain Simcoe was peculiarly partial to the military service, and is said to have left behind him a valuable treatise\n\n*Vide epitaph to Capt. Simcoe's memory in St. Andrew's Church, Cotterstock.\non tactics in that profession. The most striking occurrence of his life, arose however, it is said from an accident, improved in a manner peculiar to genius, and extensive professional knowledge. The story is that he was taken prisoner by the French in America, and carried up the river St. Lawrence. As his character was little known, he was watched only to prevent his escape; but, from his observations in the voyage to Quebec, and the little incidental information which he was able to obtain, he constructed a chart of that river, and carried up General Wolfe to his famous attack upon the Canadian capital. He was promoted to a captaincy, in 1743, at the age of twenty-nine. Upon the trial of Admiral Byng, in 1756-7, he served as a member of the court-martial convened for that purpose, and was then aged forty-two years.\n\nOf the two children left by Captain Simcoe, as a legacy to the wide world, John Graves, was the elder; and, as his brother was drowned shortly afterwards, he became the only surviving son.\n\nOn young Simcoe first going to school at Exeter, (whither his mother had removed,) at a comparatively early age, he attracted considerable notice from all with whom he came in contact for his proficiency in everything that the school taught; and he was undoubtedly the dux of the school. Outside as well as inside, he was champion in all the manly games resorted to at an English school.\n\nAt the age of fourteen, he was removed to Eton. Here he acquired new honors. He read history with avidity, and was well versed in everything appertaining to the wars and battles of his country. We are told, that young as he was, he was bold and daring in everything he took in hand, and was formed by nature to be a soldier.\n\nAfter remaining at Eton a short time, he was removed to Merton College, Oxford. From college, in his nineteenth year, he entered the army, either he or his guardians having selected that glorious profession for him. He was appointed to an ensigncy in the 35th regiment of the line; and as hostilities had already commenced with the United States of America, he was despatched to the seat of war, to join his regiment. He arrived at Boston on the day of the battle of Bunker Hill, and took an active part afterwards, as may be seen, in the great American war, when the American colonists threw off their allegiance to Great Britain, and declared themselves independent.\n\nEnsign Simcoe, having served some time as adjutant to his own regiment, purchased the command of a company in the 40th, with which he fought at the battle of Brandywine, and where he displayed (although very young,) his courage and professional attainments by the active part he took in the day's proceedings. Unfortunately he was severely wounded at this engagement.\nThe command of a light corps, or, as it is termed the service of a partizan, is generally esteemed the best mode of instruction for those who aim at higher stations; as it gives an opportunity of exemplifying professional acquisitions, fixes the habit of self-dependence for resources, and obliges to that prompt decision, which, in the common rotation of duty, subordinate officers can seldom exhibit, yet without which, none can be qualified for any military trust of importance. To attain this employment was therefore an early object with Simcoe; nor could he be diverted from his purpose by the shameful character of dishonesty, rapine, and falsehood, supposed to attend it, at least by those who formed their judgment on the conversation of such officers, as had been witnesses to the campaigns in Germany. He had fairer examples to profit from; for the page of military history scarcely details more spirited exertions, in this kind of service, than what distinguishingly marked the last civil commotions in England; and Massey's well known saying, \"that he could not look upon the goods of any Englishman, as those of an enemy,\" delineated the integrity of the citizen, and the honorable policy of the soldier.\n\nHis intimate connexion with that most upright and zealous officer, the late Admiral Graves, who commanded at Boston in the year 1775, and some services, with which he was pleased to entrust him, made him acquainted with many of the American loyalists; from them he soon learned the practicability of raising troops in the country, whenever it should be opened to the king's forces; and the propriety of such a measure appeared to be self-evident. He, therefore, importuned Admiral Graves to ask of General Gage, that he might enlist such negroes as were in Boston. With these he put himself under the direction of Sir James Wallace, who was then actively engaged at Rhode Island, and to whom that colony had opposed negroes; adding to the admiral, who seemed surprised at his request, \"that he entertained no doubt, that he should soon exchange them for whites.\" General Gage, on the admiral's application, informed him, that the negroes were not sufficiently numerous to be serviceable, and that he had no other employment for those who were in Boston.\n\nWe make an extract from the memoir from which we have before quoted:\u2014\"Captain Simcoe, was always a soldier in his heart, and attentive to every part of his duty. He already saw that regularity in the interior economy of a soldier's life, contributed to his health, and he estimated the attention of the inferior officers by the strength of a company, or a regiment in the field. This ambition invariably led him to aspire to command; and even, when the army first landed at Staten Island, he went to New York to request the command of the Queen's Rangers, (a provincial corps, then newly raised,) though he did not obtain his desire, till after the battle of Brandywine, in October, 1777. He knew that common\nopinion had imprinted on the partizan the most dishonorable stain, and associated the idea with that of dishonesty, rapine, and falsehood.\n\n\"Yet, on the other hand, he also knew that the command of a light corps, had been considered as the best source of instruction, as a means of acquiring a habit of self-dependence for resources, and of prompt decision, so peculiarly requisite in trusts of importance.\"\n\nThe corps of Rangers claimed all the attention of the now Major-Commandant Simcoe, and contributed greatly to lessen his paternal fortune; for, though warmly alive to the interests of others, he was always inattentive to his own. We find in Rivington's Royal Gazette, printed at New York during the presence of the British army in the city, an advertisement for recruits, somewhat significant of the care and expense bestowed upon the equipment of this effective band of partizans. It is as follows:\n\n\"All aspiring heroes have now an opportunity of distinguishing themselves by joining the Queen's Ranger Hussars, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Simcoe.\n\n\"Any spirited young man will receive every encouragement, be immediately mounted on an elegant horse, and furnished with clothing, accoutrements, &c., to the amount of Forty Guineas, by applying to Cornet Spencer, at his quarters, No. 1033 Water Street, or his rendezvous, Hewitt's Tavern, near the Coffee House, and the defeat at Brandywine, on Golden Hill.\n\n\"Whoever brings a recruit shall instantly receive Two Guineas\u2014Vivat Rex et Regina.\"\n\n\"The Rangers were disciplined, not for parade but for active service. They were never to march in slow time; were directed to fire with precision and steadiness; to wield the bayonet with force and effect; to disperse and rally with rapidity. In short, in the instructions for the management of the corps, its commander seems to have anticipated the more modern tactics of the French army.\"\n\nThe Queen's Rangers, under Colonel Simcoe, acquired new laurels, and were justly celebrated, as was their leader, for their several gallant deeds and exploits. During the rest of the American war, or until their disbandment, they bore part in nearly every engagement, which took place, and were invariably successful in everything. As our task is necessarily restricted by brevity, we cannot here enumerate the many gallant actions which they performed. General Simcoe's Journal supplies everything that we have been compelled, through want of space, to omit.\n\nBut unfortunately being situated at Gloucester Point, opposite York-town, when the latter place was besieged by the allied French and American army, the Rangers, as well as the other portion of the English army, under Lord Cornwallis's command,\nwere surrendered by that nobleman to the victorious insurgents. Their noble commander, \"in ill health,\" as the Journal says, \"equally the result of excessive fatigue from his arduous services, and of vexation at the inglorious fate of his cherished soldiers,\" was transmitted to New York in the Bonetta sloop, which the British, in an article of the capitulation, reserved to themselves as a transport for their sick and wounded, to be exchanged as prisoners of war.\n\nWith the surrender of Gloucester Point, the glorious existence of the Rangers terminated. The officers were afterwards put upon half pay, and their provincial rank retained to them in the standing British army. The war of independence virtually ceased, with the capture of York-Town, and Colonel Simcoe returned to England, greatly fatigued by his late arduous duties, and greatly impaired in his constitution.\n\nThe king received him in a manner which truly showed how grateful his Majesty was for the great services he had rendered; and all classes of society received him with the most affectionate regard, and showed him every demonstration of their attachment.\n\nNot long after his return, he entered into the marriage state with Miss Guillim, a near relation to Admiral Graves, a distinguished officer, engaged in the American war. Colonel Simcoe was also elected to represent, in 1790, the borough of St. Maw's, Cornwall, in the House of Commons, which place he continued to represent, with equal honor to himself and his country until the passing of the bill dividing the province of Quebec into two provinces, to be called Upper and Lower Canada. Colonel Simcoe was judiciously selected as the first governor of Upper Canada, whither he proceeded in 1791, with his accomplished wife, and a young family.\n\nUpper Canada was then in a comparative state of wilderness; few were the settlements, and few the settlers; the population chiefly consisted, with the exception of a few whites, of Indians.\n\nWe cannot picture to ourselves, a more dismal, or a more thoroughly dejected plantation than was Upper Canada at the time of which we speak. Governor Simcoe, therefore, had not much reason to think himself honored by the appointment conferred upon him by his grateful sovereign. Nevertheless, he entered upon his duty with a resolute heart. Newark, now Niagara, was made the seat of government: Firstly,\u2014Consisting of a Legislative Assembly and Council, the former contained sixteen members only; and the latter was still smaller, and a Parliament was convened so early as the 17th September of the same year. Secondly, he appointed an Executive Council, composed of gentlemen, who had accompanied him out, and some who already resided in the province. He had the whole country surveyed, and laid out into districts, and invited as much immigration as possible, in order to swell the population. For this purpose, those parties who so nobly adhered to the cause of England in the revolted colonies (now the United States), and\nwhich are chiefly known by the sobriquet of United Empires, removed to Canada, and received a certain portion of land, free. Also discharged officers and soldiers of the line, received a certain portion of land gratuitously, and all possible means were employed to further the project of the governor. When we see the flourishing and prosperous cities, towns, and villages of Upper Canada, may we not truly say that for these we are, in the first instance, mainly indebted to that brave and gallant-hearted soldier, who left no ends untried to fulfil his duty, and to make Upper Canada a valuable and enviable dependency of the British government. A provincial corps was also raised by command of the king, and Colonel Simcoe was appointed colonel of it. This corps, he also called the \"Queen's Rangers,\" after his old regiment.\n\nIn 1796, after remaining four years at Newark, the seat of government removed to York (now Toronto), which was, at that time, a miserable collection of shanties; and this place, Governor Simcoe determined, should be the capital of the province. He accordingly, with that intention, improved the site and vicinity of this projected city to a great extent. Roads were constructed, so that a proper communication should be kept up between town and country. A schooner ran weekly, we believe, between Newark and York; and couriers were sent overland, monthly, to Lower Canada. Of course, the population increased, and the young province began to consider itself wealthy. Thus, it will be seen, in his propagations of the country's benefit, how much the governor had at heart the prosperity of the province; and he would, no doubt, have continued in his good work, and have seen the province rise, as it were from infancy to maturity, but it was decreed otherwise. In 1794 he was promoted to the rank of major-general, and in 1796, appointed to be commandant and governor of the important island of St. Domingo, which had a few years previously been wrested from the natives. Thither Simcoe with his family proceeded, and there he held the local rank of lieutenant-general.\n\nHere, though he remained only a few months, he greatly endeared himself by his kind and considerate government of the island, not only to all the residents, but to the natives themselves; and a contemporary justly remarks, that \"short as was his stay, he did more than any former general to conciliate the native inhabitants to the British government.\"\n\nIn 1798, he was created a lieutenant-general; and in 1801, when an invasion of England was expected by the French, the command of the town of Plymouth was entrusted to him. We do not hear of him again until 1806, when the last scene in this great man's life was to come to a close.\n\nFrance had long been suspected of a design to invade Portugal, and, the affair being apparent to England, public attention was called to the critical situation of that country; and as Portugal was the\nonly surviving ally of England upon the continent, means must necessarily be employed to assist her. In this critical juncture, Lieutenant-General Simcoe, and the Earl of Rosselyn, with a large staff, were immediately sent out to join the Earl of St. Vincent, who with his fleet was in the Tagus; and they were instructed to open, in concert with him, a communication with the court, so that they would ascertain whether danger was very imminent, and if so, employ means to guard against it.\n\nBut alas! in such a glorious undertaking, which probably would have crowned him with fame and honors, Simcoe was never destined to participate to any extent. On the voyage thither, he was taken suddenly ill, and had to return to England, where he had only landed, when his erratic and eventful life was brought to a close. He breathed his last at Torbay, in Devonshire, at the comparatively early age of fifty-four, after having honorably served his country during many years, in a variety of occupations, regretted by all, from the simple soldier, whom he had commanded, to the friend of his heart, and his boon companion.\n\nGeneral Simcoe, previously to his death, had been appointed as successor to Lord Lake, to the command of the troops in India; and had his life been protracted, we would no doubt have heard his name spoken of with the same warmth, the same affection, and the same honor as a Clive, a Gough, or a Clyde. As it is, although he may be forgotten, and his name may descend to obscurity in half of the places where he may have served his king's country, the name of Simcoe will be ever held in grateful remembrance, and regarded as a household word, by the majority of the people of Upper Canada. He is spoken of by Tarleton and Stedman, in their History of the Indian War, and of the Queen's Rangers. A dispatch from Sir Henry Clinton, to Lord George Germaine, 13th May, 1780, mentions in high terms Simcoe and the Rangers, saying that \"the history of the corps under his command is a series of gallant, skilful and successful enterprises against the enemy, without a single reverse; the Queen's Rangers have killed or taken twice their own numbers.\"\n\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL SHANK.\n\nDavid Shank, a veteran officer in the British army, was appointed lieutenant in the Loyalists, under the Earl of Dunmore, in Virginia. He was present at the defence of Guyns Island, and\nother skirmishes; and served as a volunteer in the battle of Long Island, August 27, 1776. In March, 1777, he received a lieutenantcy in the Queen's Rangers. He accompanied General Howe's army into New Jersey; and was engaged in the battle of Brandywine, September 11, 1777, when out of twenty-one officers of that corps, fourteen were killed and wounded. Lieutenant Shank commanded the picket of the regiment at the battle of Germantown, near Philadelphia, on the 4th October, and had the good fortune to check the column of the enemy that attacked the right of the army, for which he received the thanks of Major Wenys, who at that time commanded the regiment. Lieutenant Shank continued with the army on its retreat from Philadelphia, and was present at the battle of Monmouth. In October, 1778 he succeeded to a company. After the siege of Charlestown he returned to New York with Sir Henry Clinton, and was engaged in the skirmish at Springfield.\n\nIn August, 1779, Captain Shank was selected by Lieutenant-Colonel Simcoe to command a troop of dragoons, and he afterwards commanded the cavalry of the Queen's Rangers in the expedition to Virginia, during which he was most actively employed, particularly in a severe action at Spencer's Ordinary.\n\nAt the close of the war Captain Shank returned home, and in October, 1783, the corps being disbanded, he was placed on half pay, on which he continued, till 1791. His friend, Colonel Simcoe, being then appointed lieutenant-governor of Upper Canada, with leave to raise a small corps of four hundred rank and file, he was appointed senior officer, and left under the patronage of the Marquis of Buckingham, to raise the men in England; which being accomplished, this corps had leave to take again the name of the Queen's Rangers, were equipped as a light infantry corps, and embarked for Canada in April, 1792. He received the brevet of major, 1st March, 1794. Major-General Simcoe, on his return to Europe, left Major Shank in command of the troops in Upper Canada, in the summer of 1796. He received the rank of lieutenant-colonel, January, 1798, and in April the lieutenant-colonelcy of his regiment. He returned to England in 1799.\n\nFrom that time he continued at home, in the expectation of employment under General Simcoe, until at the peace of Amiens, the Queen's Rangers were reduced. On the 3rd September, 1803 he was appointed lieutenant-colonel in the Canadian Fencibles. He received the rank of colonel in 1808, of major-general 1811, and lieutenant-general 1821. He died at Glasgow, 16th October, 1831.\nRIGHT REV. JACOB MOUNTAIN, D.D.\n\nThe late Dr. Mountain, first Protestant bishop of Quebec, and father of the present venerable and esteemed prelate, was born at Thwaite Hall, Norfolk, in 1750.\n\nThe family was, originally, a French Protestant one, who took refuge in England, upon the revocation of the edict of Nantes, (the name having been originally Montaigne); and subsequently became possessed of a moderate landed property in the county of Norfolk. The father of his lordship, and grandfather of the present bishop, at the time of Dr. Mountain's birth, resided upon his estate at Thwaite Hall, in that county; and being much known and noticed for his agreeable and social qualities, which introduced him to a familiar intercourse with persons of a higher rank than his own, in some degree, injured his property. He died about one hundred and eight years ago, while he was yet a young man; and while Dr. Mountain, his younger son, was yet an infant; leaving his widow and four children with a sufficient independence, although far removed from wealth.\n\nThe bishop received the first part of his education at a good grammar school at Wyndham; and was afterwards removed to Norwich, where his mother then resided. He was at first designed for business; and, at the age of about fifteen, was placed for a time, with Mr. Paole, a merchant, then mayor of Norwich; but, having an utter disinclination to such pursuits, he abandoned the original intention to resume the course of his education, which was continued at Scarning under Mr. Potter, the translator of the Greek tragedies, with whom he was a favorite pupil, till he went to Cains College, in the University of Cambridge, of which he afterwards became a fellow. He was well known at the university; and, afterwards to the late Mr. Pitt; and there can be no hesitation in saying, that he enjoyed the high esteem of many distinguished characters, in the literary, political, and religious world at that day. With many of these he had the good fortune to be intimately acquainted, especially with the late Lord Bishop of Winchester, whose unabated friendship he preserved to the day of his death.\n\nIn 1781, he married Miss Eliza Kentish, co-heiress, with her two sisters, of Little Bardfield Hall, in the county of Essex, and by her had four sons, three of whom followed the profession of their father;\u2014the fourth was the late Colonel Armine Mountain, C.B., adjutant-general in India, and aid-de-camp to the Queen; he had also two daughters. He was settled at first, after his marriage, in the living of St. Andrews, Norwich. At the time of his\nbeing selected for the see of Quebec, he was examining-chaplain to the Bishop of Lincoln, (afterwards of Winchester) and held the livings of Buckden, in Huntingdonshire, and Holbeach in Lincolnshire, having previously had a stall in Lincoln cathedral; all of which preferments were conferred upon him by his lordship. He had also no very remote prospect of being advanced to further dignity in the church.\n\nIt was in 1793, that, induced by the increase of Protestant population in Canada, and especially in that part of it which had been recently constituted a separate province, under the name of Upper Canada, (which has continued almost entirely a Protestant colony,) his Majesty George III. was pleased to erect the Canadas into a diocese, according to the establishment of the Church of England; provision having been made, by an act of the 31st of his said Majesty, for the maintenance of the clergy, as part of the same plan, by means of a reservation of one-seventh of all the lands at the disposal of the Crown.\n\nDr. Mountain, having been appointed to this new diocese, arrived at Quebec on the 1st November, 1793. The charge upon which he entered, did not present a very encouraging aspect. There were but six clergymen in the whole of Lower Canada; two were placed at Quebec, and two at Montreal; and there were only three in Upper Canada. Out of the nine, five were missionaries of the Society for P. G.; the remaining four were paid by government. At Quebec, there was no church, no episcopal residence, no parsonage; yet, with the blessing of God, the indefatigable bishop overcame all these difficulties, and more of a larger and more alarming character. For thirty-two years did he preside over the Church of British North America, and raised it from nothing, as it were, to the high standard which it had attained at his death. No obstacles seemed too great for him to cope with, and no dangers too formidable for him, not to peril for the interests of the church. He was indeed the father and founder of the church of British America; and all we enjoy from its present efficient and forward state, must be, in a great measure, ascribed to his diligence, energy, perseverance and care; to him our thanks are due, and he is eminently entitled to our gratitude.\n\nTo give a true and accurate conception of his qualities of heart, and his services, we have copied an article from the Christian Remembrancer of London, published a few months after his death, which occurred on the 16th of June, 1825, at Marchmont, near Quebec, the seat of the late General Sir John Harvey, Bart., deputy adjutant-general of Canada, which sad event, called forth the universal regret of the people of the province, of all shades of parties:\n\n\"His relations and friends, indeed, will always remember him with most reverential affection, and all who knew him, with respect.\"\nThe poor will mourn him as a benefactor of no common generosity, and \"the blessing of him that was ready to perish\" will mix itself, to embalm his memory, with the surviving attachments of dependents, and the thankful recollections of many whom he has soothed in affliction, relieved in embarrassment, advised in perplexity, withheld from imprudence, reconciled in estrangement from their brethren, or led by the hand in the way of truth. Those who have known him in public business of the province will acknowledge no less his readiness and talent, than his firmness, his integrity, his droiture d'\u00e2me, his singleness of purpose, his consistency of conduct; and those with whom he acted in concert will own, that there were times when others leaned upon him in difficulty, borrowed strength from his example, and counted upon him to preserve things in their proper course. His services upon some important occasions as a member, ex officio, of both the executive and legislative councils of the province, have been most handsomely acknowledged by his Majesty's representatives. In the former capacity he sat frequently in the Court of Appeals, and in whatever he undertook, was a faithful and laborious servant of the public and of the crown. He had latterly, however, retired from all but professional occupation, and long before he wholly retired, had a strong dislike to secular business. With regard to other points, he was eminently a scholar, a gentleman, a companion, a domestic guide and comforter; and united, in a most remarkable manner, qualities which commanded respect and even awe, with a cheerful affability, and often a playfulness, which threw a charm about his society. He had a delicate and cultivated taste, and excelled, in early life, in many accomplishments, which he had discarded as trifles when he became a Bishop in the Church of Christ. Never, however, was a character more perfectly genuine: more absolutely elevated above all artifice or pretension; more thoroughly averse from all flourish or ostentation in religion, and for that reason, perhaps, his character was not by all parties fully appreciated, in the day in which his lot was cast. He was friendly, at the same time, both from feeling and principle, to all exterior gravity and decorum in sacred things; and in his own public performance of the functions proper to the episcopal office, the commanding dignity of his person, the impressive seriousness of his manner, and the felicitous propriety of his utterance, gave the utmost effect and development to the beautiful services of the church. In the pulpit, it is perhaps not too much to say, that the advantage of his fine and venerable aspect, the grace, the force, the solemn fervor of his delivery,\u2014the power and happy regulation of his tones,\u2014the chaste expressiveness and natural significance of his action, combined with the strength and clearness of his reasoning, the unstudied magnificence of his language, and that piety, that rooted faith in his Redeemer, which was, and which\nshewed itself to be, pregnant with the importance of its subject, and intent upon conveying the same feeling to others,\u2014made him altogether a preacher, who has never, in modern times, been surpassed.\"\n\nREV. JOHN STUART, D.D.\n\nThis celebrated learned, pious and zealous divine, who has been justly recognized as the father and founder of the English Church in Upper Canada, was a native of America, having been born on the 24th of February, 1740, at Harrisburg; in the state of Pennsylvania. His father, Andrew Stuart, was a rigid Presbyterian, and most tenacious in his opinions. The consequence was, that young Stuart's determination to join the Church of England gave him much uneasiness and embarrassment consequent on the opinions of his father,\u2014a parent whom he had every reason to love and venerate, but who did not yield his consent to his son's solicitation, until several years had elapsed, after his son's resolution had been taken; and even then, though he continued to adhere to that resolution, yet he would not follow it out, fearing to hurt his father's feelings. Witnessing this self-sacrifice on his son's part, Mr. Stuart gave his consent to his entering the ministry of the English Church. Young Stuart accordingly overcame all the difficulties and inconveniences of a sea voyage of that period, and proceeded to England to be ordained, which he was, and returned to Philadelphia, in the full orders of a priest in 1770. He entered at once on the duties of his high and sacred office as a missionary in the Mohawk valley, where he remained for upwards of seven years in the full execution of the object of his being placed there, viz., the civilization of the wild Indian tribes located on its banks, and the bringing them within the fold of the church. That he did his duty faithfully, manfully and energetically no one can doubt; and numerous authorities might be cited in support of our assertion. It was whilst he was thus residing in this beautiful locality, that he performed the onerous task of translating the New Testament into the Mohawk language, for the benefit of his numerous Indian converts, and others that he had hopes of making. On the breaking out of the revolutionary war, he refused to swear allegiance to the revolled colonies. He was, with great personal insult and ill usage received from the American authorities, compelled to effect his escape into\nCanada in 1781, where he was soon afterwards appointed to a chaplaincy in a provincial regiment; but notwithstanding his refusal to serve the States, his friends there wished him to return, offering him a good living, which he indignantly refused.\n\nFrom this time forth he remained in Canada; and was in nearly all parts of the upper province. There still remain some traces of his connexion with it in prosecuting his high and important duties, and in all places where he travelled, there was plenty of work for his hands; and the amount that he performed is so great, that it can hardly be estimated, not only because it benefitted our forefathers, but because it has an influence over ourselves and our destinies. Indeed, but for the indefatigable energy of this zealous prelate in laying the foundation of the church, at that early date, among the wild Indians and the still wilder white men, and in civilizing and influencing their actions, what would the upper province now be? At length, we believe in 1788, he settled down permanently at Kingston (formerly Cataraqui,) which was greatly benefitted by his presence, and where he continued to reside until the time of his death, which took place on the 15th of August, 1811, and where his body is interred.\n\nSome time previous to his death he held the appointment of Chaplain to the Legislative Council.\n\nSir J. B. Robinson in a letter to the author of the *Annals of the Colonial Church*, dated August 5th, 1847, says:\n\n\"There was something in Dr. Stuart's appearance that could not fail to make a most favorable impression. He was about six feet two inches in height\u2014not corpulent and not thin,\u2014but with fine muscular features, expanded chest, erect figure, straight, well-formed limbs, and a free manly carriage, improved by a fondness in his youth for athletic exercises, particularly fencing.\n\n\"From my recollection of him at this moment, I should say that I have seen no one who came so fully up to the idea one is led to form of a fine old Roman, a man capable of enduring and defying anything in a good cause; incapable\u2014absolutely incapable of stooping to anything in the least degree mean or unworthy.\"\n\n* * * * * * * * *\n\n\"Any one, who can speak from memory of the early days of Kingston, will tell you how much and how sincerely Dr. Stuart was loved and respected by every one; how cheerful and instructive his society was; and how amusing, from the infinity of anecdotes which his observation and his excellent memory had enabled him to collect, and keep always in readiness, to illustrate his lessons, and impress more strongly his good advice, and the cautions which were often addressed to his young friends.\"\nJUDGE THORPE.\n\nThis gentleman, who was a puisn\u00e9 judge of Upper Canada in 1805, and the shameful manner in which he was dismissed from that office by Mr. Francis Gore, after only holding it a short time, and for no cause whatever for which he should be ashamed\u2014his only object being to effect \"the strict and upright discharge of his duty, unawed by power, uninfluenced by land, and unbiased by party, or prejudice,\" as it is correctly stated in some of the histories of Canada, was one of the most upright and conscientious men that ever breathed; and had not Mr. Francis Gore and the \"Family Compact Party\" taken such a dislike to him and worked his ruin, and had he been allowed to pursue the even tenor of his way\u2014he would have been an honor and credit to the bench of Canada: such however was not to be his destiny. A part of the people, the home district honoring and respecting his character, which was most unlike that of many of the subservient office holders of the lieutenant-governor, wished to return him as their representative to Parliament\u2014he accepted their invitation to be their candidate, and from that day, his ruin was determined on by the government. All the most powerful engines of the state were set against him to prevent his return, and all the most unscrupulous practices were resorted to.\n\nGovernor Gore at last got the colonial office to recall Mr. Thorpe, and that gentleman proceeded to England; but it must have been a subject of gratification and gladness to him afterwards, to see the very man who had triumphed over him, and got him recalled recalled himself; and in a suit which he brought against Gore for libel, he came off victorious.\n\nGourlay relates, that Mr. Thorpe was afterwards appointed chief-justice to Sierra Leone, and remained there two years, when he had to return to England for the benefit of his health. Some inhabitants of the colony having requested him to bear home a petition, complaining of certain abuses of power in that quarter, he complied; but what was the consequence? For this simple act, which could proceed only from a humane and obliging disposition, he was deprived of his appointment by Lord Bathurst, and in age and infirmity, and with a young family, consigned to poverty and neglect. The truth is, Thorpe was too honest and upright in principle to be an office holder of that period.\nGENERAL ROBERT PRESCOTT.\n\nGeneral Robert Prescott was a native of England, where he was born, in 1725. His family came from Lancashire, where in the time of James II. they had a landed estate, which they lost at the time of the Duke of Monmouth's rebellion, and the subsequent revolution. He served in the American war, as well as his elder brother, General William Prescott. In October, 1793, he was ordered to Barbadoes, to take the command there, and in February, 1794, he sailed with troops to Martinique, where he landed without opposition. Some months were spent in effecting the complete reduction of the island and forts, which capitulated on the 22nd March, after much opposition, and where he underwent many personal dangers and privations; he was afterwards appointed civil governor of the island, where his wise and judicious management prevented rebellion amongst the natives. The home government, under Sir C. Grey and Sir J. Jervis, were most severe upon the natives; and General Prescott wrote a letter to his Majesty George III., through Lord Amherst, expostulating on the measures they adopted, which was well received; and his honest and upright conduct caused his character to be highly appreciated at home. From Martinique he was sent to Guadaloupe, where he pursued the same system, and at this time refused the government of St. Lucia, which was offered him. Finding that it was impossible to effect much at Guadaloupe, he drew off all the British troops there, and sent some to Antigua, some to Dominica, and the rest to Martinique, where he returned himself. He suffered much at this time from the fatigue and anxiety he had undergone, which affected his health. It proved how much the French estimated his character, that\u2014had they effected the storming of Fort Mathilda, at Guadaloupe, in which he resided\u2014express orders were given out that particular care should be taken to spare General Prescott's life, the rest of the garrison to take the fate of war. At this time he had applied for leave to return home; and, having received permission to do so, on the 15th of January, 1795, he sailed for England under a salute of guns, and arrived at Spithead, on the 10th February. On the 10th April, 1796, he received his orders and instructions to relieve Lord Dorchester at Quebec, and take the command there; and on the 12th he embarked with his family at Portsmouth, and reached Quebec on the 18th of June. Lord Dorchester did not know that he was to be recalled until General Prescott arrived to supersede him. The former sailed for England on 9th July. General Prescott immediately com-\nmenced his plan for strengthening the forts of Quebec. He received his commission as governor of Nova Scotia, 1797.\n\nHe remained in the government of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, until the year 1799, when he was recalled, and Lieutenant-Governor Milnes appointed in his place. The general then returned to England, and finally settled at Rose Green, near Battle, in Sussex, where he died in December, 1815, in the 89th year of his age. He was buried in the old church at Winchelsea.\n\nDuring his administration, here nothing of great importance took place, except perhaps the insane attempt of David McLean to tamper with the loyalty of the people and endeavour to take Quebec, in which chimerical undertaking he lost his head.\n\nThe governor was well liked, being a gentleman of pleasing manners, much urbanity, and possessed of a kind disposition for all.\n\n---\n\nHON. CHIEF-JUSTICE OSGOODE.\n\nWilliam Osgoode was born in March 1754; and, at the early age of fifteen, was admitted as a commoner of Christ College, Oxford; where he proceeded to his degrees, and became M.A. in July, 1777. His inclination determined him to the study of the law; for which purpose he became a student in the Inner Temple in 1773, having been before admitted at Lincoln's-Inn. Possessing only a small paternal property, by no means adequate to his support, Mr. Osgoode seriously engaged in the study of his profession, and with such success, that in 1779, he published a learned and judicious tract in 4to. entitled, \"Remarks on the Laws of Descent, and the Reasons assigned by Mr. Justice Blackstone for rejecting, in his Table of Descent, a point of Doctrine laid down by Plowdon, Lord Bacon, and Hale.\" When he had completed his terms, he was called to the bar; but, being more studious of propriety than volubility of speech, never became distinguished as a pleader. He had, indeed, a sort of hesitation, not organic, but, if we may so term it, mental; which led him frequently to pause for expressions, when his thoughts were most stored with knowledge. But the accuracy of his professional information, and the soundness of his judgment, could not escape notice; and the new colony of Upper Canada having been established in 1791, Mr. Osgoode was appointed, in the following year, to go out as chief-justice of that province; for which he sailed in April 1792, in the same ship with\nGeneral Simcoe, the lieutenant-governor. It was owing probably to the friendly regard of General Simcoe, that the name of Osgoode has obtained a local establishment in Upper Canada, having been conferred upon a township in Dundas county, near the river Rideau, and given to the seats of law at the capital, (Toronto, Canada West.)\n\nThe conduct of Mr. Osgoode was so much approved, as chief-justice of the new province, that in a very short time (we believe in 1794,) he was advanced to the same office in the province of Quebec, now Lower Canada. He there obtained universal esteem and respect by the independent steadiness and firmness of his conduct, as well as by ability and integrity in his judicial office. But he became weary, after a time, of a situation which banished him so far from the friendships and connections of his early years; and in 1801, he resigned his office, and retired to England, on his official pension. This, together with his own property, and what he had been able to lay past, made him now completely independent; and, being determined to enjoy the advantages of that state without molestation, he neither sought to be elected into Parliament, nor would accept of any public situation.\n\nHaving been disappointed, as it is supposed, in an attachment which he formed at Quebec, he always remained unmarried; and after residing some time in the Temple, purchased a noble set of apartments in Albany House, where he died, January 17, 1824. He there lived, in the enjoyment of society, to the period above-mentioned, universally esteemed, and never tempted from his resolution of remaining free from office, except in the case of two or three temporary commissions of a legal nature; which, from a conviction of his qualifications and integrity, were in a manner forced upon him. In these he was joined with Sir William Grant, and other great ornaments of the law. The last of them, which was for examining into the fees of office in the courts of law, (in which he was united with the then accountant-general, and lord chief baron,) was nearly brought to a conclusion at the time of his death. His health had generally been good till within a few years of this time, when he began to be an occasional sufferer from fits of the stone. He did not, however, die of that complaint; but was probably removed from sufferings much more acute, by the attack which carried him off, (inflammation of the lungs.)\n\nHis opinions were independent, but zealously loyal; nor were they ever concealed, or the defense of them abandoned, when occasions called them forth. His conviction of the excellence of the English Constitution sometimes made him severe in the reproof of measures which he thought injurious to it; but his politeness and good temper prevented any disagreement, even with those whose sentiments were most opposed to his own. To estimate his\ncharacter rightly, it was, however, necessary to know him well; his first approaches being cold, amounting almost to dryness. But no person admitted to his intimacy ever failed to conceive for him that esteem which his conduct and conversation always tended to augment. He died in affluent circumstances, the result of laudable prudence, without the smallest taint of avarice, or illiberal parsimony. On the contrary, he lived generously; and though he never wasted his property, yet he never spared, either to himself or friends, any reasonable indulgence; nor was he ever backward in acts of charity or benevolence. Such was the unbiassed testimony of a friend and correspondent, attached to him for more than fifty years, and who with many others, lamented the loss of his society.\n\nHON. JUSTICE COCHRAN.\n\nTHOMAS COCHRAN, one of the assistant judges of Upper Canada, was a native of Halifax, N.S., and the eldest son of the late Hon. Thomas Cochran, many years a member of his Majesty's council in that province, and was born at Halifax in 1777. From a very early age, he was distinguished by his good sense, amiable disposition, manliness of character, and great attention to his studies. He was always fond of associating with persons older than himself, from whose knowledge and behavior he could derive improvement; and in consequence of this, before he was twelve years old, his modest and well-formed manners were held up for the imitation of all his young companions. He received most of his education at the seminary at Windsor in that province, which was endowed by George III., and established by a royal charter. He was then under the care of the Rev. Dr. Coohran, who was not related to him, but always particularly fond and justly proud of such a pupil, whose excellent character, grateful affection towards his tutor, and rising eminence, were sources of great pleasure and honorable satisfaction to him. Early in 1794, he went to Quebec, where he remained more than a year, when he acquired a perfect knowledge of the French language, without neglecting his other studies; and recommended himself there, as at every other place of his residence, to a numerous and very respectable circle of acquaintance. In the following year he returned to Halifax, and sailed for England; and, being intended for the bar, became a student at Lincoln's-Inn. He had not\nreached his twentieth year, when he was left entirely his own master, amid the gaiety, the dissipation, and the powerful temptations of London, and almost without control in his expenses. But it was his peculiar happiness, at this critical period, to obtain, very deservedly, the good opinion of some eminently-virtuous and valuable friends, in whose families he passed most of his leisure hours, and from whose kind advice and excellent example he derived the most important benefit. His respectful affection and heartfelt gratitude to those persons would never have been diminished in the latest hours of a long life; and he has often declared that he considered the paternal regard and steady valuable friendship of two persons in particular, the late Sir Rupert George, and Mr. Parke of Lincoln's-Inn, among the most distinguished blessings bestowed upon him by a kind Providence. In 1801, he was called to the bar, and joined the Chester circuit, to the members of which he was so much endeared, that, when he was obliged to leave them, they presented him with a very flattering and splendid memorial of their affectionate regard, which he always valued very highly. In the same year, in consequence of the most honorable testimonials of his character and qualifications, he was appointed chief-justice of Prince Edward Island. Perhaps he was the youngest chief-justice known in the history of England or its colonies; but a more judicious appointment was seldom made, as the event fully proved. Great care had been taken that his religious principles might be well and early formed; and he was always regular and exemplary in the performance of his religious duties. But this appointment to a situation which he considered above his years, and the death of his father, which happened very soon after, while he was on a voyage to America, greatly increased the impression which religion had already made upon his mind. At this time he became a devout communicant, and continued to the hour of his death, an humble, sincere, and fervent believer in Christ. He found the island to which he was appointed, like most small governments, divided by little parties; but his uniformly kind and affectionate demeanor, and his inflexible integrity as a judge and a legislator, obtained for him the respect and esteem of all persons. His removal from them, after a little more than a year's acquaintance, when he was appointed one of the assistant judges in Upper Canada, occasioned great and universal regret, which was expressed with much genuine feeling, in addresses which were presented to him at his departure from the island. In Canada he was equally respected and beloved. He was lost, in company with Mr. Gray, the solicitor-general, by the wreck of the government schooner Speedy, in Lake Ontario, on the 7th October, 1804, whilst on his way to hold a court at Newcastle. In the province of Halifax he was universally known, and as universally beloved by all classes of people. Though this very remarkable young man was called away\nin the flower of his age, before he had completed his twenty-eighth year, it is a great consolation to reflect that his short life was eminently useful, exemplary, and brilliant.\n\nSIR ROBERT SHORE MILNES, BART.\n\nThis gentleman, who was appointed lieutenant-governor of the province in 1799, administered its government during the absence of General Prescott, who was then governor-general, was the eldest son of John Milnes, Esq., of Wakefield, England, a magistrate and deputy-lieutenant for the West Riding of Yorkshire, by Mary, daughter of Samuel Shore, of Sheffield, Esq., and was born in 1746. In the early portion of his life he was an officer in the Royal Regiment of Horse Guards, blue. In 1795, he was appointed governor of the Island of Martinique, and in 1799, lieutenant-governor of Lower Canada. He was created a baronet, by patent, dated March 21, 1801, and died about the year 1836. He enjoyed two pensions on the civil list of England.\n\nHe continued to hold office here until 1803, when he obtained leave of absence to proceed to England. He did not return. His government was marked by nothing extraordinary; the country was calm, the people contented. With the latter he was not a popular governor.\n\nHON. THOMAS DUNN.\n\nA most enlightened, able-minded and impartial legislator, who, on two occasions, as senior member of the Executive Council of Lower Canada, became administrator of the government of that province. In this high capacity, he displayed much wisdom and prudence in his relations with the legislature and the people, and conducted the affairs of the country with much judicious foresight. He first assumed the administratorship on the departure of Sir R. S. Milnes in 1805; and in February 1806, opened the legislature.\nThe United States, assuming a hostile attitude towards us, he, on the 12th of August, issued a proclamation prohibiting the exportation of munitions of war. On the 19th of the same month, in consequence of the preparations for war making within the lines, he ordered a levy to be made of one-fifth of the militia from the ages of 18 to 50. This order was promptly responded to; and he had occasion to bear testimony to the zeal and activity displayed by the people for the defence of the country, unequalled as it was in any of her Majesty's dominions.\n\nOn the question of recognizing the Roman Catholic bishop, and allowing him to take the oath, he took a determined stand against Mr. Ryland, and supported Bishop Plessis, and deemed it but common justice to do so. In the suit between M. Bertrand, the curate, and the parishioner, Lavergne, wherein the crown officers, Messrs. Sewell and Monk, endeavored to declare the ordinance of 1791 null, as contrary to a penal statute of Elizabeth, he again supported the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nHe again became advocate on the departure of Governor Craig; and continued in that till the arrival of Sir George Prevost, in 1811. During the time he held office he permitted Monseigneur Panet to be elected to the coadjutorship. He was also a puisn\u00e9 judge of the court of King's Bench, a member of the Legislative Council, and a Lower Canadian seignior. He married in the country a Miss Henrietta Guichaud.\n\nHe was immensely popular with the French Canadian people, and the greater portion of the English population.\n\nA son of his, (still living), Major General William Dunn, is a distinguished military officer, and has risen to his present high rank after having seen much hard service.\n\n---\n\nHon. CHIEF-JUSTICE HENRY ALCOCK.\n\nOf the particulars of this gentleman's history, beyond his official connection with this country, we are not aware.\n\nThe first public situation he held in Canada was that of puisn\u00e9 judge of Upper Canada, in which section of the province he was afterwards raised to the chief-justiceship; and was subsequently promoted to that of Lower Canada, at that time a far more important and remunerative office. He took a great interest in the progress of the colony; and, if we are to believe some authorities, he\ndid much, in his high position, to forward her best interests; and became, in consequence, very popular. In Lower Canada, as a member of the Executive Council, he was not so successful; for in that assembly, we understand, he was generally disliked. Indeed it is difficult to account for the bitter invectives used against him in history in every other respect.\n\nOn the bench, however, he was more highly esteemed; as we may gather from the following notice of him in the Quebec Mercury, on recording his death:\n\n\"In the exercise of his judicial duties, he evinced the advantages which attend the forming of a legal scholar at the English bar; and in all the various offices which he filled, he acquitted himself an able judge, distinguished by the most eminent rectitude and unwearied assiduity. His memory was retentive; his judgment clear and penetrating; and so profound was his knowledge of English law, that the energies of his mind cast a luminous ray over the dark and abstruse code of provincial jurisprudence. His language was classical and perspicuous; nor can those, who have heard his judgments, remember them without a mixture at once of pleasure and regret. In the habitudes of private life, his manners were those, which are commonly said to be peculiar to a \"plain English man,\" affable, conciliating, unaffected. In a word, his public and private virtues will long live in the hearts of both the old and the new subjects of this province; and his death will be felt with a general and unfeigned sorrow.\"\n\nHe died on the 22nd February, 1808.\n\n---\n\nHon. HERMAN WITSIUS RYLAND.\n\nTo publish this volume without giving some notice of the above distinguished man, would be doing a palpable wrong; nor can his name in justice be left out of the range of \"Canadian Celebrities,\" among whom he certainly figures to a considerable extent in the history of the lower province, where he held office for a lengthened period, and was connected in an official capacity with many successive governments. Mr. Ryland was a native of Northampton, England; and was born in the year 1770. He entered the public service at the early age of twenty-one, as assistant paymaster-general to General Burgoyne, and Lord Cornwallis's forces in the first American war, in which sanguinary struggle he\nAND PERSONS CONNECTED WITH CANADA.\n\ntook part until its close, on the evacuation of New York, (where he rendered important service.) He accompanied to England, Sir Guy Carleton (Lord Dorchester), the commander-in-chief, and his future friend and patron. When Lord Dorchester was appointed to the government of British North America, in 1793, Mr. Ryland was induced by the then prime minister of England, to accompany him to Canada, as civil secretary, a post for which he was eminently fitted and adapted; and it may truly be said, that, during the time Lord Dorchester governed this country, Mr. Ryland ruled its destinies, which is a fact too well known to be contradicted. On Lord Dorchester returning home, Mr. Ryland was appointed to the same office, which he had held under him, by his lordship's immediate successor and several succeeding governors; so popular, so highly recommended, and so efficient was he in his appointment. He took part in everything that appertained to the government and the country; was appointed a legislative councillor, and often in his seat in that body, (although holding a government appointment), he would openly censure the government if they had done aught which he did not consider consistent with the due performance of their duties.\n\nHe was appointed by the government to proceed to England, on a public mission,\u2014the ostensible object of which was to endeavor to get the Imperial Government to amend or suspend the constitution\u2014to render the government independent of the people, by appropriating towards it the revenues accruing from the estates of the St. Sulpicians of Montreal, and of the Order of Jesuits, and to seize the patronage exercised by the Roman Catholic bishop of Quebec, to the cur\u00e9s or church livings in his diocese. Although the nation was deeply engaged in war, and much engaged otherwise, yet by his indefatigable energy, Mr. Ryland got the objects of his mission taken into consideration; and, but for the intervention of the lord chancellor, Eldon, he would have assuredly succeeded in two of them. As it was, the whole affair proved a failure; and he returned to Canada without gaining one single point; he was, however, well received, and no one ascribed to him the failure of the government scheme. He clearly showed how eminently fitted he was for the post of a diplomatist. The correspondence, which, on this occasion, passed between him and the public functionaries, forms a pleasing and interesting portion of the sixth volume of Christie's History of Canada. We may truly say of him that, had he been cast in a different sphere, where his talents and attainments would have been more properly appreciated and directed, he would have made his way onward, and kept even pace with his illustrious patron.\n\nHe early assumed an antagonistic attitude against the French Canadians and their clergy. As Christie says, \"The darling project of his heart, was to anglicize but by means compulsory and\ndistasteful to them, the French Canadian people; who, having no wish to be anglicized by any means, would not be so 'by compulsion.' The consequence was that a bitter feeling arose, for a time, between Mr. Ryland and the Canadians, and indeed against the government, Mr. R., being regarded as the 'fountain head' of power. Another scheme of his was to endeavour to abrogate the power of, and indeed to do away altogether with the French bishops, contending that in reality there was no bishop, for he had never been recognized. This was most unsound reasoning; and in course, everything that he did to further his views proved abortive. But who is there that does not err sometimes, especially in reasoning and argument?\"\n\nOn Sir George Prevost's accession to the government, Mr. Ryland gave up his post as civil secretary, and retained only that of clerk of the Executive Council, also an important appointment, which he held until his decease, which occurred at his seat, Beauport, near Quebec, on the 20th July, 1838, at the age of 68. Mr. Ryland was a man of great literary attainments; and, despite what some people may say to the contrary, of good ability. In politics, he was a conservative with enlarged views, and unmistakable honesty of purpose; and, as in private life, no man was ever more beloved; so, in public life, no man in Canada was ever more respected by all classes of society, notwithstanding the frequent contentions and heart-burnings of party warfare, which frequently existed, but eventually passed away.\n\nHis son is the present registrar of Montreal.\n\nD. Mcgregor Rogers, Esq., M.P.\n\nAn enlightened legislator of Upper Canada. In 1790, when a young man, and during his absence in New England, he was elected a member of the second provincial Parliament of Upper Canada, for the county of Prince Edward. In 1800 he was again elected in the same county, and during the three succeeding parliaments, was successively returned for the county of Northumberland, to which he had then removed. In 1816 he declined being a candidate on account of some unsatisfied claims for services performed during the late war, being unwilling to trust himself as a representative of the people, while dependent on government. In 1820, his claims having been satisfied, he was again elected, as he was also in 1824,\nbut he died on the day of his election, 18th July, at the age of 53. Besides being a member of Parliament, he held several offices of trust and emolument, the duties of which he discharged with credit to himself, and to the satisfaction of all concerned. In his political opinions, he was a warm admirer of the British Constitution; yet during the twenty-four years he was a member of Parliament, the rights and interests of the people were by no one more carefully watched or more zealously and faithfully defended than by him.\n\nLIEUTENANT-GENERAL PETER HUNTER\n\nLieutenant-General Hunter, who succeeded General Simcoe in the government of Upper Canada in 1799, and at the same time was appointed commander-in-chief of the forces in Canada, was a member of a very talented Scotch family, and a brother of the celebrated Doctors William and John Hunter of London, the eminent writers of some invaluable works on medicine. He was born in the year 1746, and like them, was entirely dependent upon his own abilities and resources for his advancement. Having entered the military service, he evinced considerable talent in the profession; saw some hard service, and rose to the high rank which he held at his death. His administration of the government of Upper Canada was marked with much benefit to that province; and it would not be going too far to say that to his enlightened policy and administration of affairs, that portion of Canada is greatly indebted for many benefits which it otherwise would never have known. He died at Quebec on the 21st August, 1805, whilst on a tour of military inspection. A monument has been erected to his memory in the English cathedral of that city, of which we give the inscription:\n\nSacred to the memory of\nLieutenant-General Peter Hunter,\nLieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada and Commander-in-Chief of his Majesty's forces in both the Canadas,\nwho died at Quebec, on the 21st August, 1805,\naged 59 years.\n\nHis life was spent in the service of his king and country.\nOf the various stations, both civil and military, which he filled,\nHe discharged the duties with spotless integrity,\nunwearied zeal, and successful abilities.\nThis memorial to a beloved brother, whose mortal part rests in the adjacent place of burial,\nis erected by John Hunter, M.D., of London.\nHON. CHIEF-JUSTICE ELMSLEY.\n\nJohn Elmsley was born in England, the year 1762; he died at Montreal on the 29th April, 1805. He was a nephew of the celebrated London bookseller of that name, and a great friend of the then Duke of Portland, to whom he owed his appointment in this country. He was speaker of the Legislative Council of Lower Canada, and a member of the Executive Council, as well as chief-justice, to which he was appointed October 13, 1802, previous to which he had served as a puisn\u00e9 judge in Upper Canada. He was a gentleman of great professional talents and application, as well as of the most amiable demeanor. The Quebec Mercury said at the period of his death: \"His private virtues, not less than his public talents, for both of which he was eminently distinguished, will long be subjects of unfeigned regret.\"\n\nHON. MR. JUSTICE FOUCHER.\n\nLouis Charles Foucher, a puisn\u00e9 judge of the court of Queen's Bench, Lower Canada, was born in 1760, and died 26th of December, 1829. He was admitted to the bar in 1784, and was first returned to Parliament in 1796, as member for the city of Montreal. Some time after, he was appointed solicitor-general, an honor no doubt well merited by M. Foucher, else he could not have attained it, as in those days it was seldom conferred upon a French Canadian. Subsequently he became resident judge of Three Rivers; and in 1803, attained the position which he held at his death. The House of Assembly of Lower Canada brought charges against him for misdemeanor and delinquency in the exercise of his functions, and prayed for his dismissal. The matter was left to the adjudication of the Prince Regent, who decided in his favor, and thus he retained the judgeship.\nLIEUT.-COLONEL JOSEPH BOUCHETTE.\n\nOne of the ablest topographers of the age. He was born in Canada in 1774, and was the son of Commodore Bouchette,* who distinguished himself by an exploit which history has recorded,\u2020 and which is well known to have prevented the threatened surrender of the Canadas to the arms of America, as \"the taking General Carlton (Lord Dorchester), which appeared almost certain, would have rendered their fate inevitable.\" Commodore Bouchette, however, landed the commander-in-chief in safety at Quebec, after escaping the most imminent danger that menaced them in their descent of the St. Lawrence from Montreal to Quebec, the banks of the river being occupied by the enemy, who were bivouacked on the shores of its narrow passes.\n\nAs early as the year 1790, Lieutenant-Colonel Bouchette was employed as a draftsman in the office of his late uncle, the Hon. Major Holland, then surveyor-general of British North America, and subsequently of Lower Canada, after the division of the province of Quebec. In 1791 he was tempted to follow the profession of his father, and in consequence entered the provincial navy, and sailed on the great Lakes in Upper Canada till 1796. In the year 1794, at a very early period of his life, he succeeded, through the most vigorous exertions, to raise and save his Majesty's war vessel Anondaga (the commodore's ship), carrying 14 guns, which had been cast away in York (now Toronto) harbour, and totally abandoned as lost; and taking the command, he sailed with her to Niagara, where he was received amidst the cheers of the garrison and others assembled on the shores to greet the arrival of the rescued vessel.\n\nThis service elicited the unqualified approbation of Lord Dorchester, and \"Young Bouchette\" was promoted on the 12th of May, 1794, to the rank of second-lieutenant in the provincial navy.\n\nHe continued in the command of an armed vessel until 1798,\n\n* \"Captain Bouchette commands the naval force on Lake Ontario, and is at the head of the marine establishments, yet without the least power in money matters. This gentleman possesses the confidence both of Lord Dorchester and Governor Simcoe. He is a Canadian by birth, but entered the British service when Canada fell into the power of England. While Arnold and Montgomery were besieging Quebec, Lord Dorchester, disguised as a Canadian, stole on board his ship into that city; on which occasion he displayed much activity, intrepidity and courage. It is not at all a matter of surprise that Lord Dorchester should bear in mind this eminent service. By all accounts he is altogether incorruptible, and an officer who treats his inferiors with great mildness and justice.\"\u2014Travels of the Duc de la Rochefoucault Liancourt in North America.\n\n\u2020 Adolphus's History of the Reign of George III.\nduring which period he made surveys of the most important harbours on Lake Ontario, including the harbour of York, previous to that place being established as a military post and town in 1793.\n\nThe provincial navy was partially reduced in 1796, and it was Lieutenant Bouchette's lot, as a junior officer (then commanding an armed vessel), to be included in the reduction. Owing, however, to the illness of officers who remained in command, he continued on duty for several months afterwards, successively commanding the vessels of those officers who were victims to the fever and ague then so generally prevalent. His activity meanwhile had not been altogether unnoticed, for he immediately obtained an unsolicited lieutenancy in the first battalion of Royal Canadian Volunteers; and having raised his quota of men, continued in that provincial corps until its reduction in 1802.\n\nBeing known to possess some nautical knowledge, he was selected, in 1797, to command an armed row-galley, with a detachment of thirty men of his regiment, and four artillerymen, to cruise between Quebec and Montreal, in order to detect certain treasonable practices which led to the execution of Colonel McLean, an American, at the former place. This service afforded Colonel Bouchette an opportunity of conveying much valuable information to government, relative to the soundings, &c., of the harbour of Montreal, and several other sections of the St. Lawrence.\n\nIn 1800 he was the officer chosen by order of his Royal Highness the late Duke of Kent, then commander of his Majesty's forces in North America, to repair to Halifax with a detachment of his regiment, to acquire a more uniform system of military tactics, and subsequently conveying the same to his own regiment, which he effected to the entire satisfaction of the commander-in-chief in Canada, by whom he was appointed adjutant of the regiment.\n\nBy this time Major Holland, the companion in arms of the immortal Wolfe, had become, through age and infirmity, in some measure inadequate to the duties of his laborious office of surveyor-general, and Lieutenant Bouchette was in consequence attached to his department. After Major Holland's death in 1803, he was appointed deputy surveyor-general, and in the following year received his Majesty's commission of surveyor-general of Lower Canada, and thus became the successor of his venerable uncle.\n\nDuring the American war in 1812, the defence of Canada seemed to require additional strength, and Colonel Bouchette proposed to levy a corps to be called the Quebec Volunteers; and at the eve of realizing his project, his corps (raised by beat of drum to the number of 260 men, rank and file, in seven weeks, and then under arms doing garrison duty,) was by a change of policy, drafted into other provincial regiments requiring immediate reinforcements.\n\nWith the suppression of the Quebec Volunteers, however, his\nmilitary services did not terminate. He was actively employed during the campaign of 1813, and even up to the 27th July, 1814, in conveying important despatches from head-quarters to Major-General Sir R. Sheaffe, commanding in Upper Canada, with confidential instructions, to report on the general defensive state of the frontier, whether possessing any interesting posts, and at the same time to reconnoitre and ascertain the position and strength of the enemy as he proceeded. For this service he received high commendation; and his views of the defenceless state of York, now Toronto, and of the manner in which it would be taken by the enemy, proved but too prophetic.\n\nIn November, 1813, at a very critical juncture, he was ordered to repair to Lachine, whither it had been found expedient to assemble a considerable force, and on the 9th that place became the head-quarters. He accompanied the commander of the forces to Coteau du Lac, where he received important reconnoitering instructions. The American generals, Hampton and Wilkinson, were at this period concerting a junction of their respective armies; the one marching into the province by the Chateauguay country, whilst the other descended the St. Lawrence. Their project was frustrated, and ended in a repulse and precipitate retreat within the limits of their own territory. Colonel Bouchette had, however, previously followed up closely his instructions, and did not return to Lachine until he had ascertained the strength and position of the enemy at the cross-roads, some miles above McMartin's mills, on the Rivi\u00e8re aux Raisins, and, under cover of the night, proceeded in a canoe with two Indians to the mouth of that river, crossed over to the south side of Lake St. Francis, near the Salmon river, to watch the movements of the enemy, then in full retreat; being uncertain, however, whether they meant to proceed farther down the St. Lawrence (although about entering Salmon river), he immediately went down the Beauharnois channel, ascertained the condition and situation of the gun-boats, and having put the forces on that line of military communication on their guard, he repaired to head-quarters to submit his report.\n\nOn the 17th July, 1814, the governor-in-chief directed that he should proceed to the frontier, towards La Colle and Odel town, to sketch the roads leading from thence into the province, and, at the same time, to reconnoitre the enemy who were stationed at Champlain town. A detachment of forty men of the Voltigeurs and thirty Indians, accompanied him on this service, which was characterized by General Heriot as having been performed by Colonel Bouchette \"with much credit to himself, and to the admiration of the army.\"\n\nIn the month of August following, the project he had long conceived, of publishing a topographical and geographical exhibit and description of Canada, being matured, notwithstanding the\nvarious other objects of a military character he had been called upon to attend to, he sailed from Canada for England, on board the man-of-war Ajax, for the purpose of personally superintending the publication of his work. The colonial patronage this work received from the governor-in-chief and provincial legislature paved the way to the distinguished countenance and auspices under which it was afterwards produced to the world.\n\nColonel Bouchette, whilst in England, was nominated surveyor-general under the several articles of the treaty of Ghent, for establishing the boundary between his Majesty's possessions in America and the United States. After his appointment, he prepared, at the instance of the commissioners, and the agent under that treaty, a project of operations for the year 1817, which he submitted to the board at Boston. In the spring of that year he commenced his field operations; and after erecting a monument, in conjunction with the American surveyor, at the source of the river St. Croix, from whence the land boundary departs, he proceeded in the establishment of the due north line from that point, dividing New Brunswick from the state of Maine, to the highlands: continuing, however, the exploring line, to the extent of one hundred miles, in the wilderness, making numerous exploring surveys of the various rivers intersected in his progress, and sketching the face of the country, frequently from the summit of the loftiest trees, to the imminent peril of his life.\n\nBy these arduous means he ascertained the position of the several ridges of highlands stretching westward from the exploring line, and was enabled to judge, from their continuity and elevation, which ridge was most likely to become the boundary between both territories, in virtue of the fifth article of the treaty of Ghent.\n\nThe result of his labors, during the summer of 1817, was conveyed to the board of commissioners in extensive and explanatory plans, sections, and reports, for which he received the commendation of the board, and upon which the strongest arguments of his Majesty's agent were chiefly grounded, in claiming the whole extent of country north of Mars Hill ridge of highlands, which is that pointed out by Colonel Bouchette as the legitimate boundary between that part of the British possessions and the territory of the United States. And although the Ashburton Treaty has since yielded to the pretensions of the U. S., to a boundary much further north, and coming within a few miles of the St. Lawrence, it is now generally admitted that the line of boundary pointed out by Colonel Bouchette, was that upon which the British negotiator should have insisted.\n\nThe ensuing season, he was proceeding to the establishment of the geographical boundary, on the 45th parallel of north latitude, when he was taken dangerously ill, at Montreal, on his return from Burlington, where he had met the Board, and received its\nencomiums for his field services of 1817; and from the continuance of his illness during part of the summer, the service was performed by Mr. Tierks, as his Britannic Majesty's astronomer.\n\nIn 1827, with a view of ascertaining the statistics of Lower Canada, he visited all parts of the province, and devoting himself to long and laborious researches, he deduced explanatory reports and tabular statistical statements that met with the marked approbation of his Majesty's representative in the colony.\n\nAvailing himself of these several tours as a means of perfecting his topographical work on Lower Canada, he solicited from the seigneurs copies of the plans of their respective fiefs and seigneuries, and was enabled to compile maps of the province still more voluminous and correct than the former; and desirous of rendering the information thus acquired as generally useful as possible, not only to the government, but to the public in the mother country and the colony, he repaired to England in 1830, under the formal sanction and support of the provincial legislature, and the approbation of the executive government, to superintend the publication of a new work on the topography, geography, and statistics of Lower Canada, which grew out of the materials studiously collected during the previous fifteen years with a view to the accomplishment of that object.\n\nColonel Bouchette's public works were printed and published in England, on a scale of magnificence which rendered them costly to the author, and too expensive for very general circulation. His first work appeared in 1816, under the special auspices of the Prince Regent, afterwards George IV., who personally took a warm interest in the work, and received it from the hands of the author in a private audience at Carleton Palace.\n\nColonel Bouchette's second work, \"The British dominions in North America,\" and the maps which accompanied it, published in 1831, were by special permission dedicated to the late king, William IV., to whom the author had the honor of presenting his work in person.\n\nColonel Bouchette at the periods to which we refer, appears to have been not only appreciated as an author of public works of interest, but was received with favor and distinction at court, a circumstance no doubt attributable to the late Duke of Kent, whose generous influence and royal protection followed Colonel Bouchette in every phase of his career in England.\n\nColonel Bouchette died at Montreal on the 9th April 1841, and was buried in the church of Notre Dame in that city. We cannot in concluding this memoir, do better than to quote the following passage, taken from one of the many obituary notices of his death, which appeared in the public journals of the time.\n\n\"For sentiments of loyalty to his Sovereign, and he honestly and faithfully served not less than four of them, for his veneration and...\"\nattachment to constitutional government, and for the perpetuation of the connection of his native Canada with Great Britain, the late surveyor-general was also conspicuously distinguished. With such qualities of both the head and heart\u2014and we regret that we cannot, on the present occasion, do them greater justice\u2014the memory of colonel Bouchette will be long cherished by his surviving friends, and his public labours reflect honor and credit upon his native country.\"\n\n---\n\n**Hon. ALEXANDER GRANT.**\n\nThis gentleman, like Mr. Peter Russell, being the senior member of the Executive Council, on General Hunter's death in 1805, assumed the reins of government, and ruled Upper Canada for one year.\n\nWe cannot obtain any information respecting him; but we know that during the short time he was president, some useful measures passed through the legislature.\n\n---\n\n**Hon. CHIEF-JUSTICE SEWELL, LL. D.**\n\nThe Honorable Jonathan Sewell, whose name figures in the history of Canada so considerably, was born at Cambridge, Massachusetts, about the year 1766, in the old family mansion, which is still standing. He received his education at the grammar school of Bristol, England, and migrated to New Brunswick in 1785, and entered, in that province, on the profession of the law, in the office of Mr., afterwards the celebrated Judge Chipman. In 1789, he removed from New Brunswick to Canada, and took up his abode in the city of Quebec. He was admitted to the bar on the 30th October, 1789, and speedily rose to distinction. We hear of him again in 1793, as solicitor-general; and, in 1795, advocate and attorney-general, and judge of the Court of Vice Admiralty;\nalso as burgess in the Provincial Parliament for the royal borough of William Henry, which he continued to represent for three consecutive parliaments. He continued to mount \"to the summit of the ladder of fame,\" till we find him, in 1808, chief-justice of the province of Lower Canada, and president of the Executive Council. The latter office he resigned in 1829, and the former in 1838. He was also appointed, on the 9th January, 1809, speaker of the Legislative Council,\u2014an office which he continued to hold until his death. His degree of LL.D. was bestowed on him by Harvard University, without solicitation. This learned and highly respected gentleman died in Quebec, on November 12, 1839, aged seventy-three years. The wealthy and distinguished family of the Sewells in Quebec, of which the Reverend E. W. Sewell, Sheriff W. Sewell, and Dr. James Sewell, his sons, are members, must regard him as the founder of the clan.\n\nBISHOP PLESSIS.\n\nJoseph Octave Plessis, the greatest man who ever occupied the Roman Catholic Episcopal seat at Quebec, since Fran\u00e7ois de Laval Montmorency. M. Plessis was the first Canadian pontiff who ever visited Rome, and the first ever appointed by the crown to be a member of the Legislative Council. He was born at Montreal, on the 3rd of March, 1762, and was the son of a blacksmith, according to Mr. Ryland. He was ordained a priest at Quebec, on the 11th March, 1786. From time to time, he was employed as professor of humanity, at the college of St. Raphael, also as secretary to the bishop of Quebec and curate of the capital. On the 6th September, 1797, he was created coadjutor to Bishop Denault, and obtained the royal acceptance through General Prescott; but the venerable Pontiff, Pius VI., having been dragged into captivity by the Sans-culottes, after his death, the church remained for some time without a chief. The nomination of Monseigneur Plessis, which had been long expected, became one of the first acts of the Pontiff, Pius VII., exalted at Venice, by reason of the victories obtained by Sauvarow, afterwards de Melas. A bull, dated 26th April, 1800, appointed him bishop of Canatton in Palestine, with the succession to the seat at Quebec. He pronounced an oration at Quebec in 1799, being then only elected an allocution, on the occasion of the naval battle of Aboukir. He\nwas consecrated on the 25th January, 1801, and employed himself during his coadjutorship in founding the college at Nicolet, (for which he afterwards obtained a royal charter) as well as primary schools at Quebec, and discussed the royal prerogative as to patronage, and other matters, with the crown officers. Mr. Ryland has preserved a conference on the subject between this prelate and Chief-Justice Sewell, published in the sixth volume of Christie's Canada. He succeeded Monseigneur Denault, and took possession of his seat on the 17th January, 1806. In him was to be seen a pontiff altogether loyal, firm, of good policy, with an ability much needed in his relations with certain rulers. The British government hesitated to place in him that confidence which he afterwards acquired. Sir James Craig, who endeavored to induce him to accept honors and emoluments, provided he would recognize the king's supremacy, with regard to benefices, believing him to be in correspondence with the bishops of Ireland, and with the celebrated Milner, bishop of Castabala; wrote to the British ministry. Under Prevost, Plessis began to reap the fruits of his services, and triumphed, at least partially, in the opposition raised against the provincial ordinance of 1791; since Sir George Prevost acknowledged his title of superintendent of the Roman Catholic Church, and, at his request, that of Roman Catholic bishop of Quebec, based (says Mr. Christie,) on a despatch from Lord Bathurst, wherein he appeared to recognize him as such. When Pius VII. was delivered from captivity, and re-established the Jesuits, Plessis wished to establish some at Quebec, and wrote to Russia to procure a friar, fit to be an instructor to such Canadians as might enter into that order; but this design did not succeed. He was called upon by the Crown to the Legislative Council in 1818; and in this honorable position, he proved himself to be a loyal and patriotic senator. In 1821, when the majority of the Legislative Council resolved not to concur in any bill from the Lower House, relative to the civil list, in which special items would be contained, this prelate, as well as Judge Olivier Perrault, dissented therefrom, and declared that the said resolution was premature, too general, and did not contain a precise specification of the objects comprised under the head of the civil list. This indefatigable pontiff meditated the erection of all the English colonies into one ecclesiastical province, of which Quebec should be the metropolis. He left for England and Rome in 1819.* In consideration of eminent services which he had rendered to England, during the French revolution, and during the war of 1812, as legislative\n\n* \"Although His Grace, (the Duke of Richmond) were to remain entirely inactive, it is very certain that neither the gentleman of the seminary, nor the Nuncio, who is now on his way to England, will continue so. The inordinate ambition of the one, and the zeal and bigotry of both those parties, may assure you of this,\" H. W. Ryland.\ncouncillor, he met with a kind and hearty reception from Lord Bathurst, with whom he had several interviews, and was, we believe, his guest at his country seat. Although he could not obtain his consent to the appointment of an archbishop at Quebec, nor to that of bishops for Montreal and Kingston, he was allowed district bishops at Kingston, Red River, and in the lower province; their bulls not only denominated them auxiliaries, but suffragans to the bishop of Quebec, and they were thus assimilated to other metropolitan bishops of the first centuries of the church, before the title of archbishop was known. With respect to Nova Scotia, the sovereign pontiff had placed there a vicar-apostolic. It was Monseigneur Edmund Burke, ex-grand vicar to Plessis, who consecrated him in 1818, prior to his departure for Europe. During his sojourn in London, he became intimately acquainted with the celebrated Doctor Poynter, and vicar-apostolic of that capital, who wrote to him concerning the difficulties existing in the ecclesiastical administration of Canada, which letter, the premier-pastor got published and circulated. He returned to Quebec on the 16th August, 1820, and was received with great demonstrations of respect and affection by the inhabitants of Quebec. He was accompanied by the Abb\u00e9 Lartigue, named suffragan and auxiliary, for the district of Montreal, where Monseigneur Hubert had already tried to have an episcopal see erected. He consecrated him in the ancient parochial church in 1821, and sustained him in his difficulties with the seminary. The mandate of installation, issued by Monseigneur Plessis, accorded to the suffragan\u2019s auxiliaries the same honors as to himself. The seminary of St. Sulpice and the Abb\u00e9 Chaboyez exhibited some opposition; the grand-vicar, Cadieux with another, under the pseudonyme d\u2019Hospice Bedard, defended the Pope\u2019s letter as well as the mandate, which were equally attacked. It is known that this ecclesiastical quarrel was carried to a great length; and that the same would have been worthy of a Lutrin, when such eminent men as Monseigneur Plessis, Monseigneur Lartigue, the Superior Roux and M. Le Saulnier were blamed. Joseph Octave Plessis died at the General Hospital at Quebec, on the 4th December, 1825, aged 62 years and 9 months. He was buried on the 7th, with all the religious and civil honors; the troops of the garrison lining the road of the funeral procession, and Lord Dalhousie following with his staff and the principal men of rank in the province. His coffin was placed in the sanctuary of the cathedral, under the spot where grand mass is usually celebrated. His heart was deposited in the wall of one of the chapels of the church of St. Roch, and a monument of marble was erected near it. A marble tombstone was also erected on the 2nd December, 1833, in the sanctuary of the cathedral, above his tomb. The correspondence of this prelate, which is most important, is preserved, and a series of Latin ser-\nmons for the union of the clergy. Here follows the opinion of the Canadian Review (an English journal,) of this prelate:\u2014\n\n\"The death of the Protestant bishop did not long precede that of Monseigneur Joseph Plessis, the Roman Catholic bishop of the province, who, on the 4th of December, at Quebec, terminated his mortal career. In the decease of this prelate, the church has to lament an able, temperate, yet zealous and indefatigable chief; his flock a humane, benevolent and charitable pastor, ever alive to their wants, and prompt to administer,\u2014and the king, a tried and loyal subject; there was, in short, among all classes and persuasions but one sentiment of regret for the loss, and of respect and veneration for the memory of this benevolent Christian, and truly exemplary character. His remains were conveyed, with all the civil and military honors from the General Hospital, where he had closed his life, to the chapel of the Hotel Dieu; and from thence, on the day of interment, to the parish church of the upper town, where he was interred on the right of the altar, in presence of the governor-in-chief, and heads of all the various departments, and an immense concourse of inhabitants, who all wished to express the high opinion they entertained of the zeal, charity and loyalty for which he was not more conspicuous, than he was for the talents which adorned the high and important office he had so ably discharged since 1806.\n\nHON. R. J. UNIACKE\n\nWas born in 1753, and died on the 25th October 1830. He was connected with the province of Lower Canada, by holding the office of attorney-general, from 1809 until he was succeeded by Mr. (afterwards Sir) J. Stuart, in 1825. He afterwards was appointed to the attorney-generalship of Nova Scotia, an office which he held at his death. The Royal Gazette of that province said of him:\n\n\"The death of this venerable and faithful servant of the public, will be deeply regretted by the inhabitants of the province generally; in the exercise of his official duties, the prerogatives of the crown, the rights of the subject, and the claims of humanity, were steadily kept in view by him. In private life his character was truly amiable; as husband, parent and master, he was ever kind and affectionate; in the social circle, few individuals exhibited better feelings, or the impulses of a better heart. By his country-\nmen particularly his loss will be severely felt; he was uniformly their friend and adviser. Indeed the province has sustained a loss by his death not easily to be repaired.\u201d Other members of his family have held important offices in that province.\n\nVICOMTE DE LERY.\n\nVicomte De Lery, was a member of the family of that name which have resided in Canada since the conquest; born at Quebec in 1754; died September 6, 1824, near Melun, in France. He entered, early in life, the French engineer department. He was in several expeditions on sea, during the American revolutionary war; was present at the battles of the 9th and 12th April, 1782, and placed in a state of defence the islands of Guadaloupe and Tobago.\n\nLieutenant in the same corps in 1780, he reached the rank of captain in 1788. The hostilities which commenced in 1792, and which were of a long duration, offered frequent occasions for the development of his talents, and for his making a rapid progress in the difficult career he had determined to follow.\n\nGeneral De Lery allowed none of the numerous campaigns in which he was engaged to pass without associating his name with the glories of Kleber, Jourdan, and Bernadotte; it was he who, under these distinguished officers, planned the works and agreed to all the measures of attack and defence, which facilitated the different passages of the Rhine, and secured the retreat of the army.\n\nHe established the entrenched camp at Dusseldorf, fortified Mayence, conducted the siege of Phillipsburg, and obtained in 1795, by his activity and numerous services, promotion to the rank of chef de battalion and colonel, and to that of general of brigade in 1799.\n\nHe had been charged with the draught of an extensive plan of fortification for the different places on the Rhine, the greater part of which has been executed by his successors, or by the officers of the powers who replaced the French in the possession of that territory.\n\nIn 1805, he was elevated to the rank of lieutenant-general, and accompanied Marshal McDonald through the difficult campaigns of the Grison; he was also entrusted with the fortification of Palma Nova, in Venetian Friuli, and was afterwards concerned in all the great battles of Germany and Spain.\nGeneral De Lery, was one of the engineer officers who had most thoroughly studied the connection between fortification and the art of war; he had the rare power of making command agreeable; he knew how to excite and direct the zeal of his officers; gave effect to their exertions, foresaw their wants, and could minister to them so as to add the bonds of gratitude to those of duty. He took a lively interest in the welfare of those subordinate to him, and was above paying attention to his own. Endowed with great generosity and an integrity which was proof against every trial, he left no fortune. As a good husband, affectionate father, firm friend, and disinterested citizen, none could equal him; and he left behind him a list of noble examples which will not be lost on the worthy family which bears his name.\n\nHENRY BLACKSTONE, Esq.\n\nThis gentleman was for many years his Majesty's coroner for the district of Quebec, and died in that city on the 2nd February, 1825. He was a son of the late Sir William Blackstone, the distinguished commentator on the laws of England. The superior talent and zeal of this gentleman, in the discharge of his functions, have not been surpassed; and the community was deprived by his death of an accomplished individual.\n\nCAPTAIN R. JULYAN, R.N.\n\nCaptain R. Julyan, for a lengthened period harbor-master of the port of Quebec, and who died in that city in 1856, was a naval officer who had seen great service.

He was a midshipman before he was eleven years of age, and a lieutenant (3rd June, 1799,) before he had completed his sixteenth year. The following account of his services we copy from the Navy List:\u2014R. Julyan, midshipman of the Digdom, at the occupation of Toulon, and in\nHolham's actions in 1795, of the Moselle at the capture of the Dutch Fleet at Saldanha Bay, and of the Glutton at Copenhagen in 1801. While acting in command of the Richmond gun brig, destroyed in her boats two French privateers from under a battery near Malaga in 1811, and commanded the naval forces at the siege of Tarifa.\n\nD. McTAVISH, Esq.,\n\nA native of Stratherick, Scotland, and one of the partners of the North-West Company of Canada. He was upwards of twenty-four years employed in the wilds of Upper Canada, and the interior of the north western regions of America, and was very successful in promoting the business of the company, and in securing the good-will and alliance of the Indian nations, by whose chiefs he was always treated with the greatest respect, and received on the same footing as one of their own number. His enterprising genius led him to project and attempt an expedition across the continent of North America, for the purpose of establishing a connexion with China; and, after having escaped innumerable perils, he and six of his companions were lost near Cape Disappointment, near the mouth of the river Columbia, in the Northern Pacific Ocean, on the 22nd May, 1815.\n\nPHILEMON WRIGHT, Esq.,\n\nAppropriately called the \"Father of the Ottawa.\" He was a native of Woburn, state of Massachusetts, where he was born in 1760. Mr. Wright emigrated to this country in the year 1800, and with a steady perseverance, he determined on ascending the river Ottawa in quest of a tract of land suitable for an agriculturist. With this view, he penetrated into the country at a great expense of mental and bodily exertion, for sixty miles beyond any previous settler, where, finding a spot adapted for his purpose, he obtained, after many efforts, from government, permission to settle.\nupon and survey the township of Hull, where, at last, his toils were rewarded, by seeing a thriving settlement growing up around him. In furtherance of his agricultural pursuits, he, at a very heavy cost, imported from Great Britain, some of the most approved breeds of cattle, and thereby contributed in the most efficient manner to promote the interests of the settlers in that section of the country. He was also the projector of some of the greatest improvements on the Ottawa. He died at Hull, C. E., on 2nd June, 1839. He left a numerous offspring, to all of whom he was endeared by the tenderest ties of affection and esteem. His epitaph will be recorded in the beautiful and prosperous settlement of Hull, or as it was sometimes called Wrightstown, which he commenced and lived to see attain a degree of magnitude, where his name will be long remembered with the highest respect.\n\nCOMMANDER ROACHE, R.N.\n\nJohn Roache, long a resident of the Newcastle district, and a commander in the royal navy; born in 1778; died at Peterborough, C. W., 15th August, 1848. Few men had seen more service than this gallant officer; having entered the navy early in the year 1798, he was actively employed during the whole of the Peninsular war; was engaged with the Dutch fleet at Camperdown; at the capture of the French fleet off the coast of Ireland; at the capture of Le Genereux, La Ville de Marseilles, and Guillaume Tell, in the Mediterranean; at the taking of Egypt; blockade of Calais, Boulogne, and Dieppe; and at the taking of the Cape of Good Hope, where he was wounded. His family still reside in the province.\n\nCOMMANDER STEELE, R.N.\n\nThis gallant officer, at present a resident of Orillia, C.W., was formerly a member of the provincial legislature for the county of Simcoe.\nElmes Steele entered the navy, in March, 1798, as A.B., on board the Triton, thirty-two guns, Captain John Gore, under whom, after visiting the Mediterranean, he assisted, 18th October, 1799, at the capture off Cape Finisterre, of the Santa Brigida, a Spanish frigate of thirty-six guns, and three hundred men, laden with treasure to an enormous amount. In the course of 1800, he became midshipman of the Cambridge, 74, flag-ship of Sir Thomas Pasley, at Plymouth, and Atlas, 98, Captain Theophilus Jones, attached to the Channel fleet; and in November, 1802, having left the Atlas in the preceding May, he was nominated master's mate of the Caroline, 36, Captain Benjamin William Page. During the passage of that ship to the East Indies, he was placed on board a prize, and sent home. On his arrival he joined the Castor, 32, Captain Edward Brace, stationed in the Downs. He was nominated, early in 1805, acting-lieutenant of the Amiable, 32, Captain William Bolton; was officially promoted 26th March, in that year; and between August following, and December, 1812, was employed on the coast of North America, off Boulogne, and the north coast of Spain, and in the North Sea and Mediterranean, in the Mercury, 28, Captain Charles Pollicy; Leopard, 50, Captain Salisbury Pryce Humphreys; Glommen sloop, Captain Charles Pitchford; Arethusa, 38, Captain Robert Mends; Horatio, 38, Captain John Charles Woolcombe; Menelaus, 38, Captain Sir Peter Parker; and Barfleur, 98, Captain Sir Edward Berry. He was on board the Leopard, we believe, when she compelled, 22nd June, 1807, the United States frigate Chesapeake to surrender, after an engagement occasioned by the refusal on the part of the latter to permit the British to search her for deserters. On the 20th March, 1809, a party of seamen under the orders of Lieutenant Steele, who was then serving in the Arethusa, destroyed the guns at Baignio, a place on the coast of France, and captured a vessel there laden with merino wool; while Lieutenant Fennel, of the royal marines, accompanied by Mr. Elliott, the purser, and a boat's crew, ascended the mountain and destroyed the signal posts. He accepted his present rank April 25, 1838. He is also a colonel of the sedentary militia force for the county of Simcoe.\n\nADMIRAL BALDWIN, R.N.\n\nAdmiral Augustus Baldwin, of Toronto, is an Irishman by birth, and a member of the same family as the distinguished statesman whose biography is to be found in this book.\n\nHe entered the navy in May, 1794, on board the Trompeuse sloop, Captain John Erskine Douglas, with whom he continued\nuninterruptedly and actively to serve on the Home and Halifax stations, in the same vessel, and in the Garland, 28, and Boston, 32, of which latter frigate he was created a lieutenant, 28th June, 1800, until December, 1804. He then joined the Prince of Wales, 98, bearing the flags in succession, of Sir Robert Calder, Sir James Saumarez, Sir Edward Thornborough, and Lord Gambier; and while in that ship, was present in the action of 22nd July, 1805, and also at the attack upon Copenhagen, in September, 1807. Early in January, 1808, he became first lieutenant of the Implacable, 74, Captain Thomas Byam Martin, and on 26th August following, he highly distinguished himself, and was officially reported as being a most thoroughly deserving officer, for his conduct in a gallant engagement of twenty minutes, with the Russian 74 gun ship, Scopolod, which was completely silenced, and shortly afterwards, with the assistance of the Centaur, 74, captured and burnt, in sight of the whole Russian fleet, near Rogerswick; on which occasion the enemy sustained a loss of three hundred and three men, and the British in both ships, not more than sixty-two. Mr. Baldwin, whose behavior was rewarded with a commander's commission, dated 19th September, in the same year, did not however succeed in procuring further employment afloat until 7th February, 1812, when he was appointed to the Tyrian brig, in which he served in the channel until posted, 1st January, 1817. He accepted the retirement 1st October, 1846.\n\nAdmiral Baldwin married Augusta Mary Melissa, daughter of J. M. Jackson, Esq.\n\n---\n\nTHOMAS CARY, Esq.\n\nMr. Thomas Cary founded and edited the Quebec Mercury newspaper in the year 1805. This paper originated from a desire to express the sentiments, sympathies and predilections of the British inhabitants of Quebec, who, at that time, formed a small but wealthy and influential portion of the community. The object was that that section of the people should have a non-official organ of their opinions, and be enabled to protest against such acts of power as they objected to, and to oppose the writings of their adversaries in respect of politics and nationality with equal freedom. Under Mr. Cary, the Mercury at once became what it has ever since continued to be, the consistent and unswerving advocate of high tory and episcopalian principles.\n\nThe subject of this brief memoir conducted his press with the most dauntless intrepidity. His style was at once classical, terse and vigorous; his mode of attack\u2014and he was even readier with\nAND PERSONS CONNECTED WITH CANADA.\n\nthe sword than with the shield, though master of both\u2014was, in the taste of his day, modelled after Junius. But, if in the manner he followed the teachings of the great satirist, in the matter he was essentially original; and his boldness brought him several times into collision with the House of Assembly. Stuart, Van Felson, Papineau and Denis Benjamin Viger, while leaders of opposition, were all subject to the lash of his sarcasm. One of his compositions,\u2014abounding in ironical compliments directed against the late Sir James (then Mr.) Stuart, who at that time led the Legislative Assembly, while Mr. Cary was the literary defender of the then Chief-Justice Sewell and the Legislative Council,\u2014was pronounced a libel and breach of privilege, by a nearly unanimous vote of the Assembly. On another occasion, the speaker's warrant having been issued for his apprehension, he remained concealed till the close of the session in a secret apartment ingeniously constructed in his residence in St. Lewis street, now occupied by the Honorable Louis Panet, and from his hiding place poured forth his philippics upon his political opponents, like a high tory and amiable Marat\u2014we say amiable, for he was a man of decided benevolence of heart. Unterrified by the sergeant-at-arms, then a much more formidable personage than now-a-days, the Mercury continued its course; and, with its principles, descended from father to son, and from son to grandson, of its first proprietor.\n\nMr. Cary died in 1823. He was born in 1751, near Bristol, England. He had started in life in the service of the East India Company, was subsequently tutor to several persons of distinction, including Monseigneur Plessis, and was afterwards admitted a member of the bar. Mr. Cary was a highly educated and very scholarly gentleman of the old school, of varied attainments, including great social and convivial powers, and his natural abilities were admitted even by his opponents.\n\nOf his two sons, one, Thomas, conducted the Mercury for a lengthened period; the other, Joseph, became deputy inspector-general, a position from which he retired only some few years ago.\n\nSIR JAMES H. CRAIG, K.C.B.\n\nThe career of this remarkable man was assuredly a great and arduous one; for, holding as he did, the high post of governor-general of the British North American provinces at a most critical period in our history, his government deserves peculiar attention. He was born in the year 1750, at Gibraltar, where his father held the appointment of civil and military judge. The family is\nhighly respectable and of Scottish origin, being connected with the Craigs of Dalnair and Costorton. Through his father's influence, young Craig entered the military service in 1768, when only fifteen years of age; and although comparatively so young, he possessed that strong determination and native energy of disposition requisite to the formation of the character of a man who has his way to make through the bustling and active scenes of life, without any friend to assist him to rise. In 1770, he was appointed aide-de-camp to General Sir Robert Boyd, then governor of Gibraltar, and obtained a company in the 47th Regiment, with which he went to America in 1744, and was present at the battle of Bunker's Hill, in which latter engagement he was severely wounded. In 1776, he accompanied his regiment to Canada, commanding his company in the action of Three Rivers; and he afterwards commanded the advanced guard of the army in the expulsion of the rebels from this province. In 1777, he was engaged in the actions at Ticonderago and Hubertown, in the latter of which engagements he was again severely wounded. Ever in a position of honorable danger, he received a third wound in the action at Froeman's Farm. He was engaged at the disastrous affair at Saratoga, and was distinguished by General Burgoyne and the brave Fraser, (who fell in that action) as a young officer who promised to attain to the very height of the military profession. On this occasion he was selected by General Burgoyne to carry home the despatches, and was immediately thereafter promoted to a majority in the new 82nd Regiment, which he accompanied to Nova Scotia in 1778; to Penobscot in 1779, and to North Carolina in 1781; being engaged in continued scenes of active service during the whole of those campaigns, and generally commanding the light troops, with orders to act upon his own discretion, on which his superiors in command relied with implicit confidence. In a service of this kind, the accuracy of his intelligence, the fertility of his resources, and the clearness of his military judgment, were alike conspicuous, and drew on him the attention of his sovereign, who noted him as an officer of the highest promise. In 1794 he obtained the rank of major-general; and in the beginning of the following year, he was sent on the expedition to the Cape of Good Hope, where, in the reduction and conquest of that most important settlement, with the co-operation of Admiral Sir G. K. Elphinstone, and Major-General Clarke, he attained to the highest pitch of military reputation, and performed the signal service to his king and country, of which the memory will be as lasting as the national annals. Nor were his merits less conspicuous in the admirable plans of civil regulation, introduced by him into that hostile quarter, while he was invested with the chief authority, civil and military, as governor of the Cape. He was succeeded in that situation by the Earl of Macartney, in 1707, who, by a deputation from his Majesty, invested General Craig\nwith the red ribbon, as an honorable mark of his sovereign's just sense of his distinguished services. Sir James Craig had scarcely returned to England when it was his Majesty's pleasure to require his services on the staff in India. On his arrival at Madras, he was appointed to the command of an expedition against Manilla; but this not taking place, he proceeded to Bengal, and took the field service. During five years in India, his attention and talents were unremittingly exerted to the improvement of the discipline of the Indian army, and to the promotion of that harmonious cooperation between its different constituent parts, on which not only the military strength, but the civil arrangements of that portion of the British empire so essentially depend. In January, 1801, Sir James Craig was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general, and returned to England, 1802; when he was appointed to the command of the eastern district, and remained in England till 1805; and then, notwithstanding that his constitution was much impaired by a long train of most active and fatiguing service, he was selected by his sovereign to take the command of the British troops in the Mediterranean. He proceeded to Lisbon, Gibraltar, Malta; and from thence to Naples, to act in co-operation with the Russian army. But the object of these plans being frustrated by the event of the battle of Austerlitz, Sir James withdrew the troops from Naples to Messina, in Sicily. During the whole period of his command in the Mediterranean, he suffered severely from that malady which terminated his life, a dropsy which proceeded from an organic affection of the liver; and feeling his disease sensibly gaining ground, he returned with his sovereign's permission to England in 1806. A temporary abatement of his disorder flattered him with a prospect of recovery, and being himself unable to reconcile his mind to a situation of inactivity, he once more accepted an active command from the choice of his sovereign. In 1807, on the threatening appearance of hostilities with the United States of America, he was sent out to Quebec, as governor-in-chief of British America. Here he governed the province, and commanded the forces in it, until his disease, which had made terrible inroads upon his constitution, compelled him to solicit his recall, which was granted; and he left this country on the 19th of June, 1811.\n\nBut in alluding to his administration of the government of Canada, we will only briefly touch on the most salient points of it, leaving history, in which his name will hold a high and distinguished rank, to speak of its general bearings. The whole time, or nearly all of it, was occupied in the most bitter party bickerings; a legislature divided in nationality, religion and opinion, which, although it now works in unison throughout the different departments, and is supposed to approach perfection, was, at that day, in a most alarming and refractory state, at least in its main points. With this the governor could positively have done nothing,\nalthough some of his own acts cannot but be viewed with repre-\nhension, particularly his seizure of *Le Canadien* newspaper, and\nconfining its proprietor and writers in the common gaol. Though\nperhaps for the course which they pursued, and the malicious and\nseditious articles which they promulgated, they deserved the treat-\nment they received; yet his measures were decidedly not British\nin principle, and therefore he was so far wrong. Then again, his\nrefusal to transmit the resolutions of the assembly, in which they\nprayed to be allowed in future to pay the civil list, was another\npiece of false government, and decidedly wrong.\n\nWe however must not be too severe on the old veteran's memory,\nand the course he pursued in this province. It doubtlessly cannot\nbut be ascribed to his desire to benefit the country; and, by wise\nand judicious measures, in his estimation, to do good unto Canada\nand its people. Indeed, the honesty and purity of his intentions\nare evinced in nearly every proclamation which he issued, and in\nevery one of his speeches to the Parliament, and in none more so\nthan in his beautiful proclamation (of which we give a part), to\nthe people, relative to the seditious writings then current in the\nprovince. The following passage conveys to the reader the feelings\nwhich actuated him in the performance of his duties. He said:\n\n\"For what purpose should I oppress you? Is it to serve the\nking? Will that monarch, who during fifty years, has never issued\none order that had you for its object, that was not for your benefit\nand happiness; will he now, beloved, honored, adored by his sub-\njects, covered with glory, descending into the vale of years, accom-\npanied with the prayers and blessings of a grateful people; will he,\ncontrary to the whole tenor of a life of honor and virtue, now give\norders to his servants to oppress his Canadian subjects? It is\nimpossible that you can for a moment believe it. You will spurn\nfrom you, with just indignation, the miscreant who will suggest\nsuch a thought to you.\n\n\"Is it for myself, then, that I should oppress you? For what\nshould I oppress you? Is it from ambition? What can you give\nme? Is it for power? Alas! my good friends! with a life obbing\nnot slowly to its period, under the pressure of disease acquired in\nthe service of my country, I look only to pass, what it may please\nGod to suffer to remain of it, in the comfort of retirement among\nmy friends. I remain among you only in obedience to the com-\nmands of my king. What power can I wish for? Is it then for\nwealth that I would oppress you? Enquire of those who know me,\nwhether I regard wealth; I never did, when I could enjoy it; it is\nnow of no use to me; to the value of your country laid at my feet,\nI would prefer the consciousness of having, in a single instance,\ncontributed to your happiness and prosperity.\"\n\nAlthough a continual warfare was kept up between him and the\ncouncil, the assembly and people, yet the latter could not but\nadmire the firmness of purpose which characterised his every action, and the judiciousness of some of his measures, particularly that one, in which he endeavoured to place the province and its people on their guard against the coming storm from the States. This was evinced by the numerous and spontaneous addresses for his welfare, which poured into him from all quarters of the province, during his short sojourn in it, and more particularly on his departure; and the feeling of the people on that occasion, when the horses were taken from his carriage, and they themselves drew him to the king's wharf, in the most affectionate and hearty manner, displayed the light in which he was held. All regretted his departure, more particularly when it was known he was in such a fearful state of sickness; for it was feared he would not survive till the end of the voyage; yet he did, and for months afterwards, his death taking place in January, 1812.\n\nChristie, in his History of Canada, thus describes him:\n\n\"He was of an agreeable countenance, and impressive presence, stout and rather below the middle stature; manly and dignified in deportment, but social, polite and affable; positive in his opinions, and decisive in his measures. Although hasty in temper, he was, like most men who are so, far from implacable; and as we have seen, easily reconciled to those who may have incurred his displeasure. Hospitable and princely in his style of living, he was also munificent in his donations to public institutions; and to charitable purposes, a generous patron; and lastly, we shall mention, though not the least of his virtues, a friend to the poor and destitute, none of whom applying at his threshold, ever went away unrelieved.\"\n\nM. LOUIS BOURDAGES.\n\nLouis Bourdages was one of the most celebrated men the lower province possessed. His name figures to a considerable extent in the annals of the country, as a legislator, particularly during the administration of Sir James Craig, to whom he was opposed, conjointly with the opposition of that day. He was the friend of Papineau and the others who were so bitter in their denunciations of that gentleman's government. He was the descendant of an old French family of Acadia, who had to leave that country, consequent on the trouble that arose relative\nto the \"Allegiance Oath.\" He received his education at Quebec, and for some time was engaged in maritime pursuits, and made several voyages to the old country and elsewhere. After marrying, he settled on the river Chambly on a farm which he cultivated, and soon, by honorable labor, accumulated a small fortune, and thus became independent. Being given much to study, he shortly afterwards passed the requisite examination, and became a notary public.\n\nIn 1804, through the influence of his wife's friends, he was returned to parliament for the county of Richelieu, and took an active part in all that passed in the lower house, particularly the measures of the late Judge Bedard, and those relating to the exclusion of the judges from their seats in the legislature. He was one of the most violent adversaries of the Craig administration.\n\nPrevious to the war of 1812, he had been appointed a colonel of militia, and, in 1813, commanded his battalion on the frontier. He showed much zeal in defending his country, and was a strict disciplinarian, so much so, that he incurred the dislike of his officers, and lost his election shortly afterwards. He was, however, returned for the county of Buckingham, and shortly afterwards became the leader of his party in the house, when all the important measures emanated from him. Among others, will be found the first project for the election of the members of the Legislative Council. When Mr. Papineau proceeded to England, to present the petition of the Canadians, Mr. Bourdages was a candidate for the speakership, but failed in being elected. Shortly afterwards, he was appointed superintendent postmaster of the province, and, whilst in that office, displayed great activity, and placed the post office in an ameliorated condition. His death occurred suddenly, at St. Denis, river Chambly, on the 20th January, 1835, at the moment he was preparing to depart for Quebec, to attend to his legislative duties.\n\nHe possessed a very loud and penetrating voice, was tall and imposing in his figure, and consequently, invariably received attention when he was addressing the house. He was a most devoted citizen and legislator, and was zealous and consistent in his religion, which was Roman Catholic. So assiduous and attentive was he in the discharge of his duties, that on one occasion, whilst he was engaged in a discussion in the house he received the news of the death of his son, and was pressed to retire home to view his remains and attend to his funeral, he said\u2014\"No! I am a citizen before a father!\" and did not retire, so much had he the interests of his country at heart. He mourned his son, but only after he had done his duty as a citizen.\nHON. JUSTICE PIERRE L. PANET.\n\nA distinguished member of the bar of Lower Canada, who rose to be member of the Executive Council of Lower Canada, and to be elevated as one of the judges of the Court of King's Bench for the district of Montreal. He died of an apoplectic fit on the 3rd December, 1812. A journal of the day recording his demise, said:\u2014\"In him his associates on the bench will have to lament a coadjutor second to none in ability, knowledge and integrity; his family, a parent and friend, whose character was their honor, protection, and example; and the community an individual, whose virtue and services as a judge and member of the legislature of this province, and whose humanity and benevolence in every relation of life, have entitled him to their highest respect and gratitude.\"\n\nHON. JUSTICE DE BONNE.\n\nThe Honorable P. A. De Bonne, a celebrated legislator in the beginning of this century, was a descendant of the Sieur De Bonne Mizelle, a captain in the regiment de Cond\u00e9, and a nephew of the Marquis de la Jonqui\u00e8re, one of the French governors; was a member of the Executive Council in 1794, as also of the Legislative Assembly, in which latter office, he opposed Mr. Cuthbert's motion for the abolition of slavery. He eventually became the leader of the Canadian party in the house, and as such displayed great ability as leader and debater; so much so indeed, that he lost his seat in the house (through the malignity of the Craig administration) by a simple vote of its members. He was the only member of the judiciary who held a seat in the house, and was not re-elected at the general election which ensued.\nHON. GEORGE CROOKSHANK\n\nWas, if we are not misinformed, the oldest resident of Toronto. He was born in New York, in 1763, and was of Scottish parentage, but at the conclusion of the American war of independence, his family, with others of the United Empire Loyalists, emigrated to St. John's, New Brunswick. General Simcoe, upon his appointment to the governorship of Canada, desired to have near him some of those who had served with him in the war, and among others induced the Hon. Mr. Magill to take up his residence here. Mr. Magill was a brother-in-law of Mr. Crookshank, and when he came to Toronto in 1796, brought the latter with him. Mr. Magill was appointed the receiver-general, and Mr. Crookshank received an appointment in the commissariat. He rose to the post of deputy commissary-general, which he held until the conclusion of the war of 1812, when he retired upon half pay. He received, on settling in Toronto, three hundred acres of land, now owned by Messrs. Strachan and Fitzgerald, but still known as the Crookshank estate. He died, 21st July, 1859. He was possessed of large property besides, and left a handsome fortune, to his only surviving child, the wife of Mr. Stephen Heward, of Toronto. His only son died some years ago. Mrs. Crookshank's name was Lambert. She was of an American family, and has been dead many years. Mr. Crookshank derived his title from the seat which he held in the Legislative Council of Upper Canada. Since the union, he took no part in politics.\n\nFRAN\u00c7OIS BLANCHET, Esq., M.D., M.P.P.\n\nDr. Blanchet was a native of the parish of St. Pierre, Rivi\u00e8re du Sud, where his father was a proprietor in good circumstances, cultivating his own lands. He was educated at the Quebec seminary, and took his medical degree at New York, where he published a book in French on the application of chemistry to medicine. He finally settled at Quebec as a medical practitioner; and some time afterwards was elected by his native county to represent it in the assembly. In contests arising between the colonial executives\nand the assembly he warmly espoused the popular side, and was one of the members imprisoned in 1810. During the late American war, he was at the head of the medical staff in the province. He was a sincere friend to the general education of the people, having introduced the first bill for that purpose, in 1814. He was also warmly attached to the improvement of the internal communications, and generally throughout his long career as a member of the assembly, he was animated by a strong attachment to his country, its established constitution, and government. He died at Quebec, on the 26th June, 1830, in the fifty-fourth year of his age.\n\nMR. CHARLES HURST.\n\nMr. Hurst was a native of Hampshire, England, and was brought up to the printing business. He came to Canada in the 65th Regiment, from which he obtained leave of absence, after it had removed to Nova Scotia, to work at his business in Quebec. He was afterwards transferred to the 7th Regiment, or Royal Fusiliers, in the Quebec garrison, then commanded by his late Royal Highness Prince Edward, Duke of Kent. When a conspiracy was entered into by some foreigners in the regiment against the life of the prince, it accidentally came to his knowledge, and he gave the information which led to the conviction of the criminals, who were, however, pardoned at the place of execution, by the intercession of his Royal Highness. Mr. Hurst was for some time afterwards a sergeant in the regiment, and finally bought his discharge, which precluded him by the rules of the service from the pension to which he otherwise would have been entitled. Having become infirm, he went to live with his son-in-law, Mr. Henry Patton, formerly of the artillery, and captain of the militia, at Valcartier, Canada East, and for many years Mr. Hurst was the only school master in the settlement. He was possessed of that manly independence of mind which prides itself in the discharge of the duties of the individual in whatever rank or station he is placed. He died September, 1837. In the true spirit of an Englishman and a soldier, he was devoted to his king and country, in good and bad fortune, and although his life ended in poverty, he was respected and esteemed by those among whom he lived, and died in the faith and consolations of a sincere Christian.\nCOMTE JOSEPH DE PUISAGE.\n\nFew people are aware that this distinguished man once lived in Canada, yet such is the fact. His history is worth reading; he was descended from a noble French family, and was born at Montagne, about 1754. Being intended for the church, he was educated in the seminary of St. Sulpice, but preferring the military profession, at the age of eighteen he entered as a sub-lieutenant into the regiment of Conti, whence he removed as captain into a regiment of dragoons. He subsequently purchased a commission in the Cent Suisses of the Royal Household, obtaining the brevet of colonel, and soon after the cross of St. Louis. In 1787 he was nominated a deputy from the nobility of Perche to the States-General, when he joined the tiers-\u00e9tat, after having signed the protestation of the 19th of June, and in the Constituent Assembly he always voted with the partisans of political regeneration. In 1791 he was raised to the rank of major-general, and he had afterwards the command of the national guard of Foreux. In 1793, forces having been collected in the northern departments in order to oppose the tyranny of the Jacobins, the chief command was given to General Wimpfen, and the second to Comte de Puisage. Being defeated, a price was set on his head, and he was compelled to seek an asylum in Brittany. There he reorganized the Chouans, formed a military council, and arrayed the whole district in arms against the convention. Aware of the necessity for obtaining foreign aid, the count left his troops under the command of M. Cormatin, and went to London, where he continued several months, and obtained the promise of assistance from the British ministry. He was also invested with unlimited powers by the Comte d'Artois; and though on his return to France, he found that M. Cormatin had concluded a treaty with the republicans, he triumphed over that difficulty, and every preparation was made by the Bretons to join the English and emigrate troops as soon as they should appear on the French coasts. Owing to some intrigues which took place, the measures of the Comte de Puisage were counteracted, and the expedition was diverted to the coast of La Vend\u00e9e. The disastrous expedition to Quiberon followed, for the result of which the count, whether justly or not, was generally blamed; and finding that he had lost his influence with the adherents of the exiled royal family, he resigned his commission and came to Canada, with a number of French loyalists, where they had obtained a grant of land from the British government somewhere near Toronto, we believe, close where Markham now stands. But the peace of Amiens being\nconcluded, and the count having received very bad treatment from some of the influential settlers and inhabitants of Toronto, he returned to England; and with a view to remove the odium under which he labored, he published *M\u00e9moires du Lieut.-G\u00e9n\u00e9ral le Comte de Puisage, qui pourront servir \u00e0 l'Histoire du Parti Royaliste Fran\u00e7ais*, London, 1803-6, 5 vols, 8vo. He continued to reside in England till his death, which took place December 18, 1827, in the neighborhood of Hammersmith, Middlesex.\n\n---\n\n**JOSEPH WILLCOCKS, Esq., M.P.P.**\n\nThe name of a man who figured conspicuously in the annals of Upper Canada during a portion of the time of the reign of the \"Family Compact Party,\" of whom it may be said, that they persecuted this man to death.\n\nWillcocks was an Irishman of respectable parentage, and had emigrated to Canada in his younger days. He rose rapidly; and about 1803 had become sheriff of the Home District, but was deprived of his office in 1806, for voting against the wishes of the governor at Thorpe's election. He soon became popular with the people, mostly through a suit brought against him by the lieutenant-governor, Mr. Francis Gore, for libel, and in which he was acquitted; he was elected to serve in the assembly, which speedily thrust him into the Toronto jail, then a miserable log hut, for making too free with their affairs. Released from this, he became, like Wilkes in England, still more popular; and, for a while, was at the head as leader of the majority in the assembly. In 1807, he commenced publishing and editing the *Upper Canada Guardian or Freeman's Journal*, then the second paper in the upper province, which he continued, until the breaking out of the war of 1812 forced him to give up his paper and lay down the p.a for the musket, and fight against the Americans at Queenston. Still government treated him harshly; and, at length, thoroughly disheartened and disgusted, he deserted to the enemy, taking a body of Canadian militia over with him. The Americans rewarded his treason by making him a colonel; and his erratic and singularly strange career was brought to a close at the siege of Fort Erie, where he was killed, while planting a guard.\nW. A. THOMPSON, Esq.\n\nAssistant Commissary-General W. A. Thompson was born at Quebec in 1786, and died at Dominica, 18th May, 1838. Mr. Thompson entered the commissariat department in the year 1805, and was the whole time in actual service\u2014served during the American war of 1812, and arrived in the West Indies in October, 1801. He was a brother of assistant commissary general, James Thompson, and twin brother of the Honorable Mr. Justice Thompson of Gasp\u00e9.\n\nCOMTE DE DOUGLAS,\n\nBorn at Montreal in 1747; died at Paris in 1842. Louis Archambault, Comte de Douglas, it appears, had obtained rank in the peerage of France with that title. He had succeeded, in 1770, his uncle, Charles Joseph de Douglas, Comte et Seigneur de Montr\u00e9al, in France, who, with one of his brothers, had accompanied Charles Edward in his chivalrous attempt to recover the throne of his ancestors, and was taken prisoner at the battle of Culloden. Thus the French Canadian Comte de Douglas, is said to have sprung from one of the most illustrious families in Europe; and it is stated that his maternal grandfather was governor of Montreal, when Canada was a French colony.\n\nGENERAL SIR GEORGE MURRAY,\n\nWas a well known gallant British general and statesman; and had been governor of the Royal Military College at Sandhurst. He was born at the family seat in Perthshire, in 1772; was educated at the High School and University of Edinburgh; and, having\nentered the army in 1789, he gained great distinction in almost every quarter of the globe for his military achievements, and more especially for the skill and ability with which he discharged, on several occasions, the difficult office of quarter-master-general. In 1812, he was appointed lieutenant-governor of Upper Canada, but, on hearing that Napoleon had escaped from Elba, he resigned that important office, and joined the English army in France. On his return to England, he was appointed governor of Edinburgh Castle; and, in 1819, governor of the Royal Military College. In 1823, he became lieutenant-general of the Ordnance; and was soon after elected M.P. for Perthshire. In 1828, he took office as secretary of state for the colonies. In Sir Robert Peel's administration of 1834-5, he filled the office of master-general of the Ordnance, but lost his seat for Perthshire. At the Westminster election, in 1837, he opposed and was defeated by Sir Lacy de Evans and Mr. Leader. When the Whigs resigned in 1841, Sir George again received the appointment of master-general of the Ordnance. He appeared before the public as the editor of Marlborough's Despatches, 5 vols.; but it is not necessary to speak of him in any other capacity than that of a gallant and successful soldier, and able minister. He died, July 28, 1846, aged 71.\n\nGENERAL SIR GEORGE PREVOST, BART.\n\nThis distinguished man was born on the 19th of May, 1767. By his own merits he attained a high rank in his profession, being first brought into the notice of his sovereign as a lieutenant-colonel in a battalion of the 60th Regiment, serving in the West Indies; in which situation he distinguished himself at St. Vincent, where he was severely wounded; and for his conduct on that occasion, as well as in the subsequent operations in the West Indies, he was promoted to the rank of brigadier, and had afterwards the government of Dominica conferred upon him as a mark of his Majesty's approbation for his gallant and successful defence of that island against a very superior force of the enemy, as well as for his conspicuous conduct at St. Lucia; in 1803, he was created a baronet. Shortly after his return to England from the West Indies in 1805, he was appointed lieutenant-governor of Portsmouth, with command of the troops in that district. In 1808 he was selected to fill the\nimportant charge of lieutenant-governor and lieutenant-general, commanding the forces in the province of Nova Scotia. In the autumn of the same year he proceeded with a division of troops from Halifax to the West Indies, and was second in command upon the expedition at the capture of the Island of Martinique. After that service had been completed, he returned to his government in Nova Scotia; and upon the resignation of General Sir James Craig, he was called to fill the high and responsible situation of governor-in-chief and commander of the forces in all British North America. He returned to England early in 1814, to answer certain charges preferred against him, the investigation of which had been alone prevented, prior to his decease, by causes altogether beyond his control. Sir George Prevost's successful defence of the Canadas for nearly three years, against a numerous and formidable enemy, and under circumstances of peculiar difficulty, together with his other important services in the West Indies, will be long remembered, and a grateful country will not refuse to do justice to the memory of one, who, it may be truly said, was a gallant spirit, a man with pure hands, and a most zealous and devoted servant of his sovereign.* The disorder which shortened the last days of this distinguished officer was dropsy, occasioned by a debilitated constitution, worn down by the fatigues and anxieties attendant upon the arduous duties of his last command. The first symptoms of the disease made their appearance during the journey which he was obliged to undertake overland, at a most inclement season, from Quebec to St. John, New Brunswick, in order to embark for England; to the exertions of which, it has since appeared, he was wholly unequal; and these symptoms gradually increasing after his arrival in England, he was induced to remove from his seat at Belmont, in Hampshire, to London, for the benefit of the best medical advice; but the rapid progress\n\n*Respecting this important period of his life, we make an extract of a letter from the Gentleman's Magazine for 1817:\n\nMr. Urban,\n\nJanuary 8, 1817.\n\nThe enclosed Halifax newspaper contains some observations, which appear to me to be so illustrative of the character and services of that inestimable man, and very excellent, but much-injured officer, the late governor-general of British North America, and so justly, though briefly, detail many of the civil and military difficulties which he had to encounter and did surmount, that I trust you will agree with me in thinking them highly deserving a place in your Miscellany.\n\nNow that the irritation and animosities of party-spirit have subsided and been buried in the grave, I doubt not but every impartial man will allow the preservation of Canada to the British empire to have been chiefly owing to the judicious conduct of Sir George Prevost, in the arduous charge committed to him by his sovereign.\n\nIt is certainly of great importance that the fair fame and well-earned reputation of military men should be cherished, and protected from the blight of flippant or unfounded aspersion; and I am confident you will be ready to contribute to so desirable a purpose by handing down to posterity, in your widely circulated publication, this just tribute of an unprejudiced Nova Scotian to the\nof his complaint baffled the skill of his physicians. He expired on 5th of January, 1816, and his remains were deposited on the 11th January, in the family vault at East Barnet, Hertfordshire.\n\nvirtues and talents of his late governor, which I am certain will be perused by many with as much satisfaction and interest as it has been by your constant reader.\u2014AN OLD SOLDIER.\n\n\"We have copied from the London Gazette\u2020 the posthumous honors bestowed upon Sir George Prevost, with a lively pleasure, in which we are sure the great mass of our readers will participate. Some few indeed there are (and we say it with pain) whom we remember pressing nearest to his person, and bowing most profoundly at his levees here, who altered their tone prodigiously when the great and good man was thought to be falling. Where this proceeded, as we believe it mostly did, from a trifling levity of mind, veering like a silken vane, with every wind, it can only be an object for our pity. But if there were any one who could be enemies to so excellent a man, we wish them no greater punishment than the ranklings of their own bad hearts, when they read the judgment pronounced upon him by his Prince.\n\n\"For ourselves, as we profess not to flatter the living, so we wish to do justice to the dead. We never had but one opinion of Sir George Prevost, which we formed upon some knowledge of his character, and which we never saw reason to change. We were pleased with the even cheerfulness of his temper, with his simple unassuming manners, and his condescension to people of every rank. We admired his vigorous, active, penetrating mind. But we peculiarly respected him for his probity, his independence, his justice; in short for principles of morals and religion, such as we have but rarely met.\n\n\"Sir George Prevost, we believe, never had any patron but his services and character. Recommended by these alone, he was selected to defend us at a time when the people of the United States had full confidence that they would speedily be in possession of Halifax. And some time after, when Sir James Craig had left Canada in a state of irritation little short of rebellion, 'the Prince Regent (as the Secretary's letter expressed it) having had experience of his\n\n\u2020 \"Whitehall, 3rd September.\u2014His Royal Highness the Prince Regent, taking into his Royal consideration the distinguished conduct and services of the late Lieutenant-General Sir George Prevost, Bart., during a long period of constant active employment in situations of great trust, both military and civil, in the course of which his gallantry, zeal, and able conduct were particularly displayed at the conquest of the Island of St. Lucia, in 1803, and of the Island of Martinique in 1809; as also in successfully opposing, with a small garrison, the attack made in 1805, by a numerous French force, upon the Island of Dominica, then under his government; and while governor-general and commander-in-chief of the British Provinces in North America, in the defence of Canada against the repeated invasions perseveringly attempted by the American forces during the late war; and his Royal Highness being desirous of evincing in an especial manner, the sense which his Royal Highness entertains of these services, by conferring on his family a lasting memorial of his Majesty's royal favor, hath been pleased, in the name and on the behalf of his Majesty to ordain, that the supporters following may be borne and used by Dame Catherine Anne Prevost, widow of the said late Lieutenant-General Sir George Prevost, during her widowhood, viz.\u2014\"On either side a grenadier of the 16th (or Bedfordshire) Regiment of Foot, each supporting a banner, that on the dexter side inscribed WEST INDIES, and that on the sinister CANADA; and that the said supporters, together with the motto, 'SERVATUM CINERI,' may also be borne by Sir George Prevost, Bart., son and heir of the said late lieutenant-general, and by his successors in the said dignity of a baronet; provided the same be first duly exemplified according to the laws of arms, and recorded in the Herald's Office. And his Royal Highness hath been also pleased to command, that the said concession and especial mark of the royal favor be registered in his Majesty's College of Arms.\"\nby his near relations, a few of his particular friends, and the officers who composed his personal staff in Canada. Sir George Prevost was the eldest son of Major-General Augustine Prevost,\n\ntalents, both for civil and military affairs,' ordered him to assume the administration of that most delicate and difficult government.\n\n\"And certainly no man could be better qualified to reconcile (if that were possible) the two discordant parties, who with very unequal numbers, but equal animosity, have so long divided, and still unhappily divide, that province. But since even his good temper, impartiality, and address could effect nothing like cordial union, he took the course which his duty plainly required\u2014to be of neither party; to employ men who had talents and influence, without any distinction whether they were of French or English origin, or whether they had been obnoxious or otherwise to his predecessor.\n\n\"This equal holding of the balance was displeasing to the English party; but it saved the country. It gained Sir George the entire confidence and affections of the Canadians. They submitted to be severely trained to arms; they took his army bills as cash; and when the enemy invaded the country, encouraged by the supposed disaffection of the inhabitants, General Wilkinson testifies, that they met nothing but the most determined hostility in the whole male population. And another general (Hampton) could testify that he and his army were discomfitted by the gallant De Salaberry, a Canadian gentleman, at the head of one or two companies of Canadian militia.\n\n\"In brief, when this war broke out, Sir George was informed that England could neither send him men nor money. But, confident in the affections of the people he governed, and in the resources of his own mind, he met the enemy at every point where he attacked, along a frontier of eleven hundred miles; and at every point he repulsed him with loss and disgrace; until the whole fleet on Lake Erie being captured\u2014and captured, beyond all controversy, for want of one hundred seamen, whilst we had one hundred ships of war upon the station\u2014the loss of uppermost Canada inevitably followed.\n\n\"Another much more unaccountable disaster upon the water\u2014the defeat of an English fleet by that of the enemy on Lake Champlain\u2014rendered it altogether impossible for Sir George to penetrate, as he had been instructed, into the interior of the United States. Which being the case, and none can deny it, he thought he could not answer for blood 'unprofitably shed' by assaulting the works at Plattsburgh, which he assuredly must abandon, if he succeeded, in less than a month. But here was a fine opportunity for wicked passions to work. It was convenient for the beaten navy to devolve the blame upon the land service. It was delightful to the domineering party at Quebec to be revenged of the man who had trusted to French Canadians. They were able artful men, and high in office. They had attempted long before to get Sir George recalled, by privately representing to the Prince Regent that his conciliating system, as they called it, would be ruinous to the authority of government. But now they thought no terms need be kept. The brother of one of the highest civil officers\u2014himself a civil officer\u2014was afterwards found to be the writer of the most virulent libels upon Sir George that appeared in the Montreal Herald. That paper, and the Acadian Recorder, teemed with calumnies and abuse against that good man, which must ever be esteemed disgraceful to the countries in which they were published; and we believe that both countries now think so.\n\n\"We have not room in an article of this sort to enter largely into the subject. We shall only say that we profess to think for ourselves, and not to follow the momentary cry of a mob. We think that there is often more magnanimity displayed in not fighting, than in fighting; and certainly much more in facing obloquy than in facing a cannon. The Heralds of Sedition, and Recorders of Calumnies, were as busy in the days of Fabius as they have been in ours. They called him Pedagogue, coward, old woman, every thing; because he would not fight just when they thought he should. He bore with the infamy of the day, and is illustrious to all posterity.\n\nNon ponet enim rumores ante salutem:\nErgo postique magisque virtu nunc gloria claret.\nwho served under General Wolfe, and was severely wounded on the Plains of Abraham, and who afterwards so eminently distinguished himself in the first American war, by his defence of Savannah.\n\n\"Such also was Sir George Prevost. He knew very well what use his enemies would make of his retreat from Plattsburg. He might have assaulted and carried the place (for we think it would have fallen); and, after burying one or two thousand brave men in the ditch, returned with the applause of the multitude, bought with the tears of widows and orphans, and without any one advantage to his country. He followed the dictates of his conscience, and trusted to the deliberate voice of his country for his fame. It has not disappointed him.\n\n\"But we hasten to the catastrophe. Sir George Prevost went home (with an eagerness and by a route that exhausted nearly all the strength he had left) to answer every charge his enemies might bring; and when he arrived he could scarcely find his accuser; or whether he had any. He pressed for an investigation, however, before a proper tribunal; where he might vindicate his character from the foul calumnies which he would not stoop to answer in the country where he governed. This demand was evaded, and various successive reasons found for deferring the trial for a long and most distressing period to him.\n\n\"The government seemed to wish that no investigation should take place. Indeed the feelings of the two great branches of the public service seemed to be too much concerned in the case. That of the military might be implied from the favorite and official organ of the commander-in-chief giving a dinner to Sir George and his friends upon his arrival in London. Whilst that of the navy was but too plainly marked by the court-martial on Captain Pring, who thought proper not only to try their own officers, but to declare their censure also of the governor-general of Canada.\n\n\"Hereupon Sir George reiterated his demand of a speedy trial; and a day was at last fixed, and Sir James Yeo obliged to give in his formal charges. It is plain that the whole must have turned upon this\u2014Was the fleet lost, or was it not, by want of co-operation of the land forces? On this point Sir George was ready, long ready, to meet his accusers with superabundant evidence. We have not a doubt but he would have been triumphantly acquitted, and sent back with a peacage\u2014a well-earned peacage, to his government. But alas! the justice and the reward were reserved for his ashes. His frame, exhausted by most faithful and laborious services to his country; by a journey through the wilderness in the midst of the winter, to meet his accusers; and by the still more painful delays of justice, sunk at last; and he went to a tribunal where he will find justice. So fell a great and good man; without anything to cheer him, but the rectitude of his heart, and a conscience void of offence to God and man. We are assured from good authority, that when his death was known at Quebec, it drew tears from the eyes of those very persons who had opposed his administration as too indulgent to the French Canadians.\n\n\"We have only to add, that his lady, after a few days of bitter grief, presented a spirited memorial to the minister; demanding that the proposed court-martial should proceed notwithstanding the decease of her husband; as she was ready to meet it, and to vindicate his fame. After reference to the judge advocate general it was answered, that such a request could not be complied with; but that his Majesty's ministers never had any intention to throw a shade on the name of Sir George Prevost; but on the contrary would show their high esteem of his services by conferring honors on his family; and a gentleman was sent from the secretary's office, to settle with her ladyship at Belmont how this might be done most agreeably to her feelings. The issue was what we have given from the Gazette; and nothing could be thought of more judicious. The Supporters, the proper badges of nobility, give the honor of the peacage, without the rank, to which the fortune left by Sir George was not equal, though his merits were. The words displayed upon the banners will be a perpetual memorial of the great and important services which Sir George in his lifetime rendered to his country.\n\n\"The facts which we have stated in this article we have from highly-respectable correspondents, on whom we can fully rely; and we conceived they would be interesting to our readers.\"\u2014Gentleman's Magazine, January, 1817.\nOf the two brothers of Sir George, the eldest was a post-captain in the royal navy, and the other a major-general in the army. Sir George Prevost married in the year 1789, Catherine, daughter of Major-General Phipps. A son and two daughters are still living, the former being now the Reverend Sir George Prevost.\n\nMAJOR-GENERAL SIR ISAAC BROCK, K.B.\n\nThe renowned General Isaac Brock was the eighth son of John Brock, Esq. He was born in the island of Guernsey on the 6th October, 1769, the year which gave birth to Napoleon and Wellington. In his boyhood, he was like his brother, unusually tall; robust and precocious, and remarkable chiefly for his extreme gentleness. In his eleventh year he was sent to school at Southampton, and the following year finished his education at Rotterdam. In his fifteenth year he succeeded, by purchase, to the ensigncy of the 8th, the King's regiment, which had become vacant by the promotion of his brother, John, to a lieutenancy in the same regiment. In 1790 he was promoted to a lieutenancy, and was quartered in Guernsey and Jersey. At the close of that year he obtained an independent company. Soon after he exchanged into the 49th, which was quartered at Barbadoes, and he remained there doing duty until 1793, when he returned to England on sick leave. On the 26th of June he purchased his majority. On the completion of his twenty-eighth year, on the 27th of October, 1797, he purchased the lieutenant-colonelcy of the 49th, and soon after became senior lieutenant-colonel. In 1799 his regiment embarked on an expedition to Holland under Sir Ralph Abercrombie, and on its landing, an engagement took place in which the British lost about 10,000 men. Lieutenant-Colonel Brock distinguished himself very much during this campaign, and was wounded in the battle of Egmont-of-Zee on the 2nd of October.\n\nEarly in 1801, the 49th was again embarked in the fleet destined for the Baltic, under Sir Hyde Parker, and Lieutenant-Colonel Brock was the second in command of the land forces at the remarkable attack of Copenhagen, by Lord Nelson on the 2nd April. The regiment returned to England soon afterwards, and in the spring of 1802, sailed for Canada.\n\nSome eighteen months after his arrival in Canada, a serious conspiracy was on the point of breaking out in Fort George,\nwhere part of the 49th was in garrison. By the promptitude of Lieutenant-Colonel Brock, however, the ringleaders were secured, tried by court martial and condemned to death. The sentence was carried out in Quebec early in March, 1804, where the men\u2014four in all\u2014were shot in the presence of the entire garrison. Lieutenant-Colonel Brock was now directed to assume the command of Fort George, and all complaint and desertion instantly ceased, and the 49th became one of the best regiments of the line.\n\nIn 1805, our hero was made full colonel, and returned in the fall of the year to England. While in England he laid before the commander-in-chief the outlines of a plan for the formation of a veteran battalion for Canada, which received the special thanks of the Duke of York. In 1806, while on a visit to his friends in Guernsey, the political feeling in the United States assumed a threatening aspect, and the colonel returned to Canada.\n\nIn September, 1806, he succeeded to the command of the troops in the two provinces, and made Quebec his residence. On the 2nd July, 1808, he was appointed to act as brigadier. In 1810 he proceeded to the upper province, being replaced at Quebec by the Baron de Rottenburg. On the 4th of June, 1811, he was promoted and appointed by the Prince Regent to serve as a major-general on the Staff of North America.\n\nIn this month Sir James Craig, who had been in chief command of the North American provinces, embarked for England, where he died some months after his arrival. He was succeeded by Sir George Prevost, who arrived at Quebec in September, and on the 9th of October, Major General Brock, in addition to the command of the troops, was appointed president and administrator of the government in Upper Canada, in place of Lieutenant-Governor Gore, who had returned to England on leave. \"At the close of the year,\" says Mr. Symons, of Toronto, in a pamphlet lately published by him on the battle of Queenston Heights, \"His Royal Highness the Duke of York expressed at length every inclination to gratify Major-General Brock's wishes for more active employment in Europe, and Sir George Prevost was authorized to replace him by another officer; but when the permission reached Canada early in 1812, a war with the United States was evidently near at hand, and Major-General Brock, with such a prospect, was retained both by honor and inclination in the country, and he employed himself vigorously to the adoption of such precautionary measures as he deemed necessary to meet all future contingencies. From the first moment of being placed at the head of the government, he appears to have been convinced that war was inevitable, and in consequence used every exertion to place the province in as respectable a state of defence as his very limited means would admit. Immediately after war was declared, he made Fort George his head-quarters, and superintended the various defences...\"\nof the river. He then went to York (now Toronto), where the legislature was assembled, and having dispatched the public business, set out for Amherstburg, on the 6th of August, with two hundred and fifty militia, who cheerfully came forward to accompany him. The taking of Detroit soon followed, an achievement which his energy and decision crowned with such unqualified success, that the government at home appointed him an extra knight of the most honorable order of the Bath, and he was gazetted to this mark of his country's approbation, so gratifying to the feelings of a soldier, on the 10th of October, but he lived not long enough to learn that he obtained so honorable a distinction, the knowledge of which would have cheered him in his last moments. On the 6th of October, when his despatches, accompanied by the colors of the United States 4th Regiment reached London, the Park and Tower guns fired a salute, and in one short week afterwards Brock died.\"\n\nIn a despatch from Earl Bathurst, secretary of state for the colonies, to Sir George Provost, the following tribute of respect is paid by the British government to the memory of General Brock:\n\n\"His Royal Highness the Prince Regent is fully aware of the severe loss which his Majesty's service has experienced in the death of Major-General Sir Isaac Brock. That would have been sufficient to have clouded a victory of much greater importance. His Majesty has lost in him, not only an able and meritorious officer, but one who, in the exercise of his functions of provincial lieutenant-governor of the province, displayed qualities admirably adapted to dismay the disloyal, to reconcile the wavering, and to animate the great mass of the inhabitants against successive attempts of the enemy to invade the province, in the last of which he fell; too prodigal of that life of which his eminent services had taught us to understand the value.\"\n\nWe opine, that every one knows the circumstances of his glorious fall and death; if not, the splendid monument on the sacred heights of Queenston, reddened with the hero's blood, erected as a spontaneous free-will offering to his memory, by the people of Canada, and British America generally, can pathetically tell the tale. It would be well, however, to append a brief sketch of the memorable battle which took place, and in which he sacrificed himself for the good and honor of his country; and a more lengthened account of the principal events of his life in this country and the war of 1812. We feel we cannot perform that duty better, than by giving the able speech of Sir Allan N. McNab, the worthy baronet of Dundurn, delivered on the very spot to the remaining survivors and heroes of the war of 1812, in presence of a numerous and distinguished party, met to inaugurate the restored monument in 1859:\n\n\"My friends,\" said the gallant baronet, \"we meet upon the\nanniversary of a day freshly remembered by some now present, and rendered deeply interesting to all the inhabitants of Canada, by the event which will for ever associate the 13th October with Queenston Heights. On that day, forty-seven years ago, was fought upon these heights what is known in history and in your family traditions as the \"Battle of Queenston.\" It was, though crowned with ultimate success, a day of vicissitudes, and not without alloy. When hostilities suddenly commenced on this side of the Atlantic in the year 1812, the gallant soldiers of the mother country were, under the illustrious Wellington, engaged in the sanguinary operations of the war in Europe; and knowing the inability of the king to succor us with reinforcements adequate to our defense, the illustrious Brock, with implicit faith, at once placed his reliance mainly upon the militia of the province, and our ever faithful Indian allies, for the protection of this part of her Majesty's dominions. Events proved that his confidence was not misplaced. His first exploit was at the head of an expedition, which he organized, composed of volunteers from the militia and Indian warriors, and the few regular troops at his disposal. He led that expedition from the seat of government to the capture of Detroit: and such was his imposing advance, that the terrified garrison\u2014the fort\u2014the guns\u2014and munitions of war were all surrendered at discretion. The clouds of war having been promptly dispersed in that extremity of the province, soon gathered on the banks of the Niagara, and then ensued a series of encounters, in three successive years, which have rendered the Niagara frontier, already celebrated for its mighty cataract, famous in the military annals of the British empire.\n\n\"The first serious battle was upon these heights. In the early part of that momentous day the enemy had gained possession of the elevated ground, and the intrepid Brock, regardless of their numbers and position, made a too daring attempt to dislodge them. While valiantly charging up the abrupt ascent, at the head of a far inferior force, he fell, mortally wounded. Brock fell\u2014not as Wolfe fell\u2014in the arms of Victory\u2014for Victory still hovered in the distance. He fell, rather as Montcalm (a kindred spirit) fell\u2014in the moment of repulse; and, like both Wolfe and Montcalm, he met a soldier's death upon the battle-field. He fell in the arms of his country, and they shall for ever embrace him. You all know the sequel. Although the enemy prevailed in the outset, and though the chivalrous Brock and his gallant aide-de-camp and many other gallant men had fallen, and although discomfited at a time, yet the survivors, not dismayed or cast down, but impelled by the thrilling example of their late leader, and burning to avenge the fall of the hero and his comrades, soon rallied again under the gallant Sir Roger Sheaffe, who succeeded to the command, and gathering up their strength, they with renewed energy...\nreturned to the combat and crowned the day, and crowned these heights with a brilliant victory. It may, without exaggeration (allowing for the difference in numbers) be almost said of the final attack by the remnant of the regular soldiers, militia and Indian warriors, at the close of that day, as has been beautifully said, by the eloquent Napier, of the final advance, to retrieve the day, of the renowned 7th and 23rd Fusileer Regiments at the crisis of the battle upon the bloody field of Albuera\u2014'Nothing,' says the historian of the Peninsular campaigns, 'could stop that astonishing infantry: their measured tread shook the ground; their dreadful volleys swept away the head of every formation; their deafening shouts overpowered the dissonant cries that broke from all parts of the tumultuous crowd as, with a horrid carnage, it was pushed by the incessant vigor of the attack, to the farthest edge of the heights. There the enemy's reserve, mixing with the struggling multitude, endeavored to restore the fight, but only augmented the irremediable disorder, and the mighty mass, giving way, like a loosened cliff, went headlong down the steep, and eighteen hundred unwounded men, the remnant of six thousand unconquerable British soldiers, stood triumphantly on the fatal hill.'\n\nThe loss of our beloved general, at that early stage of the war, cannot be estimated, nor its effects described. He had established himself in the confidence of all classes in the highest degree, and had become a tower of strength in his single person.\n\n\"The deep hold which he had acquired in the affections of the people, is manifested by the lively interest which, from the day of his death to the present hour, has been universally taken in his cherished memory and undying fame. This universal feeling of respect prompted the legislature, soon after the peace, to erect a monument on these heights, sacred to the memory of the illustrious dead. It was done; and his remains, with those of his steadfast friend, McDonell, reposed beneath the lofty and imposing pile\u2014fit emblem of a people's admiration, reverence and gratitude. Of its wanton and malicious spoliation you are well aware. Let the corrupt heart that conceived the design, and the coward hand that polluted a hero's unguarded shrine, under the cloak of midnight darkness, remain in darkness to the end of time. We would not give a further thought to the reprobate perpetrator, but leave him to the contempt and scorn of all mankind. The flame of indignation, which the dastardly act lit up throughout Canada, blazed conspicuously upon these heights in the year 1840. We here saw a mighty host assembled from all parts of the province, not only to express their resentment of the foul offence, but to show forth to the world their lasting veneration for the departed warriors whose tomb had been thus desecrated. It was there amidst the vehement acclamation of thousands, resolved to re-construct, by private subscription, another trophy, more towering than the first, in proof\nthat the feeling which animated the Legislature in 1815, and the men of that day had not waned, but still glowed in every breast, and to testify that the lamented soldiers, though dead, did indeed live in the hearts of their countrymen. The fruits of that day's resolution now covering the bodies of Brock and McDonell appear in the beautiful column which stands before us\u2014'Esto perpetua!'\n\nIt may be proper for me to give here a brief outline of the proceedings which have led to this result. It being rightly apprehended that the former monument had been so much shaken that it must soon fall in fragments, the necessity for taking steps to replace it became urgent. The initiative was taken on the 4th of June, 1840, by the men of Gore, whom I had the honour to command. These gallant men, on the occasion of their annual parade, passed a series of resolutions, expressing, in strong terms, their solicitude on this subject. Those resolutions, having been, by me, transmitted through the adjutant-general, Colonel Bullock, to the lieutenant-governor, Sir George Arthur, were cordially responded to by his Excellency. He, in compliance with the wishes expressed by the men of Gore, and in furtherance of the desired object, summoned the militia and other inhabitants of Upper Canada to assemble on Queenston Heights on the thirtieth of July of the same year. In obedience to the call, a meeting of many thousands took place at the base of the shattered column, and there resolutions were passed, which I need not detain you by repeating. Suffice it to say, that all offerings were to be spontaneous, and that the opportunity might, without inconvenience to the contributors, be extended as widely as the inclination prevailed, the amount to be subscribed by the officers and men of the militia was limited to one day's pay of their respective ranks when on active service.\n\n\"Subscriptions were from time to time, received from thousands who were thus appealed to, and additional sums were received from other sources\u2014among others, the officers and men of several regiments of the Loyal New Brunswick Militia presented their donations, and expressed in warm terms their respect for the memory of General Brock, and their sympathy with the object in contemplation. Very handsome contributions were also made by the brave Indian chiefs and warriors; many of whom rendered such good service on the memorable thirteenth of October and on many other occasions, some the most trying that occurred during the war. The remittances of these brave and faithful warriors were accompanied by addresses to the Queen's representative, expressive of their indignation and disgust at the atrocious act of desecration which had rendered their assistance necessary. These addresses emanated from the chiefs of different tribes, scattered throughout Upper Canada, and all breathed a similar feeling, expressed in the native eloquence and beauty of language for which the warrior chiefs of the 'red men of the forest,' are so justly celebrated,\nIn acknowledging their liberal gifts they were assured that their names should be honorably associated with those of their white brethren in this laudable undertaking, as their money would be mingled with the common fund raised for the accomplishment of a common object. And it has been done. It may be proper hereafter to publish the whole correspondence and proceedings which ensued after the meeting of the 30th of July, 1840, including the names of all the militiamen and others, through whose pecuniary aid the committee was, after much unavoidable delay, enabled to commence and eventually to finish the structure which we are now assembled formally to inaugurate. But it would quite exceed the limits of an address like this, which, I fear will prove unreasonably long, although restricted to general observations, without entering upon details. I will, therefore, merely add that donations were received from gentlemen in England, including General Brock's brother; from Lord Aylmer, Lord Sydenham and Sir John Harvey; from militiamen of Lower Canada and New Brunswick; but principally from the officers and men of the militia and the Indian chiefs and warriors within the limits of Upper Canada. The monies received amounted to $50,211, and the expenditure to $47,944, leaving a balance of $2,267 in hand. Designs were called for, and the one submitted by the talented architect, Mr. Thomas,* was selected. Under his superintendence the whole has been satisfactorily completed by Mr. Worthington,* the builder, in the style you see. You will agree with me, I hope, that it reflects great credit on the taste and judgment of the architect and the skill of the builder; and, associated as they have become with the work, it cannot fail to constitute a conspicuous and lasting proof of their professional abilities.\n\n\"My friends, this monument represents a free-will offering flowing from emotions which reminiscences of the last war awaken. It commemorates the feelings of the country, inspired by the death of Brock and the brave men who fell with him on these heights, enhanced by the subsequent achievements which, invigorated and encouraged by their example, the loyal inhabitants of Canada proudly exult in. It points back to the scenes which were enacted in former years. It points forward to the deeds which those scenes inculcate. In those years the blood of our militia and of our valiant Indian allies was freely shed, and mingled with the blood of the regular soldiers with whom they fought and died side by side in defence of Canada. Yes, with a spirit and endurance beyond all praise, the three, supporting each other, maintained the whole line of an extended frontier, and repelled attack at every point. Though sometimes overpowered by superior numbers, and not always able to at once dislodge the enemy, yet they steadily resisted his incursions and circumscribed his foothold within the\n\n*Of Toronto, Canada West.\nnarrowest limits. I may mention, as instances, the lines of circumvallation\u2014the cross-roads forming the centre, which hemmed in the enemy in the town of Niagara in 1813, and the siege and investment of Fort Erie in 1814. In the end, by indomitable perseverance and unflinching courage, every invader was expelled, so that when the welcome news of peace reached us, no part of our soil, that I can remember, remained in possession of the United States forces. We had conquered territory to restore by the terms of the treaty\u2014none to receive back. All that we boast of could only have been accomplished by the devoted spirit of our men\u2014as instances of their prowess let Chateauguay, Chrysler's Farm, Ogdensburgh, Stoney Creek, Fort Niagara, Queenston Heights and Lundy's Lane testify. The details of these conflicts, to which might be added many others, not less than fifty in all, would, though full of interest, exceed the limits of this occasion; it is the task of the historian to narrate them. It may, however, interest you to be told that, on this frontier the last shot was fired, on Lyon's Creek at Cook's Mills, in the month of October, not on the 13th but the 19th, in the year 1814. The echo of that shot may still vibrate in the ears of some present. It was providentially ordained that it should prove a farewell shot; the precursor of a lasting peace with our high-spirited and gallant neighbours, of whom it may be truly said that with characteristic impulse they warmly espoused the cause of their country, and bravely sustained it in many hot encounters. It is our mutual interest, and doubtless, our mutual inclination and desire, to live in the friendly intercourse and good fellowship which have since prevailed. Let no turbulence disturb the harmony. May no international strife ever again place us in a hostile attitude. The sympathy manifested by that people at the funeral of General Brock, when his remains were first interred at Fort George, and in the steps afterwards taken to do honor to his memory, evinced how justly they appreciate heroic character, and accords well with the spirit of a nation emulous of heroic deeds.\n\nMy Friends, when we extol the gallantry of our militia, we do them but half justice, and do commend but a part only of the merit which distinguished them. We should not overlook the exposure and the privations which (thinly clad and ill provided as many poor men were) all endured during three long years of trial. There were the out-lying picket; the frontier guard; the sentinel's vigilance; the midnight patrol; the morning watch;\u2014there were the storms of the seasons, there were the sickness and death. Add to this, wives and children\u2014mothers and sisters\u2014the aged and infirm\u2014houses and barns\u2014the cattle and the grain\u2014all but deserted, at the imperative call to arms of their invaded country. It required the highest moral courage to relinquish, as our militia did, their peaceful homes when summoned away by the loud blasts\nof war. My friends, I indulge in no fiction or flights of imagination in these allusions to harrowing recollections; they are realities vivid in living memory. There are, amongst us, those whose hearts still bleed at the remembrance of those days so full of anguish, glorious though they were. Let the historian, then, when he narrates the valiant deeds of our militia, not omit to add that they were performed in days full of domestic anxiety, disquietude and care, in all parts of the province; and especially on this frontier, where every home was abandoned, almost every house burnt down, and every farm laid waste, from the town of Niagara, at one extremity, to Fort Erie at the other. Let him record that the men, whose brilliant acts he lauds and holds up to imitation, had to encounter not only the toils of the campaign and the violence of the foe, but, in tearing themselves from their families and homes, had to encounter the more severe and painful trial of overcoming some of the profoundest and best affections of their nature. It was in scenes such as then occurred that the scourge of war was felt, and that the genuine heroism of a stout hearted people was most touchingly displayed. It was the sublime of patriotism. By obeying as they did the voice of duty, and standing boldly forward in the foremost ranks, they protected their country in the hour of need, they saved their dwellings from desolation, and shielded their families from impending dangers, and, in the end, they triumphed! They proved that, while our country is true to itself, no foreign power can ever ride its destinies or subjugate its people. Every drop of blood shed, every life lost in that eventful struggle, did but cement more strongly attachment to the soil and fidelity to the Crown, and did but develop more and more that loyal and martial spirit with which I am ever proud to proclaim the militia of Upper Canada have been always animated. The militia of that day acted as became them, and were taught by the graphic teaching of example how it would become their posterity to act, should (which God avert) a call of like urgency ever again invoke a like energy and devotion in the military service of their country. When we reflect then, that the militia were led to their earliest triumphs, and inspired with confidence and self-reliance, by the encouraging example of Brock, that the example and influence became, as it were, the foundation of all that followed his untimely death, we can understand how it is that all adore his memory.\n\n\"Friends, this fit emblem of a nation's gratitude is now inaugurated. We here dedicate it to the memory of Sir Isaac Brock, and those who fell by his side upon this battle field, and, through them, to the imperishable memory of all who fell in defence of Canada. It is the becoming offering of an admiring and grateful people to Sir Isaac Brock. It grandly illustrates the affection steadfastly cherished for the heroic champion who, in the dark\nhour of our adversity, laid down his life in our cause. It is a splendid and imposing proof that half a century has not diminished the public esteem for that noble man, nor dimmed the recollection of his noble actions. It is a consummation in which all proudly exult and warmly participate. It is a commemoration of this anniversary worthy of both the living and the dead. It perpetuates events that shall never be obliterated. It shews forth the spirit of this day, and should future exigencies require it, a like spirit would be aroused half a century to come\u2014yes to the latest posterity\u2014by a people ever prepared to evince that there exists, to the memory of Brock, a monument more durable than stone, in the patriot hearts of successive generations. Well done, noble militia! Well done, people of Canada! Let this spot be hallowed to the latest time, honored to the remains of the heroic dead! May they repose in peace until the Judgment morning, when the sound of the last trump shall rend this pillar\u2014burst the tomb\u2014and awaken the sleepers to the resurrection, eternal life! One word more. Would that what I have said were better said, and more worthy of the occasion. Before we part, permit me, in the name of Canada, to thank you for your voluntary presence here to-day, to pay these last obsequies at the shrine of Brock. I feel that I may also thank you, in the name of his Excellency the Governor-General, who would, I am sure, have joined us, had not a sad bereavement, which we all deplore, prevented his attendance. We have also to regret the absence of our much respected and old friends, Sir John Beverley Robinson and Mr. Justice McLean, both of whom fought at the battle of Queenston, and the latter of whom was severely wounded; but I regret to say that their official duties, in holding the circuit courts, deprives us of the honor of their presence, and them of the gratification it would have afforded them to have attended on this interesting occasion. I feel that I may thank you and all the contributors to this pious work, in her Majesty\u2019s name, for this gratifying manifestation of loyalty. In my own name, and in the name of the committee, of which I have had the honor to be chairman, I must heartily thank you, and all other contributors, towards a consummation which has been near my heart for many years\u2014an event in which I glory, and which renders this to me one of the proudest and happiest days of my life. And now, remarking that this monumental pile was commenced, and has been finished, in the reign of our most gracious and justly beloved queen, Victoria, I shall close, by proposing to you, what is ever enthusiastically received, and heartily responded to by the loyal militia of Canada: Three cheers for the Queen\u2014God bless her!\u201d\n\nThe regret manifested at the death of the brave and high souled general was not confined to Canada. In England it also found a vent; and the Imperial Government appropriated a large sum of money, and erected a fitting monument to his memory in St. Paul\u2019s\ncathedral. On the occasion of the late visit of the heir apparent to the British throne, another touching incident took place, which shewed that Brock was still remembered. An obelisk had been erected where he fell; and the Prince of Wales had the honor to lay the corner stone thereof\u2014thus paying another compliment to the illustrious dead. It was a princely act, and will be long remembered by all those present.\n\nTECUMSEH.\n\nThis celebrated Indian chief was born in 1770, and died October 5, 1813. He was the son of a Shawanee warrior, and was born on the Scioto river, Ohio. He was engaged in many incursions into Kentucky, and intercepted many boats descending the Ohio. It is supposed that about 1806, he and his brother, Elskwatawa, the prophet, formed the project of uniting all the western Indians in a war against the Americans. When General Harrison attacked and defeated the prophet in the battle of Tippecanoe, November 7, 1811, Tecumseh was absent on a visit to the south. In the war of 1812, he was an ally to the British, with the rank of brigadier-general. At the siege of Fort Meigs, and at the second assault in July, he was present, being at the head of two thousand warriors. In the battle of Moravian town, on the Thames, at which Proctor was the British general, the American general, Harrison, had for his aids General Cass and Commodore Perry. Colonel R. M. Johnson commanded on the left, and came into personal conflict it is said with Tecumseh. His horse being killed and himself wounded by three balls in his right thigh, and two in his left arm, the savage chief rushed upon him with his tomahawk; but, drawing a pistol from his holster, Johnson laid him dead at his feet. In this battle, Colonel Johnson's brother, Lieutenant-Colonel James Johnson, was killed. The project of uniting all the western Indians against the Americans, and the efforts made to execute the project, display a savage energy and perseverance rarely to be met with. The prophet as well as the warrior being now deceased, such a combination will probably never be made again. No one, however, can fully calculate the inestimable value of these devoted \"red men,\" led on by the brave Tecumseh during the great struggle of 1812. But for them, it is probable, that we should not now have a Canada; and if we had, we would not enjoy the liberty and privileges which we possess in so\neminent a degree. King Philip Pontiac, the Ottawa chief, who in 1763, captured Michilimackinac, and invested Detroit; the Prophet and Tecumseh may be regarded as the most remarkable of the savage warriors of America. His life was written by Dr. Daniel Drake, 1841.\n\nGENERAL SIR ROGER H. SHEAFFE, BART.\n\nFrom what we can learn of this celebrated man, we understand he was born in Boston, United States, on the 15th July, 1763, and was the third son of William Sheaffe, Esquire, deputy-collector of her Majesty's customs at that port, by Susannah, eldest daughter of Thomas Child, Esquire, of Boston. His father having died, Earl Percy, who had his quarters at his mother's house, evinced an interest in the lad's welfare, took him away with him, and gave him a military education, also purchased a commission for him in the army, and ever afterwards, while he lived, was his friend and patron. This we take from the Honorable Lorenzo Sabine's History of the American Loyalists; the following we obtain from Cannon's Historical Records of the British Army.\n\nSir Roger Sheaffe commenced his military career as an ensign, in the fifth Fusileers, his commission being dated 1st May, 1778, in which regiment he rose to the rank of lieutenant, on the 27th December, 1780. Lieutenant Sheaffe served in Ireland from January, 1781, to May, 1787, and in Canada from July following to September, 1797. In 1794, he was employed under the orders of Lord Dorchester, and with instructions from Lieutenant-Governor Simcoe, on a public mission to protest against certain settlements made by the Americans, on the south shore of Lake Ontario. On the 5th May, 1795, he was promoted to the rank of captain in the fifth Fusileers, and on the 13th December, 1797, was promoted major in the eighty-first regiment, and was advanced to the rank of lieutenant-colonel of the forty-ninth regiment, on the 22nd March, 1798.\n\nLieutenant-Colonel Sheaffe served in Holland, from August to November, 1799; in the Baltic from March to July, 1801; and in Canada from September, 1802, to October, 1811. On the 25th April, 1808, he received the brevet rank of colonel, and on the 4th June, 1811, was advanced to the rank of major-general. He again served in Canada, from the 29th July, 1812, to November,\n1813. The Americans having invaded Upper Canada, at Queenston, on the 13th October, 1812, and General Brock, commanding in the province, having fallen in a gallant effort, with an independent force, to oppose them, Major-General Sheaffe, on whom the command devolved, assembled some regular troops and militia, with a few Indians, and the same day attacked them in a woody height, which they occupied above the town, and completely defeated them, though far exceeding his own followers in number, their commander delivering his sword, and surrendering his surviving troops on the field of battle.\n\nIn acknowledgment of this important service, Major-General Sheaffe was created a baronet by patent, dated 16th January, 1813. When the Americans attacked York (now Toronto) in April, 1813, he concocted such measures for the defence of the town as he thought expedient; but did not stay to assist the local militia, he and his staff evacuating York, a short time prior to the attack of the Americans; for this he has been much condemned, but no doubt certain more weighty matters demanded his attention in another part of the province, more particularly as he was then administrator of the government, having been so constituted on Brock's death.\n\nHe continued to command in Canada West, and to administer its government, until June, 1813, when he was succeeded by General De Rottenburg. On quitting the government, he received from the resident members of the Executive Council, an address expressing their sense of \"that display of candor, justice, and impartiality, which had marked his administration, and the urbanity and confidence of his official intercourse.\" They further acknowledge their conviction, that they owed the salvation of the whole province to his military talents on the memorable day when he succeeded to the command. He was appointed to the staff of Great Britain, on the 25th March, 1814; but the appointment was recalled and deferred, in consequence of the change of affairs in Europe.\n\nSir Roger was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general, on the 19th July, 1821, and on the 21st December, 1829, was appointed colonel of the thirty-sixth regiment. He was advanced to the rank of general, on the 28th June, 1828. His death occurred at Edinburgh, on the 17th July, 1851.\n\nHe married in 1810, Margaret, daughter of John Coffin, Esquire, of Quebec, and cousin of the late Admiral Sir Isaac Coffin, Bart., of whom W. F. Coffin, Esquire, of Ottawa city, C. W., is a descendant, and had issue two sons and four daughters, but they all died before him, unmarried. Lady Sheaffe survived the gallant general but a few years.\nBARON DE ROTTENBURG, K.C.H.\n\nThis distinguished officer was appointed major in Hompesch's Hussars in 1795, and lieutenant-colonel in the following year; and was promoted to a lieutenant-colonelcy in the 60th Foot at the close of 1797. He served in Ireland during the rebellion in 1798. In the same year he formed the 5th battalion of the 60th Regiment into a rifle corps, and prepared the rules and regulations for the exercise of riflemen and light infantry, and their conduct in the field; which, having been approved by his royal highness the commander-in-chief, were published by authority, and made general for the army.\n\nBaron De Rottenburg was at the taking of Surinam in 1799. In 1805 he received the rank of colonel. In 1808 he was appointed brigadier-general, and commanded for a time the exercise of four battalions of light infantry, at the camp of instruction on the Curragh of Kildare, under Sir David Baird; but was, in the same year, transferred from the Irish to the English staff, and stationed at Ashford in Kent, on similar duty. In 1809 he commanded the light troops in the Walcheren expedition, and afterwards returned to the staff in Kent. In May, 1810, he was transferred to the staff in Canada, and took the command of the garrison at Quebec; in the same year he was promoted to the rank of major-general. In 1812, on the breaking out of the American war, he was appointed to the command of the Montreal district; and in 1813 he took the command of the troops in the upper province, and was sworn in president of Upper Canada. In 1812, he was promoted to the colonelcy of De Rolls regiment. In 1814 and 1815, he commanded the left division of the army in Canada, and returned to England in September of the latter year. He attained the rank of lieutenant-general in 1819, and died at Portsmouth, England, on the 24th April, 1832. His son is the present Baron De Rottenburg, a notice of whom appears in this work.\n\nLIEUT.-GENERAL PROCTOR.\n\nHenry A. Proctor, one of the most brave and distinguished British officers in the war of 1812, was the descendant of an ancient family in Wales. He was born in the year 1787; and, selecting\nthe army as his profession, early joined its ranks, in which he saw much service.\n\nOn the breaking out of the last American war with Great Britain, he proceeded to this country in command of the 41st Regiment, and was one of the first officers engaged with the Americans. He was despatched to Amherstburg by General Brock to prevent the landing of Hull, whose forces he repulsed from that place, and defeated at Brownston; an exploit which contributed much to the fall of Detroit and the capitulation of Hull and the American army.\n\nHe also opened the campaign of 1813, by achieving a brilliant victory over a superior force, under Winchester, on the river Raisin, for which he was promoted to the rank of brigadier-general. In the same year he did some damage to the enemy's works at Sandusky, and only retired when their fire was so fierce and terrific as to endanger the safety of the entire expedition.\n\nHis after conduct at Moravian town, on the Thames, when, hemmed in by Harrison, with a large and effective army, is well worthy of indulgent consideration; but following the defeat of Barclay, he was wanted as a victim, and fell accordingly. He was tried by court-martial; the court found that he had not retreated with judgment, and had not judiciously disposed of his force, considering the extraordinary difficulties of his situation; but it further found that his personal conduct was neither defective nor reproachable. He was, however, sentenced to be suspended from rank and pay for six months. He commanded again during the war. General Proctor was much admired by the people of Canada, and the sentence passed upon him was viewed by them as altogether arbitrary and unmerited. He was afterwards promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general, and died at his seat in Wales, at the latter end of 1859.\n\nLIEUT.-COLONEL PLENDERLEATH.\n\nAn estimable and courageous officer, who took part in the American war of 1812. He had served in Canada for some time previous to that event, during which period he had contracted the friendship and esteem of all. At the engagement at Stoney Creek, under Sir John Harvey, his gallantry was conspicuous. He was also engaged at Queenston with a portion of his (49th) regiment, and displayed much courage on that memorable occasion, and in many other\nimportant undertakings during his stay in Canada. He survived the war many years; but suffered severely from numerous wounds which he had received during the struggle. He died, we believe, at Clifton near Bristol, England.\n\nMAJOR-GENERAL JOHN MURRAY.\n\nThe subject of the present sketch was a native of Jamaica, a younger son of Walter Murray, Esq., of St. James's, in that island. He entered the service in his Majesty's 37th Regiment in 1792. On the breaking out of the war in the following year, the 37th was amongst the first of the British army sent over to Ostend, and very shortly after their landing went into action. In one of the early sorties Ensign Murray was wounded by a ball in the face, which remained in his head for more than a fortnight, and then fell through the roof of his mouth. He obtained his lieutenantcy in the same regiment, and was afterwards taken prisoner, with nearly half of his corps, on the banks of the Waal in Holland, in consequence of mistaking from their dress a division of the French cavalry for the British. Being detained a prisoner for a length of time, on his release he was promoted in the same regiment to the rank of captain, accompanying it to Gibraltar and the West Indies. He obtained his majority in the 4th Regiment; and after the peace of 1802, was appointed to the 39th.\n\nWhen the 100th Regiment was raised previous to 1812, he joined as lieutenant-colonel, and was sent with them to British North America. He then became inspecting field-officer of the Canadian militia, and in that capacity had the command of the army in advance, and intended to check the proceedings of a very superior force of the United States army, whose object was to render the position of the British untenable, by laying waste the whole of the frontier of Upper Canada. Colonel Murray marched with his comparatively small body of troops to meet the enemy, obliging them to abandon the enterprise; and, taking Fort George, drove them out of the province. The subsequent assault and capture of the Fort of Niagara is thus mentioned in \"General Orders,\" dated Quebec, December 29, 1813:\n\n\"The fort of Niagara was most gallantly carried by assault at the point of the bayonet, at daybreak, on the morning of the 19th instant, by a detachment consisting of the grenadiers of the Royals,\nthe flank companies of the 41st, the 100th Regiment, and a small party of the royal artillery, under the command of Colonel Murray. The enemy suffered severely in killed and wounded. Captain Leonard, the commandant, several officers, and the greater part of the garrison were made prisoners. This gallant enterprise was achieved with the loss on our part of very few of our brave men; but his Excellency has to regret the fall of Lieutenant Nolan of the 100th Regiment, and that Colonel Murray has been wounded. All the ordnance mounted in the fort, together with three thousand stand of arms, clothing, and military stores of every description, to a considerable amount, have fallen into our hands. His Excellency is in hourly expectation of receiving the official details of this brilliant affair, which reflects the highest honor upon Colonel Murray, and the small detachment under his command.\"\n\nWhen, by the peace, Colonel Murray's services were no longer required in Canada, thinking his health might benefit by a residence in a milder climate, he passed some time in France; but, having there the misfortune to lose his wife, whose early death was the source of deep affliction to him, he returned in broken health and spirits to England; and after a long and painful illness, borne with his characteristic patience and fortitude, he died at Brighton, on the 21st of February, leaving an only daughter.\n\nSIR THOMAS BLIGH ST. GEORGE, C.B., K.C.H.\n\nThis brave and distinguished officer was an ensign in the 27th Foot, and removed from that regiment to the 11th in 1783, and in 1790 he obtained a lieutenancy in the same. During that period he served at Gibraltar, with the exception of eighteen months' leave of absence. In April, 1793, he embarked with the troops for Toulon, and was present in all the actions that occurred, until the evacuation of that place in December following. He served in 1794 at the reduction of St. Fiorenza, Bastia, and Calvi, in Corsica; and in 1795 on the coast of France. In November, 1794, he was appointed to a company in the 90th Foot. He served on the staff in Portugal from the latter end of 1796 to 1798; from 1799 to 1802 in the Mediterranean; and from 1802 to 1805 on the staff in England and Ireland. In 1804 he was appointed major in the 90th Foot; and in 1805 lieutenant-colonel in the 68rd Foot.\nIn March 1809 he embarked for this province, having been appointed an inspecting field-officer of militia in the western section of the country, where he continued to serve for some years. He commanded at Amherstburg, in the upper province, when invaded and attacked by General Hull; and he likewise commanded the militia at the taking of Detroit, in August, 1812, (for which he received a medal), and at the river Raisin in the Michigan territory, when General Winchester was defeated. In this service he received six severe wounds.\n\nHe was advanced to the brevet of colonel in 1813, and to that of major-general in 1819. He was nominated a companion of the Bath on the 4th of June, 1815; a knight commander of the Guelphic order in January 1835; and received the honor of knighthood at St. James's Palace, on the 18th February following. He died in London on the 6th November, 1837.\n\nCOLONEL JAMES FITZGIBBON.\n\nColonel Fitzgibbon was in the 19th and 61st Regiments, and retired as a captain of the Glengarry Fencibles, in 1816. Since that time he has been a lieutenant-colonel and colonel of the 1st Regiment of Toronto militia, and assistant adjutant-general to the militia of Upper Canada. He served in the action near the Helder, and elsewhere in Holland, and was taken prisoner at Egmont-op-Zee. At the battle of Copenhagen he was in the Monarch, 74, which had 210 men killed and wounded, and was afterwards, until 1801, in Lord Nelson\u2019s ship the Elephant\u2014the 49th Regiment in these services acting as marines. Subsequently, in the American war of 1812-13-14, he was in the actions of Stoney Creek, Fort George, and several others, including the siege of Fort Erie. At the Beaver Dams, aided by a body of Indian warriors, with only forty-eight of the 49th Regiment, he captured a force of four hundred and fifty infantry, fifty cavalry, and two guns. In 1837, when endangered by the disaffected, through his foresight and precautionary measures, he saved the city of Toronto, and received an award for doing so of five thousand acres of land, which, although thrice passed in the Council, was eventually disallowed\u2014a present of a valuable sword, with the thanks of the Canadian Parliament\u2014thanks which were also tendered to this gallant and meritorious veteran officer for his efficient service as its chief clerk during an\ninterval of nineteen years in his military and naval service. In 1850, her Majesty the Queen, in grateful recognition of his services, created him a military knight of Windsor, since which time he has resided in England.\n\nWe extract from the London Review of July, 1860, an autobiographical letter, written by the gallant old hero and gentleman, as every Canadian justly considers him:\n\n\"THE HISTORY OF A LIFE.\n\n\"[We make no apology for inserting, just as we received it, the following interesting autobiographical sketch by \"An Old Soldier,\" whose name is well known to us. We commend his narrative to the careful perusal of the young and friendless, that they may learn how much a true and good man can do for himself if he will behave honestly\u2014and persevere.]\n\n\"On the morning of the 12th of July, 1860, at six o'clock, I rise from my bed to commit to paper, briefly and rapidly as I can, some of the thoughts which agitate my mind, I can truly say, with the deepest anxiety.\n\n\"I am in the eightieth year of my age, feeble in body, but with mind still active, and ever looking intently on passing events, whether religious, political, or social.\n\n\"Present appearances fill my mind with anxiety, and even alarm. Although living in retirement, and wholly unconnected with business or duties of any kind, I cannot refrain from daily and hourly reflecting on all I see passing around me. I sometimes reproach myself for letting my mind run thus on matters over which I cannot exercise the least control. But this morning, while yet in bed, it occurred to me that such a letter as I could write, might make a favorable impression on the minds of the Lords Derby, Palmerston, and Russell, and Mr. Bright, if I conveyed a copy to each, privately and anonymously.\n\n\"The speeches delivered everywhere, both in and out of Parliament, are, generally, too exciting and provocative; aggravating the passions of all excitable men on the great questions of religion, politics, and morals. With the humbler classes hope should be cultivated above all things. Encouragement should be the great lever to lift them upwards. It is a gigantic error, in any way or by any means, to degrade them. If they were encouraged and affectionately cared for by all those who exercise the chief control over them, they would almost every one of them, be not only duly obedient, but affectionately grateful. Of the truth of this I am entirely convinced, after seventy years incessant observation.\n\n\"Few, I fear, can readily imagine that I could at the age of ten begin to observe and consider such questions; yet so it was. Even at that age I had read much, and although the books were intended\nfor children only, I read them with untiring eagerness, and I soon became, as a reader, remarkable among the peasantry\u2014for I was the son of an humble farmer. At that age some one told me that the gentry and the clergy did not desire to have the people read much. I asked \"Why?\" \"Because it makes them disobedient children and rebellious subjects.\" Filled with intense indignation, I exclaimed, \"What! is it because I am the son of a poor man that I must be kept as ignorant as the cow that feeds in my father's field?\" Such were the precise words then uttered by me; and ever since I have closely watched this great question, and my opportunities have been countless, and my positions in life most favorable for such observations; for, at the age of seventeen, I enlisted as a private soldier, and was on the same day, the 25th of October, 1798, promoted to the rank of sergeant. At the age of twenty-one I was appointed sergeant-major, over the heads of forty older sergeants, after having seen many battles on shore, during the year 1799, in Holland, and one in the Monarch, before Copenhagen, on the 2nd of April, 1801. In 1803 I was appointed to act as adjutant, in the absence of the adjutant; and in February, 1806, I was promoted to an ensigncy, and in December to the adjutancy, the adjutant having resigned. In 1809, I succeeded to a lieutenancy, and in 1813, being in the field before an enemy, I obtained leave to resign the adjutancy, that I might be eligible to be employed in advance of the army, in command of a small detachment. An ensign and fifty men were placed under my command, with leave to employ them entirely at my own discretion. I advanced on the 12th of June, and on the 24th I achieved a service for which I was immediately promoted to a company in another regiment. In 1816, the war being ended, I was placed on half pay, in a distant colony.* I was immediately employed in the militia of that colony; was soon appointed a justice of the peace, and subsequently became chief clerk of the Commons House of Assembly, and served as such for thirteen years, and afterwards in the Upper House of Parliament for six years, when I retired on a pension, on which I now subsist. As chairman, I frequently presided in the court of quarter sessions, in which service, and as clerk of parliament for nineteen years, my experience of civil life was extensive. During the period of this civil service, I availed myself of a threatened danger to the public peace, which others in authority above me either would not, or could not foresee, and, in resistance to much opposition from them, I performed a service which, in all probability, saved this nation thousands of lives and millions of money; for it most likely prevented a war with a neighboring nation. For this last service the Provincial Parliament voted me thanks and a grant of money.\n\n*Canada.\n\"Why do I write so much of self? That I may show the extent and nature of my experience, and the variety and value of the opportunities I have had during a long and laborious life, of acquiring practical and real knowledge of the world; and to give some idea of the many schools, and the schooling which are daily becoming more and more accessible to every reflecting individual of the working-classes.\n\n\"Further details of my own schooling and experience would be most instructive, but I cannot write so much as to describe all; and even if I did, I fear few would read it. Yet I will state a few more facts.\n\n\"I was taken from a very humble school, at eleven years of age, to work on the farm with my father and eldest brother. When I enlisted I did not know the difference between a verb and a noun. But having read much, I could write pretty accurately. The first evidence I had of my own deficiency was obtained in this way. My colonel* when walking up and down the orderly room, set me to write from his dictation. On writing the last word of each sentence dictated by him, I pronounced that word, that he might proceed. The word 'ascertain' was one of those which I pronounced as if written 'ascertin,' when he turned round and said, \"'Ascertain,' young man!' I was startled, and felt ashamed; and on being at leisure, I went immediately to a bookseller's, and purchased a spelling-book, a dictionary, and a grammar\u2014the two latter of which I had not before ever seen. On looking over them, I was amazed at my own great ignorance, and from that hour I made every effort to educate myself; and with what success my subsequent career gives some evidence.\n\n\"One item of my experience in the improvement of the human mind was the chief foundation of my great success in teaching officers and soldiers, and the management of men generally. One morning, at early drill, everything went amiss with me. I became angry, scolded, and even used my cane, which was then allowed, and, in fact was too much used. At length I let the men stand at ease, and walked about in front, thinking what could be the cause of the want of my usual success; when, fortunately, it occurred to me that it must be owing to my own impatient and angry temper.\n\n\"At once I began to speak gently to the men, and promised to shorten the time of drill by half an hour, if they exerted themselves; after which all went well. Often, afterwards, have I pretended to be angry, and scolded the men, when, invariably, things went amiss. After some time, an idea occurred to me that I should treat the men as a lady would her piano\u2014that is, put them in tune (good humor) before I played upon them; and thus I soon\n\n*The lamented Major-General Sir Isaac Brock.\nascertained that I could readily lead nine men where I could not drive one.\n\n\"Would that every man and woman having power or authority over his or her brother or sister, be his station in life what it may, clerical or lay, in the school or in the field, in the nursery or in the kitchen, would treat all under them as if they were brothers and sisters.\n\n\"Until pride, passion, and prejudice be rooted out from the mind of man,\u2014or rather, and far better, those passions be prevented from entering it at all, by early training, even in early infancy, the improvement of mankind will continue to be slow, as it hitherto has been.\n\n\"The cheap press is now, however, exercising a mighty increase of influence, which calls aloud for the benevolent exertions of every lover of order and happiness, to guide it wisely. The efforts that many make to prevent or delay the increase of knowledge among the masses are producing, and will more and more produce, the most unhappy results. Let all rather wisely strive to guide the teaching of this press. Let the upper classes be not so much afraid of enlarging the minds of the masses. The doctrine of the depravity of mankind is a most pernicious one. I never found any man so incorrigible as not to be more or less improved by my kind treatment of him. I have tried many hundreds of experiments upon refractory and ill-behaved men, and I have never once entirely failed. But the kindness must not be feigned. If it be not sincere and earnest, the perspicacity of even the most simple will soon, more or less accurately, appreciate its real character. Let the upper classes, including all who exercise any control or authority over their fellow-men, act thus over those under their influence, and they may confidently reckon on success to a very great extent.\n\n\"Would to God that all parents, teachers, and persons having power, command, or authority over others, would treat those others with patient and untiring kindness and gentleness, and great would be their reward in the lively gratitude and affectionate obedience they would surely receive in return for such treatment.\n\n\"I emphatically declare that I have no doubt that the working-men have much more sound sense and good feeling than is generally ascribed to them. Let those qualities be seriously and benevolently cultivated, and the cultivators may as confidently reckon upon good results, as the cultivators of the soil may reckon for a good harvest after the application of good husbandry.\n\n\"I fear, however, that many who may read this paper will think its teaching quite Utopian; but if those who have the power will act as here suggested, I have neither fear nor doubt of very happy results.\n\n\"In the course of a long and most active and varied life, I have\nalways been saddened by religious controversies and animosities. In early youth I endeavoured to select for myself that kind of religion which would best satisfy my own convictions. I read the question put to the Saviour, 'What shall I do to be saved?' and the answer\u2014'Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your mind, and with all your strength, and your neighbor as yourself; upon these two hang all the Law and the Prophets.' 'Then,' I exclaimed, 'this shall be my religion,'\u2014and to this I have hitherto endeavored to adhere, and hope I shall ever hereafter adhere; but I know no so efficient mode of cultivating love to God as by the honest cultivation of love to my neighbor. Without this honest cultivation I know not how I could have happiness here, or hope for any hereafter.\u2014AN OLD SOLDIER.\"\n\nGENERAL VINCENT.\n\nThis brave and experienced officer, one of the most skilful employed in Canada during the last American war, was born in the year 1765, and was descended from a good English family. He entered the army as ensign, in July, 1781; became lieutenant in August, 1782; captain in October, 1786; major, May, 1795; lieutenant-colonel, January, 1800; colonel, July, 1810; major-general, June, 1813; lieutenant-general, May, 1825; general, November, 1841; was appointed colonel of the 69th, January 2, 1836. He served in the West Indies, and was at the taking of St. Domingo; was in the expedition to the Helder, and subsequently in that to Copenhagen, under Sir Hyde Parker. He died at his residence in Pall Mall, London, on the 21st June, 1848.\nCOLONEL C. M. DE SALABERRY, C.B.\n\nThe family of De Salaberry is descended from a noble family of the Pays des Basques (Navarre). The father of the subject of this notice was a legislative councillor, and devotedly attached to his sovereign, so much so indeed, that he placed his four sons in the army. The one here noticed, rose to great distinction, as will be seen; one of the others was killed at Badajos, and the other two died in the East Indies, employed in active warfare.\n\nThe Honorable Charles Michel d'Trumberry de Salaberry, C.B., Seigneur de Chambly et de Beaulac, member of the Legislative Council, surnamed the Canadian L\u00e9onidas, was born at the Manor House of Beauport, November 19, 1778. He married Demoiselle Hertel de Rouville, and continued, as is before stated, to serve in the army, as well as his brothers. He served also, during the space of eleven years, in the West Indies, under General Prescott. At the siege of fort Matilda, under Prescott, and at the evacuation thereof, he commanded the grenadier company of the 4th battalion 60th Regiment, which covered the retreat with credit to themselves. In 1795, he served at the conquest of Martinique; became aid-de-camp to Major-General de Rottenburg and accompanied him in the Walcheren expedition. Circumstances recalled him to his country, where he, in a very short time, formed the Voltigeurs, the organization of which reflected great honor upon him; lieutenant-colonel commanding and superintendent of this fine corps, he was also selected as one of the chiefs of the staff of the militia. Attacked at Lacolle, at the end of 1812, together with M. D\u2019Eschambault\u2019s advance guard, by one thousand four hundred Americans of General Dearborn\u2019s army, he fought them until night; in attempting to surround him, they fired against each other, which soon terminated in their retreat; thus resulted the first victory of De Salaberry and the Voltigeurs. Part of this corps participated in the defeat, no less humiliating to the American army, at Chrysler\u2019s Farm. Dearborn and Wilkinson thus baffled in their project of invasion, there only remained General Hampton to contend with. De Salaberry, in proceeding to discover his whereabouts, obstructed the road from Odelltown to L\u2019Acadia, by cutting down a great many trees. After several skirmishes, the Americans, not daring to hazard a general action in the woods, retired to a place called Four Corners. His adversary made an incursion into his camp, at the head of two hundred Voltigeurs and 150 Indian warriors of the tribes of Lower Canada, and threw the enemy into disorder, without any loss on his own side. Hampton being repulsed on the Odel-\ntown route, resolved wisely to effect a junction with his chief general, in taking the route leading to Chateauguay, which he was approaching, believing the road to be open; but access thereto, was everywhere prevented by being blockaded by field works. De Salaberry was too sagacious not to discover that this strategic point was the road which Hampton would be sure to take in order to join Dearborn. The former, in the meantime, swept away the English pickets; and Major Henry, with difficulty, resisted them; when De Salaberry ably shifted his position, and threw himself on the route to face that general. The Canadian hero, who had the advantage of being acquainted with the whole of the country above Chateauguay, during an excursion on the American frontier some weeks before, then ascended to the left of the bank of the river Chateauguay, to reach the other extremity of a wood, where he knew there was an excellent position in a swamp, intercepted by deep rivulets. On four of these he established lines of defence in succession. The fourth was about half a mile in the rear, and commanded a ford on the right shore, which was a very important point of defence, with a view to the protection of the left bank. He caused to be erected on each of these lines a sort of breastwork, which was extended to some distance in the woods, to protect his right. The breastwork on his first line formed an obtuse angle on the right of the road. The whole of the day was taken up with fortifying this position, so as to force the enemy, in case he should feel disposed to make an attack to cross a large space of settled country, and removing himself to a great distance from his supplies; whereas, on the contrary, the Voltigeurs had everything at hand, and were well supplied; more especially, as on the second line after the Voltigeurs and Indians, came the Watteville regiment. Sir George Prevost was on the third line, at Caughnawaga, with some troops and militia, from the Montreal district, having brought them down with him from Kingston, to oppose the junction of the American army. De Salaberry did not confine himself to the foregoing arrangements. He ordered a party of thirty axemen of the division of Beauharnois to proceed in front of the first line of defence, for the purpose of destroying the bridges and obstructing the roads. All the bridges within a league and a half were destroyed; and a formidable obstruction was formed on the road to the extent of a mile in advance of the first line of defence, which extended to the edge of the river, and continued to a distance of three or four acres through the woods, joined by a swamp on the right, almost impassible. The four lines of defence were thus completely sheltered, even from the fire of artillery. To this fortified position so well selected, and to the heroism displayed, is mainly due the victory which succeeded. The talents and abilities of a commander are distinguished, no doubt, as well in the selection of a position, as in leading an army\ninto and out of the field of battle. Major-General de Watteville, who visited De Salaberry's camp, approved of all his arrangements. There was some skirmishing, which led to the retreat of the workmen and their escort to the camp, at about two leagues above the confluence of the waters, between a little river belonging to the British, and that of Chateauguay, supported on the left by the river Chateauguay, and, in front and on the right, by abattis, and a species of chevaux de frise. On the 24th October, having made a large opening on the road through the woods and swamps, within a distance of five miles of the Canadian encampment, in which De Salaberry was at the head of three hundred Voltigeurs, Fencibles and Indian warriors, who had just received reinforcements in a few companies of sedentary militia; the American general advanced at the head of seven thousand infantry and four hundred horse, with twelve pieces of artillery, sending during the night, Colonel Purdy to take possession of the ford, but this officer lost his way in the woods. The next day, Hampton made an advance in person towards the abattis, with three thousand five hundred men, and placed Purdy at the head of one thousand five hundred men, to attempt again to turn the Canadians, leaving in reserve the remainder of his troops. De Salaberry, warned of this movement, by the fire directed on his advanced pickets, now seeing before him an enemy, whom he had on two former occasions brought to the charge, advanced in front; and, giving the signal, placed himself in the centre of the first line of defence, leaving the second in charge of Lieutenant-Colonel McDonell, the same who had taken Ogdensburg. The firing commenced smartly on both sides, but badly directed by the Americans. They fired better afterwards; meanwhile, the circumstance of hearing incessantly the report from the corps at different intervals, led them to believe that the Canadians were advancing in great numbers, and their ardor began to weaken. Purdy's column arrived at the ford during the engagement, but was repulsed and thrown into disorder by De Salaberry, who had directed his attention to that particular spot. Seeing his plan disconcerted by the defeat of that division, the American commander ordered a retreat, which he effected with considerable loss. De Salaberry slept on the field of battle, and, on the following day, at daybreak, he was joined by Captain de Rouville, his brother-in-law, with his company of Voltigeurs, the Wattoville grenadiers, together with a few of the native warriors. On the 28th, he sent Captain Ducharme, the hero of Beaver Dam, together with one hundred and fifty warriors, to reconnoitre, and they assured him that the American army had abandoned their camp on Piper's road, and had returned to Plattsburg. Wilkinson, who was at Cornwall, hearing of the defeat of his colleague, retired to Salmon river, and fortified himself. The victory at Chateauguay permitted the Baron\nde Rottenburg, and afterwards Sir Gordon Drummond, his successor in command, to resume the offensive in Upper Canada. Great Britain commemorated the victory by causing a gold medal to be struck; the Voltigeurs were presented with colors, ornamented with devices; and De Salaberry, besides the gold medal, had the order of the Bath conferred upon him, transmitted with an autograph letter from his Royal Highness the Prince Regent. The two houses of the provincial legislature passed a vote of thanks to him. The Voltigeurs took part in the second victory, obtained at Lacoille, in March, 1814. De Salaberry laid down the sword for the pen. He became a senator; being called to the Legislative Council in 1818, at the same time as Monseigneur Plessis. He died at Chambly, on the 26th February, 1829, aged 51 years; and was buried in the new church of that place, which was erected in the room of the one destroyed by fire in 1806. The late commander, Viger, possessed his likeness, painted by Dickinson, and engraved by Durand. De Salaberry is represented attired in the uniform worn by the Voltigeurs, decorated with the Chateauguay medal, and the cross of the Bath, with his sword under his arm. His family crest is also seen. The escutcheon of our compatriot bears the motto becoming to the purfuit chevalier: \"Force \u00e0 superbe; mercy \u00e0 fiable.\" A medallion representing a battle in the woods. On the trunk of a tree, reversed is written: \"Chateauguay, 26th October, 1813.\" A serpent biting his tail, symbol of immortality, encircles the medal. With respect to the English medal of Chateauguay, Britannia is seen bearing a palm in hand, crowning a lion lying at her feet. On the reverse is engraved Chateauguay. De Salaberry would have become a great officer of light troops, and even against the armies of Bonaparte would certainly have attained the first rank.\n\nHis son is deputy adjutant-general of militia for Lower Canada.\n\nMAJOR-GENERAL BAYNES.\n\nThis veteran officer entered the army in May, 1783. After serving at Gibraltar and in the West Indies, he became aide-de-camp, in 1794, to the late Sir James Craig, and was at the taking of the Cape of Good Hope in 1795, and also at the capture of a Dutch force in Saldanha bay, in September of the following year. He subsequently served as aide-de-camp to Sir James, in the East\nIndies; but having obtained a majority in the 76th, he joined that corps at Cawnpore. In 1803 he returned to England. In 1804 he was appointed lieutenant-colonel of the 5th Foot, and in 1805 joined the expedition at Portsmouth, under Sir James Craig; who again desiring his services as his first aide-de-camp, he was placed on half pay, and was with Sir James at Gibraltar, Malta, Naples and Sicily, until May, 1806, when he returned to England. In August, 1807, he joined the Glengarry Fencibles, and was appointed adjutant-general to the forces in North America, which appointment he held during the whole of the American war of 1812, and many years afterwards. He died at Sidmouth, England, in March, 1829.\n\nCOLONEL NICHOL, M.P.P.\n\nA notice of this gallant officer, whose unfortunate death took place on the road between Stamford and Queenston, in the night of the 6th May, 1824, in a violent storm, when, missing his way as it is supposed, he drove over the cliff, and was precipitated to the shore of the river, where his body was found almost literally dashed to pieces, may not be inappropriate. The colonel distinguished himself during the last war with the United States; his gallantry was on all occasions conspicuous, and his intelligence and local information rendered his services highly valuable to the general officers under whose command he served, and by whom, as well as by the army he was universally esteemed; he was honored with a gold medal for his conduct, at the capture of Detroit, when under the command of the late Sir Isaac Brock, whose penetration early discovered, and duly appreciated his genius and intrepidity, which procured for him, at the close of the war, a well earned pension, equal to a lieutenant-colonel's half pay. In the House of Assembly his talents were not less remarkable, and though frequently in opposition to the measures of government, he never forfeited the esteem and respect of his Majesty's representative. He was indeed a man of rare endowments, and, in private life, as amiable as his public character was brilliant.\nCAPTAIN F. ROLETTE.\n\nAn officer who greatly distinguished himself on the lakes during the war of 1812-13, and received as a testimonial of his eminent services a splendid sword, which was voted to him by the legislature of Lower Canada.\n\nCOLONEL SCOTT, 103RD REGT.\n\nColonel Hercules Scott, of Brotherton, Scotland, was one of the heroes of 1812, and was killed on the 15th of August, in the same year, by receiving a musket ball in his breast, after leading the 103rd Regiment in the most gallant manner to the attack of Fort Erie, (having carried the out-works by assault, and the fort by escalade.) In him the service lost a most valuable, active, and zealous officer. He had the good fortune to acquire the respect and esteem of the militia, and of the inhabitants generally of both provinces, having been of the utmost service in bringing them forward, placing the greatest confidence in them, and instructing them how to be useful in the defence of their country against its invaders. His remains were interred the same evening in the presence of the survivors of his regiment, attended by the only three officers who came out of the fort unhurt, the regiment having retreated after the fall of their leader, in consequence of the Americans having blown up a platform, by which two hundred brave fellows were killed or wounded.\n\nCAPTAIN BULGER.\n\nCaptain Bulger was a native of Newfoundland, and came to this province with his regiment at the breaking out of the American war. He received his appointment in the Royal Newfound\nland regiment of foot as ensign, on the 26th October, 1804,\u2014promoted to the rank of lieutenant, 30th July, 1806, to that of captain, 23rd February, 1815. Captain Bulger served seven or eight years with his regiment in the North American provinces, previous to the American war in 1812, when he embarked for Canada. At that period the British forces amounted to only a thousand men, with a frontier of almost as many miles to guard. He was present with a detachment of his regiment at the first shot against the enemy. He was afterwards detached to the western frontier of Canada when invaded by the enemy, at which time the British troops did not exceed 300 of the 41st and Royal Newfoundland regiments, with about 600 of the Upper Canadian militia, and 500 Indians under their celebrated chief, Tecumseh. He was present at the final defeat and surrender of the invading force, as well as the capture of the enemy's fort, with 33 pieces of cannon, at Detroit, on the 16th August, 1812, for which action he received the silver war medal. Upon the dispersion of the enemy's force in the west, a portion of the British troops were transferred to the vicinity of Lake Ontario; he proceeded thither also, and during the remainder of the fall of 1812 he was constantly employed in command of detachments, and at times in armed vessels acting against the enemy. He was present at an engagement under Brigadier-General Vincent at Fort George, on the Niagar afrontier, in December, 1812, where the enemy were completely routed; their numbers being 10,000 men, while that of the British force did not amount to one-third.\n\nHe served under Sir James L. Yeo, the naval commander on the lakes, for a considerable time, and was the senior military officer appointed to the squadron. He was present with Captain Mulcaster, R.N., when that officer went in pursuit of the enemy, then descending the St. Lawrence to attack Montreal. He was present with him when he overtook and routed them. He was present and took part at the battle of Chrysler's Farm, when the enemy were defeated by 800 men, under Lieutenant-Colonel Morrison, aided and supported by Captain Mulcaster, with the flotilla of gun-boats. For this engagement he (Captain Bulger) received a clasp. He was chosen one of the officers destined for the relief of Michilimackinac in 1814; was present and took an able part in the capture of the enemy's schooners, which blockaded that island. He commanded the military portion, and Lieutenant Worsley, R.N., the naval portion of the squadron, which attacked and gallantly captured, by boarding, the two armed schooners Tyrian and Scorpion, on the 3rd and 6th September, 1814. In this action he was severely wounded, and for this exploit he received the naval war medal and clasp. Immediately after the dispersion of the enemy at Michilimackinac, he proceeded to Fort McKay on the Mississippi, nearly 500 miles distant, in an open boat, suffering from an\nunhealed breast-wound, which place the enemy were making great efforts to retake, but were prevented by his active and judicious management. His exertions in the management of the Indians amidst privations and hardships, and in allaying their discontents; in organizing them to encounter the enemy, and in removing from their minds at the peace, prejudices which might have proved detrimental to the British interest in a future war, fully indicate that he had been a very zealous officer, and skilled in the discharge of his duties. In 1822, he held the commission of governor of Red River, and during his administration the settlement progressed considerably. For upwards of thirty years he held the appointment of chief examiner of accounts in the office of the commander of the forces in this command. He was a faithful and conscientious friend in every station in life. His decease took place at Montreal, in March, 1858.\n\nGENERAL SIR G. DRUMMOND, G.C.B.\n\nThe subject of the following brief biographical notice, was the youngest child of Colin Drummond, Esquire, of Megginch, who at the time of his son's birth at Quebec, in the year 1771, held the appointment of paymaster-general to the forces, in the province of Lower Canada. This meritorious servant of the crown, a descendant of the ancient family of Drummonds, of Conraig in Perthshire, had a numerous offspring, several of whom died in their infancy. John, his eldest son, who inherited Megginch castle, from his uncle, Adam Drummond, married Lady Susan Fane, daughter of John, tenth earl of Westmoreland. His son Adam, a vice-admiral and knight commander of the Hanoverian Order of Guelph, married Lady Charlotte Menzies, eldest daughter of John, fourth duke of Athol, and relict of Sir John Menzies, of Castle Menzies in Perthshire. His eldest daughter, Elizabeth, became the wife of John, Lord Hervey, eldest son of the Right Honorable and Right Reverend Frederick Augustus, fourth earl of Bristol, and bishop of Derry. Lord Harvey died at Florence, in 1796.\n\nThe youngest born of Mr. Drummond's family, Gordon, entered the army as an ensign, in the first (royal) regiment of foot, on the 21st September, 1789; and, after serving for some time on the staff of the Earl of Westmoreland, who was at that period lord-lieutenant of Ireland, he rose rapidly to the rank of lieutenant-colonel in\n1794, and the same year was appointed to the command of the eighth (king's) regiment. In the command of this gallant corps, he served in Holland, under His Royal Highness, the Duke of York, where on all occasions he became distinguished, not only for cool determination, but for judgment also. At the siege of Mineguen especially, and more particularly at the sortie on the 27th October, 1795, his conduct was most conspicuous.\n\nIn the year 1800, after returning to England, along with the troops from the Netherlands, Lieutenant-Colonel Drummond proceeded in the command of his regiment to Minorca, in which island he was stationed until the autumn of 1800, when he accompanied the expedition to Egypt, under Lieutenant-General Sir Ralph Abercrombie, when he was present at the landing of the army on the 8th March, 1801, as well as at the subsequent engagements of the 13th, the 21st, (when Sir Ralph fell mortally wounded) and at the battle of Rhamania, and finally at the surrender of Grand Cairo and Alexandria to the British army.\n\nThe ever memorable campaign in Egypt being gloriously terminated, in the events of which Colonel Drummond continued to sustain his high character as an officer, the 8th Regiment received orders to proceed to Gibraltar, and here commenced a friendship between his Royal Highness' the late Duke of Kent and Colonel Drummond, which continued to the latest period of the duke's life. In the year 1805, the government contemplated sending out an expedition against some of the West India Islands, which still remained in possession of France, and Lieutenant-General Sir Eyre Coote was selected to take the command of this force. Major-General Gordon Drummond being appointed second in command of the expedition, the troops composing which assembled at Cork, the original plan of operations, however, being abandoned, the various regiments were dispersed to different destinations, and Sir Eyre Coote proceeded to Jamaica, as governor and commander of the forces, Major-General Drummond being still appointed his second in command, as a general officer on the staff. He remained in that island until 1808, when he again returned to England, where, shortly afterwards, he married Margaret, second daughter of William Russell, Esq., of Brancipith Castle, in the County of Durham, and not long after he was appointed to the staff in Canada, where he served until 1811, in which year he once more revisited England, but did not remain long unemployed, as in the early part of 1812, he was selected to command the south-east district in Ireland, where his unremitting zeal and activity were found eminently useful in that disturbed country.\n\nIn August 1813, still retaining his post on the staff in Ireland, (having attained the rank of lieutenant-general in 1811), he received a communication from his Royal Highness the Duke of York, to acquaint him that the government were desirous he should proceed to\nCanada, as second in command to Lieutenant-General Sir George Prevost, he accordingly, on the 1st of September, 1813, embarked, with his staff on board his Majesty's ship Ethalion, Captain Heywood, for Quebec, where he landed on the 3rd of November following. Without delay he proceeded to take command of the troops in Upper Canada; and the winter campaign of 1813-14 was characterized by his wonted promptitude and activity. On the 19th December, he ordered over a force to attack Fort Niagara, opposite Fort George. This strong fortress was situated at the mouth of the river Niagara, as it flows into Lake Ontario; and its possession was deemed of much importance by Lieutenant-General Drummond. The place was stormed, and fell into the hands of the British troops, along with an immense accumulation of stores, both naval and military, which had been laid up there for security by the enemy.\n\nThe next operation undertaken by Lieutenant-General Drummond was attended with an equally successful result. He entrusted a body of troops to the command of Major-General Reall, who crossed over the river Niagara, two miles lower down than Fort Erie, during the night of the 30th December, with a force scarcely exceeding one thousand men, and accompanied by five hundred Indian warriors. At daybreak on the 31st, the town of Black Rock was stormed, the garrison put to flight, and the position of the village of Buffalo subsequently carried.\n\nIn the early part of the month of May 1814, a combined operation was executed by a military force under the immediate command of Lieutenant-General Drummond, and the squadron, commanded by Commodore Sir James Yeo, on lake Ontario, the object of which was to destroy the works, barracks, &c., at Oswego, as well as to cripple the naval operations by capturing or destroying a large magazine of ship stores belonging to the American flotilla on the lake. The success of this judiciously planned expedition was complete, the American troops being routed, the town, batteries, and stores captured, and the damage to the enemy most extensive.\n\nThe next occasion on which Lieutenant-General Drummond's active mind was engaged, took place in the summer of 1814, when towards the latter end of July he crossed over from Kingston, where his head quarters had been for two months established, to the Niagara frontier. On the morning of his landing at Fort George, he advanced towards the Falls of Niagara, where, at a position about a mile from the cataract called \"Lundy's Lane,\" he encountered the American forces commanded by General Brown, and greatly superior in number to the British. The action commenced at six o'clock in the evening of the 25th, and was maintained with great obstinacy throughout the entire night, until daybreak, when it was discovered that the enemy had decamped, and taken up a position behind the river Chippawa, leaving on the field their dead, and a considerable number of their wounded. During the\naction about midnight, General Drummond received a severe wound from a bullet which passed quite through his neck, and lodged at the opposite side; he did not, however, dismount from his horse, which, about twenty minutes afterwards, was killed under him. The American generals, Brown and Scott,* were both severely wounded. The severely fought action of Lundy's Lane was, perhaps, the best contested, as it was the most sanguinary conflict which took place during the war with the United States.\n\nOn the 13th of August following, Lieutenant-General Drummond, still suffering severely from the wound received at Lundy's Lane, moved the troops towards Fort Erie, strongly situated on the left bank of the Niagara. This important post had been somewhat discreditably surrendered to the enemy two months previously, and he was resolved to recapture it if possible. Accordingly an assault was made on the entire position, with the usual impetuosity of British soldiers; the works were carried, and the guns of the fort actually turned upon the enemy, when a magazine of powder caught fire, and an awful explosion took place which destroyed nearly four hundred men of the assaulting columns, in possession, as they were, of the works and cannon. The enemy rallied, and availing themselves of the panic into which our remaining soldiers were thrown, retook all the defences, with much loss certainly to themselves, but with a great sacrifice of life to the British troops. As may well be imagined, General Drummond was greatly distressed at this unexpected failure of his well organized plans of operation; he withdrew the army from before Fort Erie, and distributed the various regiments in cantonments for the remainder of the autumn, when, towards the latter end of the year, Lieutenant-General Sir George Prevost received instructions from home to return to England; and Lieutenant-General Drummond was ordered down to Quebec, to succeed him as commander of the forces, and also as administrator-in-chief of the government of the Canadas. In the execution of these important trusts he continued to exercise the same judgment and ability which had characterized his conduct throughout life; his unremitting zeal and integrity of purpose were displayed to the solid advantage of the colony until the spring of 1816, when, at his own request, and with great reluctance on the part of the home government, he was relieved from his onerous duties by the temporary appointment of Major-General Wilson, and subsequently, more permanently by Lieutenant-General Sir John Sherbrooke, to succeed him. The regret at his departure evinced by all classes of the community in Canada was universally expressed in the numerous addresses presented to him on his embarkation; and he landed at Portsmouth in June, 1816, after an absence from his relatives and friends of nearly three years.\n\n*The late commander-in-chief of the United States Army.\nIt may be here stated that on the occasion of the extension of the order of the Bath in 1815, Lieutenant-General Drummond was gazetted as a knight commander of that most honorable order and in 1817, his services were further graciously recognized by his Royal Highness the Prince Regent conferring upon him the grand cross of that order.\n\nThe public life of this truly estimable man may be said to have closed with his resignation of the government of Canada. During the remainder of his long career, he resided in the enjoyment of domestic happiness, among his family and friends. He was blessed with an amiable wife, two sons, and a daughter, the present Countess of Effingham. His sons, alas! are both dead, as is also Lady Drummond. His younger son, Russell, was unfortunately killed, while a lieutenant on board her Majesty's ship *Satellite*, serving in the Pacific Ocean, during an insurrection at Callao, in the year 1835. Sir Gordon's elder son, Gordon, a colonel in the Coldstream Regiment of Foot Guards, died in November, 1856, his health having been seriously impaired by the fatigues entailed upon him in the execution of his duties while serving in the Crimea, where during a part of the campaign, including the final assault of Sebastopol, he commanded the brigade of Guards.\n\nSir Gordon Drummond's death took place in London, where he had resided during the latter years of his life, on the 10th of October, 1854, in the eighty-fourth year of his age.\n\nThe various dates of Sir Gordon Drummond's commissions in the army, were as follows:\u2014Ensign, 21st September, 1789; lieutenant, 31st March, 1791; captain, 31st January, 1792; major, 28th February, 1794; lieutenant-colonel, 1st March, 1794; colonel, 1st January, 1798; major-general, 1st January, 1805; lieutenant-general, 4th June, 1811; general, 27th May, 1825.\n\n---\n\n**COLONEL MORRISON, C.B., 44TH REGT.**\n\nAmong the many British officers, who distinguished themselves in the war of 1812, in Canada, the name of Colonel Joseph Wanton Morrison, of the 89th Regiment, stands pre-eminent and next to that of the gallant and immortal Brock, for the glory of his achievement at Chrysler's Farm, on the 11th of November, 1813. We do not believe military history records a greater victory over such unequal odds as that which Colonel Morrison gained over the forces of General Boyd, U. S. A., on that occasion; and we have\ngreat pleasure in presenting our readers with the story of his erratic and memorable career. Colonel Morrison was born at New York, May 4, 1783, and was the only son of John Morrison, Esq., at that time deputy-commissary-general in America. He entered the army in 1793, as an ensign in the 83rd Regiment, and was promoted to a lieutenancy in the 84th Regiment in 1794. He did not join either of the above corps, being removed to an independent company, and placed on half-pay. In 1799 he was appointed to the 17th Regiment, and served with the second battalion during the campaign in Holland of that year, and was severely wounded at the close of the action of the 2nd October. In 1800 he obtained a company in the same regiment, with which he served in the Mediterranean till the peace of 1802, when having purchased a majority, he was placed on half-pay. In 1804 he was appointed an inspecting field officer of Yeomanry on the staff in Ireland; and in 1805 exchanged to the 89th Regiment, and served with the second battalion till 1809, when he was promoted to a lieutenant-colonelcy in the 1st West India Regiment, which he immediately joined at Trinidad. In 1811 he was removed to his former regiment, the 89th, and the following year embarked with the second battalion for Halifax. In the spring of 1813 the battalion proceeded to Upper Canada; and in November of that year Colonel Morrison was entrusted with the command of a corps of observation to follow the movements of the American army under Major-General Wilkinson, descending the river St. Lawrence, and which having landed on the Canadian territory, below Fort Wellington, a division of that force under Brigadier-General Boyd, amounting to between three and four thousand men, was on the 11th, defeated by the corps of observation* at Chrysler's Farm, Williamburgh; and after the action the Americans retired to their own shores. The details of this most gallant affair are given in the Royal Military Calendar, vol. iv, pp. 273. et seq. On this occasion Colonel Morrison was honored with a medal. He likewise received a vote of thanks from the House of Assembly of Lower Canada, and was presented with a sword by the merchants of Liverpool.\n\nIn July, 1814, during the engagement at Lundy's Lane, near the Falls of Niagara, he was so severely wounded, that in 1815 he returned with his battalion to England; and being unable, from the state of his wounds in 1816, to join the first battalion of the regiment, then in India, he was once more placed on half-pay. On the 12th August, 1819, he received the brevet of colonel.\n\nIt was not until the beginning of the year 1821 that his wounds\n\n---\n\n* This corps consisted, according to the official dispatch of Sir George Prevost, of the remains of the 49th Regiment, the second battalion of the 89th, and three companies of Voltigeurs (comprising in the whole not more than eight hundred rank and file), with a division of gun-boats.\nwere sufficiently healed to permit his return to the duties of active service, when he was immediately appointed lieutenant-colonel of the 44th Regiment, at that time quartered in Ireland. In June 1822, he embarked with his regiment for India, and arrived at Calcutta in November following. In July, 1823, the regiment was sent up the country to Dinapore, from whence it returned to Calcutta in 1824; and in July of that year Colonel Morrison was appointed to the command of the south-eastern division of the army, with the local rank of brigadier-general. To an ardent and devoted attachment to his profession, were united great military talent and prudence, cool determined courage, anxious attention to the troops under his command, and firm religious principle, the best stimulus to the discharge of the duties of the soldier, the sure consolation in times of difficulty, peril, and sickness. Thus he was eminently qualified for the arduous and important trust which had been confided to him; and the following order, which he issued to the troops previous to the commencement of the campaign against the Burmese, will afford the best exemplification of the feelings and temper with which he conducted the army through a country beset with natural obstacles and dangers, harrassed by a cruel and relentless foe:\u2014\n\n\"The brigadier-general, in promulgating the first arrangements for offensive operations, takes the opportunity to express his unbounded confidence, that every honorable achievement which zeal, discipline, and valor can effect, will be accomplished; and he humbly hopes that the Giver of all Victory will bless the united efforts of the division, to the glory of the British name, and the character of the Indian army. He at the same time begs the troops, when flushed with success, to remember that a vanquished foe ceases to be an enemy, and that mercy shewn, though in some instances it may be abused (particularly by a half-barbarous people), yet can never fail of the best reward; while the example set must be productive of ultimate good.\"\n\nThe difficulties which the army had to encounter on its march towards Arracan commenced soon after quitting Chittagong, and were of a nature only to be surmounted by the consummate skill of the commander, the steadiness, bravery, and patience of the troops under hardships and privations. On one occasion, when the officers were directed to disencumber themselves of all unnecessary baggage, and to leave their horses behind them, a young subaltern wrote to his friends\u2014\"You may imagine how severe this order appeared to be in a country like this, where, in addition to the oppressive heat of the climate, we have to scramble our way over trackless rocks, and through thick and almost impenetrable jungles; but when the general condescended to explain to us his reasons, and the necessity of the measure, we were all so delighted with him that not a murmur was heard, and there is not amongst us one\nAND PERSONS CONNECTED WITH CANADA.\n\nwho would not go with him to the world's end.\" This anecdote will shew the estimation in which this amiable man was held by those serving under him.\n\nIt would extend this notice too great length to enter into the details of the operations of this division of the army; they are recorded in the official despatches published in the London Gazette. Suffice to notice, that the country through which it passed was sometimes mountainous and rocky, only to be penetrated by passages formed by great labor and perseverance, at an advance of a few short miles per day; at others, through deep swamps, amidst noxious and pestilential exhalations. At length, after having undergone severe and almost incessant fatigue for several months, an opportunity occurred to bring the Burmese to action, and after three days continued fighting, the British army entered victorious into Arracan. No sooner, however, was this conquest achieved, than the rainy season set in; and it was necessary to make immediate provision for the cantonment of the troops. This was no easy task; for the city being situate in a marsh, surrounded on three sides with stupendous hills, was of all others a most unhealthy spot for Europeans. Thus, in a short time, General Morrison had the distress to see his gallant followers drooping with malignant sickness, and the arm of death spreading desolation around him; his own health, too, injured by continual anxiety and exertion. Nevertheless, in the midst of this heart-rending scene, not inaptly termed \"The Walcheren of India,\" it was his constant practice to visit the hospitals, to cheer the languishing sufferer, and to administer religious consolation to those whose hope of continuance in this world was gone. Thus did he at the same moment shew himself the victorious general, the kind commander, and the Christian friend; but neither his anxious care, or the best medical skill, could stay the pestilence, and Arracan was destined to be the grave of a large portion of the flower of the British army. After long contending against the influence of the climate, General Morrison found his constitution so much impaired, that he was compelled to resign his command, and return to Calcutta, where he soon after embarked for England, in the hope that the sea voyage might contribute to the restoration of his health. This hope, alas! was ordained soon to be destroyed; but his faith in the consolations of religion never forsook him; and in humble confidence in the mediation and atonement of his Saviour, he peacefully resigned his soul unto Him who gave it, soothed by the affectionate and endearing attention of a wife and a sister, to whom he had ever been most tenderly and inviolably attached. He died at sea, on board the Cara Brea Castle, on the 15th February, 1820.\n\nSuch is a sketch of the character and actions of this brave soldier, this most amiable man. Should it be perused by those who follow his profession, it may serve to prove to them that religion and vir-\ntue are not incompatible with the duties of the warrior, and that\nthe laurel-wreath of victory best adorns the brow of him who,\nwhilst fighting the battles of his country, reposes his trust and his\nreliance in the God of Armies.\n\nWe cannot better conclude this memoir than in the words of the\nRight Honorable the Governor-General Lord Amherst, who in ad-\ndressing Colonel Morrison previous to his departure from India, was\npleased thus to express himself: \"It is a melancholy satisfaction\nto me to assure you, that I know not whether most to approve of\nand admire the successful operations by which you wrested Arracan\nfrom the possession of the enemy, or the fortitude with which you\nsupported the destruction of our future hopes, by a dispensation\nbeyond our control.\"\n\nColonel Morrison was married on the 25th April 1809, to Eliza-\nbeth Hester, daughter of the late Randolph Marriott, Esq., of the\nCollege Green, Worcester, by whom he left no issue.\n\n---\n\nCAPTAIN R. H. BARCLAY, R.N.\n\nThe name of this naval hero, must not be allowed to pass\nunnoticed in this work, though there is no fear of its passing into\noblivion, while the history of America records the gallantry of his\nexploits, during the war of 1812.\n\nIt is exceedingly strange that so important a name as Barclay's\nis not to be found mentioned in any of the naval dictionaries,\nprevious to his death, while the services of innumerable minor and\nnot so celebrated men are published to the world. Of Barclay we\nhardly know anything, except that he had served with Nelson,\nand lost an arm, we believe at Trafalgar, and was a Scotchman by\nbirth, and assumed the command of the British naval forces on\nlake Erie, in May, 1813. He fitted out the naval armament, which\nhe afterwards commanded, and displayed great energy and activity\nagainst the enemy, (commanded by Perry.)\n\nMcMullen, speaking of this portion of the war of 1812, says:\u2014\n\n\"His greatest difficulty, however, was to man his fleet, as\nCommodore Yeo could only spare him fifty seamen. The rest of\nhis crews had to be made up of two hundred and fifteen soldiers,\nof Proctor's army, and eighty Canadians; while, on the other\nhand, an idle commercial marine, enabled the enemy to man their\nfleet with picked seamen, to the number of nearly six hundred.\nThe Americans, too, although their guns were fewer, had greatly\nthe advantage in weight of metal, besides having two vessels more than the British. But in sailors their great superiority rested. For these, the wretched mixture of six landsmen to one seaman on board of Barclay's fleet, even were they equal in point of numbers, would be no match whatever.*\n\n\"Proctor, at this period, found himself seriously embarrassed for want of food, and other supplies; and it was evident, that if the enemy obtained command of the lake, not only Michigan, but Western Canada must be abandoned. Barclay, under these circumstances, determined to do his best to succor the army; and, with his feeble force blockaded Perry in Erie harbor, which he could do in safety, as the sand-bar in front must compel the enemy to take his guns out to cross it. Towards the end of August, however, he was obliged to proceed to Long Point for supplies, and the American commodore at once seized this opportunity to put to sea. The British commander was now blockaded in turn in Amherstburg, and endeavored to improve his leisure to advantage, by training the soldiers to work the guns, and the Canadians to handle the ropes. But his provisions soon failed; he must either fight or starve; no other alternative presented itself. He accordingly put to sea on the 10th September, and soon met the enemy, when a most obstinate battle ensued. For a while, the British had the advantage, and Perry's own ship, the Lawrence, was compelled to haul down its colors, amid the cheers of the British squadron. But Barclay had not even a boat to take possession of his prize, so defective was his equipment. The firing now ceased for a few minutes, but a breeze springing up behind the American fleet, Perry, who had meanwhile shifted his flag to another vessel, skilfully gained the weather-gauge of the principal British ships, while they, from the unskilfulness of their crews, were unable to extricate themselves from their dangerous condition. The result was, that after a desperate engagement of three hours, during which the carnage was fearful, the entire British fleet was taken. Still, it did not surrender, till the vessels had become wholly unmanageable, nor till all the officers were killed or wounded, and a third of their crews had shared the same melancholy fate.\u2020 The American loss, was twenty-seven killed, and ninety-six wounded.\"\u2021\n\nWe do not know whether Barclay served in Canada after this; certain it was, however, that he was tried by court-martial for his loss, and honorably acquitted.\n\nThis gallant officer died at Edinburgh, on the 8th of May 1837.\n\n*Comparative strength of the fleets:\u2014\n\n|                | Americans | British |\n|----------------|-----------|---------|\n| Weight of metal, lbs. | 928       | 459     |\n| Compliment of men    | 580       | 346     |\n\n\u2020Alison's History of Europe, New York, Vol. 4, p. 467.

He served in Spain and Portugal; was present at the battles of Corunna and Fuentes d'Onor, the sieges of Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajos, and at the battle of Salamanca; for which services he had the honor of wearing a cross and one clasp.\n\nIn 1814, he served in Canada, when he commanded at St. John's at the posts in advance on the Richelieu river; and Sir George Prevost, in his general orders, expressed \"his most entire approbation of the judgment, zeal, and assiduity displayed by Lieutenant-Colonel Williams in his arrangement for the defense of the important posts placed under his immediate command.\"\n\nSir William Williams had license to accept the Order of the Tower and Sword, conferred on him for his services in the Peninsula, March 11, 1813; he was appointed a knight commander of the Bath, on the enlargement of the order, January 5, 1815, and was invested 6th August, 1830. He attained the rank of colonel in 1819, and of major-general in 1830. He died at Bath, on 17th June, 1832.\n\nGENERAL SIR PHINEAS RIALL, K.C.H.\n\nSir P. Riall entered the army as an ensign in the 92nd Regiment in January, 1794, became lieutenant in March, captain in May, and major of the 28th Foot in December of the same year. In 1797 he was reduced, and he remained on half-pay for seven years. In April, 1804, he was appointed major in the 15th Foot; and on the 1st January 1806, lieutenant-colonel by brevet. He commanded a brigade in the expedition against Martinique, and in that against the Saintes in 1809, and in the attack and capture of Guadaloupe in January and February, 1810. For these services he received a medal and clasp.\nOn the 25th July, 1810, he attained the rank of colonel; and on the 27th December following was appointed to a lieutenant-colonelcy in the 69th Foot. On the 4th June, 1813, he became major-general, and was thereupon placed on the staff in Great Britain. In September following he was ordered to Canada, to take part in the great struggle between England and America; and here his services, particularly on the Niagara frontier, and at the battle of Chippawa, were no doubt great, although he made many blunders. On the 18th February, 1816, he was appointed governor of the Island of Grenada and its dependencies, where he remained for some years.\n\nHe was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general in 1825. In 1831 he was nominated a knight commander of the Hanoverian Guelphic order, and in 1833 he was knighted at home. In 1835 he was appointed to the command of the 75th Regiment, from which he was removed to the 15th, in 1846. He attained the full rank of general in 1841, and died at Paris on the 10th of November, 1851.\n\nLIEUT.-COLONEL BRUY\u00c8RES, R.E.\n\nRALPH HENRY BRUY\u00c8RES, ESQUIRE, lieutenant-colonel of royal engineers, born 1765. Died at Quebec 1814. This meritorious officer fell a victim to professional zeal. He had returned from Upper Canada, in 1813, with the remains of a disease acquired there; and before his entire recovery, on learning the capture of Fort Niagara, he immediately set out from Quebec, notwithstanding the inclemency of the season, to examine the condition, and if necessary to improve the works of that place. He accomplished the object of his journey; but the disease returned rapidly upon him, and terminated his life. However much such zeal must command our admiration, it was in this case, by such a consequence, accompanied with the deepest regret. Colonel Bruy\u00e8res had attained great eminence in his profession. He had served honorably in Flanders and Holland; and had been materially engaged in completing the fortifications at Dover. He had projected, and directed the execution of almost all the fixed defences in both of these provinces; and his remains are immediately surrounded by many lasting monuments of his skill and indefatigable labors. To his merits as a soldier, a long residence in Canada enabled him to add the title of a good citizen. He died universally regretted; and left as a consolation to an afflicted\nfamily, the recollection of a life marked throughout by fidelity in every trust; by the exercise of all the private virtues; and in a concluding scene of extraordinary suffering, by an example of fortitude rarely witnessed.\n\nHe was interred with the military honors due to his rank.\n\n---\n\nMAJOR-GENERAL R. McDOUALL, C.B.,\n\nAnother hero of the last American war. This gallant officer entered the army 31st August, 1796; became lieutenant, 1st November, 1797; captain, 24th October, 1804; major, 24th June, 1813; lieutenant-colonel, 29th July, 1813; colonel, 22nd July, 1830; and major-general, 23rd November, 1841. When in command of Fort Michilimackinac, he successfully defended it when attacked by a very superior force, August 4, 1814, which he drove off with considerable loss. He died at Stranraer, on the 15th November, 1848.\n\n---\n\nCAPTAIN STEPHEN POPHAM, R.N.\n\nCaptain Popham, one of the British naval heroes of 1812, was brother to the late Brigadier-General George Munro Popham, C.B., of the Indian army, and was born in 1789.\n\nHe entered the navy as midshipman on board the Formidable of 98 guns, March 12, 1795. He subsequently served in the Trusty, 50, Oiseau frigate, Victorious, 74, and Sceptre, 64; from which last ship he was providentially absent, either on duty or leave, when she was wrecked in Table Bay, November 5, 1799.\n\nOn the 5th of April, 1801, Mr. Popham, then belonging to the Zealous, 74, was upset in a boat off North Yarmouth, and not picked up until he had been nearly two hours in the water. Being then placed too near a large fire, his right leg was so dreadfully scorched that he could not leave his bed for upwards of six months. He obtained the rank of lieutenant October 7, 1801.\nWe next find Mr. Popham in the Glory, 98, successively bearing the flags of Sir John Orde and Rear-Admiral Charles Stirling; from which ship he was removed to the Orion, 74, commanded by Captain Archibald Dickson, which formed part of the fleet under Admiral Gambier, in the expedition against Copenhagen, whence Lieutenant Popham brought home the Rota, a Danish frigate of the largest class. During the summer of 1808 he was frequently employed in the Orion's boats, protecting convoys through the Sound, and engaged with the enemy's flotilla. In 1809 he accompanied Sir Richard J. Strachan to Walcheren, and there acted as aide-de-camp to the naval commander-in-chief.\n\nIn November 1810, La Jeune Louise, a very fine French privateer schooner, of 14 guns and thirty-five men, was most gallantly attacked and carried in the Vlia Stroom, by a party of volunteers, in three boats from the Quebec, under the command of the first lieutenant, Stephen Popham, seconded by Lieutenant R. A. Yates.\n\nLieutenant Popham was made commander, 1st August, 1811; and was sent out to Canada during the war, where he rendered great service, on the 6th May, 1814; when in the Montreal, of 21 guns, formerly the Royal George, 28, he assisted at the capture of Oswego, situated on the St Lawrence, near its confluence with Lake Ontario.\n\nOn that occasion, he anchored his ship in the most gallant style, sustaining the whole fire of the American fort, until the storming party gained the shore. In this battle, the Montreal was set on fire three times by red-hot shot; nor could it be wholly extinguished for nearly three hours after the cannonading had ceased; her masts, sails and rigging, were much cut, and Captain Popham was severely wounded in his right hand. He was in consequence promoted to post rank, by commission dated September 29, 1814.\n\nHe died at Rhudlan, St. Asaph, England, February 25, 1842.\n\nSIR JOHN HARVEY, K.C.B., K.C.H.\n\nThe greater part of the following brief outline of the military services of the distinguished officer, whose name stands at the head of this notice, was originally compiled with the view of being embodied in a memoir of the war, with the United States, in 1812,\nand the subsequent years, in which Lieutenant-General (then Lieutenant-Colonel) Harvey bore a conspicuous share. His services were principally with the division of the army on the Niagara, when, as deputy adjutant-general, he was at the head of the department in Upper Canada, and filled that post\u2014one of the highest importance and confidence\u2014on the staff of the several general officers, who, after the death of the gallant and lamented Brock, passed in rapid succession through the command of that division of the army in the British North American provinces. The original plan for the defence of Upper Canada, was, as will hereafter be shown, originally traced out by the deputy adjutant-general, and approved by the commander of the forces.\n\nThe several circumstances connected with the military career of Sir John Harvey, which we proceed to note, were gleaned from papers and memoranda which have fallen under the notice of the writer of this imperfect sketch, who has also availed himself of printed despatches and accounts of operations in Canada, published in the provincial prints at the time, and for the accuracy of dates, of the assistance of that useful \"tell tale\" publication, the Annual Army List. From the latter it appears that the major-general was longer in the army than any officer then serving in British North America, the commander of the forces, the late Sir R. D. Jackson, alone excepted, and it may be added that, with the exception of a very short period, Sir John Harvey was constantly on foreign and active service.\n\nSir John Harvey was born in 1778, and entered the army as an ensign in the 80th Regiment, raised and commanded by Lord Paget, (afterwards the Marquis of Anglesea, whose natural son according to general belief he was) in September, 1794, and was present carrying the regimental colors, and received the expression of the marked approbation of his commanding officer, in a general action, with the French army in December of that year; he served during the winter campaign of 1794, under his Royal Highness the Duke of York, in Holland; under Major General Welbore Ellis Doyle, on the coast of France, in 1795; at the Cape of Good Hope, in 1796, where he was present at the capture of the Dutch fleet in Saldanha Bay; from 1797 to 1800, in Ceylon, the climate of which island was at that period very unhealthy; in 1800 and 1801, in Egypt as brigade-major, under Sir David Baird; in 1803, regimentally with the Madras Grand Army, at the commencement of the Mahratta war; 1804-5 and 6, as aide-de-camp to Major General Dowdeswell, of the Guards, with the Bengal Grand Army, under the personal command of General Lord Lake; and in 1807 he returned to England with an impaired constitution, having been unremittingly engaged in service for fourteen years, twelve of which were in tropical climates. In 1808, we find him on the staff in England, as assistant quarter-\nmaster-general, under Lieutenant-General Lord Chatham, at Colchester; and from 1809, to 1812, in the command of a regiment, and on the staff of the adjutant-general's department in Ireland.\n\nIn June, of the last mentioned year, Major Harvey was appointed deputy-adjutant-general to the army in Canada, with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. He lost no time in coming out to enter on the duties of his situation; but opportunities of passage to Canada were not at that time frequent, and he accordingly embarked for Halifax, where he arrived late in the season, and travelled through the then almost unfrequented route from Fredericton to Quebec.\n\nOf Sir John Harvey's distinguished services in the defence of these provinces, we shall introduce the notice by stating some circumstances which may not be generally known, but which cannot fail in being deeply interesting to our Canadian, and indeed to Sir John Harvey's friends, that having been introduced to Sir George Prevost, (by command of his Royal Highness the Duke of York, we believe,) as an officer who had served with distinction in various parts of the world. His Excellency received him with great satisfaction, having very few officers then under his command (1812) who had the advantage of having seen much actual service. Being about to visit Upper Canada for the first time, with a view to examine and make the necessary arrangements for the protection of the whole line of frontier, Lieutenant-Colonel Harvey was invited to accompany the commander of the forces on the journey from Quebec to Fort Erie. At the latter place, having shown him the immense extent of exposed frontier to be guarded, with the extreme inadequate force then at his Excellency's disposal, Sir George required from Colonel Harvey his opinion and advice, as to the best mode of defence; the answer was brief and prompt:\u2014\"First, by the accurate intelligence of the designs and movements of the enemy, to be procured at any price. And, secondly, by a series of bold, active, offensive operations, by which the enemy, however superior in numbers, would himself be thrown upon the defensive.\"\n\nThis advice was partially and in every case (except Sackett's Harbor,) most successfully adopted, and whoever will look back to the events of the campaign, of 1813, and 1814, in Upper Canada, will now see a clear exposition of the principle upon which that province was so successfully defended\u2014the various operations from Stony Creek to Chrysler's Farm, concluding (in 1813,) with the assault and capture of the American Fort Niagara, the capture of Oswego, the action of Lundy's Lane, and the subsequent advance to Fort Erie, in 1814, including the action at Cook's Mills, on the Chippawa, the various enterprizes against Fort Schlosser, Black Creek, Buffalo, &c., &c., will then stand out in bold relief, and the principle which directed all these operations will become\nclearly intelligible\u2014for these successes we are mainly indebted to the military talents of this distinguished officer.\n\nIn connexion with the first important operation in 1813, we cannot present our readers with a more interesting document than the following extract of a report addressed by the late Sir James Carmichael Smyth, of the royal engineers, to the Duke of Wellington, then master-general of the ordnance, by whom he was sent out to Canada, in 1825, to obtain information connected with the defence of the Canadas.\n\nAfter giving as clear and luminous a pr\u00e9cis of the military operations of the campaigns of 1812-13-14, as could be expected from any officer not having had access to the confidential papers connected therewith, Sir C. Smyth says, in speaking of Stony Creek:\u2014\"The preservation of the Niagara district, and of Kingston, may, with the strictest justice be fairly attributed to the attack upon the enemy at Stony Creek. The nature of the war seems to have changed after that most manly and energetic affair, and the campaign on that frontier terminated in the capture of the American stronghold (Fort Niagara,) and the destruction of all their towns and villages, together with the stores, provisions, and ordnance, which they had collected in that part of the country, for the further prosecution of the war.\"\n\nIn another place he says:\u2014\"The situation of General Vincent's small force, was unquestionably very critical\u2014in his front a very superior enemy\u2014no support in his rear, on which he could retire\u2014no provisions, supplies, or reinforcements to be expected from York, (Toronto) which the Americans had so lately possession of\u2014the Americans apparently masters of the lake (Ontario.) Under these circumstances Colonel Sir John Harvey proposed a night attack, with the bayonet, upon the enemy's troops in their front, and who had advanced as far as Stony Creek, within a few miles of the British position.\" [The enemy's force was three thousand five hundred men, the attacking column under Sir John Harvey, seven hundred and twenty bayonets.] \"The attack took place on the night of the 5th of June, (1813,) and was completely successful, the two American brigadiers, Winters and Chandler, one hundred and twenty-three officers and men, and four pieces of artillery were taken. The American troops fell back to the Forty Mile Creek, and continued their retreat to Fort George, calling in all their detachments, from the Chippawa, Fort Erie, &c., &c. The American troops seem to have lost all spirit of enterprize during the remainder of the campaign, after the affair of Stony Creek, and suffered themselves to be almost literally blockaded, and hemmed in at Fort George by very inferior numbers.\"\n\nFor some years previous to 1841, he filled the post of governor of New Brunswick. In the latter year he became governor and commander-in-chief at Newfoundland. His next appointment\nwas that of governor of Nova Scotia, in June, 1846, which he held up to the period of his decease, March 22, 1852. He received the colonelcy of the 59th Foot, on the 3rd December, 1844.\n\nSir John Harvey was nominated a knight commander of the Hanoverian Guelphic order in 1824, and a knight commander of the order of the Bath in 1838.\n\nHe married in 1806, the Honorable Elizabeth Lake, daughter of Gerard, first Viscount Lake, K.B. She died in 1851.\n\n---\n\nSIR JAMES LUCAS YEO, R.N., K.C.B.\n\nCommodore Sir James Lucas Yeo, who distinguished himself as the commander of our fleet on the lakes, during the American war of 1812, was the son of James Yeo, Esq., formerly agent victualler at Minorca, who died in 1825. He was born at Southampton, in 1782; was educated at the Rev. Mr. Walters' academy, at Bishop's Waltham, in Hampshire; whence he embarked, at a very early age, on board the Windsor Castle, under the late Admiral Cosby. At the age of fifteen, he was promoted by the late Sir John Duckworth to the rank of lieutenant. It was whilst holding this rank he commenced his more public and gallant career: being fortunately placed under that most excellent officer, Captain Frederick Lewis Maitland, in La Loire, he was despatched by him to capture the enemy's vessels in the port of El Muros; he stormed the fort in the most undaunted and gallant style, and afterwards succeeded in bringing out every vessel, armed and unarmed, lying in the port. He was immediately promoted to the rank of commander, and appointed to the Confiance, one of the vessels he had so gallantly taken. He was the person who brought the first intelligence to England of the rising of the Spaniards against their Gallic invaders, and the consequent surrender of a part of the French army\u2014an event that gave a new impulse to the people of Spain in all quarters, and at length, by the assistance of the British troops and their allies, finally drove the oppressive intruders out of the kingdom. His subsequent conquest of Cayenne, (for which he was promoted to the rank of post captain, and the Prince regent of Portugal, as a peculiar mark of his favor and high estimation, conferred upon him a knight's commandery of St. Benito d'Avis, the only Protestant ever so highly honored), and the more gallant exploits and able services\non the lakes of this province, previous to his death, are events yet in lively remembrance, and rank among the most splendid of those deeds of heroism performed by our gallant navy during the war with America. The mind of Sir James was distinguished for bold and vigorous enterprise, and never-ceasing zeal for the honor and prosperity of his country.\n\nFor one so young, he was exceedingly talented and experienced in his arduous profession, and well deserved the high honors conferred upon him. His services in Canada were great and generally successful, and he is equally with the band of heroes who so nobly defended this province from the aggressors, and to whom we owe, perhaps, our existence as a dependency of Great Britain, entitled to a fair share of praise for the gallantry and bravery of his exploits in our behalf, for these, not a little, tended to intimidate the enemy and bring about an honorable peace.\n\nHe died about the year 1819, while on a voyage from the coast of Africa. Sir James was not in a good state of health when he went there, and the most serious apprehensions for his life had been for some time entertained by his friends and relatives. The disease which closed his mortal existence in the 36th year of his age (atrophy, or general debility) was produced by arduous and anxious service. He bore his affliction and the approach of death, with the destruction of all the hopes and expectations his ardent mind had formed, with the highest degree of fortitude; and in a body kept alive alone by artificial means for four or five days, he retained his mental faculties nearly to his final dissolution. His remains were brought to England in the Semiramis frigate, and interred in the ground of the Royal Garrison Chapel, Portsmouth, with military honors due to his rank. All the officers off duty, belonging to regiments and corps in Portsmouth, Gosport, and Hilsa, attended the interment.\n\n---\n\n**COMMODORE DOWNIE, R.N.**\n\nThis brave hero was the son of a respectable clergyman in the county of Ross, Ireland. At an early period of his youth he entered the navy as a midshipman, and served on board the Circe frigate in the memorable battle of Camperdown. He acted in the same capacity, for some time, in the Melampus; and afterwards in the Apollo frigate, in the West Indies, for several years. In this station, his\nuniform good conduct and strict attention to his duty, received the most flattering approbation of his superiors, and recommended him to the particular notice of Admiral Montague, the commander of the Jamaica station, who promoted him to the rank of lieutenant. On his return to England, for the recovery of his health, which had been much impaired, his promotion was confirmed by the admiralty; and in 1804, he was appointed by Earl St. Vincent to the Sea-horse frigate, 36 guns, then commanded by Honorable Captain Boyle. After seeing a good deal of service, he was promoted to the rank of commodore, and placed in command of the fleet on the lakes of Canada in 1812. As such he was the commanding officer at the battle of lake Champlain in 1814, where he was unfortunately killed, whilst gallantly fighting the enemy's fleet under Commodore McDonough. It is a notorious fact, that the carpenters were still at work on board the Confluence, his flag-ship, when he advanced to meet the enemy, who had a force greatly superior. His vessels were also poorly manned, and he maintained the fight for a long time, totally unsupported by either the operations of the other water or land forces. He fell when the ship and part of his crew were crippled, after doing the enemy great damage. Altogether the annals of the wars of our country do not present a more daring and gallant spirit than poor Downie.\n\nLIEUT.-COLONEL DRUMMOND.\n\nAnother of the \"heroes of 1812,\" and one of the most gallant and chivalrous soldiers, that his country ever possessed. Respecting him, the Gentleman's Magazine, at the period of his death, said:\u2014\"It is some consolation to the surviving relatives, as well as common justice to the memory of an honorable man, who, in the strenuous exertion in his military profession, has fallen in defence of his king and country, that a faithful narrative of his services should be transmitted to posterity. Upon this laudable principle, we are gratified in recording, that the late Lieutenant-Colonel William Drummond, of his Majesty's 104th Regiment, and quartermaster-general, who was killed by the explosion of a mine at Fort Erie, in America, after having gloriously led the central column of the forces to the attack on the 15th August, 1814, was an officer whose life had been uniformly marked by brilliant actions. At St. Vincent, when a lieutenant in the 2nd West India Regiment, he\nreceived the most flattering testimonials from Lieutenant-General Hunter, under whom he then served. At the capture of Surinam, he was aide-de-camp to Lieutenant-General Sir Charles Green, commander of the forces, and was distinguished in his public despatches as an officer of the greatest promise. In the year 1804, the committee at Lloyd's voted him a sword of one hundred guineas' value, for their just appreciation of his talents and intrepidity, in animating by his example the crew of the merchant-ship Fortitude, on board of which he was a passenger, to a determined and valorous resistance against the united attacks of two French privateers off the Island of Barbadoes, thereby successfully maintaining the lustre of the British flag. At the attack on Sackett's Harbor he was severely wounded; and his zealous and meritorious conduct was marked in the public despatches as entitling him to the highest approbation. At Chippawa, and subsequently in every engagement, he invariably exhibited the most eminent qualities of the soldier; and, in private life, his benevolence and urbanity were equally conspicuous. He was the fifth son of the late John Drummond, Esquire, of Keltic, in the county of Perth, Scotland.\n\nCOMMODORE PRING.\n\nDaniel Pring entered the naval service at an early age, and, when very young, was a midshipman on the Jamaica station. In 1801 he served on board the Russell at Copenhagen. In 1807 he received his lieutenant's commission; and, on the breaking out of the American war, he was in command of the schooner Paz, on the Halifax station. When Sir George Prevost required naval officers to take charge of the provincial navy on the lakes, Lieutenant Pring was selected, among others, by Sir J. B. Warren, for those duties. In 1813, he was promoted to the rank of commander; and, in the following year, he was removed by Commodore Sir James Lucas Yeo from lake Ontario, to serve with Captain Downie on lake Champlain. Here he was appointed to the command of the Linnet, a brig of sixteen guns and about one hundred men. In this brig, under the command of Captain Downie, in the Confiance, and in company with two ten-gun sloops, and a flotilla of gun-boats, Captain Pring took part in the celebrated battle of Plattsburg Bay; in which engagement, disastrous as it was to the British arms, he signally distinguished himself. During the\ngreater part of the contest, the Linnet was engaged with the Eagle, an American brig of much superior force, mounting twenty heavy guns and one hundred and fifty men, which vessel he completely beat out of the line. Cooper, in his \"History of the American Navy,\" little as he seems inclined to allow credit to the British, virtually admits this fact. He says, \"the Linnet had got a very commanding position, and she was admirably fought. Eventually, the Linnet was compelled to strike, but not until the other vessels of the squadron had hauled down their colors. Captain Downie, who commanded the British squadron, was killed; and Commander Pring was the senior surviving officer of the squadron at the court-martial subsequently held at Portsmouth, at which he was most honorably acquitted. For his services, he was, in 1815, promoted to the rank of post captain; and, on the 26th June, 1816, was appointed to a command on lake Erie. He was nominated to the West India station, on the 16th September, 1844, and early in 1846, he hoisted his broad pendant as a commodore of the second class on board her Majesty's ship Imoan, at Port Royal, Jamaica, where he succeeded in making himself highly esteemed and respected, and where he unfortunately died of yellow fever, November 29, 1847. His remains were conveyed to Halfway Tree, where they were interred, in the presence of a numerous and distinguished company of public officers and private inhabitants.\n\nLIEUT.-COLONEL CECIL BISSHOPP.\n\nThe name of a young, brave, and successful British officer, in the war of 1812, who sacrificed his life in the service of his country.\n\nColonel Bisshopp was the son of Sir Cecil Bisshopp, Bart., afterwards Baron de la Zouche, of Parham, Sussex, England, and the descendent of an ancient and honored family of England. He was born in Spring Gardens, London, on the 25th June, 1783; and at the early age of sixteen, entered the military service in the 1st Foot Guards. He represented Newport, in the Isle of Wight, for some time in Parliament, and was attached to the embassy of Admiral Sir John Borlace Warren to Russia, and spent a year at St. Petersburg, from whence he was sent home with despatches in 1803. Having served with distinction in Flanders, (where he was aide-de-camp to General Grosvenor de Walchen,) and in Spain and Portu-\ngal, he proceeded to Canada in 1812, and had the satisfaction of at once being placed on active service on the Niagara frontier, in which he displayed much gallantry on several occasions, and early in July, 1813, set out in command of an expedition to reduce Black Rock; in this he was perfectly successful, all the enemy's stores, block houses, barracks and dock-yards were burned to the ground, and an immense quantity of stores captured; but the gallant Bishop was not destined to reap the benefit of this undertaking; an attack was made by the Americans on his forces, while they were examining the stores; and, although the enemy was beaten off, it was at the sacrifice of their brave young commander, who fell mortally wounded on the field, and soon after expired. His death was lamented by all, for he was universally loved and esteemed.\n\nHe was buried at the village of Stanford, near Niagara Falls, where a monument is placed over his remains by his sorrowing relations, with these lines written by the Right Honorable Sir R. Wilmot Horton, Bart:\n\n\"Stranger whose fearful steps e'er now have stood,\nBeneath Niagara's stupendous flood,\nWhose mind with awful ecstasy elate,\nHeard, in the mighty rush, the voice of fate.\nPause o'er this shrine, where sleeps the young, and brave,\nAnd shed one gen'rous tear o'er Cecil's grave.\"\n\nOn the tablet to his memory at the family burial place, Parham, are placed these lines, written by Sir James Macdonald:\n\n\"His pillow not of sturdy oak,\nHis shroud, a soldier's simple cloak,\nHis dirge, will sound till time's no more,\nNiagara's loud and solemn roar.\nThere Cecil lies\u2014say where the grave,\nMore worthy of a Briton brave.\"\n\nSIR W. H. MULCASTER, R.N., K.C.H.\n\nAnother name well known in the annals of our last war with the United States is that of Sir William Howe Mulcaster, C.B., K.C.H., K.T.S., who afterwards attained great honors, became a post captain in the royal navy, and naval aide-de-camp to the king. He was born in 1785, and died at Dover on the 2nd March, 1837.\n\nSir William was a son of the late Major-General Mulcaster, of the Royal Engineers. He was made a lieutenant early in 1800. In\nJune, 1806, when first lieutenant of the Minerva, he had the command of two boats, which, after carrying a fort of eight guns commanding Finisterre bay, captured five Spanish luggers and chasse-mar\u00e9es; this was characterized by Earl St. Vincent as a very neat exploit, conducted by an officer whom he \"felt great pride in acknowledging as an \u00e9l\u00e8ve of his own.\" In the following month his lordship had also the satisfaction of reporting \"another instance of the enterprising spirit of Lieutenant Mulcaster,\" which was in a similar service, when a Spanish lugger and privateer were captured.\n\nIn January, 1809, Lieutenant Mulcaster served at the capture of Cayenne, as first of the Confiance, 22, when his captain, the late Sir J. L. Yeo, acknowledged that \"to my first lieutenant, Mr. W. H. Mulcaster, I feel myself principally indebted for the very able support I have received from him throughout; though it was no more than I expected from an officer of his known merit in the service.\" The Prince Regent of Portugal distributed presents to all the officers engaged; to Lieutenant Mulcaster his Royal Highness gave a gold sword, with a suitable inscription; and on the 30th September, 1825, Sir William received his Majesty's permission to wear the insignia of the Tower and Sword, which had been presented to him for his services on this occasion.\n\nHe was made commander May 13, 1809; and appointed to the Emulous sloop, on the Halifax station, about October, 1810. He captured Padd\u00e9 letter of marque, August 26, 1811, and the Gossamer, American privateer, July 30, 1812; but on the 3rd of August following the Emulous was wrecked on Sable island.\n\nIn March, 1813, Captain Mulcaster was appointed to the Princess Charlotte, 42, then building on lake Ontario. He was promoted to post rank December 29 following. On the 6th May, 1814, only twenty-two days after the launching of the Princess Charlotte, he received a dangerous wound, when storming Fort Oswego, from the effects of which he never recovered. He was assigned in compensation a pension of \u00a3300, and was nominated a C. B. in June, 1815.\n\nHe married October 13, 1814, Sophia Sawyer, youngest daughter of the late Colonel Van Cortlandt.\nCAPTAIN JENKINS,\n\nA young and brave officer, a native of New Brunswick, and a captain in the Glengarry Fencibles. He distinguished himself at the taking of Ogdensburg on the 21st February, 1813, by his gallant and intrepid conduct in leading 150 men against Fort La Pr\u00e9sentation, which they attempted to carry, and finally succeeded in doing;\u2014not, however, before the chivalrous Jenkins had lost both his arms by grape shot, and sank exhausted from loss of blood on the field. He survived the war several years. He was a man of a remarkably fine appearance, full of spirit and of great bravery. He did honor to the loyal province of New Brunswick.\n\nLIEUT.-COLONEL R. B. HANDCOCK, 13TH REGT.,\n\nWas one of the most gallant of our defenders in 1812; he was born in 1780, and died at Pisa, on the 4th May, 1854. He was the son of the late Matthew Handcock, Esq., deputy muster-master-general of the forces in Ireland, descended from the Venerable Matthew Handcock, archdeacon of Kilmore, the son of William Handcock, Esq., M. P. for Westmeath, a common ancestor of the Lords Castlemaine. Having graduated in the university of Dublin, with distinguished honors, he joined his regiment in 1798, at the age of eighteen. His first campaign was under Sir Ralph Abercrombie at the memorable landing in Egypt in 1801, when he was severely wounded. He was afterwards on active service in various parts of the world for upwards of twenty years; and, during that time, served in Canada in 1812-13-14, where he greatly distinguished himself in command of Lacolle Mill, situated a few miles near Rouse's Point, and where on the 30th March, 1814, and with a small force of not five hundred men, and those not of the best, and a scarcity of ammunition, he successfully and with the greatest spirit held out against the attack of the American General Wilkinson, with a force of more than five thousand! History does not furnish a brighter victory, for such it may be termed, than that which he achieved with a comparatively small loss, against a well\norganized army, composed of infantry, cavalry and artillery. They kept up an incessant fire on the mill during the whole day; and at length were compelled to abandon an enterprise, from which they only escaped with a great loss, sustained by the well effected fire of Handcock's small force.\n\nLIEUT.-COLONEL LEONARD.\n\nRichard Leonard entered the army as an ensign in the 54th Foot, in December, 1796, and became lieutenant in the February following. After serving in Ireland during the rebellion of 1798, he embarked from Southampton, and joined Sir Ralph Abercrombie in the Mediterranean. He served the campaign of 1801 in Egypt, and was assistant-engineer during the siege of Alexandria. In 1803 he was appointed town-major of New Brunswick; and in 1805 he obtained a company in the New Brunswick regiment, afterwards the 104th Foot, and continued to hold both these appointments until 1813, when he resigned the former, on his regiment being ordered to Canada. In April he was appointed deputy-assistant-adjutant-general; and in that situation obtained permission to head his company in the attack made on Sackett's Harbor, on the 29th of May, in which his company suffered severely, until he was himself wounded.\n\nIn the campaign of 1814 he was again actively employed. He bore a part in the action of the 26th of July at Lundy's Lane, and was honorably mentioned in Sir Gordon Drummond's despatches of that action. In the assault on Fort Erie, on the 15th of August, he was severely wounded, and disabled from further service in the campaign. He succeeded to the majority vacated by the death of Lieutenant-Colonel Drummond, who was killed at Fort Erie, and served with the 104th in Lower Canada until it was disbanded in 1817. He subsequently retired to a small property he had purchased, part of the ground on which the action of Lundy's Lane was fought, and there closed his honorable career, on the 31st October, 1833, universally regretted by the people of that portion of the country, and a large circle of friends in the province.\nCOLONEL CHEWETT.\n\nWilliam Chewett, Esquire, was born in London, on the 21st December 1752; and, when about 18 years of age, passed his examination as a surveyor and draughtsman for the East India service; but after receiving his appointment, he was attacked with smallpox, so that the ship in which he should have gone out sailed without him. On his recovery he decided upon going to America, and arrived at Quebec in 1771. On the 20th of May, 1774, he received an appointment in the surveyor-general's office for the province of Quebec. During the American revolution he served in the Quebec militia; and in the course of the siege, when off duty, he assisted in the engineer department. After the defeat of the Americans, he was appointed acting-paymaster of works to the engineer's, quartermaster's, and naval departments, for the ports of St. John, Isle-aux-Noix, and the dependencies on lake Champlain, in which office he remained till 1785. In 1786 he took charge of the district of Luneburgh (now called the eastern district of Upper Canada), and there surveyed lands and located the disbanded troops and loyalists. In 1792 he was employed under Governor Simcoe, at Kingston, in reconstructing the map of this province by dividing it into Upper and Lower Canada. In 1802, upon the retirement of Mr. Surveyor-General Smith, he was appointed deputy-surveyor-general, conjointly with Mr. Ridout, who afterwards received an appointment of surveyor-general, which office he held till 1832, when he was allowed to retire on full pay, after having served in various departments for upwards of fifty-eight years. Mr. Chewett held the appointment of colonel of militia during the last American war, and commanded the Canadian troops at the attack on Toronto, on which occasion he was severely injured by the blowing up of the powder magazine. He was taken prisoner by the Americans, and allowed to depart on his parole. For a long time previous to and since his retirement from public service, until his death, which occurred 24th September, 1849, Mr. Chewett resided at Toronto. Colonel Chewett was a gentleman of well-known kindness, politeness and affability, and was much esteemed by all who knew him.\nHon. Mr. JUSTICE FLETCHER.\n\nThe Honorable John Fletcher, provincial judge of the district of St. Francis, Lower Canada, one of the justices of the Court of Queen's Bench, for that district, and also of the Provincial Court of Appeals, was born at Rochester, in the county of Kent, England, in the year 1787, and was the son of the rector of Dedham, in Essex. At an early age, the subject of this short notice, was sent as a pupil to St. Paul's school, London, where he received his education. Having embraced the law as his profession, he, after receiving a most liberal education, prosecuted the study of that learned profession, and soon enjoyed an extensive practice in London. Before migrating to Canada, Mr. Fletcher had become distinguished as an eminent man of science in the great world of London, where he contributed many valuable papers to the leading scientific journals of that city; he was also well known as a most able and successful lecturer. He arrived in Canada in the year 1810, and was immediately admitted to the bar of that country, and was for many years one of the leading members of the profession, where his great forensic powers are well remembered. During the contest between the two great rival fur companies in the north-west territory, he was appointed one of the commissioners for the settlement of the difficulties between them, and had the military rank of major conferred upon him. The next public position which he held, was that of chairman of Quarter Sessions; which he resigned upon his appointment to the judgeship of the district of St. Francis, on the erection of the eastern townships into a separate district, in the year 1823. In the establishment of a system of judicature, in a newly settled country, he had many and great obstacles to contend with, which his great firmness and high sense of duty enabled him to overcome. By the changes in the judicature, his duties were greatly increased, and we regret to learn that his decease was in some measure hastened by his anxiety to perform them, and more particularly by his having presided in court within a few days of his death, contrary to the advice of his medical attendant. This earnest desire was strikingly manifested in his unremitting attention to the discharge of his duties, as one of the members of the Court of Appeals in July 1844, when those who had known him many years, and were aware of his advanced age, saw with pleasure that his gigantic intellect and faculties were still unimpaired. He was brought up in the faith of the Church of England, of which his\nfather and grandfather were ministers, and he lived a sincere member of that church, and a devoted advocate of its doctrine and institutions. He died at Sherbrooke, 11th November, 1844, aged 77.\n\nHON. WILLIAM SMITH,\n\nAuthor, we believe, of the first English history of Canada. He was a son of the Chief-Justice Smith, and was born in June, 1770. He went to England from New York; was educated at a grammar school, at Kensington, near London, and came to Canada with his father, in 1786. He was soon appointed clerk of the Provincial Parliament, subsequently a master in chancery, and, in 1814, was appointed by the Earl Bathurst, then secretary-of-state for the colonies, a member of the Executive Council. He married Susan, daughter of Admiral Charles Webber, of Hampshire, England, by whom he had five children.\n\nHON. MR. JUSTICE KERR.\n\nMr. Kerr was a native of Leith, the son of a highly respectable merchant there; and having received his early education at the excellent old grammar school of Leith, and completed it at the University of Glasgow, he went to London about 1785, and entering at the Inner Temple, where he was admitted to the English bar. While studying there, and after his admission, he made the acquaintance, and, by his mental acquirements and gentlemanly manner and character, secured the friendship of several men who afterwards distinguished themselves in the legal profession; among these were Scarlett, afterwards Lord Abinger, and Best, afterwards Lord Wynford, and Baron McLelland of the Irish bench.\n\nIn 1794, Mr. Kerr having married, came to try his fortune at the Quebec bar, and returning to England in 1796, to bring out his family, he was captured by a French cruiser, and taken to\nFrance, but speedily exchanged; and coming back to Quebec in 1797, received in the same year the appointment of judge of the Vice-Admiralty.* Continuing to practice at the bar, he was in 1807 appointed judge of the King's Bench;\u20141812, was called by Sir George Prevost, to the Executive Council, and by the Earl of Dalhousie, in 1821, to the Legislative Council. During the absence of Chief-Justice Sewell in England, in 1814, 1815 and 1816, and again in 1826-7, Mr. Kerr presided as senior judge in the Court of King's Bench, and during the latter period as Speaker of the Legislative Council.\n\nIn 1833, he proceeded to England to meet various frivolous and malignant accusations brought against him by the Assembly, to which the then secretary of state, Lord Stanley, assured him that he did not think it necessary to require him to make an answer, but on the change of ministry in 1834, the persons who then came into office, not unwilling to make another sacrifice to the prevailing party in the Assembly, removed him in October, 1834, by an official manoeuvre, first from his situation as judge of the Vice-Admiralty, then from his seat in the King's Bench, on the plea of a matter which had for years been a subject of correspondence between him and the government at home, and which involved a claim to emoluments which those authorities partly entertained, but neither admitted or refused to him.\n\nReturning to Quebec, in 1835, at the age of seventy, ruined in fortune, and broken in health by a paralytic affection, brought on by the injustice he had suffered, he lived in retirement until his death, 5th May, 1846.\n\nMr. Kerr filled the various public situations in which he was placed with strict integrity, with dignity and credit. His written judicial decisions, especially in the admiralty, and his other public compositions, were marked by considerable elegance and vigor of style. His manners both in public and private life, were those of a thorough gentleman of the old school; and any occasional infirmity of temper, the inheritance of our flesh, was soon forgotten, by all except cankered minds, in the general courteousness of his manners and goodness of his disposition. He was a devout believer in the truths of Christianity, and an attached member of the Church of England; and his daily consolation, for some hours of every day, for many years had been found in reading the scriptures. His paralytic affection prevented him from joining in general conversation, though not from enjoying it among intimate friends; and his chief recreation was in reading works of general literature. He retained his faculties in a great degree, though diminished by disease and natural decay, to within a few hours of his death. In\n\n*His Commission as judge of the Vice-Admiralty Court at Quebec was dated 19th August, 1797.\nhis case the kindlier doom of our nature was reversed, which calls away the aged before the younger, and only just four months before his death, he had to deplore the loss of his son, in the vigor of mature age, one of the most stirring, active and enterprising men in Quebec. But the good old man was not long behind: \"in the extremest boundary of human life, without the throbs of agony, or any but the slow gradations of dissolution and decay, and supported and sustained by female filial piety (that blessed bounden duty) he came as a shock of corn to the ground in his season.\"\n\nCOLONEL C. BARKER TURNER, K.H.\n\nColonel Turner was one of the veterans of Waterloo. He came to Canada in 1838, on particular service, and was afterwards appointed to the command of the eastern district in Upper Canada. He remained there until 1843, when he went to England; but, in 1845, he sold out of the army and returned to Canada as a permanent resident. He died at Toronto, C.W., in 1853. One of his daughters married the Honorable P.M. Vankoughnet, the present commissioner of crown lands.\n\nHENRY LEMESURIER, Esq.\n\nMr. Lemesurier, the son of the late Commissary-General Haviland Lemesurier, was born in Guernsey, in the year 1791, his family having been possessed of the neighboring island of Alderney for some generations past, under royal patent. Following the pursuits of his father, he entered the army in the year 1811, and proceeded to Spain, where he served under the Duke of Wellington in the Peninsular campaign. He was present at the battle of Salamanca, and, when carrying the colors of her Majesty's 48th Regiment, in that engagement, was struck by a spent musket ball in the abdomen, and whilst extending his right arm to retake the colors,\nit was carried away by a round shot. Being, in consequence of this injury, disabled from following actively his regimental duties, and yet averse to abandon the military profession, he joined, in the year 1813, the commissariat department, and in that capacity served in Canada during the war of 1812 with the United States; and having, in 1818, upon the proclamation of peace, married into one of the old French Canadian families, he retired during that year on half-pay, and fixed his future residence and interests in Canada.\n\nHe carried on, for many years, a very extensive mercantile business in the city of Quebec; and for a considerable period of time held the office of deputy-master of the Trinity House, and upon the resignation of the late Honorable John Stewart, succeeded that gentleman as master of the Trinity House; an office which he held at the time of his death. He also held the rank of lieutenant-colonel in the militia of the province, and in his capacity of senior magistrate of the district of Quebec, had the honor to present and read to the Prince of Wales, on the occasion of the visit of His Royal Highness to Quebec, in August, 1860, the address of the magistracy, being also actively engaged at the time, in the successful demonstrations of loyalty and zeal with which his Royal Highness was received in Quebec.\n\nThe Quebec Chronicle, in recording his death, which took place on the 24th of May, 1861, said:\n\n\"To chronicle the loss to Quebec of one of the oldest, most useful, and highly esteemed and respected of its citizens, is the melancholy duty which has devolved upon us this day, as public journalists. Mr. Henry Lemesurier is dead. A long life spent in service of his Queen and country, in promoting the success of this city, and in upholding the public interests and the welfare of his fellow citizens, has been closed; and whilst there thus passed away from the very midst of us, and with a sudden transition from a strong and hale old age to the quiet tomb, one so highly honored, there yet rests to his friends the memory of his well spent life on earth, and, we may trust, the consolatory hope of his eternal happiness.\"\n\nThus has passed away a loyal and devoted subject of the Queen, an energetic citizen, and the affectionate head of a family, who, whilst lamenting his loss, have the firm consolation of knowing that whilst eagerly considerate of his public position, and the duties attached to it, he deeply felt the higher responsibilities of a Christian career, and at all times humbly sought to prepare himself for that moment which has now come, and removed him from the scene of his earthly labors.\"\nSIR FREDERICK P. ROBINSON, G.C.B.\n\nSir F. P. Robinson who served in Canada towards the termination of the war of 1812, and was afterwards lieutenant-governor of Upper Canada was a son of Colonel Beverley Robinson, of New York, and a U. E. Loyalist, a relative of Sir J. B. Robinson, Bart., chief-justice of Upper Canada, and a brave and distinguished British officer.\n\nHe first entered the military service in February 1777, as ensign in the Loyal American regiment, with which he served in North America; in 1778 he removed to the 17th Regiment, and in 1799 to the 60th, and was a prisoner of war in America several months during his connexion with this regiment, and made himself conspicuous in several engagements. In 1780 he joined the 38th, and was promoted to the rank of captain in 1794. He served at the capture of the West India Islands, under General Sir Charles Grey, in that year including the siege of Fort Bourbon in the Island of Martinique. In September, 1794, he gained his majority in the 127th Regiment, and in 1795 returned home from the West Indies. In May, 1796, he was appointed officer of the recruiting service at Bedford, England, and some years afterwards filled the same situation in the London district. While thus employed he effected some valuable improvements in the recruiting service. In 1800 he was appointed to the brevet rank of lieutenant-colonel, and in 1812 we find him serving as brigadier-general on the staff in the Peninsula. In 1813, he was appointed major-general, and continued from that time on the staff in Spain, until 24th of May, 1814.\n\nHe commanded a brigade at the battle of Vittoria; at the siege of Sebastian where he was wounded; and at the actions connected with the passage of the Nive, for which he received a medal and two clasps. After the termination of the Peninsular war, he proceeded to Canada as commander-in-chief of the forces in the upper province, and on the 1st July, 1815, the government of Upper Canada devolved upon him. This he held until 1816, when Mr. Francis Gore returned from England. He shortly after removed to the West Indies, where he took command of the troops. On the 2nd January, 1815, he was nominated a knight commander of the order of the Bath. He continued in command of the troops in the Leeward Islands until July, 1821.\n\nIn 1825 he was advanced to the rank of lieutenant-general. In 1827 he became colonel of the 50th Regiment, and in 1838 was\nnominated a knight grand cross of the order of the Bath. In 1840 he was made colonel of the 39th Regiment, and in 1841 was promoted to the rank of general. His decease occurred at Brighton on the 1st January, 1852.\n\nSIR DAVID WILLIAM SMITH, BART.\n\nHe was born on the 4th September 1764, and was the only child of John Smith, Esquire, sometime of Salisbury, lieutenant-colonel of the fifth Foot, who died commandant of the fortress of Niagara, Canada West, in 1795, by Anne, daughter of William Waylen, Esquire, of Rowde Hill and Devises, county Wiltshire. At an early age he was appointed an ensign in his father's regiment, in which he subsequently attained the rank of captain. Afterwards, he was called to the bar in Upper Canada, with precedence as deputy-judge-advocate; and was appointed surveyor-general of lands, also one of the trustees for the Six Nations, and one of the Executive Council, and of the committee for administering the government in the governor's absence; a member of the three first Canadian Parliaments, and Speaker of the House of Assembly in two of them. For these public services he was created a baronet by patent, dated August 30, 1821.\n\nThe consummate ability with which he for a long period administered the affairs of the Duke of Northumberland in the county of Northumberland, is well-known; the kindness and warm-hearted generosity of his character, united with the manners of a high-minded English gentleman, endeared him to all who had the honor of his acquaintance, and will cause him to be long remembered with deep regret both in Upper Canada and in the neighborhood of Alnwick, where he last resided in England, where his death which took place on the 9th of May, 1837, caused a blank not readily filled.\n\nSir David Smith was twice married; first, on the 3rd November, 1788, to Anne, daughter of John O'Reilly, of Ballykilchrist, county Longford, Esquire, and by that lady, who died in 1798, he had issue eight children, three of whom died young; one son David William, of H. M.'s frigate Spartan, was killed at Quiberon in 1811; and three daughters survive, Mary Elizabeth, married in 1814 to Charles Tyler, Esq., and Sarah and Ann. Sir David married secondly, in 1803, Mary, youngest daughter of John Tyler, Esq., of Devises, banker, by whom he had one daughter, Hannah.\nREV. PIERRE GIBERT.\n\nThis pious prelate, who was curate of St. Michel d\u2019Yamaska, was no ordinary man. He was a native of Normandy, and had been obliged to expatriate himself in the early period of the French revolution, when almost all his brethren of the clergy were expelled from France. He had been, for about thirty years previously to his decease, which took place at St. Michel d\u2019Yamaska on the 31st July, 1824, an inhabitant of Canada, where he was held in estimation, not merely by those who had the happiness of belonging to his own church, but the amenity and cheerfulness of his manners, the kindness of his disposition, and his freedom from illiberal prejudice, was esteemed and respected by persons of every religious persuasion.\n\nAt his death he bequeathed a large sum of money to the various charitable institutions of the lower province.\n\nHON. SIR W. CAMPBELL.\n\nMr. Chief-Justice Campbell, whom the present honored chief-justice of Upper Canada succeeded in 1829, was a gentleman of very great attainments and capacity. He originally had served in the army in a subordinate capacity, and had fought during the American revolutionary war. Having obtained his discharge, he went, after the peace of 1783, to reside in Nova Scotia; and although (we believe) he never studied, yet there he was called to the bar. Subsequently he resided in Cape Breton (which island then possessed a government of its own), and here he was appointed attorney-general, and was also a member of the Assembly. We do not know when he went to Upper Canada; but in 1811, he was appointed a puisn\u00e9 judge there; and in 1825, on the retirement of Mr. Chief-Justice Powell, he was elevated to the chief-justiceship, a post which he held until July, 1829, when he resigned on account of his advanced years and the infirm state of his health, and received the honor of knighthood, an honor which he survived only a few years.\nSir John Cope Sherbrooke, G.C.B.\n\nGeneral Sherbrooke, who succeeded General Sir Gordon Drummond in the government of Canada, in 1816, was a military commander of some repute, and had seen some service. He was the youngest brother of W. Sherbrooke, Esq., of Oxton, and of Colonel Cope, of Sherwood Lodge, Notts. He distinguished himself in the taking of Serinapatanm, in the East Indies, in 1797. He afterwards served on the Peninsula in the early campaign of the Duke of Wellington. Previously to his connection with Canada, he administered the government of Nova Scotia, as history tells us, \"with much tact and dexterity.\"\n\nHe assumed the reins of government at a most critical period of the country,\u2014namely, that in which the farmers of Lower Canada suffered the total loss of their wheat crop. The wise and prudent course adopted by Sir John in this instance, secured for him the love and esteem of all. He took the responsibility of advancing to the relief of the farmers the sum of \u00a314,216 to secure them from destitution, and to assist them in laying down another crop. On the meeting of Parliament, it not only released him from the responsibility which he had taken on himself, but voted an additional sum of \u00a335,500 for the same purpose, and to loan to industrious and deserving farmers.\n\nHe took a bold and determined stand in the matter of Judges Sewell and Monk; and, when advised by the home government to support those gentlemen, plainly replied that it would be hopeless, and strongly advised the impeachment to be raised before the Privy Council. To his resolute, manly and open conduct in this instance must be ascribed the result.\n\nDuring his administration, he also effected the entrance of the Speaker of the Assembly ex-officio to a seat in the Executive Council; and the concurrence of the Imperial Government was announced, that it accepted the Canadian government's offer to defray the expenses of the Civil List.\n\nSir John governed the province from 1816 to 1818; and on account of ill health, but principally from dislike of the station, he requested his recall. Accordingly, he left the country on the 12th August, carrying with him the best wishes and regards of the majority of the people of Lower Canada. Prior to his departure, numerous addresses were presented to him from different sections of the country, all breathing alike the warmest sentiments of good will and prayers for his future welfare.\nHe returned home, but did not leave the military service, as, in May, 1825, we perceive he was raised to the high rank of general. His death occurred on the 14th of February, 1830, at Claverton, Nottinghamshire.\n\n---\n\nHON. SAMUEL SMITH.\n\nWe now present to our readers, a brief notice of the memorable life of the Honorable Samuel Smith, administrator of the government of Upper Canada, one of the distinguished United Empire loyalists, an early pioneer of the vast and beautiful country of Upper Canada, which owes much of its present position to the energy and zeal displayed by Mr. Smith. This gentleman himself, without the assistance of any member of the \"Family Compact,\" or any other party, from a quiet citizen of York, the then capital, was raised to a seat in the Council; and from that to the highest position in the country. He was administrator of the government of the upper province, a post which he held with distinguished ability, from 1817 to 1818, and again in 1820, on the respective resignations of Francis Gore, Esquire, and Sir Peregrine Maitland, the lieutenant-governors. In his high office he displayed more than ordinary wisdom and efficiency.\n\nHis decease took place at his residence, Toronto, on 20th October, 1826. He was universally regretted, as he had been esteemed by the whole population of the western capital, and by numerous friends in the upper province.\n\nMr. Smith had a large family of seven daughters and two sons, most of whom are still living. We give an extract from an Upper Canada paper, published soon after Mr. Smith's death. Believing that it cannot but prove interesting to his many friends, and admirers, we reproduce it:\n\n\"The late Honorable Samuel Smith was one of that patriotic band who, having preserved their allegiance to their sovereign inviolate during the revolt of the American colonies, at the close of the contest sought an asylum in this province, under the protection of that gracious king, in whose cause they sacrificed their all. The example of such men deserves an honorable record, and we have no doubt that it will be satisfactory to his associates in arms, throughout the province, if we attempt to give a summary of an eulogy on the character of Mr. Smith, in a sermon delivered on Sunday last, at York, by the Reverend Doctor Phillips, the...\"\nsubstance of which, we think we are correct in quoting as follows:\n\n\"It affords us much pleasure, to recapitulate his virtues as a soldier, a senator, a father, and a friend. His youthful blood was shed in our country's cause, and he nobly withstood the mad career of rebellion, to maintain the standard of British glory. His conduct in the high and distinguished office of administrator of the government of this province was marked with undeviating rectitude, evincing on all occasions, a firm attachment to the best interests of this happy and flourishing colony. He was a zealous supporter of the laws and constitution of the British empire, and a bright ornament of our protestant church. Paternal affection and solicitude, were conspicuous in his domestic relations, and as a friend, the individual feelings of those who knew him from his youth, many of whom are here present, who were his fellow associates in the arduous cause, in which he was engaged, will bear testimony to his extreme kindness and amiable disposition. As a Christian, the sincerity of his faith, and pious resolutions, were manifested by his walking humbly with his God.\"\n\nDUKE OF RICHMOND, K.G.\n\nCharles Gordon Lennox, fourth Duke of Richmond, Earl of March, and Baron of Sitterington in the peerage of England; Duke of Lennox, Earl of Darnley and Baron Methuen in the peerage of Scotland, and Duke d'Aubigny in France, was the only son of Lieutenant-General Lord George Henry Lennox, by Louisa, daughter of the fourth Marquis of Lothian, having been born in 1764. His grace succeeded General Sherbrooke in the government of Canada, on the 29th of July, 1819. He had previously held the high and distinguished office of lord-lieutenant of Ireland, in which he had given much satisfaction to the people of that distracted country.\n\nHis administration of the government here was not of a prolonged nature; but during the short time he held the reins of power, he did much to shew the determined and energetic nature of his character; more particularly on the occasion when the legislature, having refused to grant any supplies to defray the civil list, he drew on the receiver-general on his own responsibility. Death cut short the career of this great man, on the 27th of August, 1820,\nduring a tour of inspection in Upper Canada, singularly enough through the bite of a tame fox, not suspected to be in a rabid state, with which he was amusing himself. His demise occurred at a village on the Ottawa, called after himself; his remains were conveyed to Quebec, and buried in the English cathedral of that ancient city.\n\nHis grace had married in 1789, Charlotte, daughter of the fourth Duke of Gordon, by whom he had a large progeny.\n\nThe original letter, which we produce, describing the manner of his death, was written by a member of his staff, and may be interesting to our readers:\u2014\n\n\"Quebec, September 6.\u2014You will learn from the Quebec papers the melancholy event of the death of his Grace the Duke of Richmond; but notwithstanding what you will observe in them, it is affirmed a case of hydrophobia was the cause of this sad catastrophe, and it is asserted to have originated from the bite of a fox on the 28th of June. His grace having left this place about the 24th of June on an extensive tour through the Canadas, after his arrival at William Henry, one hundred and thirty-five miles up the river, whilst walking about the village with his little dog Blucher, met a fox about the place, with which the dog appeared sociable, and they entered into play together. His grace seemed much pleased, and expressed something like a wish that the fox should be purchased. Accordingly, the hint was attended to by a servant belonging to the suite, who purchased the fox the same night. Next morning Sir C. Saxton, seeing the fox tied to a tent pitched for the accommodation of the servants, and apparently much irritated from his restrained situation under a scorching sun, desired that the animal might be removed somewhere into the shade. He was then fixed to a wicket-gate in front of the house. His grace, on coming out in the morning, observing the fox, which he knew to be the same he had seen the day before, went up to him, saying, 'Is this you, my little fellow?' and on offering to put out his hand to caress the fox, Sir Charles Saxton touched the duke on the shoulder to prevent it, apprising his grace at the same time of the irritation of the fox, and that he might bite. 'No, no,' said his grace, 'the little fellow will not bite me!' and putting out his hand, the fox snapped and made three scratches on the back of his hand, which drew blood. His grace, quickly drawing it back, said, 'Indeed, my friend, you bite very hard.' The next morning, his grace found an uneasy sensation in his shoulder; but nothing further occurred till near returning from his tour; when at the new back settlement of Perth, on the 22nd or 23rd of August, after having returned from walking, his grace desired his servant to make two glasses of wine and water for himself and Major Bowles. As soon as the duke took the wine and water, he observed to the major that he felt a strange sensation on drinking it. On the way\nfrom Perth towards the Ottawa river, some of the attendants observed his irritability, and extreme aversion to water on crossing the smallest streamlets in the woods; and they could scarcely get him along. On his approaching a small hut on the Ottawa river, rather than go into a house close to the river, he turned short and ran into a barn; at another time he ran from them into the woods, as if to shun the sight of water. His disorder was now rapidly increasing; but on his arrival within six miles this side of the newly-named place Richmond, after suffering most excruciating torments, he died, at eight o'clock on Saturday morning, the 28th of August.\"\n\nThe following is an extract from the Montreal Herald of that day:\n\n\"In public life he was steady, firm, and decisive in his measures. He was accessible to all who chose to prefer their complaints to him; and when he was compelled to refuse their prayers, he anxiously studied to convey that refusal in terms the least unpleasing to the feelings of the applicant. In private life his affable condescension was gratifying to all around him; and although he could descend to the social intercourse of the domestic circle, he never lost sight of that native dignity which repelled improper liberties, and checked the forward. In early life, devoted from choice to the profession of arms, he evinced that most valuable of all qualities in an officer, the power of securing the attachment of those under him. And when he afterwards came to be employed in the more difficult and complex duties of a ruler, he performed the office so as to secure him the esteem and confidence of his sovereign, and the ardent attachment of those people over whom he was placed. A striking instance of this was evinced in his appointment as lord-lieutenant of Ireland. At a time when contending parties, and discontented individuals distracted the public mind in that country, his grace's behavior soon produced the happiest result. His affable condescension pleased all parties; his confidence gained their esteem; and they soon discovered that the chief aim of his administration was to relieve their distresses, and promote their happiness. At the present time, though twelve years have elapsed since his appointment to that office, the anniversary of the arrival of the Duke of Richmond in Ireland, still continues to be celebrated in that country with the warmest enthusiasm and most gratifying recollection of the event. And this we consider a higher tribute to his memory than 'storied urn or monumental epitaph' can ever perpetuate.\"\n\nIt was resolved by the magistrates at Montreal, in consequence of the death of this lamented nobleman, that the public should be requested to wear mourning thirty days.\nSIR PEREGRINE MAITLAND, G.C.B.\n\nSir Peregrine Maitland was born at Longparish House, in Hampshire, in 1777. He was the son of Thomas Maitland, Esq., of Shrubs Hall, in the New Forest, by Miss Dewar, daughter of George Dewar, Esq., and niece to Brownlow, last Duke of Ancaster.\n\nHe entered the army June 25, 1792, as ensign in the 1st Guards, and was promoted to lieutenant and captain, April 30, 1794. He served the campaigns in Flanders, and was present in the several actions; and also at Ostend in 1798. He succeeded to a company, June 25, 1803, with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. In 1808 and 1809 he was employed in Spain, where he was engaged in the action of Lugo, and at Corunna, for which he received the silver war medal. He was also in the expedition of the latter year to the Scheldt. He attained the brevet rank of colonel, January 1, 1812. At the battle of the Nive he commanded the first brigade of Guards, for which he received the gold medal. He became a major-general, June 4, 1814; and at Waterloo commanded the first British brigade of the first division, consisting of the second and third battalions of the 1st Foot Guards. On the 22nd June, 1815, he was nominated a knight commander of the Bath; and for his services at Waterloo he also received the fourth class of the Russian order of Vladimir, and the third class of the order of Wilhelm of the Netherlands.\n\nOn the 3rd of January, 1818, Sir Peregrine Maitland was appointed lieutenant-governor of the province of Upper Canada, and accompanied his father-in-law, the late Duke of Richmond, to Canada. On the death of that nobleman, he administered the government of Lower Canada until the arrival of the Earl of Dalhousie, the governor-general; nothing extraordinary marked his administration of affairs. He was afterwards lieutenant-governor of Nova Scotia.\n\nOn the 22nd July, 1830, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general; and on the 19th July, 1834, appointed to the command of the 76th Foot.\n\nHe was appointed commander-in-chief of the Madras army on the 17th April, 1836; and was succeeded by Sir Jasper Nicolls in December, 1838; and from December 1843 to September, 1846, he was governor and commander-in-chief at the Cape of Good Hope.\n\nHe was removed from the command of the 76th to that of the 17th Foot on the 2nd January, 1843.\nIn November, 1846, he attained the full rank of general; and in 1852 he was nominated a knight grand cross of the Bath.\n\nHe died in London on the 30th May, 1854.\n\nSir Peregrine Maitland was twice married: first, in 1803, to the Honorable Louisa Crofton, third daughter of Anne, Baroness Crofton, and Sir Edward Crofton, Baronet, M.P. for the County Roscommon. She died in 1805. He married, secondly, October 9, 1815, Lady Sarah Lennox, second daughter of Charles, fourth Duke of Richmond and Lennox.\n\n---\n\nHON. MR. JUSTICE PIERRE BEDARD.\n\nThis celebrated Canadian politician, was born at Quebec, in 1763. He followed the profession of the law, and was one of the first native Canadians admitted to the bar of Canada, as also one of the first members of its Legislative Assembly, wherein he became leader of the opposition party during the administration of Sir James Craig. He was one of the founders of Le Canadien newspaper, and was incarcerated by the government for admitting into its pages some violent political articles reflecting on the conduct of the governor-general and the executive. He remained in confinement, and demanded a trial, so as to exonerate himself from the charges preferred against him, although at perfect liberty to leave his imprisonment; he, however, tarnished his patriotism, by accepting, as the gift of the government which had persecuted him, the post of a district judgeship; and, in consequence, became extremely unpopular with his party. He, however, filled his appointment long and ably, and with much advantage to the public.\n\nHis death occurred in 1827. He preserved down to his last illness an ardent love of knowledge, which, united to his warm and disinterested patriotism, and the peculiar simplicity of manners, so often found combined with genius, formed the basis of a character, whose public and private worth is rarely surpassed.\nROBERT GOURLAY, Esq.\n\nWe extract from McMullen this brief account of this remarkable man's career, (more particularly in this country,) which forms one of the vilest pages in our history, and is an indelible stain on the memory of the then lieutenant-governor, Mr. Francis Gore.\n\n\"While the incipient seeds of discontent and agitation were thus (referring to some violent act on the part of the government in 1817) being firmly planted in the community, Robert Gourlay, destined to figure somewhat prominently in the affairs of this country for a short time, came out in the month of July. Attracted hither by Brockville, he was sued for another libel in the same petition, but was again honorably acquitted; and, having now twice defeated the government, was, apparently, in a fair way of becoming quite a popular personage. But his elevation had been too rapid to be lasting.\n\n\"On the 12th of October, the Legislature was opened by the lieutenant-governor, with a short speech, one paragraph of which was levelled at Mr. Gourlay. 'In the course of your investigation,' said Sir Peregrine, 'you will, I doubt not, feel a just indignation at the attempts which have been made to excite discontent, and to organize sedition. Should it appear to you, that a convention of delegates cannot exist, without danger to the constitution, in framing a law of prevention, your dispassionate wisdom will be careful that it shall not unwarily trespass on the sacred right of the subject to seek a redress of his grievances by petition.'\n\n\"The Assembly were as thoroughly alarmed by the convention as the government, and regarded the movement as an infringement on the rights of parliamentary representation, and a censure on their body. The term convention, too, was an American phrase, which smacked of republicanism, and of itself alarmed the members. 'We remember,' said they, in an address to the governor, on the 19th of October, 'That this favored land was assigned to our fathers as a retreat for suffering loyalty, and not as a sanctuary for sedition. We lament that the designs of one factious individual (Gourlay), should have succeeded in drawing into the support of his vile machinations, so many honest men and loyal subjects of his Majesty.' Not a word was breathed about grievances, or the condition of the province; the convention had all that business to itself. The Assembly were now prepared to pass any measure the executive might recommend, and to put their ban, if necessary, upon the unlucky Gourlay. On the 26th of October, Jonas Jones, of Brockville, introduced a bill to prevent the future assemblage...\"\nof conventions, under the head of 'An act for preventing certain meetings within this province,' which was duly passed into law, twelve out of a house of thirteen voting for it.*\n\n\"The extreme position taken by the Legislature, and the efforts of the 'Family Compact,' produced a reaction against Mr. Gourlay, in several parts of the country, and many persons were led to believe that he was really a seditious and disloyal person; still, considering himself perfectly safe, and not a little elated at the sudden importance he had acquired as the Canadian Cobbett, he resolved to settle permanently in the province as a land-agent. But the executive determined they should not be so easily foiled. An assembly man, of the name of Isaac Swaize, was found base enough to swear, that Mr. Gourlay had not been a resident of the province for six months, and was a seditious person. He thus came under the ban of a statute, passed in 1804, levelled against foreigners, and was served with an order, on the 21st of December, to quit the country before the new year. He disobeyed this order; was arrested, and incarcerated in Niagara jail, to the great indignation of his friends, still very numerous. By a writ of habeas corpus, he was brought before Chief-Justice Powell, at Toronto, in February; but the latter refused to give him his liberty by bail, and remanded him to prison.\n\n\"In June, the Legislature again assembled. In his opening speech, the governor stated he had received instructions from the Crown, to grant lands to the militia; but that he would take the responsibility on himself of refusing them to the members of the recent convention. It was anxiously expected that the Assembly would evince its disapprobation of this part of the address. After a long debate it was endorsed by the casting vote of the Speaker, and the Upper House concurred in language the most direct and submissive.\n\n\"This conduct afforded a fresh grievance-text to Mr. Gourlay, and he hurled anathemas from his cell against the executive, through the columns of the Niagara Spectator. This led to his being refused every indulgence, for some time, till his health completely failed. His long confinement, there being only one gaol delivery in the year, had almost rendered him insane; and, when brought to trial at the Niagara Court of Queen's Bench, he was nearly unconscious of the entire proceedings. He was indicted for merely refusing to obey the order to quit the province, which the act already alluded to made a misdemeanor, and not for sedition; was found guilty, as a matter of course, and compelled to retire immediately into the United States, whence he shortly afterwards proceeded to England\u2020\n\n*This law was repealed two years afterwards, Chief-Justice Robinson alone voted against its repeal.\n\u2020Mr. Gourlay published his work on Canada in 1822. It contains a large\n\"Such was the termination of Mr. Gourlay's connection with Canada. Whatever may have been his faults or his follies, he meant well at all events; and, at the present day, there can be only one opinion of the treatment he met with; to wit, that it was most unjust, unconstitutional, and despotic, and reflects indelible disgrace on the public men who gave it the sanction of their authority. The people of Canada have reason to thank Providence such an occurrence cannot again disgrace their country, and, that the sway of the oligarchy, who permitted it, has long since passed away, never to return.\"\n\nMr. Gourlay married, only a few years since, (about 1858), a lady belonging to Woodstock, C. W., where he was then residing, he being then some seventy odd years of age. He lives now, in Edinburgh, Scotland.\n\n---\n\n**EARL OF DALHOUSIE, G.C.B.**\n\nGeneral George, Earl of Dalhousie, one of the governor generals of Canada, was the ninth earl of that ancient and time honored house; he was born in 1770, and succeeded to the title and estate on the death of his father in November, 1787. In the month of July, of the same year, he entered the army, having purchased a cornetcy in the 3rd Dragoon Guards, from which he was promoted to the rank of captain by raising, as was not uncommon at that day, an independent company, commanded by himself. In 1791, his lordship was appointed to a company in the 2nd battalion Royals, and immediately joined the corps, then doing duty at Gibraltar; his promotion to the rank of major quickly followed, and in 1792 was obtained, by purchase, in the 2nd Foot, with which he proceeded in command to Martinique; and in August, 1794, succeeded to the lieutenant-colonelcy of the regiment. In the following year he returned to England, having been severely wounded in one of the numerous sanguinary affairs which\n\namount of very useful matter touching this province; but the bad arrangement renders it less valuable than it should be. In 1822, he became temporarily insane. Mr. Gourlay was in Canada a few years since, but returned back again to Scotland. While in prison in Canada, he proposed a tax on wild land, as a check to speculators\u2014a plan soon after carried into effect, and advocated the improvement of the navigation of the St. Lawrence. Vide *Niagara Spectator*, 24th June, 1819.\n\nIn England, he was subsequently imprisoned, on the ground of insanity, for striking Lord Brougham in the lobby of the House of Commons.\ntook place between the British forces and the French republican troops and brigands in that island. In 1798, his lordship served in Ireland, then in a state of rebellion; and in 1799, embarked on the expedition to the Helder, and was present in all the actions of that campaign. His lordship received the brevet of colonel in January, 1800, his services during that year were first under General Maitland before Belleisle, whence he joined the force under Sir Ralph Abercrombie, at Minorca, and proceeded with that army to Egypt; where he participated in the actions of the 8th and 21st March. On this expedition his lordship commanded the detachment sent against the forts of Aboukir and Rosetta, whence he advanced to Cairo. In 1802, the Earl of Dalhousie was again in garrison at Gibraltar, and in the following year was appointed brigadier-general on the staff in Scotland. He remained in this situation till April, 1805, when he was included in the promotion that took place on the 25th of that month, as major-general.\n\nHis lordship now remained at home for some time, and in this year he married Christian, only daughter, and sole heiress of Charles Brown, Esquire, of Coalston, Mid-Lothian. During this interval of repose from his professional labors, Lord Dalhousie attended to the superintendence of his family estate, which by judicious management he greatly improved; for though he entered the army at an early age, and was, as has been shown, almost constantly engaged in active service, he had not neglected to study more peaceful arts, and was esteemed a scientific and successful agriculturist amongst the best of farmers. His fondness, indeed, for agricultural pursuits never forsook him, and it was familiarly said that his lordship was most judicious in his view of ground whether he looked at it as a farmer or a general.\n\nIn 1809, he was appointed to the staff in England, where he remained for a short period, when he accompanied the expedition to the Scheldt; was first with the reserve under Sir John Hope, and afterwards in command at Flushing. On the termination of that ill-fated expedition, in which as fine and well appointed an army as ever left England, was almost annihilated by the unhealthiness of the climate, Lord Dalhousie was appointed to the staff of the army on the Peninsula, where he greatly distinguished himself in several of the most important actions; and was mentioned with honor by the Duke of Wellington, particularly for his conduct at Vittoria, and in the battles of the Pyrenees. He received also the repeated thanks of both houses of Parliament for his distinguished services, particularly at Waterloo, and obtained a medal and a clasp for these battles. At Toulouse, Lord Dalhousie again rendered conspicuous services, and near St. Andrew de Cuhzac, drove the French general, L'Huillier, so hard, that upwards of three hundred prisoners fell into the hands of the seventh division commanded by his lordship.\nThis brief record of some of the military services rendered to his country by the noble and gallant earl, is principally drawn from the Royal Military Calendar.\n\nWhen the army entered France, Lord Dalhousie commanded at Bourdeaux, where the strict discipline he maintained amongst the troops, flushed as they were by hard won victories, and the protection he afforded to the inhabitants, rendered him justly popular. The authorities of that city, touched by his noble conduct, presented his lordship with a handsome gold-mounted sword, having on the guard a suitable inscription, in token of their gratitude for his generous conduct towards them.\n\nOn the 18th July, his lordship was created an English baron; he had before sat in the Lords as one of the representative peers of Scotland. In 1816, he was appointed lieutenant-general commanding in Nova Scotia, whence, on the unfortunate death of Charles, Duke of Richmond, his lordship was preferred to the rank of governor-in-chief, and commander of the forces of British North America, but did not arrive in Canada and assume the government until 1820. He retained this high station\u2014with the exception of an interval of about fifteen months, during which his lordship was absent on leave, in England\u2014till 1828.\n\nOf the political events of his government, or the correctness of his views, it is not here necessary to speak\u2014they forming such a conspicuous part of the history of Canada. It is sufficient to observe that the concessionary and conciliatory policy pursued by the successors of this noble and venerated peer, far from producing the harmony which it was fondly but inconsiderately hoped would arise from the indulgence shown by the mother country towards the dissatisfied in the colony of Lower Canada, led to a crisis which would, in all human probability, have been avoided had his successors in office been instructed to pursue the manly and energetic steps of this honest and high-minded governor.\n\nOn his return from Canada after a short interval, Lord Dalhousie was appointed commander-in-chief in the East Indies, in which important command, the highest in rank of all military commands in the colonies, he rendered himself generally beloved and respected. Unhappily his health was much impaired, and he returned to his native land, not to enjoy repose after his long and varied services, but to wear out the remainder of a life, whose best days had been devoted to his country, with a shattered constitution and frequent and severe suffering, from which at length, it pleased the Almighty to release him in the sixty-eighth year of his age, after a noble, honorable and useful career, worthy his high rank and illustrious ancestry. His death took place at his seat, Dalhousie Castle, Scotland, on the 21st March, 1838.\n\nIn his politics, the Earl of Dalhousie was through life a staunch conservative, but was not so bigoted in his political opinions as to\nallow them to interfere with his private friendships; he remained on terms of intimacy with those who took a prominent part with the party to which his lordship was constantly and conscientiously opposed. In private life the lamented earl was a warm friend and a kind patron, and though his fortune was by no means large, yet by a system of liberal economy he was always enabled to indulge his beneficent propensities in donations and subscriptions to works of public improvement\u2014to institutions for the relief of his suffering fellow creatures, and in acts of private charity; to these his lordship was always found a cheerful contributor.\n\nThe Earl of Dalhousie was a general in the army, and colonel of the 26th Regiment of Foot. He was also captain-general of the Royal Company of Archers or Queen's Body Guard of Scotland, and was governor of the Royal Bank of that kingdom, in which no nobleman enjoyed a higher degree of estimation amongst his countrymen of all classes. He was succeeded in his title and estates by James, Lord Ramsay, who was his lordship's youngest son, and who died in 1860. His elder brother, George Lord Ramsay, died after his return from India, where he had served in the 26th Regiment, and on the staff of his noble father, of a disease contracted in that climate. The second son, Charles, died at an early age.\n\nM. ABB\u00c9 LOUIS J. DESJARDINS.\n\nM. Desjardins, a native of Beaugency in France, and brother of the late Abb\u00e9 Desjardins, the archdeacon of Ste. Genevi\u00e8ve of Paris, was one of the numerous victims who were forced by the French revolution to seek an asylum on foreign shores. He and his companions narrowly escaped the blow of the republican axe: the instrument destined to perform his execution, being sharpened under his eyes.\n\nWearied of awaiting in England the termination of the storms which afflicted his country, M. Desjardins determined to come to Canada, where he arrived in 1794, and where the last fifty-four years of his life glided away; first as vicar to the curacy of Quebec; afterwards as missionary at Carleton, in Chaleurs Bay, and among the Micmac Indians of Ristigouche, whose language he acquired. He then removed to Quebec, where he supplied the place of his Grace the late Bishop Plessis, in the duties of his curacy; and in the capacity of chaplain to the ladies of the Hotel Dieu, till the year 1836.\nBy reason of his constantly increasing infirmities, M. Desjardins was forced at this period to renounce his employment. His retirement, sanctified by the meditation of eternal years, shed new lustre on the virtues of this excellent ecclesiastic; especially his noble devotion in the sufferings which accompanied him to the tomb. He died in 1848.\n\nM. l'Abb\u00e9 Desjardins always knew how to honor the sacred functions of the ministry, by imposing gravity, great regularity of life, and a zeal which the frosts of age could not cool. He knew too, in the different stations of life, how to conquer by the goodness of his heart, and the suavity of his manners, the esteem and benevolence of all classes of society.\n\nA calm death, because without remorse\u2014the death of the just\u2014crowned a long life and an honorable career.\n\n---\n\nHON. CHRISTOPHER WIDMER, M.D., M.L.C.\n\nThis gentleman was a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, and formerly staff surgeon attached to the Fourteenth Light Dragoons. He served through nearly the whole of the Peninsular campaign, and held the medal with five clasps:\u2014viz., for Vittoria, Salamanca, Fuentes d'Onoro, Busaco, and Talavera. He came to Canada during the late American war, and resided here from that time until his death, which occurred on the 2nd May, 1858.\n\nAs a member of the Legislative Council, Dr. Widmer secured the esteem of his fellow-legislators, by a quiet and gentlemanly performance of the duties appertaining to his position. He was appointed a member of the Council on the 15th of August, 1848, under a writ of summons from the crown. Although he never prominently came forward as the advocate of great measures, he was always regarded in the council chamber with unfeigned respect, and by the public with a degree of confidence warranted by his integrity. A feeling tribute to his worth was paid by the Honorable John Ross, in the Council, on the day that his death was announced, and that body adjourned as a mark of respect to their deceased colleague.\n\nDr. Widmer was one of the oldest inhabitants of the city of Toronto, and was always prominent in the advocacy of measures calculated to ensure a just administration of its local affairs. He died within a few days of his 78th year, and was in the full exercise\nof his faculties up to the night preceding his death. As a medical man, few men have been more ardently devoted to the profession he adorned. His general affability and friendly disposition secured for him the sincere regard of the younger members of the profession; whilst his long tried skill secured him the highest position in the estimation of all classes of the community.\n\n---\n\nHON. MR. CHIEF-JUSTICE REID.\n\nThe Honorable James Reid filled the judicial office of one of the judges of the Court of Queen's Bench, Lower Canada, for a period of thirty-three years; fifteen of which, he presided as chief-justice, and his administration of its functions during that long period shed a lustre alike upon the tribunal and the judge.\n\nMr. Reid was admitted to the bar in the year 1794, after a professional career marked by untiring industry and honorable conduct; he was, in May, 1807, raised to the bench, as one of the puisn\u00e9 judges, the duties of which he performed with unsullied dignity, as an upright, impartial, and laborious judge.\n\nIn the year, 1823, he was elevated to the office of chief-justice, and presided as such on the bench, until the year 1838, when the weight of declining years warned him to seek that repose which befitted his advanced age, and to enjoy the leisure to which by a long and laborious life, he had become honorably entitled, and he resigned his office. In the discharge of his judicial labors, he was admired for his integrity, firmness, and unconquerable industry. After relinquishing office, Mr. Reid and his family visited Europe, and while in England, the honor of knighthood was offered to him as a mark of the royal approbation of his long and valuable services; but a long life of public service, and a conscientious and faithful discharge of public duty, had secured to him the esteem of his fellow-citizens, and conferred upon him a rank beyond the records of the Herald's office, or the fugitive honors of a title, and he declined accepting it.\n\nAs a judge, no man ever possessed more general respect and public confidence during his judicial career, and well did he deserve it; for no man ever devoted himself more conscientiously, with more scrupulous fidelity and zeal to the discharge of public duties. His judgments were admirable for perspicuity of state-\nment, conciseness and clearness* without being eloquent, in manner they had the full effect of the best eloquence. He possessed a patience which no prolixity could exhaust, an equanimity which nothing could distract. He had much moderation, united with great firmness. His integrity was inflexible; his principles uncompromising.\n\nHis professional learning was extensive. It was the judicial accumulation of fifty years steady devotion to the science, as well as practice of jurisprudence. Mr. Reid always entertained the loftiest notions of the dignity and utility of the profession, and (while sitting on the bench) endeavored on all occasions, to diffuse among the members of the bar, a deep sense of its importance and responsibility.\n\nHis public life was marked by a most consistent and uniform course. Amidst the frenzy of party spirit and political controversies, which unhappily often agitated the public mind during his official life, he always stood with a steady inflexibility. To no court did he ever truckle; to no party did he ever bend. In private life he was benevolent, charitable, kind, and hospitable. His virtue was stern and inflexible, adjusted, indeed, rather to the vigorous standard of ancient morality, than the less elevated maxims of the modern code. Full of years and honors, he left behind him an example which many of his profession may endeavor to imitate, but very few can hope to excel.\n\nLIEUT.-COLONEL BY, R.E.\n\nSome notice of this celebrated officer, with whose name is connected, some of the greatest engineering works in the province, and the founding of what is now known as the flourishing city of Ottawa, soon to be the capital of Canada, may prove interesting to a majority of our readers.\n\nFrom the meagre materials at our disposal, we learn that Colonel By was born about the year 1780. His father held a subordinate capacity in the household of George III.; and it was through his influence, that his son was appointed to the honorable corps, in which he afterwards so distinguished himself. He first came to Canada in the year 1800, when a lieutenant, under the command of Captain, subsequently General Nicoll, R.E.; and shortly after\n\n*See the case of Joseph Fisher, in the American Jurist, p. 297.\nhis arrival, was entrusted with the construction of the boat canal, at the Cascades above Montreal, which he successfully accomplished. On his completing this undertaking, he returned to Quebec, and superintended the building of the four martello towers outside the walls of Quebec; and at this time he also got up the celebrated model of that city, which was conveyed to England, and submitted to the Duke of Wellington for inspection.\n\nIn 1811, Colonel By proceeded to England, soon after the departure of the governor, Sir James Craig; and again returned in 1826, for the express purpose of constructing the Rideau canal; a work, which the imperial government was resolved to carry out, so that in the event of another war with the Americans, there might be another route, besides the St. Lawrence, for the conveyance of stores and troops to Kingston, as this enterprise in 1812 was a work of no little difficulty and danger. From the \"Records of the Royal Engineers,\" London, we find that, excepting a partial survey made of the line of operations, by Captain Jebb, in 1815, the whole work entirely owes its origination and completion to the ingenuity and skill of By, who, overcoming all obstacles and difficulties, at last fairly accomplished what had been entrusted to him; and had the satisfaction of seeing one of the greatest works in the province fully carried out and set in operation. It was during the time that the Rideau was building, that the first huts were raised by him on the present site of what is now Ottawa city, which even unto this day is known as Bytown.\n\nBut some irregularities or mismanagement in the pecuniary affairs of the canal having arisen, and being attributed to him, in August 1832, he proceeded to England to vindicate his conduct; but there, instead of meeting with the reception which he merited, he received nothing but reproaches; and this treatment acting on a naturally weak constitution, finally caused his death. Many affirm that he really died of a broken heart, having looked forward to receiving some royal mark of favor or honor for his successful exertions in carrying out the great work which alone is a mighty evidence of his professional skill and assiduity.\n\nHe had married twice; his second wife was a lady of high connections, and one of his daughters married, we believe, Lord Ashburnham. All have now passed away, and the name of By is all that is left of one of whom it may be said, that he did his duty faithfully, and sacrificed himself to his zeal in the service of his sovereign.\nHON. AND RIGHT REV. CHAS. J. STEWART.\n\nThe name of this truly excellent and devoted servant of Christ in Canada, who succeeded the first Bishop Mountain in the see of Quebec, deserves the highest place that can be accorded to it in the annals of the Church of England, and in the hearts of the English people of this province.\n\nOften as we witness the wonderful efforts made by the ministry of the Church in its behalf and in the behalf of its people, we rarely, if ever, heard of a character of such self-sacrificing, devout, pious and holy principles, as those held by the late lamented Bishop of Quebec.\n\nBred as the son of the Earl of Galloway, in all the wealth and luxury that appertain to a scion of a noble house, brought up amidst all the temptations and hazards which beset the path of the young and noble, in their progress through college and the university, (and he might have aspired to the highest places in the many worldly employments held forth to the sons of the aristocratic families of England), he passed through the two first ordeals unscathed; and pure and spotless in character, through no worldly motives except to do good to his fellow creatures, he entered the ministry as a meek servant and instrument of God. With such purposes in view he came to this country, and endured direst privations as a missionary, passing from one place to another in the depth of winter, without perhaps, (in those days, many years ago), a prospect of a shelter for his head, or a bed for his wearied body; and, even when raised to the high and important office as head of the church of this province, when age and sickness had crept upon him, he continued in the good work, going from one place to another, never wearied, never heedful of his own health, but all intent on the welfare of his flock and people; until finally, a not very strong constitution was undermined, and death closed his earthly labors. Beyond doubt he has met with his reward, for seldom did mortal ever strive, work, suffer and endure more to the service of his Divine Master than did the zealous and upright Bishop Stewart.\n\nBishop Stewart was the fifth son of the Earl of Galloway, and was born on the 13th of April, 1775. He was educated at Galloway House, in Wigtonshire, Scotland, by a private tutor, until he was old enough to enter Oxford, and here he graduated as M.A., in 1799, and was afterwards ordained to the holy ministry. His first charge was that of Orton Longueville and Botolph Bridge, near Peterborough, where he remained for eight years; and shortly\nafterwards, having offered himself to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, he was appointed to the mission of St. Armand, in the Eastern Townships. Here there was not the semblance of a church; and the first service which he held, was performed in a room in the village inn. But he soon built a church at his own expense; and it might not be out of place here to mention that during the time he was in Canada, he spent the whole of his private fortune in the service of the church and in assisting the poor and distressed. He remained in the Eastern Townships until 1819, when he was appointed visiting missionary in the diocese of Quebec. During the time he remained in the Eastern Townships, he did much good to the cause he served; and promoted the erection of many churches in different parts of the country. In his new position, a wider field and a larger scope was opened for his exertions. The diocese then included the whole of Canada; and this extensive space of country had to be traversed by the valiant missionary in days when there did not exist any of the comforts and conveniences which characterize modern Canada. In 1817, he was honored with the degree of Doctor of Divinity, from Oxford.\n\nHe continued in his office of visiting missionary until the year 1825, when Bishop Mountain died, and Doctor Stewart was nominated to the vacant see. He accordingly proceeded to England; and, on 1st January, 1826, was consecrated Bishop of Quebec, in Lambeth Palace, by Archbishop Sutton, assisted by numerous high dignitaries of the church. In the following May, Bishop Stewart returned to Canada, and was installed in the Cathedral of Quebec. It were almost superfluous to proceed further in detailing his history; his course continued much the same all through his life. He was a most zealous servant and soldier of Christ, a noble disinterested being, endowed with rich qualities of heart and mind, and a mouth that spoke no guile. His death occurred on the 13th of July, 1837, at London, in England, whither he had proceeded through extreme ill-health; and he was buried in the family vault at Kensal Green. His decease occasioned deep and universal regret in Canada. We may say he spent the greater part of his lifetime in this country, and devoted it entirely to the service in which he was engaged. He made several visits to England, which were always destined for some good object in connexion with the church. To his indefatigable efforts in its behalf may be truly ascribed, to a considerable extent, its present high and important standing.\nHON. MR. JUSTICE WILLIS.\n\nJohn Walpole Willis, the subject of this brief notice, who, to the shame of the \"Family Compact\" party of Upper Canada, received such base and unprincipled treatment at their hands, for no reason but because he did his duty well, was an English lawyer of great legal ability and knowledge; and also a gentleman of much goodness and amiability of character. In October, 1827, he had been raised from the English bar to the bench of Upper Canada, as one of the puisn\u00e9 judges. In this high office he displayed great judgment, and an accurate acquaintance with his official duties, and was considered an honor to the bench (heretofore not in very high repute) not only for his talents and merits as a lawyer, but for his extremely excellent disposition, and for the manner in which he maintained the dignity and impartiality of the court, by refusing to take any part in the politics of the day, and by refusing to join himself to any party whatever. Such a man was not in favor with the omnipotent power that ruled the upper province; and a strong dislike was taken against him. To such a length was this mean inveteracy carried by the lieutenant-governor, Sir Peregrine Maitland, that on the first occasion he could get a plausible charge against him, he dismissed him from the bench. The alleged reason of this dismissal was, that Judge Willis, in the absence of his superior, and the other puisn\u00e9 judge, had refused to go on with the business of the court by himself at term time; a reason of so strong a nature that, on his appealing to the home government against Sir Peregrine Maitland's arbitrary and self-willed act, he was sustained in what he had done, and appointed to a judgeship at Demerara. We believe he died in England.\n\nREV. JAMES MAGRATH, M.A.\n\nThis celebrated divine was born in Ireland, in 1766. He graduated at Trinity college, Dublin, and was for many years rector of the township of Toronto, previously rector of Shankill, diocese of Leighlin, and formerly of Castlerea, Roscommon. Dur-\ning the Irish Rebellion, in 1798, he was curate of Killenvey, county of Roscommon, and in consequence of his exertions in discovering what was called the shocking conspiracy, the then secretary-of-state for Ireland authorised him to offer any reward he thought necessary, in order to procure further information regarding that treasonable design. As an acknowledgment of his well-timed and loyal services, Mr. Magrath was presented by the then lord-lieutenant of Ireland, Marquis Cornwallis, with the living of St. Kill, county of Kilkenny. He held commissions of the peace for seven counties, and was deputy-governor of the county of Roscommon. In May, 1827, Mr. Magrath arrived in Canada, and in the same year was preferred to the rectory of the Credit, which he held till the period of his decease, which took place on the 14th of June, 1851. In addition to the duties of St. Peter's church, he for many years officiated at Hurontario church, on the Centre Road. Mr. Magrath was the senior missionary, and the eldest clergyman in the diocese of Toronto. His family still remain in the province.\n\nLORD SEATON, G.C.B., G.C.H., G.C.M.G.\n\nIt must assuredly be a subject of pride and gratification to Canadians, that this great and illustrious man was for a lengthened period connected with this province, and governed its destinies in the most critical years of its existence; and we may confidently rely that a grateful and affectionate remembrance is retained of the brave old hero and conqueror, who encountered and overcame many dangers to preserve this valuable dependency to his royal mistress, and to the British nation. To Lord Seaton essentially belongs the credit, pride and honour of overcoming the rebellion of 1837-8. The biography of Sir John Colborne, a name by which he was best known here, seeing that it was while he possessed that plain designation, that he fought in our cause, and won the honors which he now so gallantly wears; the biography of this great man might be written in letters of gold.\n\nThe noble lord, we understand, is an Englishman by birth, and received his education at Winchester college. Being destined for the British army, as early as 1794, he entered the service as an ensign, but we are unable to learn in what corps. Those were the days of fierce and bloody warfare; and young Colborne had hard,\nly been in his regiment five years, before his ardent, brave and vigorous spirit for action was fully gratified. He was sent out to north Holland in the campaign of 1799, served in Egypt in 1801, and with the British and Russian troops employed on the Neapolitan frontier in 1805; also in Sicily and Calabria, in the campaign of 1806, and was present at the battle of Maida. Having obtained promotion for these services, he became, in the same year, military secretary to General Fox, commander of the forces in Sicily and the Mediterranean, and to the celebrated Sir John Moore, in Sicily, Sweden and Portugal; and in Spain in the campaign of 1808-9, and was present at the battle of Corunna. Constantly occupied, he joined the army of Lord Wellington in 1809 in Spain, at Jaracejo; and was sent to La Mancha to report on the operations of the Spanish armies, and was present at the battle of Oceana. He had now received the command of a regiment, being appointed to a lieutenant-colonelcy; and he commanded a brigade in Sir Rowland Hill's division in the campaigns of 1810-11, and was detached in command of the brigade to Castel Branco, to observe the movements of General Reynier's corps d'arm\u00e9e on the frontier of Portugal. At the battle of Busaco he commanded a brigade; and, also on the retreat to the Lines of Torres Vedras. With this brigade he occupied outside the Lines, the town of Alhandra, and the advanced posts near Villa-Franca, during the time the army was in this position, and afterwards when Massena retired from the front of the Lines. He crossed the Tagus, and had charge of the posts on that river opposite the French corps at the confluence of the Zezere, till the evacuation of Portugal by Massena. He commanded the advanced guard of infantry and cavalry, at the combat of Campo Mayor in Portugal; and was detached in command of a brigade and force of artillery and cavalry, with orders to drive back the French outposts during the siege of Badajos, in 1811. He also commanded a brigade at the battle of Albuhera. In 1812, on the investment of Ciudad Rodrigo, he commanded the force of the light division which stormed the redoubt of San Francisco, on the greater Teson, and the 52nd Light Infantry on the assault on the fortress and town; in this action he was seriously wounded. In 1813 he commanded the 2nd brigade of the light division, at the attack on the French position, and entrenched camp on the heights of Vera, at the battles of the Nivelle and the Nive, and during the operations of the campaign in the Basque Pyrenees. He led the attack of the 52nd Light Infantry, on Marshal Soult's position, at the battle of Orthes in 1814; also in the same year he commanded the 2nd brigade of the light division at the combats of Vic Bigorre and Tarbes, and the 52nd at the battle of Toulouse. After those gallant exploits, he was appointed colonel and Prince Regent's aide-de-camp, and military secretary to the Prince of Orange, commander-\nin-chief of the British forces in the Netherlands. In 1815, he was present at the memorable battle of Waterloo, in command of his old regiment the 52nd, and commanded a brigade on the march to Paris. This, we believe, was his last action on the continent of Europe. His course had been a brilliant one, and he was decked with the honors of a knight of the Tower and Sword of Portugal, of Maria Theresa of Austria, and of St. George of Russia.\n\nHe subsequently became lieutenant-governor of Guernsey; in 1825, he was appointed a major-general; and in 1829, he first came to Canada as lieutenant-governor of Upper Canada; which portion of his eventful life most concerns us; and therefore we will be more explicit in speaking of it, than of the other portions of his career. Sir John entered into the gubernatorial functions at an extremely distracted period, having succeeded Sir Peregrine Maitland, who was glad to leave the country and the discontents in it. The reform party was strong, and so was Mackenzie, who already had given evident signs of what ultimately he projected\u2014a rebellion; nevertheless, Sir John viewed all these things with a calm and steady attention, and supported the \"Family Compact Party,\" a portion of whom composed his ministry. He feared not the talk of the oppositionists\u2014he had often faced worse music than that. The course of action, which he deemed it his duty to pursue, produced among the reform ranks great discontent, which his refusal to liberate the libeller Collins heightened. Having overcome these difficulties, the general made a tour through Canada, and was the recipient of many warm and affectionate addresses from the inhabitants on his way. He continued to govern the upper province until 1835, when he solicited his recall, which was acceded to. During his administration were passed numerous measures of reform, &c. This epoch was also marked by the opening of the Welland and Rideau canals, the former the only direct route to the western lakes and states; by the passing of the act which made the judges independent of the Crown; by the origination of what is now called the great conservative party; and by the entrance into the political arena of Robert Baldwin. Sir John Colborne's successor, Sir Francis Bond Head, arrived in January, 1826; and Sir John was at New York, and about to sail for Europe, when he received a dispatch appointing him commander-in-chief of the forces in Canada. He consequently returned, and took up his quarters at Quebec, the capital of the lower province; and adopted such prompt measures for the defence of the country as the exigencies of the times demanded. On the breaking out of the rebellion he was fully prepared. Although not immediately successful in subduing Wolfred Nelson, he made ample amends by his heroic and judicious conduct in extinguishing the flame in all parts of the country, taking the field himself in person in several engagements, and marching on the rebels. In this wise Papineau was com-\npelled to retreat, as also was Wolfred Nelson and all others; and when Robert, his brother presented himself, he was totally routed by the able regular and militia forces under Colborne's command. On the recall of Lord Gosford, he was appointed temporarily governor-general of British North America, which high office he vacated on Lord Durham's arrival, and was appointed to it again on that nobleman's departure in 1838. Yet, notwithstanding these high official and arduous state duties, he contrived to do all the work appertaining to both offices, and was always successful in what he did. No one can too highly estimate his great services to this country. He has been condemned by some for executing the twelve rebels in Montreal; but we feel confident, that were such persons acquainted with the facts of the case, they would not blame the old veteran. Leniency had been too often extended to the fanatics who fancied they could conquer this fair province; they were condemned by a court martial, and there was no alternative, but for Sir John Colborne to carry its decision into effect. It was his duty, and like the great \"Iron Duke\" he never flinched from that. Sir John continued to administer the government until 1839, when he earnestly solicited his recall, so as to be enabled to repose from his great labors. The Honorable Charles Poulett Thompson was appointed his successor, and arrived at Quebec to relieve him of the cares and anxieties of government. On the 23rd October, Sir John sailed for England; but, previous to his departure, he received the most flattering addresses from the inhabitants, all of whom expressed a heartfelt regret at his leaving the country. On his arrival in England, new honors awaited him from a grateful sovereign and nation. In recognition of his eminent and distinguished services, he was created a baron of the United Kingdom as Lord Seaton; received the grand cross of the Bath, of Hanover, of St. Michael and of St. George; was created a privy councillor, and a pension of \u00a32,000 per annum was conferred upon him, and his two immediate successors, by act of parliament. In 1838, he was appointed lieutenant-general, and in 1854, general, as also colonel of the 2nd Life Guards. In 1860, he was raised to the highest rank and honor in the British service, that of a field-marshal.\n\nSince his connection with Canada, Lord Seaton held the high and important office of lord high commissioner of the Ionian Islands, and has been commander of the forces in Ireland, a post which he vacated some time since.\n\nLord Seaton married in 1814, the eldest daughter of James Yonge, Esq., of Puslinch, Devon, by whom he has a large family.\nHON. HENRY JOHN BOULTON.\n\nThe family of Boulton is one of the best in Upper Canada. According to Burke, it is descended from Henry Boulton, Esquire, of Moulton, in the county of Lincoln, England.\n\nThe father of the subject of this notice (Honorable D'Arcy Boulton) was solicitor and attorney-general, and afterwards one of the justices of the King's Bench in Upper Canada. He married Elizabeth, daughter and co-heiress of Mr. Sergeant James Forster, (sergeant-at-law) by Susannah his wife, daughter of Sir John Strange, master of the rolls, and settled at Toronto, Canada West.\n\nThe Honorable Henry J. Boulton was the second son by that marriage, and was born in 1790, in Little Holland house, Kensington, which his father rented of Lord Holland, and where his sister, Lady Mary Fox, afterwards resided for many years. He studied his professional course in its various branches in Lincoln's-Inn and the Middle Temple, of which latter society he is still a member, having been there called to the bar. He commenced practice in Upper Canada in Michaelmas term 1816, and was appointed solicitor-general about eighteen months afterwards. In 1829 he became attorney-general, and was elected to represent Niagara in the then ensuing parliament, of which the journals will best indicate his parliamentary career, which was always closely connected with the liberal school. When elected, although filling that high office, he nobly told his constituents from the hustings, that in his office he should steadfastly discharge the important duties devolving upon him in his official character; but in the house he should fearlessly represent their interest and those of the people, as if he held no such office under the crown. In following that course the then colonial secretary took offence at some of Mr. Boulton's votes; and the latter without being asked for any explanation, was one morning in May 1833, arbitrarily removed from office; and another gentleman was sent out from England to fill his place. We may be allowed to say that no opinion given by Mr. Boulton officially to the government, either as attorney or solicitor-general, was ever successfully impugned during a period of about fifteen years.\n\nIn consequence of his removal, Mr. Boulton thought it right to proceed to England to vindicate himself to the secretary of state, who was so satisfied of the injustice which had been done him, and although he could not restore him to the office he had disposed of, as his successor had sailed from Liverpool for Canada, and he was in no way answerable for the treatment which Mr. Boulton had received, yet at his first interview he said he would give Mr. Boulton anything then at his disposal.\nThe chief-justiceship of Newfoundland became vacant, with a salary of \u00a31200 sterling per annum, and Mr. Boulton being offered accepted it, and repaired thither in the autumn of 1838. He found everything connected with the administration of justice there in the utmost state of confusion. There was no regular system of procedure, no definite practice in the Supreme Court, although it possessed the powers of all the courts of law and equity in England, with admiralty jurisdiction as well. Having been well grounded in his profession as a student in London, and in a very successful practice in Canada, improved his knowledge of the law to fit him for the highest judicial position, he found no difficulty in correcting the abuses, which had prevailed in the island from the earliest times, when captains in the navy began to exercise jurisdiction there, which customs Mr. Boulton's immediate predecessor had failed to correct.\n\nAfter having administered the law for five years in Newfoundland, to the highest satisfaction of all the intelligent portion of the population, and even of the humblest suitor, he was again removed through the influence of Daniel O'Connell with a weak government, who required his support. It is true he was heard by a committee of the Privy Council, who most honorably acquitted him of every charge which had been brought against him, at the same time recommending that he should not return to Newfoundland on the ground of alleged indiscretion, but refusing to inform him of any one fact or circumstance constituting such indiscretion; and he has no more knowledge than the reader of the cause of his removal, except that O'Connell urged it at the instance of the Roman Catholic bishop.\n\nOn Mr. Boulton's return to Canada in 1838, he again represented Niagara, and subsequently the county of Norfolk in parliament, and took a very active part in the proceedings of the house. Some time since he retired altogether from public life, and now quietly resides at Holland house, Toronto.\n\nJOHN GALT, Esq.,\n\nA BRITISH author of some distinction, the friend of Byron, and other distinguished literary celebrities, and the father of the Honorable A. T. Galt, the celebrated minister of finance of Canada. He was born in Irvine, Ayrshire, Scotland, 2nd, May 1779, and\nafter spending some years in mercantile life, he began to study law at Lincoln's-Inn, London, but in 1809, set out on a tour of nearly three years in Southern Europe, and the Mediterranean, publishing the results of his observations on his return, in two books of travels. He sailed from Gibraltar to Malta, with Lord Byron and Mr. Hobhouse, and in the Levant, he strove to introduce British goods into the continent, by way of Turkey, in defiance of the Berlin and Milan decrees. He next produced a volume of dramatic pieces, which was followed by lives of Benjamin West and Cardinal Woolsey, a tragedy entitled the \"Appeal,\" acted in Edinburgh, for a few nights, and the \"Earthquake,\" a novel in three volumes. These works, written in the intervals of various commercial undertakings, made some impression upon the public; but his \"Ayrshire Legatees,\" which appeared in successive numbers of \"Blackwood's Magazine,\" in 1820-21, unexpectedly turned the whole popular tide in his favor. Within the next three years appeared the \"Annals of the Parish,\" generally esteemed his best work, written ten or twelve years before, but then rejected by the publishers; the \"Provost,\" which he preferred; the \"Steamboat,\" \"Sir Andrew Wylie,\" the \"Gathering of the West,\" the \"Entail,\" \"Ringham Gilhaize, the \"Spaewife,\" \"Rothlan\" and the \"Last of the Lairds,\" all novels of Scottish life, and all eminently successful. The character of Leddy Grippyin in the \"Entail\" was a special favorite with Byron.\n\nIt was in 1826, that he came to Canada, as commissioner of the Canada Land Company, an association in which he took great interest, and used his best endeavors to advance; and it may be safely said, that to his indefatigable energy and ability, may be in part ascribed the present high position the company enjoys. Indeed we know of hardly any one who did so much for it as Mr. Galt. During his stay in Canada, he took a great interest in the upper province, and in colonizing and settling it; and the country is indebted to him for some of the best improvements both on land and water it possesses. He founded the town of Guelph, in the county of Wellington, Canada West; and the town of Galt, is named after him. But differences having arisen between him and the company, he resigned his position in its service, and returned to England in 1829, where shortly afterwards he took advantage of the insolvent debtors' act. He returned to his literary labors with renewed zest and energy, and during the remainder of his life, produced a number of works, principally novels and miscellanies, some of which range high in the estimation of literary men, and belong to what is called the \"standard\" series of English literature. The \"Life of Lord Byron,\" and the \"Autobiography of John Galt,\" (two volumes) appeared in 1833, and next year the \"Literary Life and Miscellanies of John Galt,\" (three volumes.) Among his novels, \"Laurie Todd,\" which appeared in 1830, depicting and relating his experiences in the new world, is\none of the best. \"The Southenan,\" \"Bogle Corbet,\" \"Stanley Buxton,\" the \"Member,\" the \"Radical,\" \"Eben Erskine,\" and the \"Lost Child,\" were received very favorably.\n\nHis decease occurred at Greenock, Scotland, on the 11th April, 1839. He died after fourteen strokes of paralysis, having dictated compositions long after losing the use of every limb. The facility with which he wrote is attested by the fact, that notwithstanding many years of his life were surrendered to business pursuits, he published forty-four works, of which twenty-four were novels, many in three volumes.\n\nHe was a most estimable gentleman, and liked by all that ever came in contact with him; his conversation rich, sparkling and witty, made him generally admired, and a favorite in every circle. His business capacities were great, and he had formed some of the grandest schemes in matters of trade and commerce, appertaining to England, that was ever known.\n\nRIGHT HON. SIR JAMES KEMPT, G.C.B.\n\nSir James Kempt was born at Edinburgh, in 1765. He was the son of Gavin Kempt, Esq., of that city, and of Botley Hill, near Southampton, by a daughter of Alexander Walker, Esq., of Edinburgh. He entered the army as ensign in the 101st Foot, March 31, 1783; was promoted to lieutenant on the 18th August, 1784, and placed on half-pay at the reduction of the regiment in the same year. On the 30th May, 1794, he was appointed captain in the 118th Foot, which regiment he assisted in raising, and served with it in Ireland; and on the 18th September, in the same year, he was promoted to be major of that corps. From June, 1796, to February, 1797, he served as inspecting field-officer of the recruiting service in Scotland; and at the close of that period he was appointed aide-de-camp to General Sir Ralph Abercrombie, then commanding the forces in that country. In the same year he accompanied Sir Ralph on the expedition to Holland, where he was present in several actions, and returning with the despatches announcing the victory at the Helder, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-colonel August 28, 1799. In June, 1800, he accompanied Sir Ralph to the Mediterranean, as military secretary, as well as aide-de-camp, and he continued with him until his death at Alexandria. He then served in the same situation with his\nsuccessor, Lord Hutchinson, and was present in all the battles in Egypt, and at the capture of Cairo and Alexandria.\n\nIn April, 1803, he was appointed aide-de-camp to Sir David Dundas; on the 9th July following to a majority in the 66th; and on the 23rd of the same month, to a lieutenant-colonelcy in the 81st.\n\nIn 1805, he embarked with his regiment at Plymouth, and went to the Mediterranean, under Sir James Craig. In the expedition to Naples, he commanded a battalion of light infantry. In 1806 he went to Calabria, and commanded the light brigade at the battle of Maida.\n\nIn November, 1807, he was appointed quarter-master-general of the forces in North America.\n\nOn the 8th March, 1809, he was appointed aide-de-camp to the king, with the rank of colonel.\n\nOn the 4th November, 1811, he received the local rank of major-general in Spain and Portugal. At the siege of Badajos, he commanded the attack on Fort Picurina, and the brigade which led the attack and carried the castle of Badajos by escalade, when he was severely wounded. He commanded a brigade in the light division at Vittoria, the attack on the heights of Vera, at Nivelle, Nive, Orthes, Toulouse, and in several other minor engagements.\n\nHe attained the rank of major-general in the army, January 1, 1812. On the 4th November, 1813, he was appointed colonel commandant in the 60th foot. He subsequently served on the staff in America, and in Flanders, where he commanded the 8th British brigade in the 6th division, consisting of the 28th, 32nd, 79th, and 95th regiments. At the enlargement of the order of the Bath, in January, 1815, he was nominated a knight commander; and after the battle of Waterloo, in which he was severely wounded, he was promoted to be a grand cross, in the place of Sir Thomas Pieton, who was killed on the same glorious field. His services were also acknowledged by the allied sovereigns of Austria, Russia, and the Netherlands, by their respective orders of Maria Theresa, St. George of the third class, and Wilhelm of the third class. He was nominated a grand cross of the Hanoverian Guelphic order in 1816.\n\nSir James Kempt was next appointed lieutenant-governor of Fort William; from which he was removed to act in the like capacity at Portsmouth, on the 12th August, 1819. On the 12th July in the same year he was moved to the command of the 81st Foot. In 1820 he succeeded the Earl of Dalhousie as governor of Nova Scotia; and on the 10th July, 1828, he followed the same nobleman in the government of Canada, which he held for more than two years. When he arrived at Quebec, he found the country in a state bordering on rebellion. The legislature and executive being in direct opposition to each other; but after he had held the government for two months, these feuds subsided, and he left it in\nperfect tranquillity, and to the regret of all. On his departure he was presented with complimentary addresses by all the public bodies.\n\nImmediately on his return to England from Canada, Sir James Kempt was appointed master-general of the ordnance, on the 30th November, 1830; the office of lieutenant-general of the ordnance being thereupon abolished. On this occasion he was sworn in a privy councillor; and he continued master-general until December, 1834.\n\nSir James Kempt attained the rank of lieutenant-general in the army on the 27th May, 1825; and the full rank of general on the 23rd November, 1841. He was removed to the colonelcy of the 40th Foot on the 8th January, 1829; to that of the 2nd Foot on the 23rd December, 1834; and to that of the 1st Royals on the 7th August, 1846.\n\nHe died at London, England, on the 20th December, 1855.\n\n---\n\nHon. J. H. Dunn.\n\nMr. Dunn came to this country in 1820, having been appointed receiver-general and a member of the Executive and Legislative Councils of Upper Canada, which offices he held until the union of the provinces. He died in London, England, on the 21st April, 1854.\n\n---\n\nHon. and Rev. Alex. McDonell, D.D.\n\nThe subject of our present memoir was born at Glen Urquhart, on the borders of Lochness, Scotland, in the 1769. He was of the family of Glengarry, and manifested, from his earliest years, that deep and abiding attachment to his countrymen for which he was, through life proverbial. The heroic highlanders, who had left the States during the revolutionary war, and who fought their way to the banks of the St. Lawrence\u2014enduring every conceivable\nhorror from hunger, thirst, weather, want of sleep, and fatigue\u2014settled in various parts of the frontier of Upper Canada, then a dense and unthreaded forest. They took up their abode on the Niagara frontier, on the Bay of Quinte, on the banks of the St. Lawrence, called the John-town District, and in the Eastern District, in the counties of Glengarry and Stormont. These virtuous royalists, having succeeded in their formidable undertaking, wrote to their suffering kindred at home; and many voluntarily joined them, on account of the statements which they were receiving from time to time. Between the years 1780 and 1790, consolidation of the small farms took place in the Highlands of Scotland to a great extent, causing incredible distress to the dispossessed tenants. Owing to the restrictions then existing to emigration, the virtuous bishop obtained occupation for these men, to the number of nearly a thousand, in the manufactories at Glasgow, accompanying them himself as their chaplain and guide. Not long after this, from the depressed state of trade, these men were thrown out of employment, and the bishop then gave proof of that innate and intense loyalty which he so often exerted in after-life. He obtained permission from the king to raise a Catholic regiment, to which he was appointed chaplain, and which was the first raised in the British dominions since the period of the reformation. In 1798, this regiment performed most efficient service in Ireland in the suppression of the rebellion: on the one hand, firmly maintaining the rights of the Crown; on the other, restraining the excesses of a fanatic yeomanry. By their combined loyalty, good feeling, and prudence, they succeeded in inducing the terrified inhabitants to return to their habitations and occupations; restoring harmony, tranquillity, and peace. During the short peace of Amiens, in 1802, this regiment was disbanded, and again were these intrepid highlanders once more reduced to want. It then occurred to the bishop how desirable it would be to obtain land for their settlement in Canada, where so many of their brethren had already secured their independence; accordingly, he made a representation to the premier, Lord Sidmouth, then Mr. Addington, who, feeling great admiration of these noble but suffering men, offered the most tempting conditions to induce them to go to Trinidad, just then ceded by Spain to the British Crown. The objection Mr. Addington had to their settlement in Canada, was the apprehension that the British government held that colony by a slender tie. Disregarding equally the apprehensions of Mr. Addington, as to the maintenance of the British sway in Canada, and the splendid offer of land, and slaves, &c., &c., in Trinidad, the bishop at once declined taking them to a colony with a climate so unsuited to the highlanders as that of Trinidad. Again and again did he urge the measure of emigration to Canada; and at length succeeded, in 1803, in obtaining for every one of the late Glengarry regiment who chose to go to\nCanada, a grant of 200 acres of land. Difficulties, discouragements, and impediments met him at every step; at length, during the years 1803 and 1804, he succeeded in his object, and planted on that soil a population who have become independent, and who have defended the British power against inward assault and outward aggression. The bishop by his perseverance succeeded in obtaining for his settlers patent deeds for 160,000 acres of land. When the United States declared war against Great Britain in 1811\u2014although the British government were fully occupied in Europe\u2014and the Americans vainly imagined that the conquest of Canada was most easy of execution; when, Dr. Eustis, the secretary of war of the United States, said: \"We can take the Canadas without soldiers; we have only to send officers into the provinces, and the people, (two-thirds of them American settlers,) disaffected towards their own government, will rally round our standard;\"\u2014and when Mr. Henry Clay said, \"It is quite absurd to suppose that we shall not succeed in our enterprise against the enemy's provinces. We have the Canadas as much under our command as Great Britain has the ocean; and the way to conquer her on the ocean, is to drive her from the land. I am not for stopping at Quebec, or anywhere else; but I would take the whole continent from them, and ask them no favors. Her fleets cannot rendezvous at Halifax as now; and having no place of resort in the north, cannot infest our coast as they have lately done. It is as easy to conquer them on land, as their whole navy would conquer ours on the ocean. We must take the continent from them: I wish never to see a peace till we do. God has given us the power and the means\u2014we are criminal if we do not use them. If we get the continent, she must allow us the freedom of the sea.\"\n\nEntertaining these principles, and acting on these convictions, Canada was invaded; the bishop, then Mr. McDonell, formed a Glengarry fencible regiment, which, with the two militia regiments raised in the eastern district, consisting principally of Scotchmen, were inspirited by the presence and counsel of the venerable subject of our memoir, who accompanied them to the field of action, and who, not only defended their own shores, but carried war into the enemy's country, and succeeded, after a desperate battle, in taking the important post of Ogdensburgh, with a quantity of artillery, ammunition and other stores. For these, and other eminent services, rendered to the government, Earl Bathurst, secretary of state to the colonies, suggested that Mr. McDonell, who was to be consecrated bishop, should be a diocesan bishop, and consented that his title should be that of Kingston, to which was also added a salary of \u00a3400, afterwards augmented to \u00a3600 per annum.\n\nThus was this virtuous ecclesiastic rewarded; first made the first Catholic chaplain since the reformation; secondly, received the thanks of the Prince Regent for his efficient services; and thirdly,\nconsecrated first diocesan Catholic bishop in the British dominions since the reformation. His consecration took place at Montreal, in 1826. By virtue of authority vested in him, he established a Highland Society in Upper Canada, and was elected president of it. Seeing the indispensable necessity of encouraging a large and systematic emigration from the Highlands, as a measure of relief to his suffering fellow-countrymen in Scotland, and, as a security and benefit to his fellow-countrymen in Canada; and, being also desirous of establishing a college for the domestic education of the priesthood in that province, and having some arrangements to make respecting the future government of his diocese, he went to England in 1839, with his nephew; having secured the assistance and co-operation of his friend and companion, Dr. Rolph of Ancester, in the promotion of a scheme of emigration. He arrived at Liverpool on the 1st of August, and having proceeded to London, where he remained on business a few weeks, he visited the romantic glens of his nativity and childhood; was present at the great northern meeting and cattle-show at Inverness, in October, and then crossed over to Ireland. Between Clonmell and Waterford he took a severe cold, which laid him up some weeks at Carlow and Clongowes Wood, and afterwards at Dublin. Having recovered sufficiently to pay a visit to that warm-hearted, excellent, and most hospitable nobleman, the late Earl Gosford, at his mansion, county Armagh, he was so recruited that he re-crossed to Scotland from Belfast, and was on his way to London, to concert measures for the promotion of emigration from the Highlands of Scotland.\n\nDr. Rolph having attended the great meeting of noblemen and proprietors at the Hopetown Room, Edinburgh, on January 10th, 1840, at which the measure was to be discussed. He reached the house of his former schoolfellow, the Rev. Mr. Reed, at Dumfries, on the 11th, intending to remain there a few days, to recruit before starting for London. Early on the morning of the 14th he awoke, expressed himself chilly, and immediately expired. He was in the eightieth year of his age. In every relation of life, as subject, prelate, relative, and friend, he was a model of everything valuable. To his sovereign he brought the warm and hearty homage of a sincere, enthusiastic, unconditional allegiance, and the most invincible, uncompromising loyalty; as prelate, he was kind, attentive, and devoted to the interests, welfare and happiness of his clergy; as a relative, his attachment was unbounded, and his death created an aching void to hundreds of sorrowing relatives, whom he counselled by his advice, assisted with his means, and protected by his influence; as a friend, he was sincere, enthusiastic, and unchanging in his attachments. Such, indeed, was the liberality of his views and the inexpressible benignity of disposition, that all creeds and classes united in admiration of his character, respect for him,\nand congregated together to bid him farewell, as he left the shores of the St. Lawrence, on that voyage which proved but the prelude to that long and last one, from which there is no return.\n\nEARL OF SELKIRK.\n\nThe Right Honorable Thomas, Earl of Selkirk, Lord Lieutenant of the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright, born in 1774, died at Pau, in the South of France, where he was buried on the 8th of April, 1820. He was the youngest of five sons (all of whom attained to manhood) of Dunbar, 4th Earl of Selkirk, who died in 1799. In the latter end of 1807, he married Jane, daughter of James Wedderburn Colville, Esquire, by whom he left one son, who became Earl of Selkirk, born in 1809, and two daughters. Her ladyship accompanied the earl to North America, and afterwards to France, and continued with painful and unwearied assiduity to administer, till the last hour of his life, those kind and soothing attentions which wealth can neither purchase nor reward.\n\nFew men were possessed of higher powers of mind, or capable of applying them with more indefatigable perseverance. His \"Treatise on Emigration\" has long been considered as a standard work, and as having exhausted one of the most difficult subjects in the science of political economy. His lordship was also advantageously known to the public as the author of some other literary productions, all of them remarkable for the enlargement and liberality of their views, the luminous perspicuity of their statements, and that severe and patient spirit of induction which delights in the pursuit, and is generally successful in the discovery of truth.\n\nHis gentle and condescending manners wound themselves round the hearts of those admitted to his society, and conciliated an attachment which every fresh interview served to confirm. With those connected with him by the ties of kindred, and the sweet relations of domestic society, his lordship lived in terms of the most affectionate endeavoured. Indeed, seldom had there existed a family, the members of which were more tenderly attached to each other than that of which his lordship was the head; and few families experienced a more severe succession of those trials, by which the Almighty chastens the hearts and disciplines the virtues of his creatures.\n\nHis lordship was eminently exemplary in the discharge of every\nsocial and private duty. He was a considerate and indulgent landlord, a kind and gracious master; to the poor a generous benefactor, and of every public improvement a judicious and liberal patron.\n\nThe latter years of the life of this true nobleman were employed in the establishment of an extensive colony in the western parts of Canada which has since risen to the important settlements of Red River, &c. In the prosecution of this favorite object, he had encountered obstacles of the most unexpected and formidable character. With these, however, he was admirably qualified to contend; as, to the counsels of an enlightened philosophy, and an immovable firmness of purpose, he added the most complete habits of business and a perfect knowledge of affairs. The obstructions he met with served only to stimulate him to increased exertion, and after an arduous struggle with a powerful confederacy, which had arrayed itself against him, and which would long ere his death have subdued any other adversary, he had the satisfaction to know, that he had finally succeeded in founding an industrious and thriving community. It has now struck deep root in the soil; and is competent, from its own internal resources, to perpetuate itself, and to extend the blessings of civilization to those remote and boundless regions.\n\nHis lordship, besides his work on emigration, published a pamphlet on the Scottish Peerage, and the following tracts:\u2014\u201cSpeech in the House of Lords, August 10, 1807, on the defence of the Country,\u201d 8vo; \u201cObservations on the present state of the Highlands,\u201d 8vo, 1805, 2nd edit. 1806; \u201cOn the necessity of a more effectual system of national defence,\u201d 8vo. 1808; \u201cA letter to John Cartwright, Esquire, on parliamentary reform,\u201d 8vo.\n\n---\n\nMAJOR-GENERAL DUNN.\n\nMajor-General William Dunn, a son of the late Honorable Thomas Dunn, of Lower Canada, and a native Canadian.\n\nHe entered the army on the 22nd December, 1803, and by 1857, had risen to the rank he holds, when he retired upon full pay, and resides in England. He has seen a great deal of active and arduous service, beginning in 1805, he served the campaign in Italy; battle of Maida, and capture of Scylla Castle, in 1806, expedition to Egypt, in 1807, including the attack on Alexandria and Rosetta, and battle of El Hamet, where he was taken prisoner, but soon\nafter being exchanged, he took part in the defence of Scylla Castle, in 1808. He went through the Peninsula campaigns of 1810-11, including the operations before Ciudad Rodrigo, operations between the Agnada and Almeida, battles of the Coa, Buasco, and Albuhera, and the actions at Usagre, and Aldes de Ponte, at which last he was severely wounded in the groin, by a musket ball, which remains unextracted. Major-General Dunn, also served in 1814 in his native country during the American war, including the taking of Moose Island, and occupation of Castine. He has the war medal, with three clasps, for Maida, Buasco, and Albuhera.\n\nCOMMANDER ALLEYN, R.N.\n\nRichard Israel Alleyn, father of the Hon. Charles Alleyn, provincial secretary, (a notice of whom appears in this book, and which see for lineage of family, &c.), is a native of Ireland, having been born in the county Cork, in the year 1782. He entered the navy, in October, 1795, as first class volunteer, on board the Marlborough, seventy-four, Captains Henry Nichols, and Joseph Ellison, on the channel station, where, and in the Mediterranean and West Indies, he afterwards served, as midshipman in the Boadicea, thirty-eight, Captain Richard Goodwin Heate; Cormorant twenty-four, Captain Honorable Courtney Boyle; Haerlem, and Africaine, both commanded by Captain George Buriton; Tezel, sixty-four, Captain Richard Incledon; and Temeraire, ninety-eight, flag-ship of Rear-Admiral George Campbell; and the Speedy, commanded by Lord Cechrane. While in the Cormorant, he was wrecked, we believe, off Damietta, on the Egyptian coast, 20th May, 1800. On 23rd June, 1802, he became acting-lieutenant of the Syren frigate, Captain John Wentworth Loring; and, on the paying off of that vessel, was confirmed, by commission, dated 18th October, in the same year. His subsequent appointments were, on the Home and North American stations, to L'Egyptienne, forty-four, Captains Hon. Charles Elphinstone Fleeming, and Hon. Charles Paget; Crescent, thirty-six, Captain James Carthen; Endymion, forty, Captains Hon. Thomas Bladen Capel, and Sir William Bolton; Abercromby, seventy-four, Captain William Charles Fahie; the Endymion and Hotspur, thirty-six, Captain Hon. Josceline Percy. Mr. Alleyn was in Sir R. Calder's action, off Cape Finisterre in July 1806. He served for several years as first-lieutenant, previously to which, on the evening of 8th March, 1806, he had com-\nmanded the boats of *L'Egyptienne*, in conjunction with Lieutenant Philip Cosby Handfield, at the cutting out, under an incessant fire from two batteries, of the French frigate-built privateer *L'Alcide*, pierced for thirty-four guns, and moored to the beach, in the harbor of Muros, in Spain. Having been unemployed since June, 1814, at which period he invalided from the *Hotspur*, Mr. Alleyn accepted the rank he now holds, 20th April, 1835.\n\nHe is deputy master of the Trinity House, Quebec, and is the representative of Edward Alleyn, founder of Dulurch College.\n\n---\n\n**Hon. JACOB \u00c6MILIUS IRVING, M.L.C.**\n\nA member of the Legislative Council of this province. Mr. Irving was born at Charleston, South Carolina, on the 29th January, 1797. He was the eldest son of Jacob \u00c6milius Irving, Esquire, of Ironshore, Jamaica, and of Liverpool, who was the nephew of the Colonel P. \u00c6. Irving, mentioned elsewhere.\n\nHe entered the 13th Light Dragoons at an early age, and served with that regiment through the Waterloo campaign, having been wounded in the action of the 18th of June, 1815. On his return to England, he was presented with the freedom of the town of Liverpool, for gallant conduct and services during the war.\n\nOn the 10th December, 1821, he married Catherine Diana, daughter of Sir Jere Homfray of Landaff House, Glamorganshire, by whom (who died 23rd January, 1858) he left issue a family, one of whom is \u00c6. Irving, Esq., barrister-at-law, of Hamilton, C. W.\n\nIn 1834, he emigrated to Upper Canada, and, in 1837, aided in suppressing the rebellion on the Niagara frontier. Upon the introduction of the municipal system, when the office of warden was an appointment by the Crown, he was selected as first warden for the district of Simcoe.\n\nIn 1848, he was called to the Legislative Council, and as a prominent member of the liberal party, warmly supported the Baldwin-Lafontaine party, in their struggle with Lord Metcalfe. He died at the Falls of Niagara, on the 7th October, 1856.\nHON. COLONEL WELLS.\n\nLieutenant-Colonel Joseph Wells; born in 1757; died at Davenport, near Toronto, C. W., in 1863. He entered the army in January, 1798, by purchase, in the Scotch Brigade. In March following, he was promoted to a lieutenancy in the 43rd, joined them in the West Indies in 1800, and on their return home, was appointed adjutant. In 1804 he purchased his company; he obtained, in 1811, his majority, and in 1814, a lieutenant-colonelcy. In 1815, consequent on all second battalions being about to be reduced, he exchanged with Lieutenant-Colonel Pearson, as inspecting field officer in Canada, but, to his great mortification, six months afterwards, was placed on half pay. He held a seat in the Legislative Council, previous to the union.\n\nCAPTAIN ECCLES.\n\nCaptain Eccles resided in Toronto for many years, and was highly esteemed by all who knew him, as an upright and independent citizen and a warm hearted friend. Captain Eccles was born in 1776, and entered the army in 1802 as ensign in the 61st Regiment. He was with Wellington through the entire Peninsular campaign, and losing his arm in the battlefield, he retired on his hard-earned laurels, and settled down in Wales, where he married. In 1830, Captain Eccles removed to Somersetshire, near the city of Bath, and in 1835 emigrated with his family to Canada; he resided in Niagara from 1835 to 1841, when he removed to the city of Toronto.\n\nCaptain Eccles took an active interest in political matters, on the liberal side. In the great reform bill movement of 1832, he was chairman of Mr. Brigstock's election committee in the famous contest for Somersetshire, when his candidate was triumphantly returned. In \"the troubles of 1837,\" he commanded a regiment of volunteers, on the Niagara frontier, on the \"loyal side.\" On the arrival of Lord Durham in Canada, Captain Eccles was sent for and consulted as to the most fitting measures of redress, and we\nbelieve he contributed largely to the material of Lord Durham's famous report. In the various parliamentary elections for Toronto, Captain Eccles took an active share, and his great age did not prevent his being chairman of Mr. Brown's committee in the well contested election between that gentleman and the Honorable J. H. Cameron, Q. C., in 1858. He was also chairman and spokesman of the committee of citizens who, a few weeks previous to his death, presented an address to the governor-general, Sir E. W. Head, signed by nearly 4,000 of the people of Toronto, praying for a change of ministry, and his eloquent speech on the occasion will be long remembered. His death occurred late in the year of 1858.\n\nCaptain Eccles left a widow and a numerous family, among whom are Mr. Henry Eccles, the eminent Queen's counsel, and Mr. William Eccles, barrister, of St. Catharines.\n\n---\n\nHON. JAMES BABY.\n\nJames Baby was born at Detroit, in 1762. His family is one of the most ancient in the colony, and it is noble. His father had removed from Lower Canada to the neighborhood of Detroit before the conquest of Quebec, where in addition to the cultivation of lands, he was connected with the fur trade, at that time and for many years after, the great staple of the country. James was educated at the Roman Catholic Seminary at Quebec, and returned to the paternal roof soon after the peace of 1783. The family had ever been distinguished (and indeed, all the higher French families) for their adherence to the British Crown; and to this more than any other cause, are we to attribute the conduct of the province of Quebec during the American war. Being a great favorite with his father, James was permitted to make an excursion to Europe, before engaging steadily in business; and after spending some time, principally in England, he rejoined his family. Unfortunately, the limits assigned by treaty to the United States, embraced within it the larger portion of his father's property; and the family attachment to the British government being well known, they were looked upon with little favor by the American population; and found it necessary, after much loss and disappointment, to remove to the north side of the river Detroit, which constitutes the boundary of Upper Canada. When the province of\nQuebec was divided into two distinct governments, Upper and Lower Canada, the subject of this notice became an executive and legislative councillor of the former, and continued in the regular and efficient discharge of the high and important duties of these eminent stations to the day of his death.\n\nSoon after his return from England, he became extensively concerned in the fur trade, and other commercial pursuits; but war with the United States having broken out, all business was suddenly and completely stopped by a hostile invasion. Previous to this, he had experienced very serious losses in his commercial dealings, and also in the erection of mills on the property still retained within the territories of the United States, and was endeavoring to make such arrangements as would relieve him from all such difficulties, and enable him to attend to his farm and orchard, and his promising family. The sudden war, and the calamities which it occasioned him, were not the only evils which befell him. About the same time he lost an affectionate wife, leaving five sons and one daughter, all very young.\n\nTo this lady, a woman of excellent name, unblemished worth, and attentive to every conjugal and domestic duty, he had been married several years, and in her society had enjoyed the greatest happiness. Her death gave him a great shock; nor did he perhaps ever wholly recover from the blow, for there were moments when he felt the loss, even to the last, most deeply, and he never married again. The death of Mrs. Baby appeared to blast his hopes, and derange his purposes, and to throw him as it were adrift on the ocean of life.\n\nThe commencement of the war was perhaps fortunate for him under his heavy bereavement, for he was immediately called to active service. He commanded the militia of the western district, and performed many services highly essential to the preservation of the province. The people were anxious to win his favor; they had the most unlimited confidence in his judgment, and at his request their provisions, their cattle, and personal services were ever ready to support the king's forces in making head against the enemy. When it was in contemplation to withdraw the troops from the western part of the province, he sent his children to Quebec; and when this event took place, he found his health so much impaired by fatigue and privation, and the grief which still consumed him, that he found it necessary to adopt the advice of his physicians, and to retire to Lower Canada. There he remained with his children till the re-establishment of peace, but not in the enjoyment of health, nor was it till after he had been some time at Sandwich that his strength and energy returned.\n\nHis merits had been so conspicuous during the war\u2014his services so disinterested\u2014his losses and privation so great, that government was anxious to confer upon him some mark of approbation, and\nknowing that his means had been much impaired by the sacrifices he had made, it was determined to confer upon him the first office that became vacant, if worthy of his acceptance. As if to meet these views, the office of inspector-general, a place of great responsibility, was in a short time at the disposal of government, and was immediately bestowed upon Mr. Baby. The last seventeen years of his life were spent at York, in the discharge of the duties of this office, and never was there the slightest shadow of complaint\u2014a fact, the more remarkable, as he had to check every other office in the province, and to pronounce in a variety of questions, in which numbers were deeply interested, but such was the public confidence in his integrity and honor, that not a murmur was ever heard.\n\nAs a member of both councils he displayed the most uncompromising probity, and no influence could induce him to give up an opinion, which, after mature examination, he concluded to be right.\n\nThis estimable man's death occurred at York, now Toronto, on the 19th February, 1833, after a short but severe illness, deeply regretted by all shades and classes of society in the western capital.\n\nThere was a primitive simplicity in Mr. Baby's character, which added to his polished manners and benignity of disposition, threw a moral beauty around him, which is very seldom beheld. His favorite amusements partook largely of this simplicity.\n\nHis external accomplishments and manners were highly adapted to win affection and esteem. To an address peculiarly engaging, from its dignity, urbanity and ease, was united a cordiality and kindness of deportment which induced one to desire a more intimate acquaintance.\n\nIn his social intercourse he was an universal favorite, for the sweetness of his temper and innocence of his heart opened the affection of all in his favor. It was not that he was distinguished for his colloquial powers, for he was by no means the leader in conversation, but there was the polish of the most refined manners, ripened by innate benevolence, which made him so acceptable in all companies, that those only who had the happiness of meeting him often in society, could form a just conception of the pleasure of his presence. But highly as this excellent man was to be admired and loved for his engaging manners and virtuous sentiments, the exalted qualities which dignified his moral nature are still more worthy of approbation. These were the gems which shed around his character that lustre which made him so great a favorite. A strict probity and inviolable love of truth were perhaps the most prominent of his moral virtues. From these his conduct derived such a purity and elevation, as could only spring from a mind in which the finest sensibilities of virtue had ever remained uncontaminated by the consciousness of dishonor. To transmit this precious inheritance to his children by precept and example was\nthe principal study of his life, and to secure to them the permanent enjoyment of this valuable deposit, he labored unceasingly to inculcate that which he truly deemed the foundation of every virtue\u2014the principle of religion. His family still reside in the province.\n\nREV. JOHN HOLMES.\n\nMr. Holmes was born at Windsor, in the State of Vermont, of a Protestant family, in 1709. He was studying for the ministry in the Wesleyan church, when he became a convert to the Catholic faith. He then went to the Montreal college, where he entered the highest class, that of philosophy, and was subsequently admitted to the study of theology. He was a professor for some time in the Nicolet college, and, after taking priest's orders was appointed vicar, or assistant to the Cur\u00e9 of Berthier, which parish he left for a mission in the Eastern Townships. He entered the seminary of Quebec, as a professor in 1828, and was soon after elected one of the directors of this institution. Striking originality and great talent, both in the pulpit and in the professor's chair, attracted much attention towards the young priest, and he immediately became extremely popular. He was appointed director of the studies in the minor seminary, and among the principal reforms, he at once introduced into the system of teaching, were: the study of the Greek language, which had never previously been attempted; the teaching of geography in the junior classes on an improved principle, that of history by means of lectures delivered by the professor, an outline of which the pupils were required to give in writing at the meeting following each lecture; also, Algebra and the elements of geometry, in the junior classes; a greater development of the study of natural history, and of natural philosophy in the higher classes, and the cultivation of vocal and instrumental music, and of drawing, which had previously been much neglected.\n\nHe created a considerable sensation by the introduction of dramatic performances, music and dialogue, in public examinations, thus rendering them more attractive and entertaining, contrasting most strikingly with the cold and formal plaidoyers which up to his time had been the only relief and compensation afforded to either the pupils or the public, for the length and tediousness of\nordinary school exhibitions. The other colleges, and even the common schools, adopted the same practice; but latterly it became necessary to check it as it in some measure trespassed beyond its proper limits.\n\nEvery thing that could be done to create emulation among the students and to enliven and pleasantly diversify the monotony of a college life was studiously and successfully attended to by the new principal. During play hours in the long winter evenings he gave lectures, which were more sought after, even by the youngest pupils, than any other kind of recreation. He accompanied them by illustrations with the aid of the magic lantern, and experiments in natural philosophy and chemistry; but no seasoning was more acceptable than the many humorous and interesting anecdotes which he would from time to time introduce in those lectures.\n\nOn a holiday he would take out the pupils on some botanical or mineralogical excursion, which was always enlivened by a few good stories, and crowned by a little feast, the whole being conducted in that mysterious and almost surreptitious manner which is so charming in the eyes of youth. His mildness and indulgence, combined with the peculiar faculty which he possessed to a great extent of captivating the minds of children, and leading them gently to the most difficult points of science, endeared him to all his pupils, who have never forgotten the many pleasant hours they passed with him in those days, that may be called, the dawn of a new era in the history of colleges.\n\nHis great partiality for the study of geography, which he used to say, comprises, if well understood, almost every other study, induced him to compile a treatise in French, which is perhaps the most complete and most entertaining elementary book ever published on that subject.* A work of this nature was then much required, there being at the time nothing within the reach of the French Canadian youth but dry and incomplete treatises, which, besides being unreadable, contained inaccurate notions as to America in general, and to our own country in particular.\n\nIn that work the most minute attention has been paid to all relating to our continent, and with reference to the rest of the globe, the book having been compiled from extracts from the best authors, and being written in a very attractive and beautiful style, was perhaps the very best work on geography extant before Hodgins geography appeared.\n\nIt has been translated into English, and we believe also into German, and has now reached its fifth Canadian edition;\u2020 each being brought up to date in point of statistics and of legislation.\n\n* Nouvel abr\u00e9g\u00e9 de g\u00e9ographie moderne, suivi d'un appendice et d'un abr\u00e9g\u00e9 de g\u00e9ographie sacr\u00e9e l'usage de la jeunesse. Quebec 1832. Neilson & Cowan. 300 pages in 12mo.\n\n\u2020 The last (1854) was published by the Messrs. Cr\u00e9maire of Quebec, who have bought the copyright.\nIn 1836, Mr. Holmes was sent on a mission to Europe by the provincial government, to procure teachers for the normal school, at that time intended to be opened in Lower Canada. He was also commissioned to inquire into the system of normal schools in several countries, and to procure books, apparatus, and collections of natural history for the new institution. He returned the next year with Mr. Regnaud, who had been recommended to him by Mr. Guizot, then minister of public instruction in France, and Mr. Findlater who had been brought up in one of the training schools of Scotland. They opened a normal school at Montreal, but, in consequence of the insurrection and of the suspension of the constitution, it had to be given up, and Mr. Findlater went back to Scotland. Mr. Regnaud found employment here as a surveyor, and delivered an address at the opening of the Jacques Cartier normal school, nearly twenty years after the failure of the first undertaking.\n\nIn the course of his visit to England, Scotland, France, Belgium and Italy, Mr. Holmes was considered by many men of science, with whom he became acquainted, as a person of superior ability and attainments, and was treated with the highest regard. He also took the opportunity during his journey of purchasing for the seminaries of Quebec, of Ste. Anne, and of Nicolet, philosophical instruments and collections of mineralogy, which still do honor to those several institutions.\n\nA few years after his return, Mr. Holmes met with one of those terrible family afflictions which are so disastrous to the public career of all men of feeling. From that day he withdrew by degrees from the prominent position he used to occupy in the direction of the seminary, appeared seldom in the pulpit of the cathedral, where his presence always used to attract great crowds of hearers, till finding that his health was considerably impaired, he retired to Lorette, where he died in 1852, at the age of 58. A few years before his death he re-appeared in the cathedral, where he delivered, during Lent, a series of sermons which were published, and are highly esteemed in Canada and abroad.*\n\n*Conf\u00e9rences de Notre-Dame de Qu\u00e9bec, par M. l'Abb\u00e9 Jean Holmes, Qu\u00e9bec, A.

Even those who, when he was a politician, differed from him in politics, generally admitted that his talents rendered him an ornament of the country which gave him birth. He was the son of Christopher Robinson, Esq., a British officer who served in the revolutionary war of the United States, and afterwards resided in New Brunswick. The subject of this notice was born at Berthier, in Lower Canada, on the 26th July, 1791, his father having accompanied Lieutenant-Governor Simcoe to Canada, after the close of the revolutionary war. Sir John Beverley Robinson's recollections go back to the time when Upper Canada had a population of only thirty thousand souls. In those days the province could not boast the means of superior education which it possesses at present; and the present chief-justice may be esteemed fortunate in having found so able a preceptor as the present bishop of Toronto, who, in the early part of his Canadian career, devoted himself to the instruction of youth at Kingston, and afterwards at the then village of Cornwall, Upper Canada. Having gone through the necessary educational course, young Robinson entered as a law student; and whilst in that capacity, served as clerk of the House of Assembly of Upper Canada for one session, and on being admitted to the bar, he attained the high position of attorney-general for Upper Canada at the early age of twenty-one, a post which he held only temporarily, however, until the release from a French prison of the Honorable D'Arcy Boulton, in 1815, who was appointed actual attorney-general. Mr. Robinson then accepted the office of solicitor-general, a post which he filled until 1818; when, Mr. Boulton being elevated to a judgeship, he was again appointed attorney-general, but this time permanently. He has now been in the service of the Crown no less than forty-six years. He was eighteen years in the legislature, serving about an equal length of time in each chamber. Although he was appointed chief-justice in 1829, his career as a legislator did not end till the legislative council was re-modelled under the re-union act of 1840. He enjoyed the confidence of three successive governors: Sir Perigrine Maitland, Sir John Colborne, and Sir Francis Bond Head. The thanks of the Legislature of Upper Canada were voted to him for the part he took in adjusting the financial difficulties between Upper and Lower Canada. He never once incurred the displeasure of his superiors; while, on the other hand, it was his good fortune to be honored with the express approbation of his sovereign on at least one\noccasion; and his public conduct repeatedly elicited the approbation of colonial secretaries. On one occasion he appealed to the three governors whose names have been mentioned, and who were then all living in England, to bear him witness that their approbation had not been obtained by the suppression of his opinions or the surrender of his judgment.\n\nBelonging to one of the few prominent families, who, having fought under the British flag in the American war of independence, took up their residence in Upper Canada, his loyalty, as he himself said of the United Empire loyalists, was of no doubtful origin. These persons, it is now no treason to say, sometimes made too much of this circumstance, and put forth too extravagant claims on account of their loyalty. Sir J. Beverley Robinson was one of those who did not depend altogether upon an hereditary claim to superior loyalty; when the war of 1812 broke out, he was one of a company of one hundred volunteers who followed Sir Isaac Brock in the expedition which led to the capture of Detroit. During the whole of his political career, he was identified with the small official party known as the \"Family Compact.\" They defended the oligarchical system with a zeal fully proportioned to the interest they had in maintaining it; and opposed the introduction of responsible government as if it had been an overtried project, under which British interests were sure to suffer destruction. They opposed Lord Durham's mission as high commissioner; and the chief-justice, then clothed with the judicial ermine, officially condemned the report of that nobleman on the affairs of Canada. If he erred in this particular\u2014if time has proved that responsible government was not pregnant with the danger that he supposed it was, but proved on the contrary the very thing suited to Canada, this much may at least be said, that he only shared the error of the entire official party in the province; that his error was the error of the times and of a party, and that party systematically sustained by the British Crown.\n\nAs attorney-general, it fell to his lot to conduct some prosecutions against the press for alleged libels of a political nature. The publishers of the Colonial Advocate and the Freeman, published in Toronto, and of the Herald, published in Kingston, were all prosecuted for political libels. Collins, who was literally and practically editor, printer, and publisher of the Freeman, was condemned to two years' imprisonment. This was for a libel upon the attorney-general himself, the subject of this notice, whom he charged with having displayed \"native malignancy\" in conducting the prosecution in a former trial, as well as with having uttered an open, palpable falsehood. The chief-justice seems to have seen the folly of these prosecutions, for he afterwards permitted to pass unnoticed libels upon himself of a far more damaging nature, of which the following is a specimen:\u2014\"Mr. Chief-Justice Robinson may thank\nhis stars that he was a legislator of Upper instead of Lower Canada, when he told the home government in his recent communication of the 27th May, 1828, that any dissatisfaction with the present system of conducting criminal prosecutions in the courts of eyer and terminer was then confined to the Speaker of the House of Assembly and others of his fellow members\u2014a very few individuals in the Assembly, whose opposition to every arrangement and institution of the government is very indiscriminating.\" This reference pointed to the case of Mr. Christie, who was expelled the legislature of Lower Canada on the charge of being a spy upon its actions. But this sort of charge, as we have stated, the chief-justice came to despise, and instead of prosecuting the publisher as he had Collins of the Freeman, he passed it over in silence.\n\nIn 1829, Mr. Robinson resigned the office of attorney-general to accept that of chief-justice. It was doubtful, however, whether he could legally pass directly from the one office to the other; and to get over the difficulty, he accepted an intermediate office for a few days\u2014that of registrar of the county of Kent. His appointment to the chief-justiceship bears date July 15, 1829, in which office he succeeded Sir William Campbell, on the retirement of the latter. Mr. H. J. Boulton succeeded him in the attorney-generalship, and Mr. Hagerman succeeded Mr. Boulton in the solicitor-generalship. At the same time, Mr. James Buchanan Macaulay was made judge of the same court, in the place of Mr. Willie, who had been removed under very peculiar circumstances. The law required that three judges should sit in banco to hear applications for appeal. A case came up with which one of the judges, Mr. Justice Sherwood, was mixed up, and therefore he could not act. Another of the judges was absent; and, instead of three judges, which the law required to hear applications for appeal in banco, there was only one left. Under these circumstances, Mr. Justice Willis refused to act. The government censured and suspended him at first, and finally removed him for refusing to act in a case where the law rendered him incapable. Mr. Macaulay was his successor.\n\nSir J. Beverley Robinson is a picture of amiability and benevolence. He has a great flow of language, and is a pleasant speaker. As a judge, his impartiality has never been successfully impugned; but it is said of him that, from his having always at the bar acted as crown prosecutor, and never once having appeared on the defensive, he has acquired a habit of assuming that every prisoner is guilty until the contrary is proved. This is doubtless stating the matter strongly, and no doubt overstating it; but at the same time it is not impossible that the circumstance of having always appeared when at the bar, as prosecutor, and never once for the defence, might unconsciously have had its effects upon him. He is the author of several valuable works on Canada.\n\nA few years ago he received the honor of a baronetoy, having,\npreviously refused to accept a knighthood. He married in London, England, in 1817, Emma, the daughter of the late Charles Walker, Esquire, and niece to William Merry, Esquire, who was for many years deputy secretary-of-state for war. He is the father of several children. One of his daughters married the Hon. George W. Allan, representative of the York division in the Legislative Council; and one of his sons (John Beverley) represents the western portion of the city of Toronto in the other branch of the legislature.\n\nSIR F. N. B. CONYNGHAM, BART., G.C.H.\n\nThis gentleman was the twin brother of the third Lord Conyngham, and was born on the 26th December, 1766.\n\nSir Francis was, for some years, lieutenant-governor of this colony; and, in 1824, administered the government of Lower Canada, during the absence of the Earl of Dalhousie. History does not mention anything extraordinary that he performed during his stay in Canada. His character is represented as pleasant and agreeable.\n\nHe was one of the knights of the shire for the county of Clare, a colonel of the Clare militia, and one of the hundred members sent to the Imperial Parliament. In 1802, he was re-elected for the county of his residence without any opposition.\n\nHe married, 4th June 1801, Hon. Valentia Letitia Lawless, third sister of Lord Cloncurry, by whom he had three sons, one of whom entered the army and the other the navy.\n\nSir Francis died at Bath, 27th January, 1832.\n\nJOCELYN WALLER, Esq.,\n\nA Canadian journalist. He was brother of the late Sir Robert and Sir Charles Waller, of Newport, Ireland. Mr. Waller was an accomplished scholar, and he as editor of the Canadian Spectator distinguished himself as an able and talented political writer. In\nAND PERSONS CONNECTED WITH CANADA.\n\nprivate life his amiable and virtuous character endeared him to all who had the advantage of his acquaintance. He died at Montreal on the 2nd December, 1828.\n\nDONALD McKENZIE, Esq.,\n\nBorn in Scotland in 1784. Died at Mayville, Chataque County, U. S., in 1851.\n\nAt the age of seventeen he came to Canada, and joined the North-West Company, and continued eight years with them. In 1809 he became one of the partners with the late John Jacob Astor, of New York, in establishing the fur trade west of the Rocky Mountains. Washington Irving narrates a few of Mr. McKenzie's adventures on the frontiers. In March, 1821, Mr. McKenzie joined the Hudson Bay Company, and was immediately appointed one of the council and chief factor. In August, 1825, he was married, and shortly afterwards was appointed governor. At this time he resided at Fort Garry, Red River Settlement, where he amassed a large fortune. In 1833, he went to Mayville, where the residue of his life was spent.\n\nREV. M. DEMERS.\n\nMr. Demers was born at St. Nicholas, county of Levis, in 1774. He was the son of a respectable farmer, who being distinguished for his loyalty, was made a prisoner by General Arnold, during the siege of Quebec, in 1775. His neighbors and friends gathered and rescued him. Mr. Demers studied in the seminary of Quebec, but before entering the school of theology, he had spent some time in the world learning land surveying, as he had a strong natural taste for mathematics. He was during fifty years a member of the seminary, passing during that long career, through all the several offices and chairs of teaching to the principalship.\n\nMr. Demers, did a great deal to promote the study of natural\nphilosophy; at a time when books on that subject were scarce, or rather hardly to be found in the country; he himself compiled treatises, which being manuscript, had to be copied by the pupils. He had a remarkable taste for architecture, painting and the fine arts in general, and exercising as he did during all his life a great influence over Canadian society, he turned it more than once into account for the protection and encouragement of our artists. The beautiful paintings in the chapel of the seminary were selected by him from a collection sent from France to the Abb\u00e9 Desjardins. He died on the 17th of May, 1853, at the age of 79. His several treatises on the natural sciences were never printed, and this is perhaps not to be regretted, inasmuch as those sciences have gone through such phases, as render old treatises something very much like a Journal of Fashion twenty years old. But fortunately for Mr. Demers, he had given his attention to subjects which are eternal and immutable of their nature, and the only book which he published, his Institutiones Philosophicae, will remain as one of the best and most complete treatises on logic, metaphysics and ethics.*\n\n---\n\n**GENERAL LORD AYLMER, G.C.B.**\n\nThe Right Honorable Matthew Whitworth, fifth Lord Aylmer, born in 1775, was the eldest son of Henry, the fourth lord, by Catherine, second daughter of Sir Charles Whitworth, and sister to Charles Earl Whitworth; at whose death, in 1825, Lord Aylmer assumed the name of Whitworth before his own, and received the royal permission to quarter the arms of that family.\n\nHe succeeded to the peerage on the death of his father, October 22, 1785; after which his mother was re-married, in 1787, to Howell Price, Esquire. Her ladyship died in 1805.\n\nLord Aylmer entered the army as an ensign in the 49th Foot in 1787. He served nine months in Barbadoes, at the expiration of which period he went to England on sick leave for six months; and afterwards returned to the West Indies, and served two years and a half, eleven months of which he was at St. Domingo. His lordship was present at the first and second attacks upon Quiberon; at the storming of Fort l'Acul, near Leagone, where he was\n\n*Institutiones Philosophicae ad usum studios\u00e6 juventutis. Quebeci, ex tyhis T. Cary et Socii, 1835. 396 pages, 8vo.\nwounded; at the affair of Bombard, near Cape Nicola Mole; and at the reduction of Port-au-Prince. In 1791 Lord Aylmer received a lieutenancy in his regiment; and the 8th August 1794, a company. In October, 1794, his lordship reached England on sick leave for six months. In 1797 he served as aide-de-camp to Major-General Leland. In May, 1798, he was present at the descent, near Ostend, and was taken prisoner, with the whole of the grenadier company of the 49th Regiment under his command; and he remained in a French prison six months. In 1799, he was present in the action at the Helder; the attack on the British lines the 10th of September; and the battles of the 19th of September and 2nd of October. After his return from Holland, he served as aide-de-camp to Major-General Lord Charles Somerset, until his promotion to a majority in the 85th Foot the 9th October, 1800. In 1801, he served for seven months in Jamaica. The 25th of March, 1802, he received the lieutenant-colonelcy of the 85th, and upon the reduction of the 2nd battalion of that regiment in October following, he was placed on half-pay. The 9th June, 1803, his lordship exchanged into the Coldstream Guards. In 1805, he served under Lord Cathcart in the expedition to Hanover; he was afterwards at the siege of Copenhagen; and in 1807 was appointed assistant-adjutant-general to the Kent district. In January 1809, he proceeded as assistant-adjutant-general to Portugal, with the expedition under the command of Major-General Sherbrooke. On their arrival, the general and staff officers, and the troops composing the expedition, were incorporated with the army serving in that country. On the 25th of July, 1810, he received the brevet rank of colonel, on being appointed aide-de-camp to the king. In January, 1812, he was appointed deputy-adjutant-general to the army in the Peninsula.\n\nOn the 4th June, 1813, he received the rank of major-general, and was soon afterwards appointed by the Duke of Wellington to command a brigade of infantry, with which he continued to serve until the conclusion of the war. He was present at the passage of the Douro, in the battles of Talavera, Buasoo, Fuentes d'Onor, and Vittoria; at the affairs of the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th December, 1813, near Bayonne; the siege of Bayonne, and other actions of minor importance in the Peninsula. On the conclusion of the war, his lordship was appointed major-general on the staff in Ireland, and subsequently adjutant-general, in which latter situation he continued for some years. He attained the full rank of general, May 27, 1825; was appointed colonel of the 56th Foot, October 29, 1827; and of the 18th Foot, July 23, 1832. He was nominated K.C.B. on the enlargement of the order of the Bath in January 1815, and G.C.B. in September, 1836.\n\nIn 1828, Lord Aylmer was appointed governor-general of Canada. His government lasted nearly five years; and previously to his\ndeparture from Quebec, which took place on the 17th September 1833, the citizens presented a farewell address, signed by 4,000 persons, expressing their regret at the termination of his lordship's residence among them. His lordship's decease took place in London, on the 23rd February, 1850.\n\nLord Aylmer married, August 4, 1801, Louisa Anne, second daughter of Sir John Call, Bart.; but by that lady, who survived him, he had no issue. The peerage devolved on his only surviving brother, Frederick William, a vice-admiral and C.B.\n\n---\n\nHON. AND RIGHT REV. J. STRACHAN, D.D., LL. D.,\n\nThe history of this great and truly remarkable divine deserves special mention in a work of this description, more particularly on account of the important services which he has rendered, not only to the church of which he is an ornament, but to the western province, in whose interests his enlightened mind has been most earnestly engaged, and in which he has lived and labored for so long a time. He is one of those active minds who have shown how much distinction and honor a man can attain in this world by energy and perseverance, combined with talent and merit. Feeling, as we do, such high respect and admiration for his character as a zealous and active prelate, and for his distinguished abilities in the several capacities in which he has lived and served Canada, we are assured our readers will readily pardon any exuberance of feeling on our part.\n\nThe venerable bishop was born in Aberdeen, on the 12th April, 1778; and was educated at the grammar school of that ancient city. In 1793, he matriculated in King's college of that university, where he subsequently took the degree of A.M.; he then removed to the university of St. Andrew's to prosecute his theological studies. In 1797, he commenced to teach in the little village of King's Kettle. It was at this time that he received the offer, through the late Honorable Messrs. Richard Cartwright and Robert Hamilton, to proceed to Canada, to organize and take charge of a college or university, which Governor Simcoe had determined on establishing at the seat of government of Upper Canada, in order that the youth of the province might enjoy the benefits of a sound education. This offer was first tendered to the afterwards celebrated Dr. Chalmers, at that time studying at\nSt. Andrews; he declined it, but recommended Mr. Strachan, who accepted it. His first connection with Canada dates back to the month of August 1799, when he came to Canada in pursuance of the above offer. But unfortunately for the interests of the colony, General Simcoe, being appointed to another governorship, had left the province, and had been succeeded by another, who did not seem inclined to carry out the plans of his predecessor, and thus the establishment of the university was for the time dropped. This must have caused considerable disappointment to Mr. Strachan; but his native energy enabled him to surmount the difficulties of his new position. He opened a school in Kingston; and, by the influence of Mr. Cartwright, collected a number of pupils, among whom were that gentleman's own children. Here he remained for three years; and under the instruction and advice of the Reverend Dr. Stuart, arch-deacon of Upper Canada, prepared to enter the Church of England. He was accordingly ordained deacon by the Right Reverend Dr. Mountain, first bishop of Quebec, and appointed to the mission of Cornwall. Here he commenced the grammar school of that place; and had the honor of including among his pupils several young gentlemen, who afterwards rose to the highest positions in colonial society. One of these, John Beverley Robinson, was afterwards raised to a baronetcy, and was appointed chief-justice of Upper Canada, in 1829; an office, the duties of which, we trust, he may long be spared to discharge, with as much honor as he has done in the past. Another pupil of the Cornwall grammar school was the late Sir J. B. Macaulay, chief-justice of the Common Pleas, and the late Honorable Jonas Jones, a puisn\u00e9 judge.\n\nIt is unnecessary here to inquire into the cause of this change of denominational persuasion by Mr. Strachan. It may have been that a wider field of usefulness opened out to him in connexion with the Church of England, than with the Kirk of Scotland. In 1807, the university of St. Andrew's conferred on Mr. Strachan the degree of LL.D.; and in the same year, the university of Aberdeen also conferred on him that of D.D. In 1812, Dr. Strachan, was appointed rector of York. In 1818, he was, by royal warrant, appointed an executive councillor, and took his seat in the Legislative Council; in 1825, he was appointed archdeacon of York; in 1836, he resigned his seat in the Executive Council; in 1839, he was created bishop of the diocese of Toronto; in 1840, he resigned his place as a member of the Legislative Council, and now in 1861, at the advanced age of eighty-three, on the 12th July past, he retains the freshness and vigor of a man of three-score and three, with all the peculiarity of accent which distinguished the natives of Aberdeen of the last century,\u2014one of the strangest coincidences in the career of the indomitable bishop.\n\nTo Bishop Strachan Upper Canada is indebted for many benefits,\nas we have before mentioned. But for him the \"Queen City\" could not boast of so many attractions, raised by his untiring industry and assistance. It is but meet to enumerate, among them, the name of the celebrated Trinity college of that place, an institution which entirely owes its origination and existence to the persevering energy and assiduity of the right reverend prelate, in the cause of the Church of England.\n\nBishop Strachan has ever been the friend of the poor; to his hand has been ascribed many benefits conferred upon them, in the promotion of education, and establishing institutions for the welfare of the old as well as the young. He has indeed merited all the love and affection, which his people cherish for him. He is universally beloved and esteemed by his clergy and parishioners. We think we cannot do better than append to this brief sketch a portion of the venerable bishop's charge to the Church Society, Toronto, on the 13th of June, 1860, and which has reference to his remarkable career. He said:\n\n\"In 1796, having finished my terms at King's college, Aberdeen, and proceeded to the master's degree, I removed to the vicinity of St. Andrew's, and while there I contracted several important and lasting friendships, amongst others, with Thomas Duncan, afterwards professor of mathematics, and also with Dr. Chalmers, since then so deservedly renowned. We were all three very nearly of the same age, and our friendship only terminated with death, being kept alive by a constant correspondence during more than sixty years. After leaving St. Andrew's, I was for a time employed in private tuition, but having a mother and two sisters in a great degree dependent on my exertion, I applied for the parochial school of Kettle, in the county of Fife, and obtained it by public competition. And here, at the age of nineteen, I made my first essay in the great field of educational labor, commencing my career with a deeply rooted love for the cause, and with something of a foreknowledge of that success which has since crowned my efforts. It was my practice to study and note the character and capacity of my pupils as they entered the school, and to this discrimination which gave correctness to my judgment, many owe the success which they ultimately achieved. Among my pupils at that time was Sir David Wilkie, since so well known as one of the first painters of the age. I very soon perceived Wilkie's great genius, and with much difficulty prevailed with his uncle to send him, still very young, to the celebrated Raeburn, then enjoying the highest reputation in Scotland. It is pleasing to remark, that after an interval of perhaps thirty years, the preceptor and scholar met in London, and renewed an intimacy so profitable to one and so honourable to both. They attended the meeting of the British Association at Birmingham together, and saw much of one another during my short stay in England. Often did Sir David Wilkie, at the height\nof his fame, declare that he owed everything to his reverend teacher, and that but for his interference he must have remained in obscurity. Commodore Robert Barclay, afterwards so unfortunate on Lake Erie, from causes over which he had no control, was another of my pupils. He was a youth of the brightest promise, and often have I said in my heart that he possessed qualities which fitted him to be another Nelson, had the way opened for such a consummation. While at St. Andrew's, the Reverend James Brown, one of the professors of the university, a gentleman of vast scientific attainments, became so exceedingly attached to me as to take me under his kind protection. After some time he was advanced in the chair of natural philosophy in the university of Glasgow, to which place he removed. Still interested in my welfare, he proposed to me to become his attending assistant, to prepare and make the experiments necessary for the illustration of his lectures, and in his absence from infirm health, which was not unfrequent, to read his prelections, and discharge such of his duties in the lecture room as I was qualified to undertake. But difficulties intervened to prevent this arrangement from being carried out when almost completed, and Dr. Brown was, as he intimated to me, reluctantly induced to retire on a pension. But our mutual attachment continued through life. This to me was a very bitter disappointment. A career of honorable usefulness had been opened in a way after my own heart, and it was in a moment destroyed. But I was not overwhelmed, for God had in his goodness given me a cheerful spirit of endurance, and a sanguine disposition as to the future, which it was not easy to depress, and a kind Providence, even before I had altogether recovered the shock, presented to me an opportunity of removing to another sphere of activity, and in the frame of mind in which I found myself, I was the more disposed to accept employment in Canada.\n\nAmong the many schemes contemplated by General Simcoe, for the benefit of the province, was that of establishing grammar schools in every district, and a university at their head, at the seat of government. Anxious to complete, as soon as possible so beneficial an object, the governor gave authority to the Honorable Richard Cartwright and the Honorable Robert Hamilton, to procure a gentleman from Scotland, to organise and take charge of such college or university. These gentlemen, whose memories are still dear to the province, applied to their friends in St. Andrew's, who offered the appointment first to Mr. Duncan, then to Mr. Chalmers, neither of whom were yet much known, but both declined. Overtures were then made to me, and, suffering severely under my recent disappointment, I was induced, after some hesitation, to accept the appointment.\n\nI sailed from Greenock towards the end of August, 1799, under convoy; but such was then the wretched state of navigation, that\nI did not reach Kingston, by the way of New York and Montreal, till the last day of the year 1799, much fatigued in body, and not a little disappointed at the desolate appearance of the country, being, throughout, one sheet of snow. But a new and still more severe trial awaited me. I was informed that Governor Simcoe had some time before returned to England, but of which I had received no information, and the intention of establishing the projected university had been postponed. I was deeply moved and cast down, and had I possessed the means, I would have instantly returned to Scotland. A more lonely or destitute condition can scarcely be conceived. My reasonable expectations were cruelly blighted\u2014a lonely stranger in a foreign land, without any resources or a single acquaintance. But my return was next to impossible, and it was more wisely ordered. Mr. Cartwright, to whom I had been specially recommended, came to my assistance, and sympathized deeply and sincerely in this to me unexpected calamity, and after a short space of time, proposed a temporary remedy. My case, he acknowledged, was most trying, but not altogether hopeless, and he submitted an arrangement which might be deemed only temporary, or lasting, as future events should direct. Take charge, said he, of my four sons, and a select number of pupils during three years; this will provide you with honorable employment and a fair remuneration, and if at the expiration of that period the country does not present a reasonable prospect of advancement, you might return to Scotland with credit. He further added that he did not think the plan of the grammar schools and university altogether desperate, although it might take longer time to establish them than might be convenient or agreeable. In my position there was no alternative but to acquiesce, and I was soon enabled to return to a healthy cheerfulness, and to meet my difficulties with fortitude and resignation. In the meantime, a strong attachment grew up between me and Mr. Cartwright, whom I found to be a man of great capacity and intelligence, of the strictest honor and integrity, and, moreover, a sincere churchman from conviction, after deep enquiry and research. A similarity of feelings and tastes tended to strengthen and confirm our mutual regard, which at length ripened into a warm friendship, which continued without the slightest change or abatement till we were separated by death. I was left the guardian of his children, the highest and most precious proof of confidence that he could have conferred upon me, and I feel happy in saying that under my guardianship they became worthy of their excellent father. At Kingston, I formed other friendships, especially with the Reverend Dr. Stuart, the rector of the parish, and the bishop's commissary for Upper Canada; a gentleman whose sound judgment, sagacity and other high mental qualities were rendered more useful and attractive by his kind and courteous demeanor, and a playful wit, which seemed inexhaus-\ntible. From this gentleman I received the most affectionate and parental attention and advice from the day of our first interview, and our friendly intercourse continued ever after without interruption. At Dr. Stuart's suggestion, I devoted all my leisure time during the three years of my engagement with Mr. Cartwright, to the study of divinity, with a view of entering the church at its expiration. Accordingly, on the second day of May, 1803, I was ordained deacon, by the Right Reverend Dr. Mountain, the first Protestant bishop of Quebec; and on the third day of June, 1804, I was admitted by the same prelate into the holy order of priests, and was appointed to the mission of Cornwall.\"\n\n---\n\nMAJOR RICHARSON.\n\nThe subject of this brief notice was a native of Upper Canada; and, if we mistake not, belonged to a family, the members of which, during the war of 1812, exhibited great loyalty and devotion. Having entered the army, he was led, by a desire of seeing service, or by the hope of advancement, to join the British Auxiliary Legion, organised by Colonel (now General Sir) De Lacy Evans, and employed in Spain. It was his ill-fortune, at an early period of his engagement, to incur the displeasure of the lieutenant-general, Colonel Evans, (by some statement which appeared in a printed, but not published preface to his journal of \"Movements of the British Legion;\" and, by his own shewing, there were but too many, in that heterogeneous levy, ready to defame and asperse one who had rendered himself obnoxious to their leader, the great fountain whence flowed honors and promotion to the officers serving in the Spanish Legion. Major Richarson appears to have buffeted with fortitude and skill the storm of troubles by which he was assailed; and after many severe trials, having piloted his bark safely into port, he obtained tardy justice, grudgingly rendered, from the lieutenant-general and his staff and adherents. He published a narrative of the campaign and of the circumstances of which we have spoken.\n\nWe do not know when he returned to this province; but he speedily became known and celebrated here through the many interesting tales he produced relative to the history of this country\u2014\u201cWacousta,\u201d according to general opinion the best, was immensely popular. \u201cEcart\u00e9,\u201d the \u201cCanadian Brothers,\u201d and \u201cEight years in\nCanada,\" were also much esteemed. He received some public employment, and founded a newspaper in Upper Canada.\n\nMajor Richardson was a knight of the military order of St. Ferdinand; and, we believe, died in the United States some years ago.\n\n---\n\nHON. MR. JUSTICE CHAPMAN.\n\nThe Hon. H. S. Chapman was a son of the late Henry Chapman, Esq., of the war department. He received his education at Westminster school; he first came to Canada in 1826, and for some time devoted himself to mercantile pursuits at Quebec; but he was more successful in walks of literature. He contributed largely to the columns of the local papers, always taking the extreme liberal side of all political questions; but though politics had great attractions for his pen, he wrote with greater gusto on all commercial subjects. In 1832, he published a pamphlet on the currency, written with the object of disabusing the public mind of the fallacies then prevailing, with regard to the advantages of a depreciated currency. In 1833, Mr. Chapman proceeded to Montreal, and established the Daily Advertiser newspaper. He edited this journal with the greatest vigor and ability; so much so, as to incur the greatest vituperation and abuse from the old tory papers, and had to encounter perhaps the coarsest personality ever indulged in by any class of writers, at any period, in Canada. His writings, however, did everything for the liberal party, the leading members of which highly appreciated his efforts in the cause of constitutional government. About 1836, Mr. Chapman left Canada, and determined to try his fortunes in England, though in a different capacity. Lord John (now Earl) Russell appointed him on a commission to enquire into the state of the working classes in the manufacturing districts; and he found employment in writing for some of the periodical publications for three or four years. About this time he studied law, having entered at Lincoln's-Inn, and was called to the bar.\n\nIn July, 1851, without consulting Mr. Chapman, Earl Grey appointed him colonial secretary for Van Dieman's Land, where he resided until 1853, when differences having arisen between him and the Executive Council, relative to the transportation question, Mr. Chapman resigned his office, and returned to England. He subse-\nquently was appointed to a judgeship in one of the Australian colonies. In society, Mr. Chapman's great natural parts, improved by cultivation, a good heart and winning manners, made him a very general favorite, and much beloved by his personal friends.\n\nHON. JOHN NEILSON.\n\nJohn Neilson, sixth child of William Neilson and Isabel Brown his wife, was born in Scotland, at Dornald in the parish of Balma-\nghie, in the stewartry of Kirkcudbright, on the 17th July, 1776. He received his early education in one of those parish schools of Scotland, which have so greatly contributed to elevate the charac-\nter of her population; but the acquirements he brought from school could but have formed the foundation of his subsequent success, which he mainly owed to his own assiduity in self improve-\nment in after life. When about fourteen years of age, his family sent him to seek his fortune in Canada, placing him under the care of his elder brother, Samuel Neilson, who had just then succeeded his uncle, Mr. W. Brown, in the property and editorship of the Quebec Gazette, which had been first published by him and his partner, Mr. Gilmour, on the 21st June, 1764.\n\nMr. S. Neilson died in 1798, and Mr. J. Neilson being yet a minor, the publication of the Gazette was conducted by the late Reverend Mr. (afterwards Dr.) Sparks, his guardian, until 1796, when, Mr. Neilson coming of full age, he assumed the direction of the paper, and from that period it took a new character of interest and importance. In 1810, the increasing demand for political intelligence and the importance of the public questions which began to be discussed in the legislature, induced Mr. Neilson to enlarge the size of the paper, and to publish it twice a week, and, as had formerly been the case, in both languages. Under the management of its judicious editor, the Quebec Gazette acquired a perceptible and increasing influence on public opinion, by the ability and discretion with which political subjects were discussed in it; the personal influence of its editor naturally increased with that of his journal; his capacity for civil affairs, attracted the attention of his fellow citizens, and in 1818, he was brought forward as a candidate and elected to the provincial assembly, as a member for the county of Quebec; he thus entered upon a new and more\nimportant political career; he was now in the full vigor of his age and ripened intellect, and, as might be expected from his character, he soon took a lead in the active business of the legislature. At an early period after he became a legislator, he turned his attention to the measures necessary for the promotion of two of the most important and enduring interests of civil society\u2014education and agriculture; and, as an auxiliary to the latter, he sought to effect an improvement in the system of granting the waste lands, to encourage the survey and exploration of unknown territory within the limits of the province, and thus to assist the development of the resources of the country.\n\nHe bore a leading part also in the discussion of the grave questions which, after 1818, occupied the public mind, and led to differences between the executive government and the Assembly, as to the control and appropriation of the public revenues\u2014the accusations brought against public functionaries\u2014the plurality of offices, and the alleged abuses or evils in the administration of government, Mr. Neilson's conduct was marked by firmness and impartiality, and by that spirit of justice which was part of his individual character.\n\nBut as the Quebec Gazette was employed by government as the vehicle of public notifications, and might thus be represented as in some sort its organ, Mr. Neilson, in 1822, in order to be free in his political capacity from even the appearance of any such connection, transferred the whole establishment to his son, Mr. S. Neilson, who, shortly afterwards, accepted a commission from government as king's printer and editor, and for about a year the paper bore the imprint, \"by authority.\" But the commission having been revoked in 1823, the Gazette resumed and thenceforth retained the character of an independent paper, which it had borne since its establishment.\n\nThe disputes between the executive government and the Assembly, on financial matters, had, in 1822, apparently become so irreconcilable, that the Imperial Government, pressed at the same time by Upper Canada to interfere in a question of finance pending between the two provinces, determined to propose to Parliament to re-unite the provinces. The intelligence of this measure created general uneasiness among a large part of the people of Lower Canada, and a strenuous spirit of opposition to it being aroused, it was determined by those adverse to it to send delegates to England with representations against it. Mr. Neilson was chosen as the delegate from the district of Quebec, and Mr. Papineau, for that of Montreal, and through their remonstrances, supported by the influence of Sir J. Macintosh in Parliament, or rather by his withdrawal of the assistance which the government had understood him to have promised, the measure was, in 1823, abandoned for the present.\nIn 1828, the discussions between the local government and the Assembly having become more and more exasperated, a petition of grievance was sent to England, addressed to the Sovereign and Parliament, complaining of the administration of the government, and bearing the names of upwards of 80,000 inhabitants of the province. Mr. Neilson was again chosen as a delegate jointly with Mr. D. B. Viger and Mr. Cuvillier, to support the complaints and demands of the petitioners before the imperial authorities; and a committee of inquiry having been appointed by the House of Commons, Mr. Neilson and the other delegates were examined, with many other witnesses; and a report was made favorable in the main to the views of the petitioners. The testimony given by Mr. Neilson, with respect to the Legislative Council, gave occasion subsequently to a charge against him of having recommended that that body should be made elective; but an unprejudiced perusal of his evidence, taken as a whole, will shew that then, (as at all times afterwards, both in his editorial articles and in his place in the Assembly,) he discountenanced all suggestions of fundamental changes, and maintained that the existing constitution and frame of government, if properly administered, were sufficient \"for the peace, welfare, and good government of the province.\"\n\nIn like manner, both before and after that celebrated inquiry, Mr. Neilson always expressed his entire confidence in the good intentions, liberality and justice of the British Government, in every thing that concerned the welfare of the people of Lower Canada; and the recommendations of the report then made, being carried into execution, in a spirit of concession and conciliation by a new governor (Sir James Kempt), had the effect of producing a greater degree of tranquility in the province.\n\nOn the 29th of March, 1830, Mr. Neilson received the thanks of the House of Assembly for his services on this mission to England; and we extract a part of his answer to the Speaker on that occasion:\n\n\"In performing a duty imposed upon me by my fellow citizens, I did nothing more than was incumbent on any inhabitant of the province, who might be honored with their confidence; and whose means might allow of those sacrifices of ease and individual interest which we all owe to the common welfare, and of which so many of my most esteemed friends, both in and out of the committee by which I was delegated, have set such an honorable example. Next, after the consciousness of having faithfully endeavored to discharge a public duty, the best reward is, the certainty that we have been successful as to obtain the approbation of those for whom we have acted; it is in this respect, that I set the highest value on the testimony of approbation, with which the representatives of the people have been pleased to honor me.\"\n\nNor was this vote of thanks the only public mark of approbation which Mr. Neilson's services to the people called forth. In\nJanuary, 1831, a silver vase, which cost one hundred and fifty guineas, (raised by public subscription) was presented to him at a public dinner, given to him by a large number of his fellow citizens, in testimony of their gratitude for his services in England, in 1828 and 1829. This tribute bore the following inscription:\n\n\"A John Neilson, Ecr., M. P. P., d\u00e9put\u00e9 deux fois aupr\u00e8s du Parlement Imp\u00e9rial pour d\u00e9fendre les droits des Canadiens; ce l\u00e9ger tribut de reconnaissance lui est offert en m\u00e9moire des services qu'il a rendus au pays, et comme un hommage \u00e0 ses vertus civiques.\"\n\nMr. Neilson's well known modesty, however, prevented any notice of this public honor from appearing in the Quebec Gazette, and we have been obliged to take these details from a contemporary journal.\n\nIt was about this period that a difference of opinion on points of political importance began first to shew itself between Mr. Neilson and the leaders of the party with whom he had generally hitherto acted.\n\nHis career was in nothing more remarkable than for his constant desire to maintain the ancient institutions, usages, and social arrangements of the French Canadian portion of the population; and he vigorously opposed the measure called Le Bill des Fabriques, in 1831, which he considered as a needless and mischievous encroachment on the laws and customs by which the parochial church corporations had hitherto been governed, and, as tending to create disorder and confusion, where tranquillity and contentment had generally prevailed before.\n\nThe separation thus made was widened still further at the same period, and the political quiet partially restored by the measures of administration in 1829 and 1830, was again disturbed by the agitation of the question of an elective Legislative Council, by the imprisonment of two publishers of newspapers for alleged libels on that body, and, by the deplorable events at the Montreal election, in 1832, when the editor of one of those papers was elected to the Assembly. When this unfortunate occurrence was made the subject of investigation before a committee of the Assembly, and the feelings of party and origin were aroused into irritated action, Mr. Neilson abstained from taking any part in the proceedings, and his conduct on that occasion was justly considered as indicating his marked disapprobation of the course pursued by his political friends, who strove to cast the whole odium of the occurrences in question upon the civil and military authorities. He looked with ill-boding and prophetic eye on the measures of his party, as mischievously intermeddling with what ought to have been left to the proper tribunals of justice; and from that period may be dated his entire separation from that party. The consequences of that separation to himself personally were soon evident; for, on the occasion of the general election of 1834, he was thrown\nout of the representation of the county of Quebec, for which he had sat for fifteen years.\n\nIn the session of 1834, the celebrated ninety-two resolutions on the state of the country, (which a minister of the crown described as a \"paper revolution,\" but which have now almost become a reality,) were adopted, and were brought before the Imperial Parliament, in a petition, calling for organic changes in the constitution, and the general adoption of the elective principle. Those who desired to maintain the constitution of the country unimpaired, formed themselves into \"Constitutional Associations,\" throughout the province; and sent home petitions to the government and parliament in England. True to his principle of seeking administrative and opposing needless constitutional changes, Mr. Neilson accepted the appointment of a delegate from Quebec, associated with Mr. Walker, an advocate, of Montreal, to carry these petitions to England, and urge the objects of them there. Upon this third mission, Mr. Neilson proceeded to England, in the spring of 1835, and communicated with the new colonial secretary, Lord Glenelg; but, in the month of July, the British cabinet determined to transfer the further inquiry into these political distractions to the province itself, by recalling Lord Aylmer, and sending out Lord Gosford, as governor-in-chief, with a commission also, jointly, with two others, as commissioners of inquiry. Mr. Neilson, consequently, returned immediately to Canada. In this year, the health of his son, the editor of the Gazette, which had been for some time failing, sank under the labor of a daily publication, (a change which had been adopted in 1832, when the Gazette appeared alternately in the two languages), and he was obliged to go to the south of Europe;\u2014and, having died at New York, on his return to his family, his father, at the age of three score, while suffering under this afflicted bereavement, and the disappointment of his hopes, resumed his editorial labors, in order to maintain the old establishment.\n\nAmongst the events of 1837 and 1838, Mr. Neilson was found true to those loyal principles, which he had always inculcated\u2014recommending order and obedience to the laws, and respect to the constituted authorities. Notwithstanding the deplorable revolt of a portion of the population, he still shewed himself the firm and constant friend of the French Canadians, and maintained that the mass of the people were untainted by disloyalty or disaffection. He was, in truth, attached to them as a people\u2014he loved to talk of their primitive manners and customs, their simple character and habits, and the peculiar changes and occurrences of their history; for their clergy, too, he entertained a high respect; which was returned by equal respect and regard, on their part, which followed him, it is believed, to the last moments of his life, and still attends his memory.\nThe union of the provinces, which followed upon the events of 1837-8, was opposed by Mr. Neilson, so long as he conceived that opposition could be of any avail;\u2014having been called to the special council, in 1839, after the suspension of the constitution, he there voted against the union, being supported only by two other members, (Messrs DeRocheblave and Quesnel), and in June, 1840, at a general meeting of the inhabitants of Quebec, he proposed a series of resolutions, which were embodied in a petition sent to England, remonstrating against the measure.\n\nWhen the act of union passed, Mr. Neilson came forward, and was elected without opposition, as member for his old county of Quebec, in the united legislature. One of the first measures introduced by him, was an act to restore to the electors of the suburbs of St. Roch and St. John, the right of voting for members, which had been taken away from them by the electoral arrangement, under the act of union.\n\nMr. Neilson's rooted desire to stand by old institutions, and even usages, again manifested itself in his constant disapprobation of what is called \"responsible government;\" and, his opinion upon this innovation upon the old system of colonial government, are to be found thickly scattered through his editorial articles in the Quebec Gazette, from the adoption of the resolutions upon this subject in the Assembly, in 1841.\n\nOn the formation of a new government, in November, 1843, he was urged to accept the honorable post of Speaker of the Legislative Council; but he declined it, as he had uniformly declined every office of emolument, in fulfilment of a public declaration he once made to his constituents, and it was not till the session of 1844, that he consented, though the offer had before been frequently made to him, to become a member of that branch of the legislature.\n\nHe was now verging to the appointed period of three score years and ten, and his constitution betrayed the inroads of age. He had already seen many contemporaries go before him to the grave, with whom he had been connected in the relations of sincere friendship, or in those of political life; but he still continued to take that active part which he considered to be his duty, as a member of society, in all public measures, either within the legislature or without, which appeared to him conducive to the public weal; on such occasions, he shrunk not from meeting or co-operating with those who might be of an adverse political party, and the respect with which his suggestions were received in the public assemblies of his fellow citizens, shewed the weight attached to his opinions, and the confidence reposed in his ripened judgment and long experience in public affairs.\n\nIt was at last in discharging a voluntary duty that he had taken upon himself, by attending with his brethren of St. Andrew's\nSociety, to receive the representative of his sovereign with due honor on his visit to Quebec, in October, 1847, that Mr. N. brought on himself the malady which proved ultimately fatal to him; he was on that occasion exposed for a considerable time to a chilling rain, but persisted in remaining to read the address of his fellow citizens, to his excellency, on his first arrival in the ancient capital of Canada.\n\nHe was shortly after taken ill, and never fully shook off the disease; but in spite of increasing weakness, his spirit failed him not, nor his habits of application to business; so that neither his family nor his medical attendants perceived the full extent of his danger, and it may be said that he \"died in harness,\" for the very evening before his death, he wrote off for the next issue of the Gazette, and with a steady hand, and almost without obliteration, the two remarkable articles, his last impressive words to his fellow citizens, which appeared in the Gazette of 31st January, 1848; the following day he was no more. He had some days before left his town residence for his loved retreat at Cap Rouge, where his family hoped that retirement and repose might help to check his malady and prolong his days, but the morning before his death he was seized with a shivering, from which he passed into a lethargic slumber, and gently breathed his last at four o'clock in the morning of the 1st February, at the age of seventy-one years, six months, and a few days.\n\nAfter thus tracing Mr. Neilson's public career, from its commencement to its close, it remains for us to notice the principal features of the character which he had established, by his abilities and integrity, in the course of a long and laborious life, and which he left as the best heritage to his descendants.\n\nAs a public journalist, his labors, spread over thirty volumes of the Gazette, attest his industry, ability, firmness and moderation, in delivering to the public the opinions upon the various subjects of political discussion which occupied the public attention oftentimes during the periods of great difficulty and agitation. In his style of writing he was a model for journalists\u2014plain, simple, concise, terse and idiomatically English. When the occasion required, as may be seen in some of his communications to the Quebec Gazette, then conducted by his son, in the summer of 1812, after the fatal occurrences at the Montreal election, he threw into his compositions a degree of eloquence and force seldom surpassed in any public journal. His forte lay in compressing into a small compass of well arranged thoughts and well chosen words, what ordinary writers would spread over columns with a flux de paroles.\n\nTo his earnest pursuit, as a legislator, of what seemed to him to be for the public good, ample testimony is afforded by the statute book of the province, and the journals of the legislative bodies to which he belonged.\nAs a member of society, sincerely aiming at the welfare of all, he was remarkable for the absence of self-seeking\u2014carried even to the extent of sacrificing or neglecting his personal interest;\u2014this freedom from selfish views, and his clear integrity, kept him out of the vortex of those petty intrigues, which, in colonies especially, are often used by meaner minds, as the crooked paths to attain wealth or power;\u2014if he had a feeling of contempt for any persons, it was for those who trod such paths.\n\nLifting the veil of private life, which it were only fitting to do in these pages, there he was seen the head of a family regarded by him, and he by them, with unbounded affection, and the most unrestrained confidence. In his personal friendship in society, his moderation and openness of character insured their constancy. If ever a man became his enemy, it was because he chose to be so. Of enmity to others he seemed to be incapable, except \"the strong antipathy of good to bad,\"\u2014and if occasionally an observation was made to him, on the misrepresentations of his conduct and opinions to which, as must happen in political discussions, he was often exposed, he would reply with a smile,\u2014\"never mind, wait a while, and let us in the meantime only return good for evil.\"\n\nIn social intercourse he was remarkable for a natural good breeding, a constant cheerfulness, good humor and pleasantry, that shewed a mind and heart well poised and tempered within; habitually under the influence of true benevolence, disturbed by no angry passions, and enjoying \"the ceaseless sunshine of a kindly breast.\"\n\nIn his personal habits he was not only temperate but abstemious in his mode of living\u2014active in mind and body\u2014fond of rural and sylvan life, and of the wild scenes of nature. He had built a lonely cabane on one of the mountains overlooking the valleys through which the Jacques Cartier river finds its way from the north; and here he loved sometimes to resort, and enjoy the unbounded solitude. Even in the last year of his life he expressed a wish to explore the wilderness through which that river flows, and onwards to Lake St. John, and proposed to make up a party for the purpose, as a winter excursion.\n\nMr. Neilson's funeral took place on the 4th of February. He was interred according to his often expressed desire, in the burial ground which had been given by himself to the Presbyterian church at Valcartier, a settlement about sixteen miles from Quebec, in the progress and prosperity of which he had always taken a deep interest. To that romantic spot his remains were followed by a long cortege of mourners, on one of the stormiest days of the season. But the funeral service over him was in St. Andrew's church, Quebec, which was crowded with citizens, both of French and British origin. An extract from the address of the Reverend Dr. Cook on that occasion may appropriately conclude this notice.\n\"It is a saying of the great apostle\u2014'no man dieth unto himself:' and in the widest sense of which the words are capable, it is a saying which holds emphatically true. By the unalterable arrangements of the Divine Providence, we are bound together in too many and too close relations, ever to remain altogether unaffected by what breaks up and dissolves these relations for ever. Even in the case of the humblest individual in society, and the most isolated from the ordinary relations of kindred and love, there is power to reach our hearts and to awaken our sensibilities, in many tokens, however rude and simple, by which we are made aware that a human spirit has departed; that with another of our race, the work and the battle of this life are over, and the mystery of a new life begun. We feel the tie of brotherhood with the departed. We recognize in what hath befallen him, the common destiny of all; and we give way to an awe, which is neither ignoble in a rational spirit, nor unworthy of a Christian believer, while anticipating so great an event in the progress of our being as that which is to separate us for ever from this world of living men, and to place us amidst the interests, the employments and the retributions of the world invisible.\n\n\"But seldom is it, indeed, that any one passes away from this life, without affording proof more ample and direct, that he died not to himself\u2014that in the great change which had come over him, he was not alone interested. In the neighborhood to which a man belonged; in the circle of society, however small, in which he moved; among the friends and associates with whom he was in daily converse and communion, his loss is felt; and, at all events, in the household to which he belonged, there are some whose hearts are wounded, and on whose relations with this life, and their condition in it, a serious and irrevocable change has been effected. Seldom does any one pass away unmourned and unmissed by all. God hath not bound together the children of the human family with ties so loose and uncertain.\n\n\"The feeling of loss and mournful regret over the ashes of the dead, by which we bear testimony that the departed died not to themselves alone, must of course be extensive in its range, and intense in degree, in proportion to the place which they who are gone, held in the public eye, and the public estimation; to the talents which they had displayed; to the public services which they had rendered; to the worth of their character; to the kindness of their nature; to the existence and exercise within them of those affections which win our love, and those higher principles which command our esteem and admiration. Where these have been eminent; where these have been long acknowledged; death comes not to the individual alone, nor to the sanctuary of domestic affection, but it carries sadness into the general community, and each feels as if a friend and a benefactor had passed away.\"\n\"Let it be one, for example, who for more than fifty years had been known in a community, as a good and valuable citizen; who had early established a character for inflexible honor and uprightness, and continued to bear it to the last; in whom steady application to the duties of life, and purity of moral principle, were combined with the powers of a singularly shrewd and clear and perspicacious understanding, and a promptness to bring the strength of his understanding, and the weight of his character to bear upon every measure that was designed to promote the general good; let it be one, too, who was known to all, and had a word of kindness for every one; to whom the humblest could have access for advice and assistance, who was at once liberal and unostentatious in his charity, who treated his dependents rather as his friends and his children, than as inferiors, and manifested ever, in his whole bearing and intercourse with society, that genuine and unassuming simplicity, which is the characteristic of a noble nature; can such a one be said, in passing away from this life to 'die unto himself'? Is there not a general loss under which all suffer, and their sense of which it is natural and reasonable that (in humble submission to the will of Providence), they should openly and earnestly express?\n\n\"And the supposition we have made may be still farther extended. Let such a one, with all the claims to respect in a limited community, which we have now been describing, have also for a long period of time applied his talents to the higher duties of the legislator and the statesman, with honor to himself and advantage to the public; let him have set an example, known and acknowledged by all, and but too rare in the unhealthy atmosphere of provincial politics, of a perfectly honest and independent man, actuated by no selfish motives; seeking no personal advantage, deferring neither to the men in power, nor to the popular leaders, when in his own clear judgment, he thought either in the wrong; ready to co-operate with any party, up to the point, that in his conscientious opinion, they were seeking the public good, and their efforts tending to promote it; sure to leave and to oppose them, the moment they overstepped that point, without regard to party connections, or the abuse which his independent conduct could not fail to bring down upon him, and that too, from different points in the political compass; the determined foe of every abuse in the executive government, and yet in whom unflinching loyalty was not the dictate of convenience and temporary expediency, but a principle of honor and conscience, which his reason approved, and to tamper with which, he counted a crime, to be regarded with abhorrence. Let such a one be called away from the midst of us, and shall there not be a yet deeper and more wide-spread conviction of the public loss; token that as he had not lived, so he did not die to himself alone?\"\n\"And persons connected with Canada.\"\n\n\"Once more let us extend this supposed case, into another sphere of public labor and usefulness. It is not easy to set too high a value on the power of the press in these times, to influence the public mind for good or for evil. And he who has the opportunity of expressing his opinions to the public in a widely circulated and frequently published journal, and the capacity of expressing these opinions tersely and clearly, setting them forth in the fairest light, supporting them with argument, and illustrating and enforcing them with facts drawn from a capacious and well stored memory, cannot fail to be, to a very considerable extent, the corrupter or the benefactor of the community. Let such a one then, as we have before described, be for a long series of years in possession of this powerful engine for influencing the public mind; and let him use it for wise and good purposes, not so as that wise good men may not sometimes differ from him in opinion, yet so as that all shall acknowledge the purity of his motives and the general soundness of his principles; let it never be turned into a vehicle for slander or personal malignity; let the sacred sanctions of religion and morality be ever treated with reverence, and solemnly enforced on every proper occasion; let the benefits of industry, and order, and general education be unceasingly inculcated; let a sober tone of feeling be expressed respecting the possible benefits of political measures and political changes, and the necessity be ever shown, of personal exertion, and moral principle, in private individuals, to the general prosperity of the country; let all this be taught from day to day, and from year to year, till it fails not materially to influence the public mind; and let the career of the editor be closed, without giving cause for making one personal enemy, and with a few short and simple sentences embodying the principles, moral and political, which he had cherished for a life time, and forming, though without any such purpose on his part, a befitting charge with which to close the scene of life, would not the public calamity be unspeakably enhanced, in the loss of such an able and sober-minded instructor and guide of public opinion?\n\n\"My friends and fellow-citizens, I need not say, it is such a calamity under which we are now suffering. It is the loss of such a man we this day deplore\u2014which, coming unexpectedly on us, has thrown a gloom over our whole community, and has brought us in solemn mourning to the house of God. It has not been at all my aim, in what I have said, to delineate fully the character of the eminent and venerable man whose ashes are this day to be laid in the dust. That will be done by others better fitted for executing the task. Already, one who served him faithfully for fifteen years, has paid an affectionate tribute to his memory; and another may be expected from an old and much esteemed friend. I have but indicated such claims to the public respect as all will acknowledge.\"\nthat he possessed. The faults and frailties which cleave to all men, it little behoves us to remember, in the case of those who have passed from the judgment of man to the judgment of God. These we leave to Him, who doing ever right, is yet unspeakably more merciful and loving than the best and most benevolent of men. It is the good in the departed which it behoves us to remember; and to remember that we may imitate it. And long, I trust, it will be, ere the memory pass away from this community, of the private and public virtues of him, whose remains now lie before us; or ere that memory cease to have a powerful and beneficial efficacy on those who cherish it.\"\n\nJOHN CHARLTON FISHER, Esq., LL. D.\n\nDr. Fisher, was a gentleman of high literary attainments, and, as a Canadian journalist, very few could cope with or excel him. Previous to his connection with Canada, he was the proprietor and editor of the New York Albion, a journal which he founded, and which still exists and flourishes. Invited to Canada in 1823 to conduct the Official Gazette, by authority, under the administration of the Earl of Dalhousie, his paper was managed in a way which gained him the approbation of scholars, of persons fond of lighter literature of the day, and of all those who sincerely desired to see British supremacy, and an affectionate acknowledgment of the advantages it conferred upon Canadian colonists, duly understood and appreciated. In this task he worked fearlessly and incessantly, and continued until, in the year 1831, he was directed to suspend his political articles, as they were not in accordance with the views of the party then in the ascendent in the mother country; and his Quebec Gazette, by authority, was (as its contemporary, the Upper Canada Gazette, published by Mr. Stanton, had previously been) reduced to a mere official sheet, in fact, assimilated to the London Gazette in the mother country. He edited the Quebec Mercury for some years, and in 1841 started the Conservative, a weekly journal. Speaking of this, the Mercury, the great authority in those days, said:\n\n\"Of the manner, in which this new candidate for public favor will be conducted, we may safely say, that the well known urbanity of the editor, his classical knowledge and good taste, will render it the most polished public print published on this continent. It will contain candid views of politics, and its literary character will...\"\nbe of the first order. In short it will be a publication, which if duly encouraged, will be found in the house of every truly loyal British subject; and one which may be laid on the drawing room table of the most refined, for its literary articles, and be advantageously read by persons of all classes for the sound and loyal principles it will inculcate.\"\n\nHe was president, and an active, energetic and useful member of the Quebec Literary and Historical Society, which it is not too much to say, he raised by his superior talents, to the high standing held by the society, previous to the burning of its museum and collections.\n\nHe died on board the Sarah Sands, steamship, in September, 1849, whilst returning from England, whither he had gone for the benefit of his health.\n\nS. J. BURTON, Esq.\n\nSamuel Judge Burton, Esquire, Collector of Customs at Freilighsburgh, where he died on the 10th November, 1845, was the son of a dignitary of the Church of England. He had served with credit, in the 76th Regiment, during part of the Peninsular war, and having embarked at Bordeaux, for America, he eventually settled and married in Canada. He was distinguished as an agriculturist and horticulturist, combining and applying, very happily to this country, the most approved modern theory and practice. He introduced the art of macadamising roads into the province, and conferred a lasting benefit on the inhabitants of the vicinity of Quebec, by converting an impracticable morass into an excellent road. In the commission of the peace for upwards of twenty years, and at the head of a corps of volunteers during the late rebellion, he was conspicuous for his impartiality, rectitude, humanity and firmness. His decease was hastened, if not caused by fatigue, privation, and exposure, towards the fall of the year, in the zealous discharge of his duties. In him, society lost an accomplished gentleman, the provincial government a valuable and conscientious servant, and the Queen a devoted subject.\nREV. DANIEL WILKIE, LL.D.\n\nDr. Wilkie was born in Scotland in the year 1777. He was the youngest of twelve children, and was left an orphan at an early age. His education, from first to last, was with a view to the ministry, and his brothers, under whose care he fell, contributed out of their scanty resources the necessary means. In 1789 he entered the grammar school of Hamilton, and in 1794 commenced his collegiate course at the university of Glasgow, under Professors Jardine and Young. In 1797 he entered the divinity hall, and in 1803 competed successfully for the first university prize, a silver medal, for an essay on the Socinian controversy. He came to Canada in the same year, and in 1804 was licensed to preach by the Presbytery of Montreal. He took up his residence in Quebec, and during the next forty years was actively and successfully employed as a teacher. Many of his pupils have occupied, and do still occupy, distinguished places on the bench, at the bar, and in the legislature of this country. He took an active part in every association designed to advance literature, science, or art, and many of his metaphysical and scientific productions appeared in the periodicals of the day. He was editor of the Star newspaper during the three years of its existence, the first number of which appeared in December, 1827. The design of the publication was to correct, if possible, the extremes into which the press in the province had fallen, of indiscriminate praise and indiscriminate censure of the administration of Lord Dalhousie. The undertaking was made by the late Andrew Stuart, Esq., who entered into it with his whole heart and soul, contributing most valuable articles on general subjects, but more especially on legal and constitutional questions. Dr. Wilkie wrote, in all cases, the editorial portion, and contributed many long articles on educational and literary subjects.\n\nIn 1843, at the foundation of the high school, he was appointed rector of that institution, but advancing age compelled him to retire from the active duties of his profession before the end of the year. The remaining years of his life were spent in retirement. The first symptoms of disease appeared in 1845, and he died in 1851. He was buried in Mount Hermon cemetery, where a handsome monument has been erected to his memory. It bears the following inscription:\n\nDaniel Wilkie, LL.D.\nBorn at Tollcross, Scotland, 1777.\nSettled at Quebec in 1803,\nWhere he died on the 10th May, 1851.\nHe was a learned scholar;\nAn indefatigable student of philosophy and letters;\nAn able and successful instructor of youth;\nOf genuine uprightness and guileless simplicity;\nA devout, benevolent, and public spirited man;\nCommanding through a long life\nthe respect and esteem\nOf the community in which he lived.\n\nThis monument\nis erected by his pupils,\nin grateful remembrance of his services,\nand as a memorial\nof their deep and earnest veneration for\nhis character and virtues.\n\nQuis desiderio sit pudor, aut modus\nTam cari capitis?\n\nWe close the notice of this \"good old man,\" with the address delivered on the day of his burial, by the Rev. Dr. Cook, Quebec:\n\n\"In the Providence of God we have been called together, this day, to commit the ashes of an old and much valued friend to the dust: an office of brotherhood, with which we are but too familiar, and which we must expect to continue to perform till we are ourselves summoned away from this mortal life, and others have to discharge the same duty to us. It is not, however, with common feelings, that we now discharge this common duty. Ordinarily, death comes among us suddenly\u2014sternly. By a few days or weeks of suffering his work is accomplished, and when we meet to lay the body, which has been despoiled of its immortal inhabitant, in the grave, it is with the painful feeling of a recent and mournful separation.\n\nBut so it is not in the present instance. In the case of the venerable individual, around whose mortal remains we now stand, the separation had long been accomplished; separation from the world and its interests; separation from society and its duties; separation from communion with even the nearest and dearest of his friends, almost as complete as that which has now taken place. He had dropped out of his usual place in society. He had ceased to appear in circles, where for so long a period his face and figure were familiar. He had already, while life was still lingering on in its last stages, begun to pass away from the common remembrance. The place that had once known him, was beginning to know him no more. And the announcement of his actual departure and the mournful solemnities, in which we are now engaged, serve less to excite any painful feeling of separation, than to recall\nvividly to the mind the image and memory of one, who had already been long removed from us.\n\n\"I wish I could set before you, in a few plain words, what is thus recalled to the minds of all, giving expression to the common opinion and the common feeling; but it is little necessary. You have before you more vividly than I could represent them, the form and figure of the old philosopher, moving slowly, and sometimes incongruously enough, in the midst of our busy community,\u2014obviously abstracted from the common interests;\u2014little occupied with common objects of desire and ambition, and dwelling in a world of his own; a world of speculation; a world of theories and fancies, and doubtings, but into which, none of the mean or sordid, or selfish passions of the actual world ever found their way. You know as well as I can describe them, the guileless simplicity of his nature; his inflexible integrity; his perfect frankness and sincerity; his genuine benevolence; his unaffected courtesy.\n\n\"There will, I trust, be borne other and more valuable and more permanent testimony than any that could come from me, to the important services which, for the long period of forty years, he rendered to this city as a teacher of youth\u2014the indefatigable earnestness and the successful results of his labors in that toilsome and ill-requited but most honorable profession\u2014and his persevering and zealous efforts to keep up a high standard of education, in a community but too much inclined to limit education to the more immediate wants of commercial business. From first to last, without aid or countenance from the provincial authorities, nay, and while these were sometimes actively opposed to him, he maintained in this latter respect his steady and unyielding course, and so conferred a benefit on the community, great in itself, and to which no other person of the same profession can assert anything like an equal claim.\n\n\"It will be for others also to bear witness to his zeal and efficiency in supporting every literary and educational institution; every means by which the intellectual improvement of the community could be promoted. He was indeed, and showed it when required, by sacrifices and personal exertion such as few are inclined to make, of a large, a public, a patriotic, and a philanthropic spirit. And in regard of the highest of all subjects, in regard of religion, whose office it is to bind men to God and to one another, while from the turn of his mind, and the circumstances of his education, he was prone to indulge in speculations, and, perhaps, reached conclusions with which we might be little inclined to agree, yet were both his daily conduct and his devotional temper in accordance with the faith which he had been early taught, and the simple worship on which he regularly waited, and I feel it is a good and holy wish I utter for myself and you when I desire that we all may have and cherish such profound reverence and love for the Lord\nJesus Christ as he felt and continued to feel, I do believe, as long as he was capable of feeling; for blessed, and only blessed are they, who love Christ, and whose hope is founded upon Him.\n\n\"It was a mournful spectacle\u2014the bodily and mental decline of this good and valuable man; a decline which proceeded till only the elements of his original character remained\u2014his devotional temper\u2014his domestic affections\u2014his genuine kindness and courtesy. These continued with him to the last. And it was striking to observe, and not without a lesson to those entrusted with the teaching and training of the youthful mind, how in the 'deepening twilight of his powers' when he could indulge no longer in moral and metaphysical speculations, when he was incapable of comprehending the most elementary principles of geometry or arithmetic, and the pages of classic literature, with which he had been familiar, had entirely faded from his remembrance, the words of divine truth still dwelt in his mind, and it was still possible to draw from him the petitions of the prayer which Christ taught his disciples, or the verses of the twenty-third psalm, in that simple version which is sacred in the associations of every Scottish churchman. Surely it is good that that which was best remained the longest. And it is wise to lay up in the mind first that which is best.\n\n\"But if his gradual decline was a spectacle mournful to his friends it was not, we may be sure, without its use. It is reasonable to believe that in the arrangements of the divine providence it answered important ends to himself. It gave opportunity for a most touching and impressive exhibition of devotedness in the aged partner of his life. And it emphatically called on all, while in the full exercise of their powers to give heed to the things which concern their everlasting peace, instant and immediate heed; since even before this life comes to an end, it may altogether cease to be available, in order to a preparation for the life eternal.\n\n\"That call, brethren, I would now repeat, to you and to myself. Now is the accepted time and the day of salvation. Oh! let us each say with our great Lord: 'I must work the work of him who sent me, while it is day; the night cometh when no man can work.' And let us cherish, through the faith of Christ, the blessed conviction that though 'the earthly house of our tabernacle be dissolved, we have a building of God; a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.'\"\nMAJOR-GENERAL F. HERRIOT, C.B.\n\nGeneral Herriot was a resident of Drummondville, Canada West, where he died. He was a gallant military officer, and had fought in more than one battle during the American war of 1812, in Canada. He was also a member of our provincial Parliament; and was born in Jersey on the 2nd January, 1766. He was second in command under De Salaberry at Chateauguay, and for his military services was made a C.B. After the war he retired to Drummondville, which we believe he had founded and settled. On the birth of the Prince of Wales, he was promoted to the rank of major-general; he was also provincial aide-de-camp, and member of the Executive Council, as well as of the Assembly. His death took place at his residence, Comfort Hall, on the 30th December, 1844.\n\nGeneral Herriot had secured the attachment of a numerous circle of friends and acquaintances both in public and private life, by his kind and conciliatory manners, as well as by his benevolence and charitable disposition, both of which were unbounded. Of the village of Drummondville he may truly be said to have been the father and founder, having retired there, on half pay, in 1816, with a number of veterans and pensioners from the different corps disbanded in the province after the late war; his Majesty having rewarded his active and meritorious services by a large grant of land situated chiefly in the county of Grantham, of which the village forms a part.\n\nHON. JAMES CROOKS, M.L.C.\n\nWe think it due to the memory of the above enterprising gentleman to include in this collection a short notice of him. He was one of the first settlers in Upper Canada, and one of the first to lead the van in home and local enterprises, which at the present day so distinguish the enlightened and intelligent people of the western section of the province, and goes far to stamp them as a wealthy, thriving, and industrious class of subjects.\n\nMr. Crooks was an ancient resident of Niagara, having emigrated thither from Scotland, in 1794. He established himself as a\nmerchant; and it was he who sent the first load of wheat and the first load of flour from the upper province to Montreal, which, in those days, was both a matter of difficulty and danger. He was elected a member of the legislature of Upper Canada; and, during the war of 1812, took part on our side in the struggle that ensued for the mastery of Canada. He was in command of a company of the 1st Lincoln militia, and fought gallantly at Queenston and other places. He was a member of the Legislative Council for twenty-five years, and always bore himself in that body, as an honest and consistent man, favoring neither party, being perfectly independent in his views. The Honorable Mr. Crooks established the first paper mill in Upper Canada, and carried it on successfully for many years; but he grew tired of business as old age wore on, and finally abandoned the paper-making business. The facilities at his command were limited, because the demand for paper was light, yet the Flamborough paper mill supplied the wants of the entire community then; now the case is different, and such an establishment would do but little in keeping up a supply for the newspaper offices within range of the old mill. His death occurred at Flamborough West, on the 2nd March, 1860. He was in the 82nd year of his age, having been born in Kilmarnock, Scotland, in 1778. His demise caused very general regret among his numerous friends and acquaintances.\n\nLIEUT.-COLONEL JOHNSTON, C.B.\n\nColonel Johnston, long a resident of the county of Haldimand, C.W., was born in 1769. He entered the military service in 1784, and was employed with the army in reducing the important fortress of Dharwar, and in the field through the Mahratta war; was in the leading party at the storming of Seringapatam; appointed deputy quarter-master general of the force under the late Duke of Wellington, (then Sir Arthur Wellesley), and took an active share in the labors of the memorable battle of Assaye; during a cessation of hostilities he assisted in the survey of the Ghaut Mountains, in the Deccan, a most arduous and perilous task; and afterwards was appointed quarter-master general of the Bombay army, and retired from the honorable East India Company's service, after forty years active service. He was created compa-\nnion of the Bath by his Majesty George IV., a distinction, at that period, seldom conferred on officers of the Indian army. Colonel Johnston died at his seat, \"The Retreat,\" near Dunnville, C.W., in February, 1816.\n\n---\n\nHON. SIR JOHN CALDWELL, BART.\n\nHe was the eldest son of Sir James Caldwell, the third baronet, (who was made a Count of Milan by the Empress Maria-Theresa), by Elizabeth, daughter of the Most Reverend Josiah Hort, Lord Archbishop of Tuam, and the Honorable Elizabeth Fitzmaurice, daughter of William, 20th Lord Kerry. He succeeded his father in 1784; and married Harriet, daughter of Hugh Meynell, Esq. He was connected with Canada through his appointment of receiver-general of the lower province. During the time he held that office, he was found to be in default with the province for a very large sum of the public monies, which, however, we believe was afterwards partly refunded by the sale of his large property in Canada.\n\nHe died at Ramsgate, in June, 1830, and left a son (the late Sir Henry Caldwell) to inherit his title.\n\n---\n\nHON. JAMES McGILL.\n\nA notice of the distinguished philanthropist and benefactor, James McGill, to whom Montreal owes so much for founding and endowing the noble university which bears his name, may not be inappropriate in this collection.\n\nMr. McGill was a native of Glasgow, in Scotland, having been born in that city on the 6th of October, 1744. He came to this country at an early age, and immediately engaged in mercantile pursuits, in which he was most successful, amassing a large and handsome fortune as the fruits of his exertions. He was successively a member of the Parliament of Lower Canada for the city\nof Montreal, and member of the Legislative and Executive Councils; he was also an officer in the militia, and rose to the high rank of brigadier-general in the war of 1812.\n\nMr. McGill was distinguished for his charity, his sound practical judgment and his kindness of heart; he mixed much in society, both English and French, being connected with the latter by marriage. He died on the 19th December, 1813, being sixty-nine years of age, in the city of Montreal, where he had resided ever since he came to Canada, and where for his liberality, goodness of heart, and philanthropical munificence, he left behind him a monument of his worth, which will assuredly carry his name down to posterity with honor and distinction.\n\nHe married on the 2nd December, 1776, Charlotte Guillemin, daughter of the late Guillaume Guillemin, in his lifetime councillor of the King of France, in Canada, lieutenant-general of the admiralty of Quebec, and judge of the Court of Prerogatives, and widow of the late Fran\u00e7ois Amable Trottier Des Rivi\u00e8res.\n\n---\n\nLIEUTENANT MACPHERSON.\n\nAllan Macpherson, Esquire, of Orillia, C. W., was one of that gallant band of heroes who defended the honor of Britain during the eventful period from the French revolution to the peace of 1815, and whose deeds of valor form one of the most splendid pages in the annals of British history. Of those noble veterans, a scattered remnant, fast disappearing before the onsets of death, is still to be found in the recesses of our forest land, and forms an influential and interesting portion of our people. Entering the army at the age of seventeen, Lieutenant Macpherson fought at the battle of Maida, in the 78th Highlanders, that gallant corps which has, under the immortal Havelock, achieved for itself such undying fame. For his brave conduct at that action he received a medal. He subsequently accompanied his regiment to Egypt, where he suffered severely from ophthalmia, like many of his fellow soldiers in that land. He next assisted in forming and drilling the Royal Sicilian Regiment, of which he was adjutant. He was put on half-pay in 1815, came to Canada in 1835, and thus exchanged the sword for the ploughshare. He became one of our most spirited and enterprising settlers. A Highlander by birth, he possessed much of the spirit of his countrymen, warm-hearted, friendly, and energetic.\nHe was indeed a worthy representative of a Highland gentleman, and did honor to that gallant people, whose noble deeds, whether at Waterloo, Balaclava, Inkerman or Lucknow, have won immortal laurels. He died at his residence at Orillia, in 1859.\n\nWILLIAM KEMBLE, Esq.,\n\nA TALENTED Canadian journalist; born in 1781; died at Quebec, on the 25th of February, 1845. He was formerly of Clapham Common, Surrey, England, and a member of a distinguished mercantile family in London, one of whom, at the period of Mr. Kemble's death, was a member in the Imperial Parliament, for the county above mentioned. As editor of the Quebec Mercury, from 1823 to 1842, he greatly distinguished himself as a writer, and the spirit and raciness which characterized his writings will long be remembered. His talents were of a high order. He was also a valuable contributor to many periodicals, including the celebrated Simmonds Colonial Magazine, of London, England.\n\nDAVID THOMPSON, Esq.\n\nMR. THOMPSON, during a residence of nearly twenty years in the township of Glengarry, was favorably known for his kindness and generosity of character, and as one of the magistrates of the county, discharged his duties with the greatest integrity. He was many years a partner in the late North West Company, during which time he was professionally employed in exploring those vast regions towards the Columbia river and Pacific ocean, and of which he has left maps and charts, conveying a minute description of the country as to soil, climate, &c., which must at this period, when there is a prospect of these regions being more closely connected with Canada, be of infinite value. Mr. Thompson, previous to his death in 1856, was employed as astronomical surveyor, on\nthe part of the British government, attached to the commission for defining the boundary line between the United States and Canada.\n\nSIR DAVID JONES.\n\nBorn 1794; died 23rd August, 1838, at Brookville, C.W., where he and his family had long resided. Few men were more respected and none could be held in higher estimation by his countrymen. In private life he was an uncompromising supporter of British interests. He visited England in 1835, as agent for the Brockville \"Loan and Trust Company,\" at which time he received the order of knighthood from his Majesty William IV., at Windsor Castle, being the first native of the province who had the honor of receiving so distinguished a mark of royal favor. He died after an illness of only five days; his death casting a gloom over his native place.\n\nRIGHT HON. THE EARL OF GOSFORD, G.C.B.\n\nThis distinguished nobleman was the second earl of the same name, who held the office of governor-general of Canada, and continued in that office two years and a half, having arrived at Quebec in August, 1835, and left on the 26th February, 1838. He was chief of a commission of inquiry and pacification, whose labors, it was hoped by ministers, would have led to the adjustment of all political differences, and the establishment of the provincial government upon a firm and liberal footing, the grand principles of the British constitution being always kept in view. That the mission failed in its object is a matter of notoriety; and that terms, which have been accepted with thankfulness by the other British American colonies had been factiously rejected by Lower Canada, is also too well known to render it necessary that we should further dwell upon the subject on this occasion. That Lord Gosford, as governor-in-\nchief, executed the instructions of concession and conciliation, which had been imparted to him, to their full extent, is equally well-known. Indeed he pushed his courtesy to the utmost bound, and still held out the olive branch, when the enemies of the constitution and of British connection were sharpening their swords in the hope of overthrowing the government, and of severing that tie by which the province has been raised to its rank in the British colonial possessions; whilst the religion, the institutions, language, and laws of the inhabitants have been preserved inviolate. At length the undisguised language of the declaration, at the meeting of the six counties, held at St. Charles on the 23rd of October 1837, too plainly proved that the endeavor at governing Lower Canada under the existing constitution was a hopeless task; and Lord Gosford then apprised her Majesty's ministers of his thorough conviction of the necessity of changing the conciliatory policy which had been hitherto pursued for measures of a sterner character; and, at the same time, he declared his inability to conduct the government under the instructions by which he had to that time been guided, adding that if he stood in the way, from his adherence to those instructions, of the full execution of the measures which had obviously become necessary, he was willing to resign the trust that had been confided to him, and begged to be relieved from his charge. Her Majesty's ministers, whilst they fully concurred in all that his lordship had done in the government of this colony, and expressed their approbation of the manner in which his important duties had been discharged, consented to his lordship's return to Britain, and sent instructions to his Excellency Lieutenant-General Sir John Colborne to assume the reins of government upon his lordship's departure. This transfer of authority took place. Whatever errors Lord Gosford may have committed during the short but eventful period of his administration, no man can question his motives; we believe that none will be found so rancorous in their censure of his conduct as to question the purity of his intentions or the benevolence of his views. But having been instructed to endeavor to form a government by uniting the most moderate of the two political parties, his lordship pursued this object with an earnestness that caused him to lend too ready an ear to the representations of designing men, who affected to secede from the majority of the Assembly, only to forward their views of personal advancement; and, unhappily, these were too successful in palming their pseudo-loyalty upon the noble lord, and producing a far more favorable impression than their previous conduct, considered along with their after professions, ought to have obtained for them. That Lord Gosford did not succeed in administering the government of Lower Canada, and calming the dissensions by which it was torn, cannot be imputed to his memory as a disgrace, his predecessors for years had not been more fortu-\nnate, and if open rebellion pretended to have been provoked by the necessary interference of the Imperial Parliament in the concerns of the colony, broke out under the conciliatory policy enjoined by his instructions, it is fully obvious that such an outbreak would not have been averted had coercion been resorted to at an earlier period. An appeal to force might have produced for the insurgents a strong sympathy among the people of the United Kingdom and even in the Imperial Parliament, under the idea that they had been driven to desperation by arbitrary and oppressive conduct pursued towards them; whereas they stood prominent as reckless and ungrateful rebels, who refused concessions which had been thankfully received by every other province in British America, and had been seduced by their own vanity, and the vaunts of their unprincipled chiefs, to wage an unprovoked war against the mother country, without even the most distant prospect of success to cloak the crime of treason in the mantle of revolution.\n\nHe married 20th July, 1805, Mary only daughter of Robert Sparrow, Esquire, of Worlingham Hall, Suffolk. She was lineally descended from Thomas Sparrowe of Somersam, living A.D. 1419, and by her had issue one son (present peer) and four daughters.\n\nThe Earl of Gosford died in England on the 29th March 1849.\n\n---\n\nLIEUT.-GENERAL SIR GEORGE GIPPS.\n\nIt being our province to give the particulars of the lives of all those celebrated men who have in any way been connected with Canada, we place next on the list the above distinguished civil and military officer who, as will appear, bore a very important part in the affairs of this country, at a time when we were really in an alarming predicament.\n\nWe will not enter into the details concerning the early portion of his distinguished career; but will content ourselves with giving the simple facts and adding the various and important civil employments in which he was engaged previous to and at his death. Together they extend over a period of thirty-eight years, and are such as to entitle him to an honorable rank among the best servants of his country.\n\nSir George was born about the year 1791. His father was the Rev. George Gipps, rector of Ringwould in the county of Kent. His commissions in the honorable corps to which he had the honor\nto belong, are dated respectively, second lieutenant, 11th January, 1809; first lieutenant, 21st December 1809; second captain, 30th September, 1814; first captain, 8th April, 1826; brevet-major, 10th January, 1837; regimental lieutenant-colonel 23rd October, 1841.\n\nIn 1811 he was ordered to join the army in the Peninsula, and was present at the successful siege of Badajos, in March and April, 1812. Whilst leading one of the columns of assault on Fort Picurina, he was wounded in the left arm; and for his gallant conduct on the occasion he was specially mentioned in the Duke of Wellington's public despatches. In 1813 and 1814 he was with Sir John Murray's army in Catalonia, and took part in the affair of the pass of Biar, the battle of Castella, the capture of Fort Balaquer, (for which service he was again honorably mentioned in the despatches of Sir J. Murray) in the siege of Terragonna, and blockade of Barcelona. From November, 1814, to July, 1817, he served with the Duke of Wellington's army in the Netherlands and France; but he was not present at the battle of Waterloo, having been detached some time previously for the purpose of putting the fortress of Ostend into a state of defense. Subsequently to the withdrawal of the army of occupation from the French territory, Sir George was permitted to remain some time out of active service, and availed himself of this opportunity to visit Germany, Italy, Egypt, Syria, Turkey and Greece. After further military duty at Chatham, he proceeded in October, 1824, to the West Indies, and at the expiration of that service he visited Mexico, and returned to England in December, 1829. The able representations which he made during this period on the subject of the emancipation of the slaves in those particular colonies, with which he was immediately acquainted, so strongly impressed the ministry of the day with his capacity for civil business, that after his return, whilst in command of the Royal Engineers at Sheerness, he was nominated on two successive governments commissions, the one in Ireland and the other in England, on the subject of the proposed boundaries for constituencies, under the parliamentary reform and municipal corporations acts respectively.\n\nIn 1834 he was appointed private secretary to the Earl of Auckland, then first lord of the Admiralty; and in the subsequent year proceeded with the newly appointed governor-general of British North America, the Earl of Gosford, and the Right Honorable Sir Charles E. Grey, to Canada, as a commissioner \"for the investigation of grievances affecting her Majesty's subjects in that colony,\" which had been raised by Messrs. Papineau, Mackenzie & Co. But these men failing in their endeavors to obtain redress for their alleged \"grievances,\" excited and fomented a portion of the people to rebellion. Sir George, on this occasion, received the honor of knighthood. As to the success of the mission, we are all aware how unfortunate it was in its results; but this was not the fault of\nAND PERSONS CONNECTED WITH CANADA.\n\nthose that composed it. The blame lay at the door of another party, higher in office, and over whom they had no control or authority, and but for whom all would have gone on well; and the people of Canada would not have to blush for the part a portion of their countrymen played in 1837. Sir George returned home, after a brief excursion into the United States, in April, 1837; and in the course of the same year, received the appointment to a more arduous undertaking, the government-in-chief of the Australian colonies, and sailed for Sydney in the following October.\n\nThe anxieties of this high office, exercised under every succession of administrations, during a period of nine years, laid the foundation of that disease, which at the early age of fifty-six, deprived the country of the further services of a most able, talented and energetic officer. He died on the 28th February, 1847, of a complaint of the heart, within a few weeks after his return to England. His wife, whom he married in 1830, was a daughter of the late Major-General Ramsay, of the Royal Artillery, who with one son, their only child, are still living.\n\nRIGHT HON. SIR CHAS. E. GREY, G.C.H.\n\nThis learned and distinguished gentleman, who came to Canada in 1835, as one of the \"Three Gs,\" as they were called, but in other words, the royal commissioners, appointed for the adjustment of the affairs of this province, and which was composed of Gosford, Gipps, and Grey; is the son of Ralph William Grey, Esq., of Buckworth, Northumberland (descended from the Greys of Horton-castle) by the daughter of Charles Brandling, Esq., of Gosforth House, Northumberland; born, 1785; married, 1821; second daughter of Sir Samuel Clarke Jervoise, Bart., (she died 1850); educated at University college, Oxford, where he graduated B.A., 1806; obtained a fellowship at Oriel, and thence graduated M.A., 1810; author of the prize essay of 1808, on the \"Hereditary Rank;\" was called to the bar, at Lincoln's-Inn, 1811; appointed a bankrupt commissioner in 1817; a judge of the Supreme Court at Madras, in 1820 (on which occasion he was knighted); chief-justice of the Supreme Court at Bengal, in 1825, and commissioner for the affairs of Lower Canada, in 1835. On his return from this country he received the Hanoverian order; was governor of Barbadoes, St. Vincent, Tobago, Trinidad, St.\nLucia, &c., from February, 1841, to September, 1846, when he was appointed governor of Jamaica, (salary \u00a36,000). In 1837 was an unsuccessful candidate at the Tynemouth election; but, on petition, succeeded in obtaining his seat, which he held till 1841.\n\nCHIEF-JUSTICE Sir J. STUART, BART., LL.D.\n\nPerhaps there never existed a public man in Canada who possessed higher attainments and more gifted endowments of mind, or a more varied and extensive range of legal and other knowledge, than the eminent individual whose name heads this notice. No one, perhaps, ever exercised such power and influence in political circles, or controlled the destinies of the country with a more jealous eye and in a more guarded manner.\n\nSir James Stuart was the third son of the celebrated divine, Dr. John Stuart, then a clergyman of the Church of England at Fort Hunter, and afterwards rector of Kingston, a notice of whom we have given. Sir James was born at Fort Hunter, on the Mohawk river, in the state of New York, on the 2nd of March, 1780. After passing two years at school, in Schenectady, he went to the college at Windsor, in Nova Scotia, then the only Protestant collegiate institution in British North America. Having completed the ordinary course of study in that college, at the unusually early age of fourteen, he became, in 1794, a student-at-law with Mr. Reid, when prothonotary of the court of King's Bench at Montreal, with whom he remained four years. In 1798, he entered the office of the late Jonathan Sewell, then attorney-general, and afterwards chief-justice of Lower Canada. With this gentleman he completed his studies, and was called to the bar on the 28th of March, 1801. Before being called, however, he received from Sir Robert Shore Milnes, lieutenant-governor of Lower Canada, the appointment of assistant-secretary, which he retained for several years, practising at the same time his profession at Quebec.\n\nIn 1805, at the early age of twenty-five, he was appointed solicitor-general for Lower Canada, and removed to Montreal, which was the usual station of the incumbent of that office.\n\nAt the general election, in 1808, he was returned to represent the county of Montreal, and also the county of Buckingham, and declared his option to sit for Montreal. In 1809, in consequence of some difference with the executive, he was removed from the\noffice of solicitor-general. He remained a member of the Assembly until 1817, when he withdrew for a time from political life.\n\nIn December, 1822, he was sent to England as the delegate of the British inhabitants of the city and county of Montreal, to advocate the re-union of Upper and Lower Canada, under one legislature; and, while in England advocating that measure, he was offered by the British government the office of attorney-general for Lower Canada, which he accepted, and to which he was formally appointed in 1822.\n\nIn 1827, he was appointed a member of the Executive Council, and elected a member of the provincial Parliament for Sorel. In March, 1831, in consequence of the part which he held it his duty to take in the political struggle of the day, he was suspended from office by Lord Aylmer, the then governor-general, which suspension the colonial minister (Lord Goderich) thought it expedient to advise the Crown to confirm, in November, 1832; but in the following month of May, after the change in the administration, by which the Right Honorable Edward G. Stanley (now the Earl of Derby) became secretary-of-state for the colonies, Sir James received from him an official communication, acknowledging in effect the injustice of the decision against him, and accompanied by an offer of the office of chief-justice of Newfoundland, which was respectfully declined. Sir James then returned to Lower Canada, and resumed practice as an advocate, at Quebec.\n\nIn 1838, the Earl of Durham, after completing his well known enquiry into the state of the provinces, and before leaving Quebec on his return to England, appointed Sir James chief-justice of Lower Canada, in the place of the Honorable Jonathan Sewell, who retired upon a pension. In Lord Durham's despatch to Lord Glenelg, dated Castle of St. Louis, 20th October, 1838, the motives for this appointment are given in the following terms:\n\n\"In the place of Mr. Sewell, I have not hesitated a moment to appoint Mr. James Stuart. Public opinion, with so universal a consent, points out this gentleman as the ablest lawyer in the province, that there cannot be a doubt that it would be injustice and folly to place any other person in the highest judicial office of the province. It is especially necessary that in times like these, the capacious understanding, sound knowledge, and vigorous decision of Mr. Stuart should be employed in the public service.\"\n\nDuring the administration of Lord Seaton (then Sir John Colborne) he was a member of the special Council of Lower Canada, and acted as chairman of that body. And among the many useful acts of legislation which are generally attributed to his pen, is the first successful attempt to introduce into Lower Canada a system of registration of titles and claims to and upon real estate. The incorporation of the cities of Quebec and Montreal, and a general municipal system for Lower Canada, are also understood to\nbe his work; and his talents were also made available by Lord Sydenham in preparing the act to re-unite the provinces of Upper and Lower Canada, and for the government of Canada, passed by the British Parliament in 1840, and now forming the constitution of Canada.\n\nFor his eminent public services, he was created a baronet of the United Kingdom in 1840, on which occasion he selected for his motto: \"Justitiae propositique tenax,\" which few words contain an epitome of his character. He was married in 1818 to the only surviving daughter of Alexander Robertson, Esquire, of Montreal, and leaves four children, three sons, the eldest of whom inherits the baronetcy, and one daughter.\n\nHis practice as an advocate was of the most extensive and varied character, his eloquence and legal ability of the highest order; and of the estimation in which his rare qualities were held by his professional brethren, the resolutions of the bars of Quebec and Montreal, on the occasion of his death, which occurred on the 14th July, 1853, afford ample proof:\n\n\"At a meeting of the members of the bar of the Quebec section, held in their rooms on Friday, 15th instant, the following resolutions were unanimously adopted:\n\n\"Moved by the Hon. Henry Black, Q.C., seconded by Mr. Solicitor General Chaveau, and resolved:\n\n\"That the members of the bar have learned with the deepest sorrow the death of the Hon. Sir James Stuart, Baronet, chief-justice of the court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada, and as such, the head of the profession therein; and feel it right to record their high estimate of his abilities and character, and their profound sense of the loss which the profession has sustained by his decease.\"\n\n\"Moved by the Hon. R. E. Caron, Q.C., seconded by the Hon. F. W. Primrose, Q.C., and resolved:\n\n\"That throughout the long period of more than fifty years, during which Sir James was a member of the profession, and during a very great portion of which he held the highest professional rank and office, his great and varied learning, his profound legal research and attainments, his unwearied industry, and his inflexible integrity, have placed him among the foremost of the jurists of the day, and marked him as one of whom our country may be justly proud.\"\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nAt a meeting of the Montreal section of the bar of Lower Canada, on the 18th of July, 1853, besides the usual resolutions of condolence, the following were adopted:\n\n\"That the members of the Montreal section of the bar have received with emotions of deep regret the intelligence of the death of the late chief-justice, Sir James Stuart, who for several years\npast has occupied the position of head of the judiciary in this section of the province.\n\n\"That his acknowledged abilities and deep learning in his profession, obtained for him the respect of the bar, whilst his integrity in his judicial office, secured for him the confidence of the public generally.\"\n\n---\n\nHON. LOUIS JOSEPH PAPINEAU.\n\nThe Honorable Louis Joseph Papineau will be remarkable in history, chiefly as an agitator. Having all his life been in opposition, there are no tests by which to measure those administrative abilities which, because he never had an opportunity of displaying, his opponents have generally agreed in denying to him, for his appointment under Lord Dalhousie is no exception.\n\nThe father of the subject of this notice was born at Montreal, on the 16th October, 1752, and died, in the same city, shortly before attaining his 89th year. His commission as notary was dated on the 19th July, 1780. He was long a member of the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada, and his career was as active as his general conduct was honorable. In addressing the electors of Montreal in 1810, the elder Papineau said he had no other personal motive in wishing to be elected than a desire to consecrate his feeble talents to the support of the government and of our happy constitution; at the same time appealing to his past conduct as a proof of \"his fidelity to the king, as well as his zeal to sustain the interests of his Majesty's subjects in this province, without distinction of rank, situation or religion,\" and alleging that \"he had given proof of his devotion to the preservation of a strict union of the provinces with the mother country; and that he was still ready to expose his property and even his life for the preservation of the happiness we enjoy under the British government.\"\n\nSuch was the father of a man destined to become the most celebrated agitator that Canada has produced. The subject of this notice was born at Montreal, having first seen the light in October, 1789, two years before the passing of the constitutional act. He is, therefore, now 72 years of age. He is a well-preserved man, and has always, even during his eight years of exile, had abundant means of taking care of himself. His retirement from public life, however, may be regarded as definite. The Papineau family ori-\nginally emigrated from the South of France to Lower Canada towards the end of the seventeenth century. Louis Joseph was educated at the Seminary of Quebec, under the superintendence of the Roman Catholic priests of that city; a circumstance which did not prevent his opposition, in after years, to many claims and pretensions of the priests. He steadily opposed for many years the levying of tithes\u2014a twenty-sixth part, not a tenth, upon the grain produced by the Roman Catholics of Lower Canada. After his return from exile\u2014eight years spent pleasantly at Paris\u2014he changed his tone, and rather courted the favor of the clergy; but his opponents declared that this was a purely diplomatic move. Quitting college at the age of seventeen, he entered on the study of the law, and was called to the bar in 1811 or 1812.\n\nHis early inclinations led him to take an interest in political affairs; and while yet a student he had been, in 1809, elected a member of the Legislative Assembly, for the county of Kent, afterwards called Chambly. He started as he ended\u2014in opposition to the government. After representing this county for two sessions, he was for twenty successive years representative of the west ward of the city of Montreal. On his entrance into Parliament, he found in contest a subject which offered wide scope for agitation\u2014the control of the revenue, which was claimed by the legislature against the official party. Such use did M. Papineau, the younger, make of this question that, in 1812, by the time he had been called to the bar, he found himself leader of the young and enthusiastic Canadian minority. He and his party were strongly averse to the war with the United States, then on point of breaking out, but when war was inevitable, he did not shrink from bearing his part in it, and having entered the militia, he served as captain till the restoration of peace. He had command of the company that preceded the American prisoners who had been taken at Detroit, after the surrender of General Hull, into Montreal; but he indignantly wheeled out of line and refused to proceed while the prisoners were insulted by the band playing \"Yankee Doodle.\" Of a naturally polite and gentlemanly turn of mind, he could not, though ready to fight for his country, be induced to be a party to treating prisoners with discourtesy; and this, he declared, his duty to his country would never require of him.\n\nIn 1817 he was elected Speaker of the Lower Canada Assembly, a situation which he continued to fill for twenty years, at a salary of \u00a31,000 currency a year. He was the only member of the opposition who contrived to make his position profitable; and he has often been reproached with close-fistedness. There is no doubt that his coadjutors did feel that, while he received the only salary which a member of the opposition could obtain, it was not generous in him to leave the pecuniary burden of agitation to be borne entirely by those who were not so favored, who had nothing but what they\nsaved from their own private sources. Whether they took a correct view of the matter, it is not for us to inquire; it is sufficient that we place the matter on record.\n\nIn 1820, Lord Dalhousie assumed the governorship of Lower Canada. Observing the talents of M. Papineau, he appointed him executive councillor. This was done in face of the fact that M. Papineau had opposed the demand of the official party for a permanent civil list, a civil list for the life of the king, or, at the very least, the voting of the supplies en bloc. Next year, the house presented an address on grievances, to which the governor returned a polite answer. But things were destined to assume a different complexion between the popular leader and the governor. In 1827, Lord Dalhousie refused to sanction the election of M. Papineau as Speaker; and even went so far as to deprive him of his captaincy of the militia. A warm subject of debate\u2014although it was one over which the local legislature had no control\u2014was the proposal made in the Imperial Parliament, at the instance of Mr. Ellice, in 1822, to unite the provinces of Upper and Lower Canada, as was afterwards done in 1840. M. Papineau was and is a great stickler for the preservation of the French Canadian nationality; and in this respect he does not differ in the least from the rest of his race.\n\nThis love of nationality\u2014undying, and even gaining strength with time\u2014is the most powerful feeling that influences the French Canadians. M. Papineau then threw up his practice at the bar to devote his entire attention to politics; and although he received a certain indemnity in his Speaker's salary, it is doubtful whether he was not, like most other lawyers in Canada who have allowed politics to absorb their attention, a loser by the operation.\n\nM. Papineau was hearty in his opposition to the administrations of Lord Dalhousie and Aylmer, but there is no reason to believe that he comprehended what was required as a remedy for the evils of which he complained. Seeing that the official party set at naught the votes, declarations, and opinions of the Assembly, M. Papineau could think of no better remedy than to make the Legislative Council elective, that body being the instrument used by the oligarchy to thwart the wishes of the Assembly. He never thought that the true remedy would be to make the government, on whose advice appointments were made to the Legislative Council, responsible to the Assembly. In 1831 he first demanded an elective second chamber. The demand for elective institutions every day received new force under the leadership of M. Papineau; but a royal commission, appointed in 1835, with Lord Gosford at its head, reported against the various demands of the Assembly. In denouncing the report of the commission, M. Papineau in 1836, made the famous declaration, which is by a certain class regarded as prophetic, that \"not only were republican institutions to prevail...\"\nthroughout the whole of this continent, but America was destined to furnish at some future day republics to Europe.\"\n\nThe Imperial Parliament having, in 1837, undertaken to seize upon the money which the Lower Canada Assembly refused to vote, to defray the expenses of the government, the rebellion followed. Of his share in that event, M. Papineau does not appear to have been proud; for he has declared that he took no step in it, but in obedience to the orders of Dr. Nelson, an honor of which the latter gentleman has been equally disposed to make a present to M. Papineau. If the movement had not failed, its leadership would not now be repudiated.\n\nAfter the failure of the insurrection, M. Papineau went to the United States, where, it is said, he tried, without success, to influence the government to interfere in the quarrel. In February, 1839, he left for France, and after spending eight years, chiefly in Paris, in perfect quiet\u2014having issued only one letter all the time\u2014he was allowed to return. He was subsequently elected to the united Parliament, and led the opposition against M. Lafontaine, who, however, was too much for him; he was totally opposed to the union and never ceased to demand its repeal. In 1854 he retired from public life, and has since been enjoying that literary leisure of which he is so fond, on La Petite Nation Seigniory, Ottawa River. After his return, he found his brother in power, and several of his relations provided for, and he himself was paid \u00a34,500 arrears of salary as Speaker, though he asked, like Oliver, for more, but asked in vain. M. Papineau is a man of fine talents, with a mind highly cultivated, and of most gentlemanly demeanor. He has four daughters besides sons, one of the latter of whom was some years ago appointed prothonotary in the Queen's Bench of Lower Canada.\n\nWILLIAM LYON McKENZIE, Esq.\n\nFew men have exercised a more potent influence on the affairs of Canada than that wielded by the subject of this notice. He it was who first directed attention to the necessity of those changes in the system of government, which were afterwards effected under the auspices of others when he had been driven into exile. During his long public career he did many things which he afterwards admitted to be wrong, and for which he expressed the deepest regret; but whatever errors may have blended with his exertions\u2014errors which he himself afterwards frankly admitted\u2014there can\nbe no question that he did his share to advance the cause of civil liberty in his adopted country.\n\nMr. Mackenzie was born at Springfield, Dundee, Forfarshire, Scotland, on the 12th March, 1795. His father, Daniel Mackenzie, dying twenty-seven days after his only child was born, his mother was left a widow with slender means of subsistence. The circumstances of being an only child, and being indulged by his mother with a great deal of his own way, doubtless had an important influence upon his character in after life. From this source he probably derived much of the strong, unbending will for which he was conspicuous. Resembling his mother very closely in appearance as well as in his mental characteristics, there can be no doubt that from her he took the impress of his character. She was of the same ardent disposition with himself; and the energy that he expended upon politics was in her case devoted to religion. He was a favorite with his school teacher, Mr. Kinnear, of Dundee, from whom he received more than an ordinary share of attention.\n\nAt the age of seventeen or thereabouts, he went into mercantile business, to which he added a circulating library in Ayleth, not far from Dundee. Meeting with only indifferent success, as might have been expected at so early a period of his life, he afterwards went to England, where he was for some time in Lord Lonsdale's employment, as clerk. Before starting for this country, he also spent some time in France.\n\nIt was in 1820 that Mr. Mackenzie first came to Canada. In the vessel in which he came out, was one of the Lesslies, with whose father he had previously had business connections in Scotland. For a short period after his arrival he was employed as superintendent over the works of the Lachine canal, but it was not long before he went into partnership with Mr. John Leslie, now of Dundas, in Toronto, in the book and drug trade. Soon after, the partners established a business at Dundas under the name of Mackenzie & Leslie. The business succeeded remarkably well in both cases, The connection closed, however, early in 1823.\n\nAnd now it was that Mr. Mackenzie entered on the stormy sea of politics. How little he could have foreseen of the career that was before him, and the trouble it was to bring upon himself! If he could have obtained a foreknowledge of all he was to encounter in the political arena, would he have made the venture? There is much reason to doubt that he would; for towards the close of his life he often expressed dissatisfaction at his abandonment of mercantile for political life. On the 18th May, 1824, appeared the first number of the Colonial Advocate, very much in the shape of old Cobbett's Register, and containing thirty-two pages. The form was, however, altered to the broad sheet in the second or third number. The Colonial Advocate was at first issued at Niagara, in the house now occupied by Mr. David Thornburn. In those days the\ngovernment was a sort of close corporation, and was not accustomed to have its acts freely criticised. The Colonial Advocate soon fell under the displeasure of the ruling party, and every effort, except such as reason and the law might have sanctioned, was made to suppress it. A bitter personal quarrel, carried on by means of the press, between Mr. Mackenzie and some prominent members of the official party, led, in 1826, to the violent destruction of the Advocate printing office by a mob of irritated friends of the ruling party. The office was forcibly entered, and the types cast into the bay of Toronto. At this time, the paper was printed at that city.\n\nA most inopportune time was chosen for the work of destruction. It was probably not known to the rioters that the last number of the paper which it was intended to destroy had already been published; for if it had the act would have been as stupid and unnecessary as it was wicked and illegal. As the act was done in the face of day, the perpetrators of it were known, and damages were recovered against them, on the case being brought into a court of justice. We must suppose that the object of scattering the types into the bay was to put an end to the existence of an obnoxious newspaper; but the effect was precisely the contrary of what had been intended. The paper, of which the last number had already been issued, received from the violence used to put it down a new lease of existence. The Colonial Advocate, instead of expiring in 1826, as it would, if left to itself, continued to be published till 1833, when the press and types were sold to Dr. O'Grady.\n\nThe \"press riot\" had another effect, the reverse of what was intended. Through it, not only was Mr. Mackenzie brought more prominently into notice than ever before, but that popular instinct which always flies to the succor of any man who is unfairly treated, created for him a large number of enthusiastic friends and supporters. In 1828, the question of his becoming a candidate for the county of York, at the election about to take place, was raised. In those days, something analogous to the present political conventions was not unknown. Mr. Mackenzie attended two of these meetings, at both of which he was by far the lowest on the ballot. He had for an opponent, Mr. James E. Small (now county judge), who before the contest had vainly endeavored to induce him to leave the field, on the ground that he was sure to be beaten. But Mr. Small was mistaken. Mr. Mackenzie was returned.\n\nThe violence of the official party was not confined to the destruction of a printing office. Mr. Mackenzie had, in his newspaper, used language towards the majority in the Assembly, which that majority chose to regard as libellous, and they resolved to punish the representative for the act of the journalist. The alleged libel consisted of describing the majority as sycophants fit only to register the decrees of arbitrary power. Language quite as strong as this has frequently been used in the House of Commons. For\ninstance, Henry, now Lord Brougham, when in the House of Commons, said of the Minister Peel, \"I do not arraign him as much as I do you, his flatterers, his vile parasites,\" for which language, so far from being expelled, he was not even called to order. But admitting the language used by Mr. Mackenzie to have been libellous, the proper remedy would have been to bring the case before the jury. But that remedy was hopeless; it was notorious that no verdict could have been obtained against the publisher of the alleged libel. It was treated as a breach of privilege; on that ground the expulsion proceeded, and an attempt was made to render Mr. Mackenzie incapable of sitting in the Assembly. His re-election could not, however, be prevented, for no member of the official party would have had the least chance against him; and as often as he was expelled\u2014five times\u2014he was re-elected; once when he was absent in England. At this time of day no one pretends to defend the arbitrary proceedings of the Assembly, and it is impossible to read the debates which took place on the occasions of these repeated expulsions, without being surprised at the want of sagacity in the men by whom they were performed. No new offence was deemed necessary to justify each new expulsion\u2014the original breach of privilege as, it was called, was held to incapacitate the person charged with it from taking his seat in the house to which he was so often elected. Other pretexts were, however, found, but it is a remarkable fact that not one of the expulsions proceeded from anything that Mr. Mackenzie had done as a member of the house. The hostility of that body was directed entirely against a member of the press. The printing and distribution at his own expense of 200 copies of the official journals of the house was attempted to be made a cause of expulsion. It was not pretended that the journals had been falsified or interpolated. The motion rested upon an obsolete rule of the house which forbids any one to print the proceedings of that body without authority\u2014a rule that is constantly and systematically violated, and the putting of it into force would be just as absurd as the revival of the English statute which renders it penal for any person to fail to appear in the Established Church once every Sunday. The cause of the liberty of the press became identified in the minds of the people, with Mr. Mackenzie, and every new expulsion only added to his popularity, and increased his power. At last it was resolved to punish the constituency which had persisted in re-electing the expelled member, and the Assembly refused to issue the writ for a new election. This refusal contrasted strongly with the official pretence previously set up that it was necessary for the county of York to be fully represented in the legislature, and that therefore no time ought to be lost, after an expulsion, in calling a new election. These arbitrary proceedings of the Assembly finally evoked the decided condemnation of the Imperial Government. The period\nduring which the county of York was left without a representative, from this cause, extended from 1831 to 1834. On one occasion the re-election of Mr. Mackenzie was followed by a demonstration of menacing character against the Assembly. A large escort conducted him to the Assembly to take his seat. Strangers were ordered to be excluded from the galleries, but the doors of the Assembly were burst open, and the order of exclusion set at defiance by the people.\n\nIn May, 1832, Mr. Mackenzie proceeded to England bearing a petition of grievances to the Imperial Government, said to have been signed by 19,000 persons. He remained there for a period of eighteen months, and was able to effect far more than any one could at that time have done in Canada during the period of a lifetime. While there he had the hearty and energetic assistance of his early and constant friend, the late Mr. Joseph Hume. Mr. Hume had at that time considerable influence in the House of Commons, with the press and with the government. Mr. Mackenzie obtained a patient hearing at the colonial office, and the result of his interviews with Lord Goderich was a long and elaborate dispatch from that nobleman, laying down for the guidance of the Canadian government principles that would effect great reforms and get rid of many of the grievances complained of. His exertions procured the removal of some of the officials who held the first places in the government, and caused instructions to be sent to the lieutenant-governor to appoint one member at least of the popular party to a governmental office. To himself a most tempting offer was made by the colonial secretary. The post office in Upper Canada, then under imperial control, yielded about $60,000 a year, and the whole of the revenue went into the pocket of the postmaster. Lord Goderich proposed to divide this office, and give Mr. Mackenzie half the spoils. The latter replied that if he accepted the offer he certainly should benefit himself individually, but that the abuse of which he was sent to complain would still be continued. He therefore declined to accept the offer. It was at the instance of the colonial secretary that Mr. Mackenzie's stay was protracted to eighteen months in England, in order that an opportunity might be afforded to discuss the various questions on which the popular party in Upper Canada had complained to the Imperial Government. Perhaps it was his success on this occasion that caused Mr. Mackenzie to the close of his life to believe that our political movements could be best influenced by the application of a leverage power in Downing street; an error which arose from his not making due allowance for the change which our system of government has undergone. He had been anxious to make a second journey to England, and he was firmly convinced that if he were there he could produce changes as great as those which resulted from his previous visit. His idea of course included the being armed with a monster peti-\ntion from the people. On his return from England, Mr. Mackenzie received an abundance of thanks; but he thought himself entitled to be re-imburied the expense of the journey.\n\nFrom first to last, Mr. Mackenzie was elected to the legislature of Upper and of United Canada fourteen or fifteen times, and he was once defeated. This was in the election of 1836. He contended that he had not been fairly beaten, but that just previous to the election the government had issued patents to a large number of persons for small lots at the mouth of the Credit river, in respect of which the conditions of the grant had not been fulfilled. His petition against the return of Mr. E. W. Thompson, his opponent, was at once rejected by a majority of the ruling party. Into the merits of that question it is impossible here to enter; and indeed where one is overwhelmed with mountains of documents relating to the career of a public man, it is almost impossible to give a satisfactory biographical sketch within the limits at our disposal. The life of the subject of this notice can only be fully understood when it is written at sufficient length to allow all the principal events which it embraces to be dealt with in a comprehensive and discriminating spirit.\n\nThe first mayor of Toronto\u2014chosen in 1836\u2014he was also one of the first magistrates ever elected in Upper Canada. Before the passing of the charter under which he became mayor of Toronto, elective magistrates were unknown in the province.\n\nOf the insurrection in which Mr. Mackenzie bore so prominent a part, in 1837 and 1838, it is impossible within the limits of our space to treat. He has always said that he was led into it by the urgent entreaties of the Lower Canadians, and he has left behind him documents in which he frankly confesses the error of the part he played and expresses regret for the course he was induced to take. But even the rebellion, with all its evils, was not without its incidental advantages. It awakened the attention of the Imperial Government to the various abuses of the oligarchial system which had previously existed, and brought about a beneficial change sooner than it could otherwise have occurred. Few men paid more dearly for an error than Mr. Mackenzie did in this case. His life was spared, it is true; but if the whole story could be told, it is very doubtful whether one person in a hundred would consider life desirable upon such conditions. Under the Van Buren administration, Mr. Mackenzie was sentenced to eighteen months' imprisonment for a breach of the neutrality laws of the United States, and he was actually kept in close confinement for twelve months at Rochester. There can be no greater mistake than to suppose that he enjoyed any of the immunities which are sometimes accorded to state prisoners. On the contrary, he was kept in close confinement within the narrow walls of an insanitary room, where he contracted ague from the poisonous miasma arising\nfrom the neighboring Genesee river. Ruined by the confiscation and sale of his property in Canada, and unable to use his exertions for the benefit of his family, he was made to taste the bitter draughts of poverty. His aged mother, who had attained her ninety-sixth year, died while he was debilitated by intermittent fever in prison, and it was only by resorting to a stratagem that he was permitted to see her at all before she expired. A writ of habeas corpus ad respondendum was obtained to secure his attendance as witness in a trial which was got up for the occasion, and which was held in the house where his mother was dying. The court was held by the father of \"Grace Greenwood,\" who indulgently protracted its duration for three hours. While in Monroe county prison at Rochester, Mr. Mackenzie was shot at through a window by a tall person armed with what appeared to be a fowling-piece and accompanied by a dog. The ball entered the opposite side of the room. This is only one of the many attempts that at various times were made upon his life, and where they were so numerous it is surprising that he escaped. Mr. Mackenzie never took root in the United States. He was not at home there; he was an exile. He found foreigners looked upon with suspicion, and excluded from nearly all the offices in the gift of the Federal government. He was long anxious to return to Canada before the issuing of the amnesty which enabled him to do so. The case of all the Canadian refugees except himself had been covered by amnesty, and he was under the impression that the Canadian government exerted some hostile influence to prevent his return. He finally received a pardon through the influence of his friend, Mr. Hume, and he always continued of the impression that he had nothing to thank the Canadian government for in that respect. More than this, he had a suspicion, whether well founded or not, that some even among his own colleagues and associates were anxious to prevent his return. This notion was probably not without its influence upon his course after he re-entered public life in Canada. He might have occupied an influential position in the United States had he resolved to make that country his home, but the desire to return to Canada was too strong to permit him to think of becoming a permanent resident there. He published a journal both at New York and Rochester, entitled Mackenzie's Gazette, and he was for a considerable time connected with the Tribune, of whose proprietor, Mr. Greeley, he had the most exalted opinion. The amount of labor that he performed\u2014at one time as Washington correspondent of that journal, at another time its correspondent at Albany while the State Convention was sitting to revise the constitution\u2014was prodigious; quite enough to have given occupation to almost any other three men. He burned the midnight oil and prematurely consumed his own vitality.\n\nAfter his return to Canada in 1850 he offered as a candidate for\nthe first constituency\u2014Haldimand\u2014that became vacant. He opposed and beat Mr. Brown, who ran on the government interest. He continued to hold his seat in the Legislative Assembly till 1858, when he resigned. He attached himself to no party, and though he was generally in the opposition, he attended no opposition caucuses, entered into no party engagements, and persistingly refused to have anything to do with the formation of the two-days' government. In 1858 he supported the Hon. Mr. Allan for the Legislative Council, solely because he believed him to be preferable to the other candidate.\n\nIt is now universally conceded that, however erroneous his views, Mr. Mackenzie did everything from a thoroughly honest motive, and in the belief that it was best for the country. He was no trading politician or office-seeker, and the best test of his political virtue is that he resisted the most alluring temptations when he thought their acceptance would be contrary to the interests of the public. His most intimate friends best know the value he set upon political honesty and how deep and utter was his detestation of a tendency to dishonesty or corruption.\n\nA few years ago a public subscription was set on foot to provide funds for the purchase of a \"Mackenzie homestead.\" The net visible result was chiefly expressed in a house which cost, we believe, \u00a3950, though owing to some misunderstanding a sum of \u00a31,500 of what was subscribed was never collected. He died at Toronto, in August 1861, in comparative poverty.\n\nMr. Mackenzie married, in 1822, Isabel Baxter, sister of Mr. George Baxter, of Kingston, who, when master of the royal grammar school of that place, educated many of the men who have since held some of the most prominent positions in public life. In his darkest fortunes she was always at his side; whether amidst the chill snows of Navy Island, or the drear gloom of the Rochester prison. Mr. Mackenzie left seven children; only two of whom are married.\n\nWOLFRED NELSON, Esq., M.D.,\nChairman of the Board of Prison Inspectors, &c.\n\nThis well-known gentleman was born in Montreal on the 10th July 1792. His father was Mr. William Nelson, son of a victualling officer in the royal navy, as the commissariat of that department was then termed. His mother was a daughter of Mr. G. Dies, a\ngentleman of large property on the Hudson River, state of New York, and formerly well known as \"Dice Manor.\" Being an enthusiastic loyalist, he lost all he possessed, and took refuge in Canada, where, shortly after the declaration of independence of the United States, he terminated a long and respected life.\n\nAt the early age of less than fourteen years, Wolfred Nelson was apprenticed to Dr. Carter, of the army medical staff, at Sorel, in the month of December, 1805. There being few medical men in Canada at that period, he was soon forced into practice, and had the drudgery of a small military hospital confided to him. In December, 1810, he went to Montreal for his examination, but could only come before the board at the end of January, 1811, when he was duly licensed. He established himself at St. Denis, on the Richelieu river, and soon enjoyed a flourishing practice.\n\nWhen war was declared in 1812, he volunteered his services, requesting at the same time to be the right hand man of his regiment of militia; he was, however, forced to take the surgeoncy, as medical men were \"few and far between.\" The battalion was ordered to the frontier, but peace being soon proclaimed, the militia was disbanded.\n\nIn 1827 he was solicited to contest the representation of the \"Royal Borough of William Henry,\" against Mr. James Stuart, the attorney-general; and although great influence was used against him, he was elected by a majority of two, after seven days of the hardest election contest ever experienced in Canada. The attorney-general, instituted actions of so harassing a nature, that the House of Assembly was petitioned; this resulted in Mr. Stuart's suspension from office. But he assumed such a fierce and determined attitude towards the then governor, Lord Aylmer, that it led to his being deprived of his high office.\n\nBut to come to the most important period of Dr. Nelson's life. In 1837, the year in which he took part in the rebellion of this part of the country, the doctor from his professional connection with, and from having been one of their representatives in Parliament, possessed great influence and authority in the country bordering on the Richelieu river, where the outbreak took place. He was accordingly appealed to on all political questions of great moment; and at the memorable meeting of the \"Five Counties,\" was chosen chairman. That he should have used that influence and authority for the base purpose that he did\u2014to excite the Queen's subjects to open rebellion, and connect himself with Papineau, the great chief of the movement, was certainly reprehensible, and drew down upon him and the others the just indignation of the government and the loyal inhabitants of the country. An armed troop, under Colonel Gore, was dispatched to arrest him and the other leaders and concoctors of the fomentation. Dr. Nelson and his friends hastily retreated to his residence, where, with a\nsmall force of habitants, they made all the resistance they possibly could to the demand made for their surrender. Shots were exchanged; human blood was spilled; but the troops had to retreat without effecting their purpose. Dr. Nelson and some friends also beat a hasty retreat, Mr. Papineau, having, previous to the fight, absconded. They made a part of their way to the frontier; and after wandering about, and suffering many privations for some days, were arrested by an armed force from Montreal. Two thousand dollars had been offered for the arrest of Dr. Nelson; and, consequently he was conveyed with all possible speed to Montreal, where he was confined for seven months. At the end of that time, having previously received his sentence, which was banishment for life, he was with other persons connected with the rebellion, taken to Quebec, and placed on board one of her Majesty's vessels, in order to be taken to the West Indies. Previously, however, to sailing, he had conveyed to the Earl of Durham a message reflecting on the character of his advisers. When in the West Indies, the exiles received the proceedings which had taken place in the House of Lords declaring their transportation illegal; they were allowed to depart, and reached the United States, 1st November, 1838. In the United States Nelson remained in the prosecution of his profession until August, 1842, when he returned to his native city, with a wife and a large family, to begin the world anew, having lost all his fine property by fire. Some people would be disposed to pity such a man, but the more numerous proportion of loyal citizens would do just the contrary. Dr. Nelson knew perfectly well what he was doing, when he joined in the movement; he was in happy circumstances, and had secured a fortune in the country which he wished to ruin. He well knew the result, if he was captured; and knowing this, he rushed madly on to his own destruction and the ruin of his family. Why then should he excite any compassion or seek to palliate his offence? Happily now, we can look on his aged form with feelings of tenderness, for he has deeply atoned for the past; and, by his services in preserving human life during the time when fever and cholera were raging, and when grim death was stalking and carrying off numberless victims, he endeared himself to a great many, and became entitled to the grateful remembrance of the people of the country. But not to depart from the \"even tenor of our way,\" in 1845, Doctor Nelson was triumphantly elected for the county of Richelieu, in opposition to the great Mr. D. B. Viger. He represented that county for two parliaments, and was a member of the house when the celebrated rebellion losses bill was discussed and passed. When the hard names of traitor and rebel were hurled against him, the old man rose in his place, and in a determined manner, claimed to be heard: \"Those who call me and my friends rebels,\" said he \"I tell them they lie in their throats; and here and everywhere else, I hold myself respon-\nsible for the assertion. But, Mr. Speaker, if to love my country quite as much as myself, if to be ardently attached to the British crown and our glorious sovereign is to be guilty of high-treason, then I am a rebel indeed. But I tell those gentlemen to their teeth, that it is they and such as they, who cause revolutions, who pull down thrones, trample crowns into the dust and annihilate dynasties. It is their vile acts that madden people, and drive them to desperation. As for my own great losses, wantonly inflicted as they were, I cheerfully make no claim for them; but I call on you to pay those whose property you destroyed in my hands; and I am happy, for I feel that with the protection of an Almighty Providence, I may yet honorably by my own exertions, acquit my dues, advanced as I am in years. But there are hundreds of others with less encouraging prospects before them, whose only crime was, reposing confidence in the man they loved and trusted; pay these unhappy men, I ask no more.\"\n\nThis speech was certainly a very novel one, and the request still more so; the most surprising thing is that the doctor was allowed, in those exciting times, to speak at all on the subject.\n\nDoctor Nelson refused re-election, and devoted himself with his wonted energy to his profession, in the line of which the inspection of prisons clearly ran. He was made inspector of the prisons in 1851, and so continued until December, 1859, when he was appointed chairman of the board of prison inspectors for the two provinces. He has also been a justice of the peace and commissioner for the trial of small causes\u2014offices which he threw up in 1837. He has repeatedly been elected vice-president and president of the medical board and college of surgeons. He was appointed chairman of a board of commissioners during the prevalence of the emigrant fever in 1847, on which occasion he rendered great service in preventing the spreading of that dreadful disease; as also chairman of the board of health during the time that the cholera raged in the country. He was also likewise twice elected mayor of the city of Montreal. His reports on prisons, &c., are well written, and contain much valuable information.\n\nRIGHT HON. SIR F. B. HEAD, BART., K.C.H.\n\nThis celebrated author, who from 1835 to 1838, governed Upper Canada, is a descendant of the same ancient English family as our late much esteemed governor-general. He was born near Rochester,\nEngland, in the year 1793, and entered the military service at an early age, in, we believe, the corps of the Royal Engineers, in which he served with some distinction; was present at Waterloo, and the campaign under Wellington, and bore a high character as an engineer; so much so, that whilst an officer of that distinguished corps, he received from a mining company an invitation to explore the gold and silver mines of South America, between Buenos Ayres and the Andes. He arrived in Buenos Ayres in 1826, and in a short time had completed the work to the great satisfaction of the company, having crossed the Pampas four times and the Andes twice, and ridden upwards of six thousand miles, most of the time unaccompanied. His \"Rough Notes,\" published after his return to England, and a well known work, give a graphic description of his expedition. But however suited Sir Francis was for the military profession, the life, it appears, did not please him, or was it congenial to his tastes, and having gained a majority, he in 1828, retired on half pay from the service. In November, 1835, he was appointed lieutenant-governor of Upper Canada, and held office during the distracted period of 1837, and until 1838. He has been censured for his administration of the affairs of the province during the rebellion, and accused of having trifled with the disaffected parties concerned; be that as it may, his \"Narrative\" of the events which took place, which was published on his return to England, exonerates him in a great measure, in the estimation of some, from the charges preferred, and justifies the course he took for the suppression of the rebellion. Since governing Canada, Sir Francis has not re-entered the public arena, but has lived a life of retirement. His reputation will be highest as an author, by which, indeed he is principally and widely known. His \"Bubbles from the Brunnen of Nassau,\" \"The Emigrant,\" \"Life of Bruce, the African traveller,\" \"Faggot of French sticks,\" \"Fortnight in Ireland\" and his most recent, and it is said, best work, \"The Horse and his rider,\" are all both amusing and instructive works, and have been favorably commented on by the press of England and America, and universally read. He enjoys a pension of one hundred pounds from England, for his services to literature.\n\nSir Francis Bond Head married in 1816, a daughter of Honorable Hugh Somerville, and sister of the 16th Lord Somerville.\nSIR GEORGE A. WETHERALL, G.C.B.\n\nFew can be ignorant of the important services which this gallant and skilful general rendered to Canada, during the short time he remained amongst us; and we are sure that all will very gladly welcome a notice of him, however brief and imperfect it may be.\n\nSir George is a son of the late General Sir Frederick Wetherall, by the daughter of E. Mytton, Esquire, and was born at Penton, Hants, England, in 1788. Sir George pursued his studies at Winchester, and in the senior department of the Royal Military college, with much success; and first entered the army in 1804. Since then he has seen much arduous service, and been at nearly all the foreign and colonial posts of the army. Our readers will coincide with us when we say, that any honor or distinction he may have received from his sovereign he richly merited. In 1807, he was appointed brigade-major at the Cape of Good Hope; and, accordingly, proceeded thither. In 1811, he served at the attack and conquest of Java, for which he received the war medal, and one clasp. From 1822 to 1825, he was military secretary to the commander-in-chief of the forces in Madras; and in 1826, he was appointed deputy judge-advocate, in India. He first became connected with Canada previous to the disturbance of 1837, in his capacity of military secretary, we believe, to the commander of the forces, (Sir John Colborne.) When the awful scenes took place on the south shore of the St. Lawrence, consequent upon the Papineau faction inciting the people to rebellion; when the young and brave Lieutenant Weir, had been inhumanly murdered in cold blood, and the whole loyal population of Canada, roused as a lion from his den, to wreak vengeance on the heads of the miscreants, General (then Colonel) Wetherall, took part on behalf of the Crown in all the engagements and scenes that occurred; and invariably acquitted himself with much distinction. More particularly, may here be mentioned, the gallant victory which he achieved over the rebels, at St. Charles and Point Oliver, with a small force. At the former place, more than a thousand men were concentrated, who doggedly held out to the very last, even until their intrenchments were battered away, by the effective fire of Wetherall's few guns. Fifty-six of their number were killed, and many wounded; this was a just retribution for the death of Weir, and his countrymen, and the manner in which it was carried out, reflected the highest credit upon Colonel Wetherall's military skill and judgment. For his distinguished services during the rebellion,\nhe was made a companion of the most honorable order of the Bath.* He remained in Canada until the year 1850, filling the post of deputy adjutant-general, when he was appointed to the same office at the Horse Guards. In 1854, he had risen to the high post of adjutant-general, and colonel of the 84th Regiment. In 1856, her Majesty, the Queen, in recognition of his high services and merits, conferred upon him the honor of knighthood; and next year, he was appointed lieutenant-general, a rank which he at present holds; and commands besides one of the military districts of England.\n\n---\n\n**HON. SIR CHAS. S. GORE.**\n\nSir Charles Gore, whose services in Lower Canada during the rebellion of 1837-8, in conjunction with those of Lieutenant-General Sir George Wetherall, conduced so much to its suppression, is the third son of the second Earl of Arran, and was born in 1793. He entered the army in 1808, and by his peculiar talents speedily rose to distinction in the service. In 1811 he went out to the Peninsula, and served throughout the campaign, was present and one of the storming party at Fort San Francisco at the investment of Ciudad Rodrigo; also at the siege and storming of that fortress and of Badajos, battle of Salamanca, as aide-de-camp to Sir Andrew Barnard; and in a similar capacity to Sir James Kempt in the battles of Vittoria, the Nivelle, the Nive (9th, 10th, and 11th December), Orthes and Toulouse. He was\n\n*The people of the district of Montreal, sometime afterwards presented him with a piece of plate, which bore the following inscription:\u2014\n\n\"To\n\nG. A. WETHERALL, C.B., K.H.,\nColonel 2nd Battalion, 1st Royal Regiment,\nthe loyalists of Montreal, present this testimonial of gratitude, for his important services to the great cause of British connexion,\nin the defeat of the rebels, at St. Charles, on the 25th November, 1837, to which, by its moral influence, may be mainly ascribed, under Providence, the speedy arrest of insurrectionary movement;\nand of admiration of his wisdom in conduct, his gallantry in action,\nand his mercy in victory.\"\nalso in the action of San Milan, capture of Madrid, storming of the Heights of Vera, Bridge of Yanz\u00e9, and all the skirmishes of the light division from 1812 to the close of the war in 1814, after which he accompanied Sir James Kempt with the troops sent to Canada under his command; returned to Europe in time for the campaign of 1815; was first and principal aide-de-camp to Sir James Kempt, and was present at the battles of Quatre Bras, where his horse was shot; Waterloo, where three successive horses were shot under him, and at the capture of Paris. For these services he received the war medal, with nine clasps.\n\nHe received the honor of knighthood a few years since, and about the same time was advanced to the rank of lieutenant-general.\n\n---\n\n**SIR J. R. EUSTACHE, K.H.**\n\nSir J. R. Eustache is the fifth son of General Eustache (representative of the Viscounts of Batlinglass, a title under attainder.) He was born in 1795, and received his education at St. Peter's college, Cambridge, where he graduated M.A. in 1816. He adopted the military service as his profession, and in November, 1859, had risen to the rank of lieutenant-general, not however before he had seen and experienced much hard service. He served in Upper Canada during the campaign of 1813-14 in command of a troop of the 19th Light Dragoons, attached to the division of the army under the immediate command of General Sir Gordon Drummond, and was engaged in the battle of Lundy's Lane, on the 23rd July, 1814, and commanded the whole of the cavalry outposts and pickets during the siege, was present at the storming of Fort Erie, and had the honor to be personally mentioned in the general orders of 1814, upon three different occasions, and to receive the honor of knighthood for his gallant and efficient services.\n\nIn 1827 he was appointed to the Grenadier Guards, and accompanied the 1st battalion of that distinguished corps to Lower Canada in 1838, and was present with his regiment in the advance upon Napierville and in the subsequent pursuit of the insurgents. In 1848 he was appointed high sheriff of Kildare, a post which he still continues to occupy.\nLIEUT.-COLONEL GRIFFIN.\n\nA notice of this high-spirited and estimable public man cannot, we are sure, but be acceptable to the people of Canada. Colonel Griffin was, as it were, born into the 32nd Regiment, with which he was so long identified, being the son of Dr. Griffin, late of her Majesty's 32nd Regiment, surgeon of the military prison at Quebec. He was born at Greenwich, England, and at an early age obtained a commission in her Majesty's Regiment with which he served in the Ionian Islands, and came to Canada in 1830. His winning manner, (said the Montreal Gazette) his kind and earnest usefulness, his good and religious life, won for him the unfeigned respect of the whole of that military family. Those who enjoyed an intimacy with that \"band of brothers,\" the officers of the 32nd Regiment, will remember well that with them the familiar name of \"Frank\" was emphatically a household word. With Inglis, Griffin served at St. Eustache during the unhappy rebellion of 1837. Here he first attracted notice. On the suppression of the revolt, he was appointed by Sir J. Colborne, now Lord Seaton, a military magistrate, with civil powers, in the county of Two Mountains, and numbers will, even now, bear grateful testimony to his unwearied and successful exertions in mediating between exasperated nationalities, to protect the weak, to raise the fallen, and to assuage the horrors of civil war. This noble work to a great degree accomplished, he was removed to Montreal, and for some time employed as adjutant-general in the organization of the provincial volunteer force. Subsequently he was appointed deputy adjutant-general to her Majesty's forces at Montreal, and served in that capacity under Lord Seaton, Lord Cathcart, Sir Richard Jackson, Sir Benjamin D'Urban, and Lieutenant-General, now Sir W. Rowan, K.C.B., to whom he was military-secretary, until the termination of his command in 1855, when he proceeded to England, and died at Torquay in Devonshire, on the 29th of July, 1858. Colonel Griffin through life, was remarkable for the scrupulous performance of duty,\u2014of all duties, the foremost with him was his duty to his God.\nMAJOR-GENERAL YOUNG, K.H.\n\nMany will, no doubt, remember the name of Major Plomer Young, and his connection with the rebellion of 1838. He was one of the most efficient officers in Canada at that period. We give a brief sketch of his military career.\n\nHe entered the army in May, 1805, as cornet, and in 1806 gained his lieutenantcy. He served as adjutant of the 89th at the capture of the Isle-of-France in 1810, and at the capture of Java in 1811 (for which he received the war medal with one clasp), on which last service he was wounded in the action of Welteveden, and at the storming of Fort Cornelius; and was, for his conduct on those occasions, appointed, by Major-General Sir Robert Gillespie, major of brigade to the Batavia division of the force. He accompanied Sir Robert as such in the arduous operations against Djocarta in 1812, which terminated by the storming of that capital and capture of the Sultan. Served as major of brigade on the expedition to Ava, from June, 1824, until the close of the Burmese war in 1826, and was present at the principal affairs during that period, including the operations in the vicinity of Rangoon, defeat of Bandoola's army at the Shevedageen Pagoda, Tavoy, Mergui, Kokein, Denobiou, Prome, Meloon, and Pagahm Mew. We do not know the year he came to this country. He was in command of the Johnstown district during the insurrection of 1838, and commanded the troops in the attack and defeat of the brigands under Van Scootz, at the Windmill Point, near Prescott, on the 13th November of that year, in the most gallant manner, so as to draw forth the admiration of his superior officers, and the loyal inhabitants of the province, and was promoted to a lieutenant-colonelcy by brevet in consequence. Since that time he has been promoted to his present rank.\n\nHON. J. H. WALLACE\n\nWas born on the 7th June, 1807, and was son of the late Honorable the Earl of Hopetoun. He died at his seat, Featherstone Castle, on the 7th of January, 1854. This distinguished noble-\nman was, until 1844, a captain and lieutenant-colonel in the Cold-\nstream Guards, in which regiment he served for about twenty-three\nyears. In 1838, he came out to Canada with his regiment, and in\nNovember, of the same year, was selected by the then governor-\ngeneral, Lord Seaton, to raise a regiment of volunteers, for general\nservice in Canada. The order was given on the 5th of November,\nand, in less than a week, he had the regiment of \"Queen's Vol-\nunteers,\" consisting of ten companies, of one hundred rank and\nfile each, organized, and ready to take the garrison duties, which\nenabled the battalion of Grenadier Guards to be moved up the\ncountry. The high state of discipline, and perfect and wonderful\ncorrectness with which the Queen's Volunteer Light Infantry per-\nformed their duties, frequently drew forth great praise from the\ncommander of the forces, and, also from Major-General Sir James\nMcDonell, who was then in command of the garrison.\n\nColonel Hope was in every sense of the word a thorough soldier,\nand although very strict\u2014for he would never allow any deviation\nof duty on the part of his officers or men to pass unnoticed\u2014yet,\nhis kind manner of putting his orders in execution, won for him\nmost deservedly the esteem and regard of every officer and man,\nunder his command. Colonel Hope was, however, not only beloved\nby those who came under his immediate command, but by every\none in Quebec who had the good fortune and pleasure to make his\nacquaintance.\n\nSoon after he left Canada, Colonel Hope succeeded to the estates\nof his uncle, Lord Wallace, and took the name of Wallace. He\nmarried, in 1837, Lady Mary Francis Nugent, a daughter of the\nMarquis of Westmeath, and left by her three sons and four\ndaughters.\n\nCOLONEL G. HAMILTON, OF HAWKESBURY.\n\nAmong the many loyal and valued individuals whose lives fell\na sacrifice directly or indirectly in the defence of Upper Canada\nagainst the unprovoked and atrocious invasions of its soil by a\nruthless set of unprincipled adventurers, it is believed that the\nlamented gentleman above named is one of the most extensively\ndeplored, and whose death inflicted the heaviest blow on the com-\nmunity in which he lived. Mr. Hamilton was a native of the\ncounty of Meath, in Ireland, where he was born on the 18th of\nApril, 1781. He emigrated to Canada at an early age; and after a long sojourn at Quebec, where he was extensively engaged in business for several years, he retired from that city, and took up his permanent residence on his extensive property in Hawkesbury, in the year 1811; and has, with a few slight intervals, remained there until his death. His talents and acquirements became early known to the government; and on a formation of the district of Ottawa in the year 1816, he was appointed to the judgeship of the District Court, an office which he continued to discharge with exemplary integrity and correctness during the rest of his life. He was also for many years chairman of the Quarter Sessions, and contributed greatly, by his energy and strict enforcement of the laws, to create and maintain the high degree of social order and quietness for which the Ottawa district has been so long favorably conspicuous. He held also several other honorable and confidential situations under the government, the duties of which he invariably fulfilled with distinguished fidelity and judgment. His political predilections were rigidly conservative, though far removed from sycophaney and subserviency; and although compelled by the circumstances of the times to assume the chieftainship of his party, his unflinching firmness and the caustic severity of his eloquence were at all times agreeably relieved and modified by the suavity of his demeanor and the generosity of his conduct. He was repeatedly invited by the local government to accept a seat in the Legislative Council, but he invariably declined the proposed honor, on the patriotic ground that he could be of much greater service to the government by watching over its interests at home. As lieutenant-colonel of militia, he had been ordered to superintend the formation of several reserve companies for possible active service against the American brigands, and to inspect occasionally their state of organization and discipline. On the fourth day of December, 1838, he travelled for this purpose to Plantagenet, where he inspected and reviewed the reserve company of that township, commanded by Captain Kearnes. The weather was intensely cold and stormy, and it was while reading the general orders to the men, and addressing them at length upon the occasion, that the first symptoms of his illness manifested themselves. These were still further increased on his journey home, where he arrived late at night, almost dying with cold and exhaustion; and, notwithstanding the instantly applied, and unremittingly continued cares, and assistance of several medical gentlemen of high standing, he languished until the 7th of January, 1839, when death relieved him from his sufferings.\nHON. M. S. BIDWELL.\n\nMARSHALL SPRING BIDWELL, a name that figures to a considerable extent in the annals of Upper Canada, and more particularly during the period immediately anterior to the rebellion, was an able and energetic legislator, and a clever lawyer. He was born in Massachusetts, before the treaty of 1783, and settled at Bath, C. W., in 1811. He is the son of the celebrated Barnabas Bidwell, who was expelled from the Upper Canada legislature, on account of his being an alien. Shortly after which event he was triumphantly returned for his father's county, Lennox and Addington, and twice was elected to fill the office of Speaker of the Legislative Assembly. The colonial-secretary, in 1837, directed Sir F. B. Head, the lieutenant-governor of Upper-Canada, to elevate him to the bench, which Sir Francis, for some good reasons of his own, refused to do; and detecting some connection of his with the rebels, gave him the option of either allowing him (Sir F.) to peruse some private letters of his which had been placed in his hands by the postmaster, or to leave the province. Mr. Bidwell preferred the latter alternative, and left the Upper Province for the States in 1838; and, we believe, has never returned; he has built up for himself a lucrative practice at the New York bar, and is considered there an eminent practitioner.\n\nDOCTOR ROBERT NELSON.\n\nDOCTOR NELSON is both a man of celebrity and notoriety. His name figures in the history of Canada as the leader and originator of the lamentable and unhappy, as well as ludicrous invasion of Canada in 1838. Believing that a sketch of him would prove interesting to a great portion of the people of Canada, we herewith give all the information which we have been enabled to gather concerning him.\n\nHe was born in January, 1794, and at an early age was apprenticed to the late celebrated Doctor Arnoldi, of Montreal; and even before he was admitted to practice, he had raised a reputation for himself as a talented and clever young man, and one likely to rise\nto the head of his profession. While yet in his youth he was appointed surgeon to a regiment called the \"Indian Warriors,\" and served during the war of 1812. He was one of the most distinguished and celebrated doctors of the day. It is told that on one occasion an influential patient of his had had a ball lodged in his thigh for a considerable time, and which Dr. Nelson was unable to extract, went to England to consult some of the medical celebrities there. These, on ascertaining who had attended him in Canada, said, \"if Dr. Nelson is unable to do anything for you, we are perfectly sure we can do nothing.\" The gentleman returned and died without the ball having been extracted. Having been prominently mixed up with the politics of the day, after a warm contest, the Doctor was elected in 1827, conjointly with M. Papineau, to represent the city of Montreal in Parliament. He soon, however, withdrew from that position to devote his time solely to his profession, which he loved beyond all other things. He did not take an active part in the scenes being enacted on the north and south shores of the St. Lawrence, in the autumn of 1837; but he was arrested certainly without any justifiable cause, and cast into prison on the news arriving of the result of the fight between his brother and the royal troops; after a time he was admitted to bail.\n\nIn 1838, the most eventful period of his career, he played a conspicuous part in the affairs of the country. Being induced by a number of dissatisfied and disloyal persons of Canada, as well as some \"sympathizers\" from the States, to take up arms against his country, and thus entered madly as chief into the chimerical scheme of invading Canada, which proved abortive and awfully disastrous to those engaged in it. His property was sold at a great sacrifice, and his debts accumulated. He himself, a fugitive from justice, wended his way to California, where, by patient industry, he amassed a considerable fortune which he unwisely entrusted to the hands of an agent who swindled him out of every shilling. He is now, we understand, a resident of New York, and practices as a consulting surgeon.\n\nHe has translated Hupeland's system of medicine, and has written several valuable articles for various medical publications; and we have reason to believe he is now engaged in writing a history of the Asiatic cholera which prevailed so extensively in Canada, in 1832, as well as a disquisition on the difficult subjects of contagion and infection.\nHON. MR. JUSTICE MORIN.\n\nAugustin Norbert Morin, another name well known, and to a great extent connected with the history of the lower province at some of its most interesting epochs.\n\nHe was born at St. Michel, district of Quebec, in 1803, and received his education at the seminary of that ancient city, where his progress was both rapid and brilliant, and elicited the encomiums of all those over and connected with him. He studied law under the late Honorable D. B. Viger, and was admitted to the bar at Montreal in 1828. As the greatest ambition of all our Canadian lawyers is to be elected to Parliament as soon as possible, so that they may have an opportunity of displaying their oratorical and other powers, and be enabled to establish a reputation and take part in the administration of the affairs of the country, and finally attain the bench, young Morin was, in 1830, returned to Parliament, being then only twenty-eight years of age, and speedily made his way by his peculiar abilities over those who had sat in the house for lengthened periods. He took part in all the great discussions and questions of the day, and displayed much wisdom and foresight in the arguments which he set forth. So valued and appreciated was he by his party, that, when in 1834, a person was to be deputed by the Assembly to carry their petitions on the state of the province, to Mr. Viger, then in England, and to sustain that gentleman in his representations before the English ministry, he was selected to perform that responsible and onerous duty; and he returned only after he had done all in his power and might to carry out the ends of his party and the instructions which he had received. Mr. Morin is a gentleman of remarkable energy of character, and was not likely to be stopped in what he had taken in hand. Let whatever obstacles rise in his path, he would overcome them. Having continued in the legislature after the union, he entered the Lafontaine-Baldwin ministry, on the 18th of October, 1842, as commissioner of crown lands, and remained in that office until December, 1843. In 1844, he was elected simultaneously for the counties of Saguenay and Bellechasse, but selected to sit for the latter county. He was returned again by the same constituency in the general election of 1848, when he was elected to the speakership of the house, and remained in that position until 1851, when, jointly with the great Mr. Hincks as the premier, they formed the celebrated government that bears their names; and he accepted the office of provincial secretary of the province, and was elected for the county of Terre-\nbonne. From August, 1853, to January, 1855, he was commissioner of crown lands; and in that year was raised to the bench as a judge of the Superior Court of Lower Canada. In 1859, he was appointed a member of the commission for codifying the laws of Lower Canada, a position which he continues to retain, reflecting in that capacity both honor and credit on himself and the country.\n\nKage thus speaks of him, in his \"Life of Lord Metcalfe\":\n\n\"Mr. Morin a French Canadian, commissioner of crown lands. He had been thrown in early life, by the troubles of his country, into the stormy sea of politics; but I believe had followed the law as a profession. His character, as described to Metcalfe, would have fitted well the hero of a romance. With administrative abilities of the highest class, vast powers of application, and an extreme line of order, he united a rare conscientiousness and a noble self-devotion, which in old times would have carried him cheerfully to the stake. His patriotism was of the purest water. He was utterly without selfishness and guile. And he was of so sensitive a nature, and so confiding a disposition, that it was said of him, he was as tender-hearted as a woman, and as simple as a child. But for these\u2014the infirmities only of noble minds\u2014he might have been a great statesman. If the enthusiasm and demonstrativeness of his character, rendered him a striking contrast to Secretary Harrison, he was in these and other respects also remarkably dissimilar to Mr. Receiver-General Dunn.\"\n\nRIGHT REV. J. J. LARTIGUE.\n\nThis most estimable and learned divine, was born at Montreal, on the 20th of June, 1777.\n\nHe was named, by Pope Pius VII., on the 1st February, 1820, bishop of Felmesse in Lyoia, and suffragan bishop to the bishop of Quebec, for the district of Montreal. He was consecrated in the parochial church of Montreal, by his Grace Bishop Plessis, on the 21st January, 1821.\n\nWe are indebted to him for the firm and determined stand which he took in 1837, against Papineau and his party, when they wished to deluge the land with blood, and to bring ruin and dishonor on the heads of the simple habitants of Lower Canada. By the vigorous and well-timed measures, which Bishop Lartigue adopted, in conjuring the people to abstain from all the horrors and miseries of\ncivil war, and in denouncing the rebels at the altars and confessional of his church, he did good service, both to his church and to the crown, under which he served.\n\n---\n\n**Hon. JOHN MAITLAND, C.B.**\n\nColonel Maitland was a son of the last Earl of Lauderdale, and a brave and distinguished officer, who, if he had lived, would have undoubtedly made his way to great distinction. His name is linked with the history of Canada, but more particularly with the western section of it, as the gallant colonel of the brave 32nd Regiment, and as the victor of a splendid victory over the American brigands, at Point Pel\u00e9e Island, in lake Erie, on the 3rd March, 1838. Unfortunately he caught a severe cold on the march to, and during the attack on the island, which speedily overpowered him, and brought on a disease, which carried him to his grave. He died at London, C. W., on the 18th January, 1839. No one was ever more sincerely regretted than this meritorious officer, from the commander of the forces, down to the humble privates in his regiment, all mourned his death. Previous to his connection with Canada, he had served in Spain and Portugal, as extra aide-de-camp to General Houston; and in 1816, was appointed an inspecting-field-officer in the Ionian Islands, from which he exchanged into the 32nd Regiment.\n\n---\n\n**Hon. Mr. JUSTICE ELZEAR BEDARD,**\n\nWas, like the other members of the Bedard family, a prominent politician and legislator. He was also a member of the Lower Canada Assembly, and the reputed father of the celebrated ninety-two resolutions; although, we believe, Judge Morin has more claim to that distinction. M. Bedard became puisn\u00e9 judge of the Court of Queen's Bench, and, in conjunction with the late Judge Panet, was in favor (in 1838) of establishing the law of habeas corpus by substituting the statute of Charles II. for the provincial ordinance.\nof 1784. He was suspended from the bench, but afterwards reinstated. He subsequently entered into a contest with the Honorable Justice Day as to precedence, and the question was referred to the Imperial Government, the decision of which resulted in his favor, but only arrived when he was on his death-bed. He was a victim of cholera, and died at Montreal in 1849.\n\nETIENNE PARENT, Esq.,\nAssistant Provincial Secretary, (East.)\n\nWe could hardly omit in such a work some notice of this well known official whose career has been respectable and successful. Mr. Parent was born on the 2nd May, 1801, on his father's farm at Beauport, near Quebec. He received his education at the seminary of that city, where the generality of the gallic Canadians of the Quebec district, graduated until the foundation of the Laval university. Young as Mr. Parent was, ere he left school he had acquired a reputation as a political writer and a profound scholar. The story goes that after he left the seminary, some influential friends, high in office in the lower province at the present time, determined to put his talents as a writer to the test. With that view they proceeded to his father's farm, where they found young Parent commendably engaged assisting his aged parent in farm operations. Being struck with his nobleness of mind, exhibited in this act of filial acquiescence, they offered him the editorship of the largest and most influential French journal then published in the province, Le Canadien, which offer he accepted, and he edited that paper for three years viz., from 1822 to 1825. He then entered into the office of Mr. C. E. Casgrain, to study the profession of the law, and subsequently into the office of the late Chief-Justice Valli\u00e8res de St. R\u00e9al, who was then practising in Quebec. But the bar, apparently, was not Mr. Parent's forte, for shortly after he had been received and had practised for a short period, he gave up the profession for an appointment as French translator in the House of Assembly of Lower Canada. With this office he likewise held the law clerkship, and he afterwards served as librarian of the same house. These appointments he subsequently resigned, to re-establish the Canadien, which he edited for a period of fourteen years, rendering it by his extensive knowledge, his purity and elegance of style and force of reasoning the political standard of the\nFrench Canadians, and the best exponent of their views. It was during this period of his life (1838) that he underwent imprisonment in the Quebec jail for giving too bold an expression to some extreme political opinions in his newspaper. At the union of the provinces, Mr Parent was returned to Parliament for the county of Saguenay; and he continued to sit therein, until responsible government was established under Sir Charles Bagot, when he vacated his seat to accept the responsible appointment of clerk of the Executive Council, which he held till 1847, when he was appointed to be assistant-secretary, east, an office in which he still continues, and has acquired the respect and esteem of all parties. Bibaud says of him, \"His series of lectures on political economy, labor and material progress, entitle him to rank amongst the most enlightened minds of America.\" Mr. Parent, although in his sixtieth year, is as robust and active as ever. His mother only died a few months ago, at a very advanced age, which makes us imagine that he will be spared to the country for a lengthened period; and that such may be the case we sincerely trust.\n\nHON. THOMAS RADCLIFF,\n\nAn efficient member of the Legislative Council of Upper Canada, and a retired military officer, born 1794; died at Kingston, C.W., where he had resided for some time, on 9th June, 1841. He served his country gallantly in the four quarters of the globe; he followed the Duke of Wellington through the whole of the Peninsular campaigns, during which he received eight wounds; and, in the late rebellion in Canada, distinguished himself as the commander of the militia on the western frontier, and captured the piratical schooner Ann, having on board several rebel leaders.\n\nLIEUT.-COLONEL MOODIE.\n\nThis gallant soldier was a native of the neighborhood of Dunfermline, in Fifeshire; and, having joined the army very early in life, and seen much of the severest service of the Peninsular war,\nrose to the rank of lieutenant-colonel of the 104th Regiment. He served in Canada during the American war of 1814, and distinguished himself in many sharp affairs with the enemy. He was present at the battle of Queenston, where he acted with great pravity. About the year 1822, he returned to Scotland, and resided at St. Andrew's for the education of his family. He continued in that town until 1835, when he again came to Canada, for the purpose of taking possession of a valuable and extensive tract of land which he had acquired near Toronto, and where he was killed by the insurgents, in December, 1838. He left behind him his widow, a Canadian lady of Scottish extraction, two sons and three daughters.\n\nSIR R. H. BONNYCASTLE.\n\nSir Richard Henry Bonnycastle, Knight, son of the late John Bonnycastle, Esquire, professor of mathematics in the Royal Military Academy, at Woolwich, was born in 1791; he married in 1814, a daughter of Captain William Johnstone. In 1825, he became a captain of the Royal Engineers, and, in 1848, was advanced to the rank of lieutenant-colonel in the army. He served at Flushing in 1809; in America, from 1812 to 1815; was commanding royal engineer in Canada West, from 1837 to 1839; received his knighthood for services in the defence of Kingston, in Canada, in 1837; was commanding royal engineer in Newfoundland; and published a work on Newfoundland\u2014\u201cThe Canadas in 1841.\u201d He is also the author of the celebrated work, \u201cCanada as it was, is, and may be,\u201d &c.\n\nSir Richard was an officer of considerable literary and scientific acquirements, zealous in the discharge of his duties, an ardent student, and leaving, at his demise in 1848, a mass of interesting writings on Canada\u2014the most important colony of Great Britain. These have been published.\nHON. P. D. DEBARTZCH,\n\nA MEMBER of some repute in the Lower Canadian party of 1837. He first entered the legislature as a member of the Assembly, in 1810, and enrolled himself in the ranks of the opposition of the day, in which he assuredly performed a distinguished part, not only by his activity and energy in carrying out the projects of his party, but, also by his oratorical powers, which were great. He was elevated to the Upper House in 1815; and there, as in the other chamber, remained a steadfast ally and friend of his party. He founded a journal in Montreal, which contributed, in a great measure, to excite the people to the lamentable outbreak of 1837; and he protected and defended some of the leaders of the insurrection.\n\nWe do not know the period of his death.\n\nHON. A. MCDONELL.\n\nTHE HONORABLE ALEXANDER MCDONELL, at one time Speaker of the House of Assembly of Upper Canada, was a native of Inverness, Scotland, having been born there in the year 1760. He died at Toronto, on the 18th March, 1842. An Upper Canadian journal thus eulogized his character on that occasion:\n\n\"Throughout a residence in this country, almost from boyhood, he sustained a high character for loyalty and public virtue, and has now sunk to his rest, amid the regrets of a community who loved him for the mild excellence of his domestic and private character, no less than they esteemed him as a public man.\"\n\nROBERT CHRISTIE, Esq., M.P.P.\n\nA CANADIAN HISTORIAN and a native of Nova Scotia, but for a lengthened period, an inhabitant of Canada; born in 1788; died at Quebec, on the 18th October, 1856.\nThe name of Mr. Christie is well known for his literary productions, as well as for his parliamentary career. Most of our readers will remember the circumstance of his being expelled from the House of Assembly in 1829, on the ground of his having misadvised the government to dismiss certain magistrates from the commission of the peace for their political opinions and votes in the Assembly. He was again returned by his constituents, and again expelled, and continued deprived of a seat until the union, after which he was again elected by the same constituency, and remained a member until the general election of 1854. Mr. Christie was at various times a contributor by his pen to the Quebec Gazette, when conducted by the late Honorable John Neilson, and subsequently to the Quebec Mercury. His writings were vigorous, and showed an intimate acquaintance with the political history of the country. He was rather a violent and crotchety politician, and his hot temper greatly impaired his political utility. His principal literary labor is his \"History of Canada;\" valuable as a compilation, but otherwise not deserving the name of history, or even entitled to the credit of being a connected and clear narrative of events.\n\n---\n\nHon. PETER McGILL.\n\nA resident of Montreal for upwards of half a century, Mr. McGill's name is identified with the welfare, progress, and prosperity of that city.\n\nMr. McGill, we learn, is a Scotchman by birth\u2014and, if we are not mistaken, a native of Dumfriesshire, or Gallaway\u2014came to Canada in 1809, in connection with the old, and, by the last generation, highly respected firm of Parker, Gerrard, Ogilvie & Co., with whom he continued a partner for some years. He afterwards joined the firm of Porteous, Hancox, McCutcheon & Cringan\u2014his name being then McCutcheon, which he shortly after consented to change to that of McGill, at the request of his uncle, the Hon. Mr. McGill, of Toronto, whose heir he became, inheriting his extensive and valuable property in Upper Canada. Mr. McGill subsequently carried on a very extensive business with the late Mr. Dunn, under the firm of Peter McGill & Co., which firm was dissolved some years ago, since which time Mr. McGill's connection with mercantile life mainly consisted in his position as president of the Bank of Montreal, to which office he was yearly elected from June 1834 until June, 1860, when, from the\nstate of his health, he resigned it. It was not, however, as a successful and enterprising merchant and man of business alone that Mr. McGill gained the eminent position he so long held in Canada. In public as in private life\u2014as a statesman and philanthropist as well as a merchant and banker\u2014he equally secured the respect and esteem of his fellow-citizens, and but a year or two before his death, etc., his health failed him, he held and zealously performed the duties of the following various and important offices\u2014besides being a member of the Legislative Council, an office which he had held before as well as after the union, he was president of the Bank of Montreal, governor of the University of McGill College, director of the Grand Trunk Railroad Company, governor of the Montreal General Hospital, president of the Lay Association of Montreal in connection with the Church of Scotland, president of the Canadian School Society, chairman of the Colonial Life Assurance Company, a lieutenant-colonel of militia, and trustee of the University of Queen's College, Kingston. Most of these offices were connected with social life, but in political life Mr. McGill's services were also sought for and readily obtained. He was for some time an Executive Councillor and, in 1843, was, by Lord Metcalfe, offered the speakership of the Legislative Council, an office which, although he then declined it, he afterwards, in 1847, accepted and held until the following year, when with his colleagues in the administration, he resigned it. Mr. McGill was also, for many years, president of the Montreal Bible Society, and when he resigned the office, in 1848, not only received the cordial thanks of the society for his long and zealous services, but was placed at the head of the honorary governors of the society, then created. He was also the first chairman of the first railroad company\u2014the St. Lawrence and Champlain\u2014established in Canada, from its commencement, in 1834, until the completion of its road, in 1838. For many years, dating from its commencement in 1835, he was president, and gave much of his time, and no small amount of his means, in supporting the National Society of St. Andrew. He also served the office of mayor of Montreal from 1840 to 1842, during which period many and great improvements were effected in that city. In short, whether as a statesman and politician, a useful and active member of our municipal government, or as patriotic, liberal-minded and philanthropic citizen, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to name any man who, in the community of Montreal, or indeed in any community, so deservedly merited the esteem and regard of his fellow-men as the late Mr. McGill. He died at his residence Beaver Hall Place, Montreal on the 28th September 1860.\nHON. JOHN MOLSON.\n\nThis gentleman, to whose liberality, philanthropy and generosity Montreal owes so much, was born in that city, on the 14th October 1787.\n\nMr. Molson was of English descent, his father, the late Honorable John Molson, having come to Canada in 1782, being then only eighteen years of age. Two years afterwards, having determined to settle in this province, he returned to England, and having just come of age, he raised a considerable sum of money on the security of his estate of Snake Hall and Moulton, in Lincolnshire, the whole of which he sunk in building a brewery in Montreal, then an inconsiderable town of a few thousand inhabitants.\n\nFinding his means insufficient to complete his plans, he again went to England, and returned with a further sum of money, which he expended with a like result. Determined not to be defeated, he visited England a third time, sold out his property, and with the balance was just enabled to get his brewery into operation. The foundation of the ample fortunes which the Molson family have since acquired was thus laid by the sacrifice of his inherited estate; a circumstance which is also true of several other well-known Canadian names.\n\nIn the year 1807, the celebrated Fulton launched his first steamer on the Hudson; and two years later the first movement towards the steam navigation of the St. Lawrence was made by the elder Mr. Molson. On this occasion Mr. M. again went to England, and brought out engineers and other workmen, with such parts of the machinery as could not be made in Canada. The first vessel placed upon our waters was the Accommodation, a small boat 72 feet in length, 16 feet beam, and propelled by an engine built by Mr. Jackson, of not more than six horse power.\n\nTwo years later, viz., in 1811, another vessel, the Swiftsure, was launched by Mr. Molson, and in the following year did the state some service in the transport of troops and stores during the war with the United States in 1812. These vessels were placed on the route between Montreal and Quebec, and were soon after replaced by him with the Malsham, Lady Sherbrooke and others of superior tonnage and power.\n\nLater in life the elder Mr. Molson became president of the Bank of Montreal at a time of great commercial difficulty, Benjamin Holmes, Esquire, being made cashier at the same period; since which time that institution has attained the high position it has\nsince preserved. Mr. Molzon, senr., was also a member of the Executive Council of Lower Canada. He died in 1836, in the seventy-second year of his age.\n\nThe subject of this memoir was connected with his father in all his enterprises, first in his father's service, then for a short time in opposition, when his father gave him a vessel to set him up in business, and afterwards as a partner, and we believe we are correct in saying that it was not a little owing to the energy and enterprise of the son that the father added largely to the handsome competence of which he died possessed.\n\nA striking instance of the business capacity of the son has often been mentioned. The boat given him by his father was of inferior power and speed, but the young man was not to be outdone. The river was not lighted and buoyed as at present, and it was, therefore, deemed unsafe to run after dark. The son, however, ran his boat all night, and by working while others slept, made the best time with the slowest boat.\n\nAt a later period when railroads were introduced, Mr. Molson took an active part in their introduction into Canada, and was president of the first railroad opened in the province,\u2014the St. Lawrence and Champlain, of which he continued a director until his demise. Nor was he less active in advancing the interests of our monetary institutions. He had felt the want of these in early life, when he kept guard over his father's strong box, and paid out the English guineas, French crowns, and Spanish pieces, to his numerous workmen. He became a director in the Bank of Montreal, but retired to make room for his father at the period already referred to. Resuming his seat at the board on the retirement of his father from the presidency, he remained in the direction till 1858, when, in connection with his brother, William, he established the Molson Bank, under the free banking act, but which obtained a charter in 1854, when his young brother, Thomas, also became a large shareholder in that institution.\n\nIn politics, Mr. Molson was highly conservative; and when the Special Council replaced the Parliament in 1837, he was called to a seat in it. He, however, never desired to enter public life. He preferred to assist in carrying out those public improvements which had been set on foot by himself and others, to develop the resources, and aid in the advancement of his native country.\n\nHaving shouldered his musket in 1837, he, with many other loyal men, felt keenly the passing of the rebellion losses bill of 1849; and was one of the first signers of the famous annexation manifesto at that time, a proceeding for which he was deprived of his commissions of justice of the peace and colonel of the militia; the offers afterwards made by government to reinstate him, he respectfully declined.\n\nAs a private citizen, Mr. Molson was highly esteemed. The\ncause of education and philanthropy ever found in him a friend, and there is scarcely an important educational or charitable institution in Montreal with which his name has not been connected. The Molson chair in the McGill college, endowed by the liberality of the three brothers, may be specially mentioned as an instance of munificence and public spirit. As a governor for many years of the Montreal General Hospital, from the presidency of which he retired about a year previous to his death, owing to his failing health, his zeal will be long remembered, which, considering the magnitude of his business engagements, often surprised his coadjutors, in the management of that benevolent institution. The old and respected gentleman died at his residence Belmont Hall, Montreal, on the 12th of July, 1860, in his seventy-third year, universally regretted, we may say, by all parties in his native city, and by a large circle of friends throughout the country.\n\nCOMMODORE DUNLOP, R.N., M.P.P.\n\nRobert Graham Dunlop, Esquire, commodore royal navy, for a long time member of Parliament for the county of Huron, a man of sterling integrity, and of great capacity. Born 1789, died at Gairbraid, near Goderich, C.W., on the 25th of February, 1841.\n\nCaptain Dunlop entered the service, at the age of thirteen, on board his Majesty's sloop Tortorelle, and after a cruise in the North Sea, he proceeded to the Mediterranean, in the Active, frigate, commanded by Captain (now Admiral) Mowbray; when Lieutenant Warwood, then first lieutenant of the Active, was promoted to the command of the Pylades, he took him along with him as acting lieutenant.\n\nDuring the five years that he served in these ships in the Mediterranean, he was in no action of any public notoriety\u2014except the passage of the Dardanelles; though few weeks elapsed without his being engaged in the very dangerous service of cutting out in boats, and though upwards of one hundred times under fire, he miraculously escaped unhurt.\n\nOn his return to England, he was sent to the Cape of Good Hope, to join the Sironion, then carrying the flag of Admiral Sir Robert Stopford, the late hero of Acre. While attached to this ship, he was employed at the siege of Fort Cornelcris, and though\nwounded in three places, was carried through the breach on the boarding pikes of his sailors.\n\nFor his services here, Admiral Stopford promoted him to the rank of lieutenant, on board of the Surabaya, a Dutch brig, so called from having been captured in the harbor of the same name, in Java. In her he proceeded to Bombay, where he was placed on half pay, she being out of commission. Having then been upwards of nine years in the navy, and never having slept but seven nights ashore.\n\nOn his return to England, he was appointed to the Surveillant, Captain Sir George Collier, with whom he was employed on the coast of Spain. During this period, he and his brother officer, Lieutenant Dowal O'Reilly, were employed in manning a naval battery, at the siege of St. Sebastian. In this service he was severely wounded, having his arm and three ribs fractured, by a twenty-four pound shot passing between his arm and body. Afterwards he and his comrade O'Reilly, passed the Duke of Wellington's army across the Adour\u2014a service so hazardous, that the French were quite unprepared for it, inasmuch as they thought that nobody would have the temerity to attempt it. He advanced with the Duke's army into the Pyrenees, but was afterwards shortly recalled to act as flag lieutenant to Admiral Sir Charles Penrose. While in this situation, he was sent in the Garonne, to cut out a flotilla of gun brigs, gun boats, and store ships, intended for the relief of Bayonne. In this he fully succeeded, and brought out the whole flotilla, with Bonaparte's imperial barge, with the single exception of one ship loaded with gunpowder, which, thinking it unsafe to bring under the fire of the batteries, he blew up.\n\nBefore the tide served to carry him out, and protected by the fire of the gunboats he had captured, he landed and repulsed an attack of five hundred men of the French army, though his command amounted only to one hundred and fifty men. On his return to England, he proceeded to the Halifax station, where he joined the Leander, on board which ship his old friend, Sir George Collier, had kept a berth for him. But the ship not being in the harbor at the time, he went with the army on the Penobscot expedition, where he was again slightly wounded. On the Leander being paid off at the close of 1816, he was appointed first lieutenant of the Glasgow; Captain (commonly called) Paddy Doyle. From her he was promoted to the Curlew sloop, and from thence transferred to the command of the Termagant frigate, which he brought home to England, in 1828, after which time he was not employed, his limited means not allowing him to take a command during the time of peace.\n\nAfter being placed on half pay, he endeavored to make up for an education, necessarily deficient, by attending lectures in the\ncolleges of Glasgow and Edinburgh, for three years; during this period he was a most laborious student, and limited himself to dining abroad on Saturdays only. From his return to India to his arrival in this province, he applied himself exclusively to scientific pursuits, chiefly those connected with his profession, in the building and sailing of vessels, and in mineralogy and geology.\n\nHe was the first member for the county of Huron, and served in that office to the time of his death; he originated many useful enactments, among which may be enumerated the Huron county bill, and the Goderich harbor bill, but was unsuccessful in others; such as the lunatic asylum bill, the geological survey bill, &c.\n\nAs an early settler in that part of the country, he exerted himself for the good of all his brother settlers; his house was ever open to them whatever their rank might be, and no man ever went away hungry from his door. We may well conclude by saying that he was honest and just, as well as kind and considerate to all who came within the sphere of his action.\n\nHis funeral was attended by almost all the people in the neighborhood where he resided, and by many who came from a great distance, to pay the last homage to his memory. Four gentlemen, sons of post captains of the royal navy, offered to carry his body to the grave, but the captains of the vessels in the port had previously volunteered their services, and the flag of Britain, under which he so bravely fought, was the pall which covered his coffin, when he was laid in the narrow house appointed for all.\n\nIn him the community lost a thoroughly independent man, who neither courted power nor feared it, and whose loss it has been difficult to replace in his county.\n\n---\n\nRIGHT HON. THE EARL OF DURHAM.\n\nWith the exception of that of Lumley, Earl of Scarborough, the family of Lambton is the only one in the county of Durham which still retains the seat whence it originally derived its designation; and, there is proof incontrovertible, that the Lambtons existed at the time of the conquest, although, from the destruction of family records, in the civil wars of Henry III., the regular\npedigree cannot be traced higher than the twelfth century. Upon this point, Surtees, in his History of Durham, observes, \"no earlier owners of Lambton are on record, than the ancient and honorable family which still bears the local name. Although the regular pedigree can only be traced from the twelfth century, the previous residence of the family is well established, by attestations of charters and incidental evidence, from a period very nearly approaching the Norman conquest.\"\n\nFrom Robert de Lambton, feudal Lord of Lambton, in the county palatine of Durham, who died in 1350, lineally descended John Lambton, of Lambton, who was born in 1504, and who married Agnes, daughter and co-heir* of Roger Lumley, Esquire, of Ludworth, and niece of Richard, Lord Lumley. This John died in 1549, and was succeeded by his son, Robert Lambton, of Lambton, who espoused Frances, daughter of Sir Ralph Eure, constable of Scarborough Castle, temp. Henry VIII., and granddaughter of William, Lord Eure. Through this alliance, the Lambtons obtained an infusion of the blood of the Plantagenets. The son and heir of Robert Lambton and Frances Eure, Ralph Lambton, married, in 1587, Eleanor, daughter of Thomas Tempest, Esquire, of Stanley, and, dying in 1598, was succeeded by his son, Colonel William Lambton, who received the honor of knighthood from King Charles I., and fell fighting under the royal banner at Marston Moor.\n\nThis gallant cavalier married two wives: first, Jane, third daughter and co-heir of Sir Nicholas Curwen, of Workington, in Cumberland, by which he had a son, Henry, and two daughters. His second wife was Catherine, daughter of Sir Henry Widdrington, Knight, of Widdrington Castle, in Northumberland; and, by her, he had two other sons, William, who, like himself, fell in the royal cause at Wakefield, and Thomas Lambton, colonel of the horse of the bishopric of Durham, afterwards governor of the Leeward Islands.\n\nSir William Lambton was succeeded by his eldest son, Henry Lambton, of Lambton, who wedded Mary, daughter of Sir Alexander Davison, Knight, of Blakiston, and had five sons and four daughters: the eldest son, William, represented the county of Durham in seven parliaments; he died, unmarried, at the advanced age of eighty-four, in 1724: the second son, Alexander, died unmarried: the third son, Henry, was a barrister-at-law, and attorney-general to the bishop of Durham. He also died unmarried, in 1709, as did the fifth son, John, in 1722. The fourth son, Ralph, espoused, in 1696, Dorothy, daughter and co-heir of John Hedworth, Esquire, of Harraton\u2014heir general and representative of the family of D'Arcy, of Harraton and Herrington\u2014and left, at his decease in\n\n*With her sisters, Isabella, wife of Richard Conyers, Esquire, of Horden, in Durham, and Margaret, wife of Thomas Trollop, Esquire, of Thornley.\n1717, five sons and four daughters: the eldest son, Henry, represented the city of Durham in six parliaments, and inherited Lambton, with the other estates of the family, from his uncle William; he died, unmarried, in 1761. The second son, Major-General Hedworth Lambton, died unmarried in 1758; as did the third son, William, in the same year. The fourth son, Ralph, was collector of the customs at the port of Sunderland, and died likewise unmarried, in 1781. The fifth and youngest son, John Lambton, inherited, eventually, the estates, and became \"of Lambton.\" This gentleman was a general in the army, and colonel of the 68th, or Durham Regiment of Foot, (of which he was the first colonel.) He represented the city of Durham in five parliaments, and married, in 1763, Susan, daughter of Thomas, Earl of Strathmore; he died in 1794, leaving, with two daughters, two sons, William Henry and Ralph John.\n\nThe elder, William Henry Lambton, Esquire, of Lambton, was born in 1764, and educated at Eton and at Cambridge. He succeeded his father in the representation of the city of Durham, for which he continued to sit during the remainder of his life. In and out of parliament, Mr. Lambton was a stanch whig; and, at a period when the House of Commons resounded with the eloquence of a Pitt, a Fox, a Sheridan, and a Burke, the acute power of his reasoning faculties, the manly and nervous tone of his oratory, the refinement of his taste, and the accuracy of his judgment, procured him a distinguished place within its walls. Zealously attached to the principles of reform, Mr. Lambton signed, as chairman, in 1792, \"The Declaration and Address of the Society of Friends of the People, associated for the purpose of obtaining Parliamentary Reform.\" The views of this association were exposed to much obloquy and misrepresentation, and Mr. Lambton stood forward the defender of himself and his colleagues. \"From a state of confusion,\" he observed, \"I have every thing to lose, and nothing to gain; and I must hope, that neither my head is so weak, nor my heart so wicked, as to seek the misery of others, at so great a personal risk. All I wish is, to see this happy constitution reformed upon its own principles\u2014that every reparation may be made in the style of the original building.\"\n\nThe same sentiments which influenced the whole of Mr. Lambton's political life, rendered him adverse to the interference of the British government in the internal affairs of France, and an opponent of several consequent restrictive measures at home. Upon all occasions, the member for Durham was found amongst the friends of humanity who advocated the abolition of the nefarious traffic in slaves; and, his voice was last raised in the British senate, to oppose (in 1795) the bills for altering the laws, regarding treason and sedition. He died at Pisa, on the 30th of November, 1797, of consumption, at the early age of thirty-three. Mr.\nLambton had married, on the 19th of June, 1791 Lady Anne Barbara Frances Villiers, second daughter of George Bussey, fourth Earl of Jersey, and left, with a daughter, four sons, of whom the late Lord Durham was the eldest. His widow espoused, secondly, the honorable Charles William Wyndham, and died April 1, 1832. Mr. Lambton's eldest son, being but five years of age, at his decease, the representation of the city of Durham devolved upon his brother, Ralph John Lambton, Esquire, who advocated the same independent principles, and continued the representation of Durham for five successive parliaments.\n\nJohn George Lambton (afterwards created Earl of Durham,) was born on the 12th of April, 1792, and, like his father, received his education between Eton and Cambridge. As soon as he attained maturity, he was elected to Parliament by the county of Durham, and took his seat almost immediately on coming of age. He had previously married Miss Cholmondeley, who died on the 11th of July, 1815. Mr. Lambton espoused, in the next year, (on the 9th of December,) Lady Louisa Elizabeth Grey, daughter of the late prime minister, and had issue by both ladies. In Parliament, the abilities of Mr. Lambton very soon obtained him a distinguished position.\n\nMr. Lambton, inheriting the sentiments of his predecessors upon the question of parliamentary reform, introduced, on the 8th of April, 1821, a plan to amend the representation of the people\u2014a project differing but little from that which has since become the law of the land. In one material point, however, it differed from the measure as finally sanctioned by Parliament, the abolition of the septennial act, and restoration of triennial parliaments.\n\nOn the 17th January, 1828, it pleased his sovereign to elevate Mr. Lambton to the peerage, under the title of Baron Durham, of the city of Durham, and of Lambton Castle, in the county palatine of Durham. Mr. Lambton had selected himself the title of D'Arcy, and the patent was actually in preparation, when it was discovered, that a Barony of D'Arcy was already in existence, although in abeyance, and that the ducal house of Leeds laid claim to the suspended dignity.\n\nUpon the accession of his father-in-law, Earl Grey, to power, in 1830, Lord Durham was appointed lord privy seal, and became a cabinet minister.\n\nIn 1831, Lord Durham experienced a domestic calamity of the deepest dye, in the decease of his eldest son, Charles William, who expired on the 24th of September, in that year. The beauty of this promising boy, has been immortalized by the pencil of Lawrence. Amongst the works of the late president, \"young Lambton\" excited universal admiration; and his portrait will remain a chef d'oeuvre of the British school of painting.\n\nOn the first of June, his lordship was deprived of another child,\nin the person of the Honorable Harriet Caroline Lambton, his youngest daughter by his first wife. The young lady had just completed her twentieth year. His lordship left surviving at his decease\u2014by his first marriage, Frances Charlotte, and Georgiana Elizabeth; by his second; Lady Mary Louisa, Emily Augusta (now Countess of Elgin), Alice, and a son, George Frederic D'Arcy, the present earl, born 5th September, 1828.\n\nOn the 12th March, 1833, Lord Durham retired from the cabinet, received an earldom, and in the summer of the same year, proceeded on a special mission to the court of Russia. In 1835, his lordship returned to Russia as British ambassador, and remained there until the summer of 1837; and, in the following year, went out as governor-general to Canada, whence he returned, after a few months' absence, without any permission from government, and died in 1840.\n\nFor the following, we are indebted to the celebrated colonial historian, Robert Montgomery Martin, Esquire:\n\n\"Justice\u2014that sacred principle so little understood, and so seldom practiced\u2014repudiates the maxim, \"de mortuis nil nisi bonum.\" It is one of the many blessings of a free constitution, that the actions of public men are freely canvassed, and, although party feeling may obscure merits, and confer undeserved honors, yet truth, sooner or later, will maintain her position.\n\n\"We do not, therefore, think that the dead, any more than the living, are to be spared the free examination of their public life; and the good of a nation is always best consulted by a temperate expression of the conduct and character of those who seek to exercise an influence over their fellow-men. When we reflect how readily that which is evil is perceived, and how silently the good passes on its beneficial course, we should pause in judgment, and be disposed to spare censure, even where it appears deservedly due. Moreover, if consideration be had to the physical temperament of individuals, to their social position, to their education and surrounding circumstances\u2014men not subject to similar influences should be cautious how they condemn, and charitable in their conclusions.\n\n\"These are general remarks, and not made merely with reference to the subject of the present notice. It is now so rare to find a man of rank and fortune devoting himself to colonial questions, that we would be wanting in our duty to the colonies, did we omit to offer a few brief remarks on the character of the late Earl of Durham, so far as we can form an opinion from the recorded events of his life.\n\nBy birth and inclination, Lord Durham was one of the earliest advocates of political and popular reform; and to his credit, be it said, he was ever foremost to aid the cause of the oppressed. His sympathies were Saxon, and consequently with the people, but the Norman, or feudal pride, was often seen struggling with the more\nliberal principles of his early ancestry. At a period when few men stood forward to oppose the encroachments of ministerial power, Lord Durham was always the staunch opponent of oppression, whether national or individual. With a generous disposition, he was prompt to relieve distress, and expend his wealth in objects conducive, as he thought, to his country's good. There was no niggard or parsimonious spirit in his proceedings, whenever it could be proved that money or energy could advance the cause he took in hand. And an unsullied integrity, and lofty patriotism, were among the distinguishing characteristics of this lamented nobleman. Possessed of a mind well stored with varied and useful information, and sincerely desirous of turning his position and opportunities to good account, it is remarkable how little real good Lord Durham effected. We admit the important part he bore in the reform of parliamentary representation in the House of Commons, and in the upper house; but, there was a lamentable absence of expansive and constitutional views in the settlement of that great question, when one of the finest opportunities occurred for renovating the constitution of this empire. Lord Durham's plan of abolishing the right of cities, towns, burghs, &c., to return members to Parliament, and cutting up the country into parallelograms, with a certain number of electors in each section, however plausible in theory, was not only totally impracticable, but, if effected, would have destroyed the peculiar sectional and municipal freedom, which tends to prevent centralization, and the evils consequent on a destruction of local power and political rights.\n\n\"The adoption of the ballot and of triennial parliaments, would have quickly led to the overthrow of this parallelogram-constitution, and to the establishment of a despotism. The same want of practicability was observable in other parts of Lord Durham's public life; and, while we admit, that in several instances, his views were in advance of the age in which he lived, it is to be regretted that the real rather than the ideal was not more generally the object of his solicitude. This remark is fully illustrated by Lord Durham's mission to Canada, undertaken, as we believe, with the purest intentions, but totally failing as regards any object which might not otherwise have been obtained. The project of now uniting the whole of the British North American provinces in a federal union, was, to say the least of it, Utopian, and its promulgation, together with the vague declaration of responsible government, productive of no good result. Of the celebrated Canadian report of Lord Durham we may merely observe that it abounded with truisms, contained several erroneous principles, and often mistook effects for causes; but not a few just and sound ideas were promulged, and very many valuable facts were collected and registered for public investigation, while its tone was bold and manly, though too egotistical.\"\n\"But here our praise of Lord Durham's Canadian mission must end. His lordship set a most dangerous example to men, in high or low station, by the undignified and unconstitutional manner in which he quitted the government-general of British North America, particularly at a moment when one rebellion was but just quelled, and another on the eve of breaking forth. No governor of a colony has any right to gratify his own feelings by the desertion of a post in which his sovereign has placed him. Lord Durham's conduct on this occasion deserved impeachment, or, at the very least, a strong rebuke from the crown, and a marked vote of censure from both houses of the legislature. We say this without any reference to the alleged proceedings, or want of support of the ministry; no conduct on their part could have justified Lord Durham's retreat from his post. Nor was the manner in which his lordship acted after his return to England in unison with the high-spirited tone which he had assumed, and with his reckless defiance of the constitutional practice of the realm, or his ungracious despisal of the authority of his sovereign\u2014that sovereign too being a woman. We willingly pass, therefore, from the subject, as with it Lord Durham's political life ended, and we are disposed to think that idiosyncrasy of temperament, or bodily suffering, may have warped his judgment, and influenced his actions.\n\n\"The dark spots in the character of the nobleman, whose loss we lament, and who has passed away ere that period of life when age would probably have tempered asperities and impetuosity, are few, while the bright shades are in strong relief. Lord Durham loved his country, and ardently, though we think, in some instances, mistakenly espoused the cause of political freedom; he idolized our favorite idea of 'ships, colonies, and commerce,'* and his purse; and his time were ever cheerfully devoted to that great cause. He was ambitious, personally and nationally; but we think the latter outweighed the former; his passions were strong, but not lasting; and his nature too generous to be vindictive. As one of the few noblemen who sought to extend the colonial dominion of England, we honor Lord Durham's memory, and do justice to his statesmanlike views\u2014in his faults and his virtues he was truly English; and while numerous sorrowing relatives deplore his early decease, the advocates and friends of the colonies have reason to regret his too premature loss to his country.\"\n\n*To Lord Durham England owes mainly the colonization of New Zealand. His manly mind saw at a glance the importance of our settlement on that fine portion of the southern hemisphere, and he rested not until his wishes were realized.\nCHARLES BULLER, Esq.,\n\nA CELEBRATED English politician, connected with Canada during the administration of the Earl of Durham, whose secretary he was. Born at Calcutta, August, 1806; died in London, November 28, 1848; educated at Cambridge, where he graduated as B.A. in 1826; he entered Parliament in 1830 as member for West Looe, and in the following year was admitted a barrister at Lincoln's-Inn. He voted for the reform bill, which disfranchised West Looe, but in 1832 was returned for Liskeard, in Cornwall, which he continued to represent until his death in 1848, distinguishing himself by his support of liberal measures, and by his readiness as a debater. Whilst in Canada he took a very active part in our affairs, and wrote a great portion of the celebrated \"Report\" of Lord Durham. On his return to England he devoted himself to the practice of his profession, chiefly in connection with Indian affairs. In 1841 he became secretary of the board of control; in 1846, judge-advocate-general; and in November of the same year a Queen's counsel. In November, 1847, he was appointed president of the poor law board, but his promising career, which pointed to him as one of the future great statesmen of England, was cut short by death a year afterward. His skill in the treatment of public questions was made evident in his writings, most of which appeared in the journals of London and the leading periodicals of the country.\n\nSIR T. E. M. TURTON, Bart.\n\nMany in Canada will, no doubt, remember the name of the above gentleman, who accompanied Lord Durham to this country on his great mission, as his law adviser, and to him no doubt may be ascribed most of the errors which his lordship fell into during the short period of his administration.\n\nHe was born on the 8th November, 1790, and was the only son of the late Sir Thomas Turton, Bart. of Starborough Castle, Surrey, for many years M.P. for Southwark, and clerk of the juries in the Court of Common Pleas, by Mary, daughter and heir of the Reverend John Mitchell, rector of Thornhill, County York.\nHe was called to the bar by the honorable society of Lincoln's Inn, on the 6th February, 1818. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the borough of Sudbury at the general election of 1837. He was registrar of the Supreme Court at Calcutta from 1841 to 1848, having previously practised in the same as an advocate.\n\nHe succeeded to the baronetcy on the death of his father in 1844.\n\nHe died at the Mauritius, on his way to England, on the 13th April, 1854.\n\nSir Thomas Turton was three times married; first on the 2nd November, 1812, to Louisa, second daughter of Major-General Browne, from whom he was divorced in 1831, which gave rise to a trial in the Courts of England; secondly, to Adeline-Maria, daughter of , who died at Calcutta, July 14, 1841; and thirdly, in 1842, to Maria Louisa Hume, second daughter of Captain Edmund Denman, R.N.\n\nHis eldest daughter was married in 1842 to Francis Buller Templer, Esq., only son of F. J. Templer, Esq., of Columbo. His third daughter, Alice Trevor, in 1844, to Lieut. Ouchterlony, Madras Engineers. Another, Constance Trevor, in 1846, to James Forlong, Esq., of Milnath, Kishnaghur. He left a son to inherit his dignity of baronet.\n\nTHOMAS FARGUES, Esq., M.D.\n\nBorn at Quebec in 1780; died at the same place, 11th December, 1847; a distinguished scholar and eminent physician. He was educated in Harvard college, United States, where he graduated in the early part of the present century. He soon after left for Europe to complete his medical studies, and obtained his degree of doctor in medicine at the university at Edinburgh after defending a Thesis in Latin on \"Chorea,\" which was considered a production of great originality and merit; he afterwards resided for some years in London and became the intimate friend of plain John Abernethy, F.R.S. Those who were acquainted with both men considered them in talent and eccentricity the prototype of each other. He returned to Quebec, his native city, about the year 1811, and soon took the lead in his profession, and made for himself an extensive and lucrative practice.\n\nIn the variety and extent of his reading, the originality and strength of his mind, the sagacity of his observation, and the\ncapitvating power of his conversation, Dr. Fargues was an extraordinary man; he possessed one of the best private medical libraries in the country,* and was throughout life an indefatigable student, apart from his profession, metaphysics was his favorite pursuit. He was several times solicited to accept a seat in the councils of the province, which he declined, preferring to spend the whole of his valuable time in the exercise of his profession, of which he was so distinguished an ornament.\n\n---\n\nHON. D. B. VIGER.\n\nMr. Viger's is one of the names bound up inseparably with the history of his country. In the days when M. Papineau's magic eloquence spread disaffection through the province, while he was doing battle in Parliament for the fullest concessions of his liberty to his fellow countrymen, he had no stancher ally and adviser than Mr. D. B. Viger. A lawyer of standing, and well read in constitutional lore, he occupied a most prominent place in the controversy which led to the insurrection of 1837 and 1838. He crossed the Atlantic to lay the grievances of the Canadians before the Imperial Parliament. When the rebellion broke out, he was seized and imprisoned, charged with seditious practices. No sooner was he free to act again, than he regained his hold upon the popular affections, and was returned to Parliament. He sat for Richelieu, if we mistake not, in the first Parliament of United Canada; and for Three Rivers in the second. When Lord Metcalfe quarrelled with his Lafontaine-Baldwin cabinet, Mr. Viger was asked to take part in the new government as its Lower Canada leader, a task which he accepted, and which proved one of the most difficult and trying ever undertaken by any man. Mr. Viger had a sincere respect for the sincere, manly and generous qualities which adorned Lord Metcalfe's character, and made him almost the idol of a great portion of the people of the country. He believed him honest and just in his appreciation of the position which an imperial governor must assume in the country, and wished to give the strongest evidence to show that it was not disloyalty to the British crown, but a desire to secure the blessings of free government for his fellow countrymen, that prompted the\n\n*The library was purchased by George Ohill Stuart, Esq., Q. C., of Quebec, and given by him to the Laval university.\naction he had taken before 1837 and 1838. But although he secured the alliance of M. Papineau, a brother of the much loved popular chief, whose very name, it was believed, would prove a tower of strength,\u2014Mr. Lafontaine yet proved too strong for him, and he utterly failed to rally the masses of his countrymen to his side. He was raised, if we remember aright, in 1848, to the Legislative Council, where he continued to sit and vote for some years afterwards, but with the fall of the Metcalfe ministry, his political career may be said to have ended. His health precluded him for several years from attendance upon his parliamentary duties, and not long before his death, his seat was declared vacant for non-attendance, amid general expressions of regret. He died on the 13th February, 1861, and attained, we believe, a great age.\n\nHis funeral was one of the largest ever witnessed in Montreal. After leaving his residence, it proceeded to the Recollet church, and thence to the French cathedral. An impressive funeral service was chaunted at the altar with responses by a choir of male voices. The grand altar, as well as the smaller ones, were draped in black; and in the centre of the church, covered with a mourning pall, and surrounded by waxen tapers, stood the coffin. Monseigneur Bourget officiated, and at the close of the mass came forward to the stairs leading to the altar, and pronounced a brief eulogy of M. Viger's many virtues, as a citizen and Christian. In the course of his remarks he referred to the exemplary life which M. Viger had led, and desired the congregation to remember and act upon the glorious words he uttered when expiring: \"J'aime mon Dieu et j'aime mon pays.\" At the request of the deceased, all show and pomp were avoided in the funeral. It was no less deeply affecting than marked by perfect simplicity. Monseigneur Larocque, bishop of St. Hyacinthe, and the Hon. L. J. Papineau were present. The following gentlemen were pall-bearers: the Hon. Justice Smith, J. De Beaujeau, F. A. Quesnel, T. Bouthillier, W. Coffin, and A. Laframboise. M. Viger was the first president of the St. Jean Baptiste Society, and an honorary member of the Congregation St. Michel. These societies, with the Institut Canadien, Union St. Joseph, Congregation des Hommes de Ville Marie, L'Union St. Pierre and Societe de Temperance, formed in a line after the funeral service ended, making with the immense number of friends and relations, one of the largest funeral processions ever seen in Montreal. The Place d'Armes was thronged with people, showing their respect for the deceased, and the public sorrow which is felt for his death.\nHON. SIR DOMINICK DALY.\n\nWe know of no one who has figured in official life in Canada who has carried away with him so much esteem and respect from our people.\n\nSir Dominick Daly is the third son of the late Dominick Daly, Esquire, by the sister of the first Lord Wallscourt, and brother of Malachy Daly, Esquire, a banker in Paris. He was born in Galway, Ireland, in 1798, and married in 1826, the second daughter of Colonel Ralph Gore, of Barrowmount, county Kilkenny. He passed the usual examination, and was called to the bar; but he did not practice for any length of time. We believe he first came to Canada as secretary to one of the governors, and resided at Quebec. He subsequently became provincial secretary for Lower Canada; and, at the union, was appointed provincial secretary of Canada, as also a member of the board of works, with a seat in the Council. The latter he held until 1846, but the former he continued to hold, taking an active and lively part in all the most important affairs of the day, until 1848, when he vacated that post, but still continued a member of Parliament for the county of Megantic, for which constituency he sat during three first parliaments, until 1851, when he proceeded to England. His length of service in Canada amounted to twenty-five years. Afterwards he held some important commissions from the home government, and was appointed governor of Tobago, and subsequently lieutenant-governor of Prince Edward's Island, a post which he vacated only a few years since. He was knighted by patent during the time he held the latter office.\n\nHe has lately been elevated to the governorship of Western Australia. Kaye, in his \"Life of Lord Metcalfe,\" gives the following sketch of Sir Dominick, then provincial secretary.\n\n\"Mr. Daly was the secretary of state or provincial secretary of Lower Canada. He was also an Irishman, and a Roman Catholic, but although for the latter season his sympathies were strongly with the French people, or had been, so long as they were oppressed by the dominant race, his feelings, the growth of education and early association, were of a conservative and aristocratic cast. All Metcalfe's informants represented him to be a man of high honor and integrity, of polished manners and courteous address; a good specimen of an Irish gentleman. It was added, that he was possessed of judgment and prudence, tact and discretion; in short, a man to be trusted.\"\nSir G. ARTHUR, Bart., K.C.H., D.C.L.\n\nSir George Arthur's connection with Canada, although necessarily brief, was important in its results to this country, inasmuch as he was appointed to the high office of lieutenant-governor of Upper Canada at a time when it was inundated with troubles; and by his wise, conciliatory and also energetic mode of government, with the assistance of an able coadjutor in the distinguished officer, known best in this country as Sir John Colborne, perfectly restored peace, good will and contentment to the distracted province under his supervision. He checked, in a great measure, those evils which had arisen during his predecessor's term of government.\n\nSir George was born on the 21st June 1784; and, being destined for the profession of arms, early obtained a commission, and joined the army of his country. From all we can understand, he rendered good service during the time he was actively engaged, certain it is he could not otherwise have risen to such high rank, and to the eminence which he enjoined, having been before he came to Upper Canada governor successively over Honduras and Van Dieman's Land. As our province is more especially to draw attention to his services in this country, we will content ourselves by saying that previous to being appointed to the government of Upper Canada, he had been knighted by his sovereign, in recognition of his high abilities and of the important parts which he had taken in his country's service.\n\nOn the 23d of March, 1838, he was appointed to be lieutenant-governor of Upper Canada, and was sworn in at Toronto, Sir F. B. Head having been previously re-called. He immediately took the most active measures to suppress the rebellion, known as that of 1837, which had been raised by Mackenzie and his \"sympathisers.\" He was entirely successful; the course which he adopted at first was cautiously and prudently allied with bold measures. He bound himself to none, no parties, but was actuated by the purest motives. Many prisoners who had assumed an hostile attitude against us, he humanely released, and would have continued in this temporising course, were it not that a more stringent and enforcing rule of conduct was demanded against the base and infatuated fanatics, who would not be driven away, or be subjugated by kind or conciliatory means; and who returned again and again to their infernal practices, until they finally met the fate which all such as they so richly merit. History tells the tale how many suffered on the scaffold for the sins they had committed; nothing but this could move the rebellious and refractory to subjugation, or to lay down the arms which they had taken up against a confiding sovereign.\nWhen the troubles happily passed away, and peace was restored Sir George devoted himself to the minor affairs of state, which demanded his attention; and he worked assiduously for the good weal of the country. Many important changes were effected during the short time he held the reins of state; and more would assuredly have been effected, were it not that in 1839 the union of the provinces was resolved upon by the home authorities. The Honorable C. Poulett Thompson was appointed the first governor-general of United Canada. Sir George Arthur therefore, on the arrival of that gentleman, took his departure from the province, deservedly regretted by all parties of British tendency in Upper Canada. His success in that section of the province, as a colonial governor, was so good and so highly spoken of, that he was immediately appointed governor of Bombay.\n\nSir George married in May, 1814, Eliza, second daughter of Lieutenant-General Sir J. F. S. Smith, by whom he had many children, several of whom are still living.\n\nLIEUT.-GENERAL Sir R. ENGLAND, G.C.B.\n\nSir Richard England is essentially a Canadian, having been born at Detroit in 1793, then forming part of the province of Upper Canada, and as such we feel proud to be enabled to record his name with other \"celebrated Canadians\" in these pages. He is the son of the late Lieutenant-General Richard England of Lifford, county Clare, Ireland, (who served with distinction in all the American campaigns from 1775 to 1781) and at one time was commandant of Detroit. He was well known at that period to most of the people of the upper province, for his kind and amiable disposition to the settlers, and for his efforts in colonising the extreme western portion of Upper Canada.\n\nThe subject of this brief notice entered the army in 1808, and in the next year saw active service by serving at the siege of Flushing, and on the staff in Sicily in 1810; and in France in 1816, &c., he commanded the 75th Regiment for several years; was commandant of Caffaria in 1822-3, and was prominently employed in the Caffire war of 1835-6; was nominated a K.C.B. for his services in the Affghan war of that year, where he commanded the Bombay column which relieved Candahar; commanded an infantry division with the local rank of lieutenant-general in the Crimea in the campaign of\n1854-5; was present at Alma, Inkerman, the unsuccessful attack of the 18th of June, and all operations before Sebastopol, from October, 1854, to August, 1855; made colonel of the 50th Foot in 1854, and lieutenant-general for his services against the Russians, 1856; received the order of the Medjidio of the first class from the sultan; and was created grand officer of the legion of honor, 1856.\n\nSir Richard married first in 1814 the daughter of John Anderson, Esquire, (she died in 1839); second in 1844; the daughter of Richard F. Wilson, Esquire, of Milton Park, Yorkshire.\n\n---\n\nHON. ZACCHEUS BURNHAM,\n\nBorn on the 20th February, 1777; died at Cobourg in 1857. He came to this country in the year 1798, and lived at first in Haldimand. In the following year he removed to Cobourg, and for some time resided with his brother, the late Asa Burnham, Esquire, whose son, Asa A. Burnham Esq., now occupies the same premises.\n\nAt that time, the site of Cobourg was covered with a dense forest, and not a single log cabin was raised as a landmark in the dreary wilderness. The only \"clearance,\" if such it might be called, was a beaver meadow, on the skirts of the little creek in the heart of the town now crossed by King-street. Here Mr. Burnham cut his first hay, before grass had time to grow on the blackened fallow which the axe, the fire and his own sturdy hands had cleared. Hitherto the first settlers had been obliged to bring their provisions, generally on their backs, from Kingston and Napanee; but about the year 1793, Mr. Elias Smith built a mill at Smith's creek, the site of which is now Port Hope. Mr. Burnham would often mention his brother's first attempt to get some corn ground at the mill.\n\nFully equipped with a yoke of oxen and strong sled, he drove up along the beach to the mill, but a sudden thaw, (it was the month of March,) removed the ice from the beach, and he was obliged to return through the woods. In some places the trees had been felled where the road was intended, but the logs lay in the position the choppers had thrown them, and to guide a yoke of oxen after night in such a state of matters might well be called engineering under difficulties.\n\nIn the year 1801, Mr. Burnham removed to the farm he occupied at his death. During his long and active life, he filled various\nstations of trust, honor and emolument. He was an officer of the militia in the war of 1812. In that contest he took charge of the government stores, and conveyed them in bateaus up and down the lake. In 1814 he was appointed treasurer of the Newcastle district, and held that office till 1851, a period of thirty-seven years. In 1816, he was elected to the Assembly, and again represented the county in 1824. He was appointed legislative councillor in 1834, and held that high position till the union of 1841. He was also at different periods chairman of the quarter sessions and judge of the division court. He was colonel of the militia more than twenty years, and acted in that capacity at the time of the rebellion of 1836-37.\n\nMr. Burnham was one of those strong men that make a country. In his disposition he was good-natured, with a considerable vein of humor. He was a shrewd man of business, and at his death was considered the richest man in the district. He left a name that will not soon be forgotten.\n\n---\n\nHON. JOHN STEWART,\n\nFor sixty-four years a resident of Quebec, where he died in June, 1858. He filled many offices in the government and in the commercial institutions of the country. Under the administration of Sir G. Prevost, he was appointed deputy paymaster-general of the incorporated militia, the duties of which office he continued to discharge until the forces were disbanded. Upon the accession of Lord Dalhousie to the government of the province, he was called to a seat in the Legislative and Executive Councils, and was appointed sole commissioner of the Jesuit estates, having been for many years previously a member of the board of management. For a long period he was president of the Executive Council, a position which he held during the rebellion of 1836, when the peculiar state of the country imposed upon him duties of the most onerous and responsible nature. As a member of the commercial community, his life was no less active and useful. He was president of the Board of Trade, president of the Bank of Montreal, master of the Trinity House, and a firm and upright member of the Church of England. In every station of life, public or private, his conduct was marked by the strictest honor and integrity, and commanded the respect and esteem of all who became acquainted with his character.\nSIR R. J. ROUTH, K.C.B.\n\nSir Randolph was a son of the Honorable Richard Routh, past chief-justice of Newfoundland. He was descended from a very ancient Yorkshire family, of Routh, near Beverley. Sir Randolph was born at Poole, Dorset, England, in 1787. He received his education at Eton, and entered the military service. In 1826, he was appointed commissary-general, and from that time, saw continual service, and always of an arduous character. For thirty-seven years he served abroad, in Jamaica, at Walcheren, in the Peninsula, and at Waterloo (under the Duke of Wellington), also in the Mediterranean, West Indies, and Canada, where in the latter place, he was an efficient member of the Executive Council before the union, and while here, received the honor of knighthood by patent. During the famine in Ireland, he was made a commander of the order of the Bath, for his able superintendance and services in attending to the wants of the people during that time. In this country he was a universal favorite with all classes of the community, and it was with regret they witnessed his departure. He married first, in 1815, at Paris, Adelaide Marie Josephine, granddaughter of Colonel Laminiere, secretary-general of the Gardes de Corps of Louis XVI., who died. Secondly in 1830, at Quebec, Maria Louise, daughter of Honorable Mr. Justice Taschereau, and niece of the Roman Catholic bishop of Quebec. Sir Randolph Routh's death took place in London, in 1858.\n\nCOLONEL M. B. MENARD.\n\nMichel Bracamour Menard was born in Canada, at the little village of Laprairie, near Montreal, on the 5th of December, 1805. His parents were French. At the age of sixteen, he engaged in the north-western fur trade, in the employ of an American company, at Detroit. At about nineteen, he went to Missouri, at the solicitation of his uncle, Bierra Menard, then lieutenant-governor, and an extensive Indian trader, and for several years traded for him among the Indians. Becoming attached to Indian life, he determined to remain among them, and was elected chief\nby the powerful tribe of the Shawnees, which station he held for several years. His influence over them, and other tribes among whom he was known, was very great.\n\nTruth, justice, honor and courage, were instinctive to his character and displayed in all his actions\u2014qualities which command confidence and affection among all men\u2014the red and black even more than the white. The Indians still cherish his name, and it is a common expression among them, speaking of him by his Indian name, \"Miohelee never deceived us.\" A few days prior to his death, a brother of Tecumseh, with several other Shawnees, came to Galveston to see him. His meeting with them was affecting. They went to his house but would not enter. He sat on the ground with them for hours, and they begged him to go back again and be their chief.\n\nSuch was his known influence with the Indians, that at one time he was in treaty with the United States government for the removal of all the tribes of north-western Indians to the present country of Utah and California. This, of course, was never consummated, but we have heard him say that he came very near uniting all the Indian tribes into one great nation, and being their king, with over 100,000 subjects.\n\nAbout 1833 or 1834, he went to Texas, settled at Nacogdaches, and traded with the Mexicans and Indians. When the revolution broke out, the Mexicans endeavored to incite the Indian tribes on the north-eastern frontier, to overrun and desolate the country. At the solicitation of the Texan government, Colonel Menard went among them, and by his personal exertions, no doubt, prevented an invasion and kept them quiet.\n\nHe considered this event in his life of important service to his country.\n\nHe was a member of the convention which declared the independence of Texas, and formed the constitution of the republic.\n\nIn 1839, he was a member of Congress, from Galveston county, and was the author and powerful advocate of the system of finance by the issue of exchequer bills, which, failing that session, was recommended by General Houston the next, and adopted; and at a time when the country was flooded with red backs at a mere nominal value, and credit nearly gone, provided a revenue and currency which carried on the government, and saved the country.\n\nIn December, 1836, the first congress of the republic, for the price of $50,000, granted to Colonel Menard the league of land on which Galveston now stands, then unoccupied by a single habitation. He was emphatically the founder of the city of Galveston. From that day to that of his death, he was identified with every step of the progress of that city. Of enlarged public spirit, and the truest benevolence, there has been no enterprise which has not received his helping hand. No man possessed a larger share of\nthe confidence and respect of the entire community, or a stronger hold on its regard and affection. His death occurred at Galveston, in 1856.\n\nColonel Menard possessed a mind of very great originality and vigor. He was a strong, direct, practical thinker, who went to \"the inner fact of things,\" and expressed himself in the most sententious, nervous, and apt language. His conversation was very agreeable and interesting, abounding in anecdote, enlivened by keen wit, and rendered especially striking by his French gesture and accent.\n\nHis domestic character was admirable\u2014a devoted husband and father\u2014a hospitable neighbor, and a warm and generous friend.\n\n---\n\nHON. A. W. COCHRAN, D.C.L.\n\nAndrew William Cochran was born at Windsor, in Nova Scotia, in the year 1792. His father, the Rev. William Cochran, D.D., was a learned and eminently respectable Irish clergyman, who emigrated originally to the colonies which afterwards became independent; and having passed into Nova Scotia, became ultimately vice-president of King's college at Windsor, where the subject of this notice passed through his college course and finally became D.C.L. Mr. Cochran was bred to the profession of the law; but he had been noticed by the late Sir George Prevost, lieutenant-governor at the time of Nova Scotia, as a young man of far more than ordinary promise, and when Sir George became governor-in-chief, and assumed the reins of the government of Lower Canada, he sent for Mr. Cochran, and appointed him assistant civil secretary, in which capacity he served also during the short administration of Sir Gordon Drummond. He rose afterwards, under Sir John C. Sherbrooke, to be civil secretary, and filled the office with distinguished credit to himself, both under this patron and the Earl of Dalhousie,\u2014the Duke of Richmond, whose government intervened between that of Sir John and the Earl, having brought out Colonel Ready, as secretary, who continued to serve for a short time in the same capacity under the last mentioned of these governors. As a servant of the crown and of the public, Mr. Cochran passed through many changes, and experienced some vicissitudes and disappointments which never shook the evenness of his spirit or the cheerful flow and playfulness of\nhis temper; and in the unusual number and variety of offices which he sustained at different periods of life, he uniformly acquitted himself, according to the acknowledgment of all parties, as a thoroughly able and conscientious man, perfectly at home in whatever he undertook. At one time, in the early part of his career, he acted as judge-advocate within the military command of this country; at a period somewhat later (in the interval already mentioned between his occupation of the civil secretaryship under Sir J. Sherbrooke and Lord Dalhousie,) he was secretary of the clergy reserve corporation; he was also appointed auditor of land patents, (an office since abolished,) and held, while it lasted, the office of commissioner of the Court of Escheats. Previously to the suspension of the constitution, consequent upon the troubles of 1837, he was law-clerk of the Legislative Council, and during the existence of particular circumstances which created an interruption in the judicial functions of two of the judges of the Court of Queen's Bench, he was one of those who were appointed to occupy these important vacancies. He was also a member of the Executive Council of Lower Canada. Subsequently to the union of the provinces, he returned to the bar; and as he was now Queen's counsel in virtue of an appointment made in the time of Lord Dalhousie, he conducted under the late administration, the business of the crown in the criminal court at Quebec. Shortly before his death he was one of the commissioners for the administration of the loans made to the sufferers by the conflagrations of 1845.\n\nHe also filled, with great ability and assiduity, certain unremitting offices in institutions connected with the government, having been for many years an eminently useful member, and at one time, principal of the royal institution for the advancement of learning, and having a short time previous to his death been chairman of the commissioners of education, under the school act, at Quebec.\n\nThe multiplicity, however, of these official occupations did not withhold him from taking an active and prominent part in a variety of useful public institutions or operations, whether literary, religious, or beneficent. He was one of the trustees of Bishop's college, at Lennoxville; a vice-president and honorary counsel of the incorporated Church Society of the diocese of Quebec; a member of several other institutions connected with the operations of the Church of England, to whose principles he was deeply attached; but his beneficent exertions took a wider range, and his time often severely taxed as a working member of charitable associations, especially in the hour of public calamity.\n\nIn the departments of literature and science, there was no man in this country who manifested a more zealous interest, or was better qualified to bear a leading part, examples of which may be pointed out, in the Literary and Historical Society (of which he was at one\ntime president), and the Quebec Library Association. The range of his acquirements was unusually varied and extensive; the stores of his memory were really prodigious; and his habits, notwithstanding the vast variety of calls upon his time, were perseveringly studious,\u2014all opportunities being turned to account. He was curious in books, and, besides his acquaintance with classic literature, was familiar with the principal modern languages of Europe. He travelled at one time in some of the principal countries of that continent; and although his opportunities in this way were not very extended, his mind had treasured up, with great accuracy, whatever he saw of celebrity or interest.\n\nA most honorable tribute, conceived in the highest terms of eulogy, was paid to his ability, integrity and capacity for business, as a public servant, in the report of the royal commissioners sent out to inquire into the affairs of Canada, in 1835.*\n\nIn private life he was a person of ready conversational powers and great friendliness of spirit\u2014warmer, sometimes, on behalf of his friends than he would have been for himself\u2014yet of a remarkable firmness and solidity of character. He was of a social turn, and maintained an extensive acquaintance with persons at home and in the United States of America, as well as in the colonies\u2014but his earthly affections were centred in the domestic circle, and, with all the demands upon his time, which have been here enumerated, he found means to devote a portion of it to certain branches of the education of his own children.\n\nSuch was Mr. Cochrane\u2014but with whatever qualities to commend him to the esteem or even the admiration of men, he knew how to estimate himself before his God: and went out of the world, in all the self-possession and collectedness by which he was rarely deserted, with the deep conviction in his soul and the distinct avowal upon his lips, that his only hope of mercy was in Him who died for sinners. It was on the morning of the 11th July, 1849, after having gone to bed as usual and passed a comfortable night, that he became sensible of an indisposition which prompted him to write a note, about half-past seven, from his summer cottage, to his medical adviser in town. The attack soon declared itself in the unequivocal symptoms of Asiatic cholera, although not in their more violent form; and before three, p.m., of the same day his earthly history was brought to a close. It is history which affords an example, among others, that those who have best served the govern-\n\n* It may be worth while to mention an anecdote in Mr. Cochrane's life serving to illustrate the absence of haste and stiffness which are known to characterize the Duke of Wellington. Mr. Cochrane being upon one occasion in London, was sent for by the duke, who wanted some information connected with the military defence of the Canadian frontier, but being indisposed, he requested, that his grace would excuse him for that day. The duke immediately proposed to come himself to the lodgings of Mr. Cochrane. This however the latter would not permit, but made the exertion to wait upon the duke.\nment and the public in this country, have not always been the best requited. Mr. Cochran, in all human probability, would have been a far more prosperous man at the time of his death, if he had simply followed his profession, and had never served government at all.\n\nRIGHT HON. LORD SYDENHAM, K.G.C.M.\n\nThis great man, to whom we undoubtedly owe the existing union of Canada, was born at Wimbledon, in 1798, and was the eldest son of Mr. J. Poulett Thompson, of Rochampton and Austin-friars, and brother of George Poulett Scrope, Esquire, late M.P., for Stroud, who on his marriage in 1821 assumed the arms and name of Scrope by sign manual. When about twenty, he became resident in St. Petersburg as the correspondent of his father's firm; and until his accession to public office in 1830, he continued to be connected with the mercantile business. He represented Dover in the House of Commons from 1826 until 1830, when, being returned both for that borough and Manchester, he took his seat in Parliament as member for the latter influential manufacturing town. A reputation for commercial knowledge, a readiness of debating powers, and a zealous devotion to his party, recommended Mr. Poulett Thompson to Earl Grey's notice, and when, in November, 1830, that statesman was called on to form the reform administration, he was appointed vice-president of the board of trade and treasurer of the navy, and was sworn in a privy councillor on the 23rd of November. In July, 1834, he became president of the board of trade, and resigned with Lord Melbourne's administration in November following. In April, 1835, he resumed that office, in which he continued until he was selected to succeed the late Earl of Durham as governor-general of Canada.\n\nAs a cabinet minister, Mr. Thompson's principal efforts were directed to simplify and amend the customs laws. He attempted to negotiate a commercial treaty with France; but when he fondly anticipated that his agents had achieved the task, he found that all his efforts had been thrown away, and that the French government repudiated the concessions of their employ\u00e9s. Mr. Thompson was deeply mortified at this result, and pertinaciously refused to resume the negotiations unless the French ministers would define an outline of details by which they would be bound; this they refused to do. Mr. Labouchere (now Lord Taunton), his successor at the\nboard, did resume these negotiations without such preliminary stipulations.\n\nOn Lord Seaton's recall from Canada, Mr. Thompson was appointed to the supreme government of British North America. He arrived at Quebec on the 16th October, 1839. On the 19th he assumed the reins of government; and soon afterwards visited Montreal and other parts of the country, holding sessions of the then existing legislatures of Upper and Lower Canada. On the 10th of August, 1840, her Majesty was pleased to elevate the governor-general to the peerage of the United Kingdom, by the title of Baron Sydenham, of Toronto, as a mark of approbation of the manner in which he conducted the important government entrusted to his care. On the 20th of May, 1841, his lordship, while still in delicate health, left Montreal for Kingston, for the purpose of opening the first session of the united legislature of Canada, but which, from the alarming character his indisposition had assumed, he was only destined to close by deputation.\n\nLord Sydenham had slowly conquered the distrust of the Canadians, and under his administration prosperity gradually re-dawned on our noble province. The union of the two provinces was skilfully commenced by him\u2014an attempt was made to develop their great resources by completing the public works indispensable to their prosperity; and the name of Lord Sydenham will be preserved in connection with Canada for time immemorial.\n\nHe was appointed a knight grand cross of the order of the Bath on the 19th of August, 1841.\n\nHis excellency, whilst riding near Kingston, on the 5th September, 1841, met with a fatal accident by the falling of his horse. His right leg was broken, and at the same time a deep and painful wound was inflicted just above the knee. For about a week after, he appeared to be going on tolerably well. On the 18th, however, spasms came on, first in the leg, and afterwards in the stomach and throat. The prorogation of Parliament had at first been fixed for the 15th September, and subsequently, at the request of the Assembly, postponed till the 17th; and during the 16th the governor-general was employed in giving his decision on the several bills which had been passed, and in revising the draft of the speech, which, at his desire, had been prepared for him. On the morning of the 17th, his illness increased so much that he was obliged to put off the prorogation, and after consultation with his medical advisers, he determined to prorogue the Parliament by deputation. General Clitherow, being the senior military officer at Kingston, was selected for the purpose, and prorogued the Parliament on the morning of the 18th, at twelve o'clock, giving, at the same time, the royal assent or reservation to the bills which had all previously received Lord Sydenham's decision, and almost all of them his signature. On the night of the 17th the symptoms were fearfully\naggravated, and even those who had before hoped most, were forced to confess that hope was now vain. He was perfectly conscious of his own state, and about two o'clock on the 18th, he, together with all his establishment, received the sacrament. He then dictated to Mr. Dowling his will. To all his establishment he left some token of his regard. He desired to be remembered to Lord John (now Earl) Russell, to whom he bequeathed a memorial of his friendship, and when that part of his will was read over to him, he exerted himself to say, with emphasis, though interrupted by violent spasms in the throat, \"Dowling, Lord John is the noblest man it has ever been my good fortune to know.\" He then took leave of all individually, saying something kind to each. To Mr. Murdoch, his civil secretary, he expressed a wish that he should write the history of his administration in Canada. He repeatedly mentioned his continued interest in our country, and his satisfaction that the Parliament was prorogued, the great constitutional measures he had devised and proposed to Parliament passed into law, and the purposes of his mission accomplished. To his private secretary, Mr. Grey, late member of Parliament for Tynemouth, he said, \"Good bye, Grey; you will defend my memory. Mind, Grey, you will defend my memory!\" He then spoke kindly to Major Campbell and Mr. Baring, adding (motioning with his hand to all), \"Now leave me alone with Adamson (his chaplain, and the chaplain and librarian of the Legislative Council) to die.\"\n\nThe rest of that day and the whole night were spent by him in prayer and conversation with Dr. Adamson. During this period he suffered very much, but it was not until seven o'clock on Sunday morning that he breathed his last. There can be no doubt that the severity of the two winters he passed in this country, acting on a constitution not strong, alone rendered him unequal to bear the effect of an injury not otherwise of a fatal character.\n\nIn compliance with his own request, his remains found a fit resting place among the inhabitants of that town (Kingston), which owed to him its selection as the capital of United Canada. His funeral took place at Kingston, on the 23rd September. The occasion was observed as a day of mourning; the shops were closed, business suspended, and the greatest respect paid to the memory of the departed and great hearted nobleman. Immediately after the funeral, Lieutenant-General Sir Richard Jackson was sworn in as administrator of the government.\n\nLord Sydenham died unmarried, and his peerage expired with him.\n\nWe make the following extract from the life of this distinguished nobleman, edited by his brother (C. Poulett Scrope, Esquire, M.P.) and published in London in 1848:\n\n\"Lord Sydenham died at the age of forty-two; an age at which the public career of many statesmen is only commencing, of few...\"\nis more than half accomplished. Had his life been prolonged, and a stronger constitution permitted him to continue to devote his talents and experience to public business, few living men, perhaps, would at this time have commanded a larger share of the confidence of the community, or possessed, whether in or out of office, a greater influence over the course of affairs, by which the national welfare is determined.\n\n\"No man, we often hear, is long missed; his place is quickly filled, and the world goes on as before, or as it would have done had he not left it. In the case of Lord Sydenham, he had, in fact, for the two years previous to his decease, been withdrawn from the immediate focus of British politics; and, though the report of his brilliant administration in Canada excited much warm admiration among his friends in this country, and extorted praise and respect even from his political opponents, still a public man, who is lost sight of for two whole years in the centre of the political arena, runs much chance of being forgotten altogether.\n\n\"Had he, however, been permitted to return from Canada, Lord Sydenham's own energies and persevering anxiety to forward the march of improvement must, under any circumstances, have secured to him a high position in public estimation. And the tendency of events, since the period of his quitting England, has been precisely of a nature to render his peculiar qualifications of more than ordinary value and importance in the conduct of public affairs. From the epoch of the decease of Mr. Huskisson, he had been generally looked up to as the leading advocate of the doctrine currently known as that of free trade; and of the important, and till of late disputed principle, that the industry of a country thrives best when left to its own devices, uninterfered with by legislative and fiscal shackles, imposed for the pretended object of encouraging and protecting it. He had gone further than Mr. Huskisson himself had ventured in laying down this great principle, and in recommending it for adoption, as a state maxim. He had never wavered for an instant in the expression of his opinion in its favor, nor in a fearless determination to act up to it, so far as a just regard to circumstances would permit; and he had, in fact, vigorously and indefatigably striven to carry it out into practice during nine years of official power. He endured, without flinching, the savage storm of ridicule, calumny, and misrepresentation, which from the countless organs of the various monopolies was daily, weekly, and monthly poured forth upon him, as previously upon Huskisson, for daring to make war against their darling system of (miscalled) protection; and this at a time, when those, who now claim the credit of having always supported the principle of commercial freedom, either opposed him, or at the best stood coldly and silently aloof, and left him to bear the full weight of the odium then attaching to its advocacy. And now\nevents, which his sagacity long since foresaw and predicted as inevitable, had brought about a crisis in the commercial and economical history of the country, in which the full application of this principle could brook no longer delay; if the nation was to retain its pre-eminence in wealth and power, and be preserved from impending ruin,\u2014a crisis in which the leaders of the very party that had for years past thwarted and calumniated the efforts both of Mr. Huskisson and Lord Sydenham to liberate trade from the restrictions of the 'protective' system, were forced to come forward and admit the soundness of the doctrine they had so long allowed their followers to revile unchecked, and the necessity of far more largely acting upon it than they had permitted their political opponents, when in power, even to propose with any chance of success.\n\n\"As this crisis approached, and before Lord Sydenham's death, many who saw with dread the blackening of the horizon, and heard the threatenings of the coming storm, looked with anxiety for the expected return of one whose experience and judgment was, in their opinion, well fitted to cope with its emergencies, and exert, even out of office, a salutary influence in the national councils on its occurrence. And their regret was proportionately severe, when this hope was destroyed by his premature and melancholy dissolution.\n\n\"Not, whatever sincere respect we may entertain for the abilities of those who now hold the foremost rank in that noble contest into which he, with them, would have so warmly entered, as into his natural element, had his life been spared, can it be gainsayed that no one individual among his survivors united so many of the peculiar qualities, which he possessed for successful service in this particular cause. His comprehensive and liberal views of commercial policy were founded, not upon the book-learned theory, caught up from the suggestions of pamphleteering economists, but upon extensive practical acquaintance with commerce, and an experience gained in the superintendence through many years of the whole range of the commercial interests of this mighty empire: with this, an intimate acquaintance with finance\u2014habits of order and business\u2014indefatigable application\u2014the confidence of practical men, built upon a long intercourse, and, moreover, the tact, judgment, and prudence taught to a mind of great natural sagacity by a long and intimate acquaintance with parliamentary tactics and ministerial responsibility.\n\n\"Possessing the acknowledged qualifications, had Lord Sydenham returned to England with the additional reputation acquired by his brilliantly successful administration of Canadian affairs, where being isolated from all others, his individual abilities had been brought out the more conspicuously, it cannot be questioned that he would have commanded a high position in public opinion,\nand must have taken a very prominent and valuable share in the discussions that have been, and are yet going on, upon the absorbing questions of the day relative to commercial legislation.\n\n\"These speculations are perhaps useless at present; but not so, it may be hoped, this attempt to record and present to the public a review of the acts and opinions of one who did so much while living to advance the prosperity of the country by giving freedom to its industry; and whose authority may yet have some influence in guiding the current of public opinion, now setting so strongly, and, as it would appear, irresistibly, in the direction, which, for so many years, he laboured to give it.\n\n\"Nor, it is hoped, will the portion of this memoir which relates to his Canadian administration, be devoid of a similar value. It may serve to teach a lesson of great practical value with respect to the treatment of colonial dependencies. The time is gone by when the important task of representing in them the sovereign authority can be safely entrusted to unskilful or inexperienced hands. The peace of the empire, the progress and future destinies of great nations, can no longer be jeopardized in this manner. It requires a mind of no ordinary vigor and capacity to encounter successfully the ever-varying difficulties of such an office;\u2014above all, where the colony possesses an independent legislature, and perhaps no lengthened experience in the exercise of such an institution. By executive mismanagement a colony may be very easily ruined and lost, or the parent state weakened and distressed by its forcible retention. A mere glance at the history of Canada, during the last few years, will amply demonstrate to the most casual observer that such a colony is only to be preserved and rendered a real source of strength, power, and wealth to the mother country, through the rapid development of their common resources by a cordial union, when the sovereign power within it is delegated to some statesman, who, like Lord Sydenham, can temper conciliation with firmness, mildness with decision,\u2014who, without trenching on the freedom of representative institutions, knows how to maintain the supremacy of the imperial authority, and whose personal influence, prudent skill, and practical knowledge of mankind may enable him so to work upon the discordant materials he has to deal with, as to obviate those shocks and collisions to which new and popular institutions are ever liable; and which, at a distance from the central supreme authority, are more than ordinarily hazardous.\n\n\"Such a governor as Lord Sydenham, is indeed not to be always obtained. Perhaps one so happily fitted for the task will never be again seen. But he afforded a high standard towards which to approximate in our estimate of the qualifications required for such an office.\n\n\"Canada has, certainly, no less reason than England to deplore\nhis loss; since, even though absent from her, he might have been relied on to watch over her destinies, with which so much of his own future fame is embarked, and advocate her cause on every opportunity in the imperial councils. But it may be reasonably hoped that the great institutions and large schemes of public economy, which were founded by him, will survive the embarrassments that mismanagement or party dissensions may have for a time occasioned; and that this province, of which the natural resources are so vast, may long continue incorporated with the glorious empire of Britain, growing in wealth, power, and prosperity into the mighty and ultimately independent nation which it is, no doubt, destined hereafter to become. For this prospect both countries will, it is confidently anticipated, ever consider themselves in a large degree indebted to the wise resolves and vigorous action of Lord Sydenham's administration of the affairs of Canada in the years 1839, 1840 and 1841.\n\n\"The public character of Lord Sydenham has been anticipated in the narrative of his public career. Little remains to be said but what would be mere repetition. His mind was of a class peculiarly fitted to deal with the necessities of the bustling and practical period in which he lived; and that was the secret of his early and rapid success in the arena of politics. His was not, however, a parliamentary reputation of the usual stamp, acquired by oratorical display, or gladiatorial powers of debate. He seldom attempted any flights of eloquence, though in some of his earlier speeches, there are passages which cannot be read, and certainly were not heard, without creating strong emotion. His voice, however, in speaking was not well modulated, and this is well known to be essential to successful oratory. The subjects to which he exclusively confined himself, in addressing the House of Commons, were, moreover, necessarily dry and unentertaining, full of details of facts and figures, usually of the most uninteresting character to such an assembly as the House of Commons. On the exciting party question of the day he rarely opened his mouth; and hence his services to his party were liable to be undervalued by those who look rather to the debates in the house, than to the principles on which the government is carried on, or the mode in which it conducts the affairs of the country. In fact, he ever disliked and avoided speaking, unless when the commercial or financial interests of the country, to which he devoted himself, required the exposure of some abuse, or the suggestion of some legislative improvement, or when the business of his office, rendered defence or explanation necessary.\n\n\"His fame must rest, as has been noticed in an earlier part of this memoir, not so much on what he did or said in parliament, as on what he did and proposed to do out of it,\u2014on his consistent, and to a great degree successful efforts, to expose the fallacy of the\nmiscalled 'protective system,' and gradually but effectively to root it out of the statute-book, and thereby to free the universal industry of Britain from the mischievous shackles imposed, and yet partially maintained, by an ignorant and mistaken selfishness,\u2014to allow the development of its inherent energies, unencumbered by the officious patronage of the legislature to permit it to make (as under such circumstances it is sure to do) that vigorous, rapid, and healthy progress, which must secure to all engaged in it a continually increasing remuneration, and to the nation at large a corresponding increase of her power, her strength, and her prosperity.\n\n\"His Canadian administration may be looked on as a brief though brilliant episode in his public life, which, while it confirmed the high opinion ever entertained of him by his friends, convinced those who had under-estimated his powers before of their extent and variety,\u2014convinced every one that in all the great qualifications of intellect, temper, habits, and acquired information that constitute a statesman, few have been so rarely gifted as the lamented subject of this memoir.\n\n\"In private life, Lord Sydenham was universally loved and esteemed. His amiable disposition and pleasing manner excited the warmest attachment among those who were admitted to his intimacy; and in every circumstance that affected their happiness, he always appeared to feel the liveliest personal interest. In the midst of his unceasing occupations, he never failed to find time for any work of kindness or charity that offered itself, and even for the attentions required by the forms of society. His assistance was always prompt and eagerly afforded, whenever he could oblige a friend, or confer a favor on a meritorious object. His integrity and sense of honor were of the loftiest character, and his disinterestedness carried to an excess.\n\n\"The remuneration, indeed, for his arduous public services in office, with which he was contented, was far inferior to that of any other official of equal station, and much below (be it said in passing) what a just and wise appreciation of the importance of the post would assign to it. But never having married, his wants were moderate, and his private fortune more than compensated the exiguity of his official salary. That he remained single may, perhaps, be partly attributed to an early disappointment; but, chiefly to his incessant occupations and failing health.\n\n\"The friendships he formed with individuals of either sex were both strong and lasting. Indeed, few men were more fitted by nature to captivate and enchain affection. His person and countenance were singularly prepossessing; his manner full of charm and refinement, and his address frank, manly, and courteous; his disposition obliging; his regards to the feelings of others, exquisite. His mind was amply stored with varied information, acquired from books, from frequent foreign travel, from an acquaintance with the\nleading characters of the day, and a special intimacy with the subjects of paramount interest in these bustling times. His remarkable aptitude for foreign languages made his conversation as pleasing, and his society as much sought after by foreigners as by his countrymen. Few men were more generally popular in the circle in which he moved, and this was ever the highest and most intellectual of whatever place he inhabited. He was a sincere Christian, and the account given of his last hours, by the reverend gentleman who fulfilled the last painful duties towards him, as his chaplain, is at once affecting and consolatory to his intimate friends and connections, among whom his loss created a void which can never be supplied.\n\n\"It is not, however, in his private capacity, but rather as a public benefactor, that it has been the object of this memoir to record him, and, it may safely be concluded, by the expression of an opinion, that the annals of no country can produce an instance of one, who, in a spirit of truer patriotism, during the brief period permitted to his earthly career, more nobly, ardently, devotedly pursued, in defiance of ridicule, obloquy, and the most odious misrepresentation, through good repute and through bad, and at the sacrifice of his own ease, health, and even life itself, the one great object which was ever uppermost in his thoughts, to the last moment of his existence, namely: the increase of the happiness of his fellow-creatures, by all such means as are within the reach of those gifted statesman who wield the supreme power of Imperial Britain.\n\n\"None knew better than he the amount of that power,\u2014the influence which Great Britain, at the head of the advancing energies of the civilised world, exercises over the destinies of mankind. And the task which he laid down for himself, on arriving at manhood, and assiduously labored through the remainder of his life to accomplish, was, in truth, the highest, the noblest, the most god-like, which is given to man upon earth to undertake. Time and power were not afforded him to give full effect to his exertions, or bring them to maturity. Nevertheless, those, who hereafter review the events of the age he lived in, will, it is believed, see reason to assign to their impulse no inconsiderable share of the beneficial progress which is now generally making towards a right understanding, and a practical exemplification in this country, (followed as she is sure to be at a distance by other states) of the great problem how human institutions can best secure, and least interfere with, the spontaneous development of man's ingenuity and industry, in the production and just distribution of all the material comforts and enjoyments of existence, which a gracious Providence has abundantly placed within his reach.\n\n\"This, and the impress of his influence on the future history of our North American colonies, will form Lord Sydenham's most enduring and appropriate monument.\"\nHON. AUSTIN CUVILLIER\n\nFor many years occupied a conspicuous position amongst our public men. In 1815 he was returned to Parliament as member for the county of Huntingdon: there his eminent financial abilities displayed themselves, and he became one of the leading members on all matters relating to the finances of the country. In the difficulties between the House of Assembly and the oligarchy which, under the name of the governor-general, administered the affairs of the country, he was found at all times arrayed in the ranks of the advocates of the rights of the people, and the privileges of their representatives. In 1828 he was delegated, along with the Hon. D. B. Viger and the late Hon. John Neilson, to lay before the Imperial Parliament the petition of 87,000 inhabitants of Lower Canada, complaining of the privation of their political rights to which they were subjected. He was examined before the select committee of the House of Commons, and his answers evinced a high degree of ability, and a thorough knowledge of the defects of the then system. The report of the committee, it is well known, admitted the well-founded nature of the complaints of the people of Canada, and promised reparation of the abuses.\n\nMr. Cuvillier continued to sit as a member for Huntingdon until 1834; when he lost his seat in consequence of his differing in opinion with the majority of the House of Assembly on the celebrated \"92 resolutions.\"\n\nAt the first elections of members of Parliament for united Canada in 1841, Mr. Cuvillier was again returned for Huntingdon, and he had the high honor of being elected speaker of the Legislative Assembly. This office he filled with great dignity and impartiality during the first Parliament.\n\nIn the second Parliament after the union Mr. Cuvillier was not re-elected, in consequence of his being considered not to concur in the view taken by the Lafontaine-Baldwin administration in the rupture with Lord Metcalfe, which led to their resignation. Since that time he took no part in public affairs.\n\nAs a merchant, Mr. Cuvillier conducted the most extensive commercial establishment, we believe, in Canada. His business talent was certainly unsurpassed by that of any of his rivals or contemporaries.\n\nAltogether, whether as a public man, or as a merchant, Mr. Cuvillier evinced talent very rarely to be met with. He was one of those instances which may, with propriety, be adduced in refutation of the absurd and unfounded prejudice which underrates\nCanadian talent and enterprise. In whatever country Mr. Cuvillier might have been born\u2014or in whatever sphere he might have moved\u2014his talents would have been appreciated, and he could scarcely have failed to rise to eminence.\n\nHe died at Montreal on the 18th of July, 1849.\n\n---\n\nJOHN WAUDBY, Esq.,\n\nA CANADIAN journalist. Mr. Waudby was a native of England, though the last thirty years of his life were spent in Canada, during a portion of which time he was connected with the newspaper press of this country. He was editor of the Kingston Herald, when that journal was under the proprietorship of Mrs. Thompson, from whom subsequently he purchased the proprietorship. He was also selected by Lord Sydenham, when governor-general of the province, to edit a newspaper at Toronto, with a view to forward his lordship's views respecting the union of Upper and Lower Canada. But sometime previous to his death (which occurred in August, 1861,) vacated the editorial chair for the responsible office of clerk of the peace for the united counties of Frontenac, Lennox, and Addington. Mr. Waudby not only possessed literary talent, but was also a mechanician and inventor. In his lifetime he laid claim to the invention of \"angle-sided mail-clad ships and floating batteries.\"\n\n---\n\nHon. Mr. JUSTICE SULLIVAN.\n\nThis was truly one of the greatest statesmen, politicians and lawyers that Canada could reckon among her indigenous sons.\n\nWe understand that Mr. Sullivan was born in Toronto, but we have not the date of his birth. Let it suffice, however, to record that he was brought up and educated, that he lived and died there, and that he was one of the illustrious men whom the \"Queen City\" has produced to do honor to her name, and to be a credit to the country.\nHe studied the profession of the law under his uncle, the late Dr. Baldwin, father of the Canadian statesman of that name. Whilst engaged in his legal studies, he was appointed librarian of the House of Assembly, from which situation he probably derived some advantages from access to the books at a time when public libraries were scarce and most private ones meagre. At this period of his life, we are told in an article in the Leader recording his death, that he was noted for what afterwards was more conspicuous in him, brilliancy of wit, sobriety of conduct, and severe application. He was admitted to the bar in 1824, or 1825, and, not thinking himself competent as yet for a professional life in town, he removed to the county of Middlesex, where he for a time practised until his services were called into requisition in various cases in Toronto, first as counsel for Dr. Morrison before the House of Assembly, in the contested case of member of Parliament for York, between that gentleman and the present Chief-Justice Robinson. He also appeared in the celebrated prosecution case of Collins, for libel, and after the trial he industriously got up a petition to the government in the prisoner's favor. In consequence of his conduct in the latter case, a requisition was presented to him from the citizens of Toronto, praying him to reside in that city,\u2014a prayer with which he complied, and ever afterwards lived amongst them. This was in 1828, and not until 1834, we believe, did he enter public life, and then only as mayor of the city. The advent of his name into the grand arena, however, was not long delayed. On the resignation of Sir F. B. Head's council, he accepted a vacant seat. Till then he had never had one in either branch of the legislature, and had never contested a constituency, nor did he now look out for one, although there is no doubt he could have been easily returned for several places. He preferred the higher branch of the legislature, and accepted a seat in it from the governor. On the death of the Honorable Peter Robinson, Mr. Sullivan became commissioner of crown lands, in which situation it was his misfortune to have thrown on him the responsibility of a subordinate defalcation, the amount of which he made good out of his own pocket. He subsequently became a member of Sir George Arthur's government, which position he held during the troubles of 1837, and took an active and judicious part in suppressing it, to the satisfaction of all that had at heart the good name of their country. In the government of Lord Sydenham, Mr. Sullivan also held a place. The administration of that great nobleman and statesman was distinguished chiefly by the union of the provinces, which was mainly effected by his exertions. This was the dawn of responsible government. During the government of Sir Charles Bagot, Mr. Sullivan was also a member of the executive, as in that of Sir Charles Metcalfe; but resigned with his liberal colleagues on the famous antagonism between that governor and his ministry. This was one of the most\nAND PERSONS CONNECTED WITH CANADA.\n\ncritical conjunctures that had ever arisen in Canada between two parties, and two great party cries, constitutionalism and reform. In the former the subject of this notice took a determined stand, and his letters under the signature of \"Legion,\" did good service to the cause which he espoused, so much so, that, combined with his activeness and energy, they in a great measure achieved the triumph of his party.\n\nIn the Baldwin-Lafontaine ministry of Lord Elgin, Mr. Sullivan held the office of provincial-secretary, until raised to the bench in September, 1848, a position which he maintained with great honor and advantage to the country, and credit to himself and family, until his death, on the 14th April, 1853.\n\nHON. ROBERT BALDWIN, C.B.\n\nMr. Baldwin was born in the city of Toronto in 1804. His family, father and grandfather, came to this country in 1798. His father, the Honorable William Warren Baldwin, was the son of Robert Baldwin, Esquire, of Summer Hill, otherwise Knockmole, near Corregoline, in the county of Cork, Ireland. When the family came to this country, they originally settled in the township of Clarke, on lake Ontario, where they were among the earliest settlers. They afterwards removed to Toronto\u2014then the town of York\u2014where they took up their residence in Spadina; and there the family resided till the death of the father of the subject of this notice, which took place on the 8th January, 1844. The Honorable W. W. Baldwin, was a medical man; having taken his degree of M.D. at Edinburgh. After removing to York, however, Dr. Baldwin betook himself to the profession of law, which he practised with success for a number of years. He (father of the Honorable R. Baldwin) had represented the county of Norfolk in the Parliament of Upper Canada; and been called to the Legislative Council about six months before his death. On the occasion of the death of Dr. Baldwin, Mr. Hincks wrote:\u2014\"Our country has lost a friend; and the country, it may be said, will follow him as mourners to the grave. By the removal of one so worthy, so disinterested, so excellent, we have sustained a loss, the magnitude of which it is difficult to appreciate, much more in this community to repair... It is not Toronto only that will feel the privation, or drop tears of submissive sorrow over his honored tomb. The sad tidings, like an electric shock, the less convulsive...\"\nin its effects because expected, will widely extend an awakened interest over regions sufficiently enlightened to appreciate his worth, and sufficiently grateful to deplore his loss.\" To his son, these words might with equal truth be applied. No public man in Canada, perhaps, in his day, commanded such general respect as the Honorable Robert Baldwin. His integrity was so far above suspicion that the breath of calumny itself never uttered a word against his fair fame. He commanded the respect of all parties; the affection of his own was willingly accorded. His name, even to the last hour of his life, was a tower of strength; it might easily have been made the nucleus of a party round which the scattered elements of the Reform ranks would have rallied, till union was once more restored.\n\nIn stature Mr. Baldwin must have been about five feet nine or ten inches. His frame was of stout build; but the work of disease appears to have begun to undermine his constitution eight or nine years before his death. In the spring of 1850 his health had visibly declined; and there being no hopes of a speedy improvement he was the more anxious to retire from public life, in the following year.\n\nHe was of a mild and affable disposition; but he lacked that peculiar style of address which characterizes the man easy of access and of familiar manners and habits. He had few of the characteristics which usually make a man popular with the crowd. He scorned to bend to those petty arts which inferior men find so useful, and indeed so indispensable, to their success in dealing with the public. He paid small court to even the most prominent of his constituents; and by this means lost something of that ephemeral and local popularity which are necessary to the statesman who wishes to retain undiminished the full strength of his position. His name is, however, inseparably interwoven with the brightest period of our history; the period in which constitutional principles triumphed over the oligarchical system on which the province had previously been ruled. His was a career that will be the more valued according to the increasing distance at which it is seen; his a lustre that will shine the brighter as time continues to roll on.\n\nFollowing the profession adopted by his father, he entered on the practice of the law, in 1825, and the firm was long carried on under the name of Baldwin & Son, till he retired on the 28th July, 1848, when the business was continued by Mr. Adam Wilson. His father and he built up an extensive and lucrative practice; and he must have left behind him a fortune of something like a million of dollars. He owned an immense amount of property in Toronto. Of the large amount of wealth which he leaves behind, a part had been left to his father, by bequest, from the Honorable Peter Russell.\nMr. Baldwin inherited the liberal principles of his father. He was first elected to the Upper Canada Assembly in 1829, in opposition to Mr. Small; having in the previous year made an unsuccessful run against Mr. Mackenzie, for the county of York. This election took place on the resignation of Chief-Justice Robinson; Mr. Baldwin came forward as the liberal candidate in opposition to Sir John Colborne's administration. His opponent was then deputy-clerk of the Crown, and many of his friends were well provided for, in one way or another, out of the public. The whole influence of the placemen was cast against Mr. Baldwin. While the election was pending, Mr. Mackenzie wrote:\u2014\u201cOur earnest wish, is that the election of Mr. Baldwin may prove to the world that the capital of Upper Canada has burst her fetters, and followed the praiseworthy example of her sister city, Quebec, which sent to Parliament an independent citizen, a few months ago, in spite of all the military and civil influence of all the constituted authorities.\u201d Sir John Colborne, before his retirement from the government, recommended to the colonial secretary, the appointment of Mr. Baldwin to the Legislative Council, of which body, if we mistake not, an uncle of his was a member. The appointment was, however, not made; and a subsequent governor wrote to England to discourage the recommendation of Sir J. Colborne.\n\nThe Opposition to which Mr. Baldwin, the newly elected member for York\u2014now Toronto\u2014had allied himself, had a parliamentary existence as early as 1820. Even at that time it was respectable, if not formidable, both in talents and numbers; but as yet it could not count a majority of the representatives. But after the election of 1824, the scales were turned; and the Government found itself perpetually in a minority in the popular branch of the legislature. The election of 1828 brought no additional strength to the executive government; and the same anomalous spectacle of a government ruling in defiance of the constantly expressed wishes of the Legislative Assembly presented itself to the eyes of Mr. Baldwin, when in 1829 he entered Parliament for the first time. It was one well calculated to impress upon his mind the necessity which existed for changing the system of government. Subsequent events were not calculated to remove that impression; for although the executive did contrive to secure the return of a majority of supporters in the elections of 1830, events soon showed that this was but a passing accident; for the elections of 1834 again left them in a minority, in which condition the government continued to be carried on for two years. In the twelve years from 1824 to 1836, the executive was in a minority in the Legislative Assembly for eight years. During the whole of this time, the Legislative Assembly were consistently passing bills which were as constantly rejected by the Legislative Council. For these\nevils Mr. Baldwin declared that he saw no remedy but that of placing the \"Executive Council permanently upon the footing of a local provincial cabinet, holding the same relative position with reference to the representatives of the king and provincial Parliament as that on which the king's imperial cabinet stands with respect to the king and Parliament of the empire; and applying to such provincial cabinet, both in respect to their appointments and their continuance in office, the same principles as those which are acted upon by his Majesty with respect to the imperial cabinet.\" To an elective legislative council Mr. Baldwin was opposed; believing that the demand for it would never have arisen, if the principle of responsible government had been conceded as soon as the executive found themselves permanently in a minority in the Legislative Assembly. This opinion he never changed. He never concurred in the propriety of constituting, on a new basis, the Legislative Council; and for this reason he thought there would be an incongruity in his consenting to be elected to that chamber. From the time of Mr. Baldwin's entrance into Parliament, we find the principle of executive responsibility constantly asserted. It was embodied in the address in reply to the speech from the throne, 1829; and again in 1835, it was made the subject of a solemn appeal to the imperial government, in an address to the sovereign passed by a majority of twenty-one votes. On this occasion, the Assembly went so far as to intimate their intention to refuse the supplies if their reasonable demand was not complied with. After the resignation of the Executive Council, in 1836, of which Mr. Baldwin was a member, the Legislative Assembly adopted a resolution declaring it to be the opinion of that house that the appointment of a responsible Executive Council, \"to advise the lieutenant-governor on the affairs of the province, was one of the most happy and wise features in the constitution, and essential in our form of government.\" In a house of fifty-five members only two votes were recorded against this resolution. In 1836, Mr. Baldwin went to England, and while there endeavored to impress upon Lord Glenelg, then colonial minister\u2014by writing, for he was never granted an interview at the colonial office\u2014the necessity of applying the English principle of responsibility to the provincial executive. When in England, the intelligence of the success of the tories in the Upper Canada elections, which had just been held, reached London; and Mr. Baldwin took special care to impress upon the colonial secretary not to deceive himself by supposing that this event would supersede the necessity for an application of the principle for which he so strenuously contended. If it were withheld, he assured the imperial government, there was great danger that the affections of the majority of the people would become alienated from the mother country. In their quarrel with Sir Francis Head, the executive took the ground that the\nprinciple of responsible government was intended to be conceded by the constitutional act of 1791.\n\nMr. Baldwin, having thus begun, never ceased to do battle for the principle of responsible government, till it was fully and unreservedly conceded. He has been called the father of responsible government; and in one sense he may be said to have been so. Not that he was the only one to advocate the principle; but there was this difference between him and most of the other reformers, that while he relied entirely upon this principle as the basis of all real reform, they did not by any means confine themselves to this single demand. They were always discussing what ought to be done when the machinery for doing it should be obtained. Mr. Baldwin was for obtaining the machinery first, and then trusting to its successful operation when it should have been secured. This devotion to a single leading principle\u2014which, however, contains all that is valuable in the British system of government\u2014earned for Mr. Baldwin, in certain quarters, the designation of a man of \"one idea.\" And a glorious idea it was! Without it what would Canada be to-day? Of this principle the ablest opponents were to be found in the Legislative Council. An excellent summary of their objections\u2014containing all that could be said against responsible government\u2014is to be found in a report of a committee of the Legislative Council, which, in 1839, undertook to answer Lord Durham's able report on British North America. Although this document contained all the tory wisdom of the day, it is impossible to peruse it now without a smile.\n\nMr. Baldwin's principle\u2014his one idea, if you will\u2014had found a powerful advocate in Lord Durham; and from the moment of the publication of his famous report, the oligarchical system was doomed. It managed to totter on a little longer, by the aid of violence and fraud; but nothing could avert a doom which was inevitable. Even the reaction attempted by Lord Metcalfe was unavailing. He would consult his ministers on all \"adequate occasions,\" so he said\u2014and he was left without ministers for nine successive months, having only a provincial secretary, after the resignation of the Lafontaine-Baldwin cabinet in November, 1843. Mr. Baldwin was among those who resisted his reactionary movements; and he was one of those who came in after the fall of the ministry which, after the elections, Sir Charles Metcalfe had been able to form.\n\nMr. Baldwin was in several different governments. He was first sworn in as executive councillor on the 18th February, 1836; having for colleagues Messrs. Rolph, Dunn, Bidwell and Markland. They held office for a very short time; and it was after their resignation, upon a difference with Sir Francis Bond Head, as to how the government should be conducted, that he made the visit to England previously referred to. In 1840, on Mr. Draper being\nappointed attorney-general\u2014on vacating the solicitor-generalship\u2014Mr. Baldwin was appointed solicitor-general. This step was publicly approved by his friends. At a meeting held in Toronto for that purpose, Dr. Widmer occupying the chair, Henry John Boulton, who had previously been allied to the \"Family Compact,\" appeared as an advocate of responsible government. The meeting was, however, essentially reform in its complexion. Mr. Baldwin thus explained his views in accepting office: \"I distinctly avow that in accepting office, I consider myself to have given a public pledge that I have a reasonably well grounded confidence that the government of my country is to be carried on in accordance with the principles of responsible government, which I have ever held. My position, politically, is certainly peculiar; but its peculiarity has arisen out of the position in which the present Parliament has placed the governor-general, (Sir George Arthur) themselves and the country, by the course they chose to adopt during the late session; and it is therefore right that it should be distinctly understood that I have not come into office by means of any coalition with the attorney-general. * * * * * * * Whenever I find that the government is to be carried on upon principles adverse to those which I profess, I shall cease to afford them my support, and shall cease to be a servant of the Crown.\"\n\nThis step was fully endorsed by the county; and Mr. Baldwin was elected for two constituencies, the south riding of York and the county of Hastings. In September of 1842, Mr. Baldwin became attorney-general for Upper Canada, M. Lafontaine occupying the corresponding office in Lower Canada, and dividing with him the somewhat anomalous dual premiership. He continued to occupy this position till the rupture with Sir Charles Metcalfe. Taking the same office again in February, 1848, he held it till July, 1851, when he quitted ministerial life for ever. At different times he represented the town of York, the fourth riding of York, Rimouski and Hastings, in Parliament. His death took place at his seat Spadina, near Toronto, on the 9th December, 1858. There also his body lies. His funeral was attended by an immense concourse of people of all political parties.\n\nMr. Baldwin married a sister of the late Honorable Robert Sullivan, who bore him several children. He survived her. One daughter is married to the Honorable John Ross; one son is at sea, and another in the church. A man of charitable dispositions, he has been known to subscribe as much as \u00a3100 at a time to a worthy object.\n\nAt a meeting of the members of the bar held two days after his death, in the convocation room at Osgoode Hall, for the purpose of paying such tribute to the memory of Mr. Baldwin, who had been treasurer of the Law Society of Upper Canada, as his high position\nand marked integrity deservedly entitled him to, the following resolutions were passed:\n\n\"Moved by Mr. Attorney-General Macdonald, seconded by Geo. Ridout, Esquire: That the death of the Honorable Robert Baldwin, C.B., late treasurer of the Law Society of Upper Canada is to this meeting, and to the whole profession, a source of profound regret.\n\n\"Moved by Honorable J. S. Macdonald, Q.C., seconded by Honorable P. M. Vankoughnet, Q.C.: That the legal knowledge and ability of the late Robert Baldwin secured to him the high respect of the bar, while his pure love of justice and the unaffected honesty of his character commanded the sincere admiration and esteem of all who knew him.\"\n\nMr. Baldwin, although his valuable life was not very long extended, lived to witness in Canada a very remarkable progress, both material and political. That progress is described, in an article which appeared some years ago, by Mr. John W. Cook, Quebec; and as the political improvement which it records was very mainly owing to the labors of Mr. Baldwin, we may not unfitly conclude with it this notice of his life:\n\n\"What vast changes a few years have witnessed in Canada! Swamps have been made the seats of cities abounding in all the means of enjoyment peculiar to civilized life. Territories, but yesterday as it were, serving only as preserves for wild beasts, have been turned into areas of cultivated land. Innumerable acres, which but a short time ago were lying in their original waste, abound now with granaries stocked with the food of man, the product of agricultural labor. Vast wildernesses have become fruitful fields. In the very heart of districts which but a few years back were covered with the primeval forest, are the homesteads of thousands of happy settlers, surrounded on every side with the most substantial marks of comfort. Were Goldsmith to rise from his grave and see our farm houses, we firmly believe that he would bless the results of that monopoly, which, in the finest of his poems, he denounced as the cause of British depopulation. Yet many of these abodes have been erected by recent settlers. It requires but a steady exercise of perseverance to procure in Canada for the industrious comforts of which a life of self-denial would in all probability have left them destitute in Britain. And long after the agricultural settler has placed himself in a better position than he could ever have occupied at home, he still retains the industrious habits which, with the concurrence of propitious circumstances, gained him that position. Placed in a larger sphere, his ideas expand. He no sooner obtains one comfort than he looks forward to another. And the more he desires the better for the country. Agricultural ambition is the mainstay of trade. The longing of the tiller of the ground for those luxuries to which his industry entitles him, is the builder up of our cities. To supply\nhis wants becomes the aim of many, who assembled together in new formed towns, vie with each other in offering to the agriculturist whatever he may regard as attractive. Every new settler, in however remote a section he may establish himself, advances in two ways the general interests. Not only does he make a piece of ground hitherto useless become productive; he also offers inducements to others to settle in the country. Anticipating that success will crown his labors, the trader follows him to the forest. And he is not deceived. The farmer is successful. He is in good time enabled to avail himself to a greater or less extent, of the proffered luxuries; and as he increases in prosperity his views enlarge. The stores of the merchant increase in exact proportion to the number of cleared acres. When we consider the near relation between agriculture and trade, we need not wonder at the rapid rise of our cities. Success in trade always follows agricultural success. And the latter is sure to attend the industrious farmer in Canada.\n\n\"It is impossible, however, even when bearing in mind the great advantages of Canada, to avoid wondering at the success of its industrious population; so great is the change which their industry has worked\u2014so great the change which it is every day working. The alterations which late years have witnessed in the material condition of the province, can indeed be only compared in magnitude to the political changes which have contemporaneously occurred. The latter are in their way as striking as the former. An old settler might have laughed at the person who told him that in twenty years the then desolate site of Hamilton would become the seat of a considerable city. But he would not have been one whit less surprised, had he been told that the two provinces would be united under a just and liberal system of government; that the power of self-government would be recognized by imperial authority as a right not to be called in question; and that the party, which denied the soundness of the great principles for which reformers contended, would become powerless in the state. Perhaps, indeed, the prospective rise of a city would not have seemed so strange to him as the prospective fall of irresponsible misrule. His ideas of provincial government would have, likely enough, been indissolubly connected with a few families. The reign of an oligarchy he might have looked forward to as interminable. There are many now living who never expected to see the country governed on sound principles. But those principles have happily triumphed; and a more thoroughly popular system of government than that which exists in Canada, could not possibly be found in any country.\n\n\"Perfection in the administration of public affairs has, indeed, yet to be attained. The great revolution did not all at once give good government to England. It almost immediately improved the political condition of the country, but it still left many evils\nuntouched. 'The vices and ignorance,' says Lord Macaulay, speaking of another period, 'which the old tyranny had generated, threatened the new freedom with destruction.' So it was in 1688. To the superficial observer it seemed that affairs were even in a worse condition than in the time of James. A boorish usurper had, it was said, replaced a king who had at least, the hereditary dignity of the Stuarts. Short-sighted, narrow-minded men were dissatisfied because of the temporary inconveniences which followed the change. Very few even dimly discerned the great benefits which have ever since continued to flow from it. There may be many with us so disgusted either by real or imaginary abuses in the administration of affairs during late years, as to be unable duly to appreciate the benefits which have already flowed from responsible government. But if the province is true to itself, the period of the inauguration of that system, will be to it what the period of the revolution is to England\u2014the period from which will date, not indeed revolution in the outward form of its government, but continued improvement in the manner of its administration. We never expect to see absolute perfection; but we do expect to see the rise of a spirit which will ultimately impart to our politics the same character which now distinguishes the politics of Britain. While almost every other country in Europe presents a more or less pitiless spectacle, England stands conspicuous for its combination of law and liberty, loyalty and order. And the old reformers of Britain\u2014the men who fought and died for the constitution in the darkest periods of English history\u2014did not fight for the enjoyment of it by England alone. The Hampdens and Russells fought the battles of the future inhabitants of countries of which they had probably never heard. Thanks to the exertions of such men as Mr. Baldwin, we enjoy the advantages of the system which they died in defending. Whether or not we can work it well is a great political problem which has not yet been thoroughly solved. But if fanatical bitterness is disregarded, and the dictates of a judicious public opinion, which seeks only the general good, become the guide of our Parliament, there will be no doubt of the final result. The province will then present a pleasing spectacle. Political improvement will keep pace with the wonderful material improvement on which we dwelt in the former part of this article; and closely connected with prosperity as it is, good government will regulate and sustain our progress. It rests with the people of Canada themselves to make their political future a bright one.\nLIEUT.-GENERAL CLITHEROW.\n\nJohn Clitherow was the eldest son of Christopher Clitherow, Esquire, of Bird's Place, in Essenden, Hertford; by Anne, only surviving daughter of Gilbert Jodrell, Esquire, and was born in the year 1782. He died October 14, 1852.\n\nHe was appointed ensign in the 3rd Foot Guards, December 19, 1799; lieutenant and captain, February 24, 1803; captain and lieutenant-colonel, October 8, 1812. He served in the Egyptian campaign of 1801, and received its medal; the expedition to Hanover in 1805, and that to Walcheren, in 1809. In December, 1809, he proceeded to the Peninsula, where he was present in the battle of Buasco, and severely wounded in that of Fuentes d'Onor, and in consequence he went home. He rejoined before the battle of Salamanca, in which he was engaged; and was again wounded at the siege of Burgos, and obliged to return. In 1815, he served in France.\n\nHe attained the rank of colonel, in 1821, that of major-general, in 1830, and that of lieutenant-general, in 1841. He administered the government of Canada, in 1841, after the decease of the lamented Lord Sydenham, and until the appointment of Sir R. D. Jackson. He was appointed to the command of the 67th Regiment on the 15th January, 1844.\n\nOn the death of his cousin-german, James Clitherow, Esquire, colonel of the West Middlesex militia, on the 12th October, 1841, he succeeded to the representation of that ancient family,\u2014the only family, we believe, of any antiquity in Middlesex, having first settled at Boston House, in the parish of Brentford, in the reign of Charles I. in the person of James Clitherow, Esquire, who was the son and heir of Sir Christopher Clitherow, lord mayor, in 1636, and one of the citizens in parliament for the city.\n\nLIEUT.-GENERAL SIR R. D. JACKSON.\n\nSir R. D. Jackson, who administered the government from 1841 to 1842, was the commander-in-chief of the forces in Canada, and an officer who had seen much service. He distinguished himself particularly at the battle of Barrosa, in the command of\nthe detachment of the Coldstream Guards, which in conjunction with the 87th and 67th Regiments, repulsed the right wing of the French army, and captured an imperial eagle. Sir Richard served throughout the after campaigns in the Peninsula, on the quarter-master-general's staff, and in 1820, succeeded Sir Benjamin D'Urban as deputy quarter-master-general, and colonel of the brigade staff corps. He died at Montreal.\n\n---\n\nHON. FRANCIS HINCKS.\n\nThis gentleman to whose enlightened mind and patriotic spirit, Canada is so deeply indebted, is the fifth and youngest son of Dr. Hincks, of the family of Hincks, of Breckenbrough, in Yorkshire, which traces its origin to William Hincks, an alderman of Chester in 1841. Dr. Hincks, who settled in Cork in 1791, was an active member of the various benevolent societies in that city. He was minister of the Princess Street Presbyterian congregation, and secretary of the Cork Institution; and was also distinguished for his success in the instruction of youth, several educational works that he published having had a large circulation, and many of his pupils have risen to eminence in their respective professions. In addition to the ordinary branches of school education, he gave lectures on natural philosophy, chemistry, and natural history, which were open to others as well as his immediate pupils, and which led to the establishment of the Cork Institution, of which he may be regarded as the founder. In January, 1815, he removed to Fermoy, in consequence of obtaining the mastership of the classical school there founded by John Anderson, Esq.; and in July, 1821, to Belfast, having been elected head classical master and professor of Hebrew in the Royal Institution of that city. He died a short time since.\n\nEdward, the eldest son of Dr. Hincks, obtained a fellowship in Trinity college, Dublin, in 1818, and is now rector of Killyleagh, a college living which was formerly of considerable value. He is the author of several papers in the transactions of the Royal Irish academy, on subjects connected with Egyptian, Persian, and Assyrian archaeology. In the two latter, his discoveries have attracted much attention, in connection with those of Colonel Rawlinson, the same results having, in several instances, been obtained almost simultaneously, by the one at Killyleagh, and by the other at\nBagdad. He was the first to determine the forms and values of the Assyrian numerals, from an examination of ancient inscriptions at Van; an account of which was published in the journal of the Asiatic Society.\n\nThe second son, William, is distinguished as a naturalist; he was the first professor of natural history in Queen's college, Cork, and holds since 1853, a similar situation in the university of Toronto, an institution of great celebrity on this continent, being indeed only second to Harvard of Boston.\n\nThe third son, Thomas, has been curate of Belfast, and is the prebendary of Cairne Castle; he has the character of being one of the most active and efficient clergymen of the Established Church of Ireland.\n\nFrancis, the subject of the present notice, commenced his education under his father, at Fermoy, and continued it in the classical and mathematical school of the Belfast Institution, then presided over by Dr. James Thompson, afterwards professor of mathematics in the university of Glasgow. In the month of November, 1822, he entered the collegiate department of the institution, and attended the logic and belles-lettres and the Greek and Latin classes during the winter session. But in May, 1823, he expressed a desire to be a merchant, and it was finally arranged that he should be articled for five years to the house of John Martin & Co., previously to which, however, he had three or four months initiation into business habits in the office of his father's friend, Samuel Bruce, Esq., notary public and agent. The period for which he was articled terminated in October, 1828, but he continued with the firm until the beginning of 1830, when he sailed to the West Indies as supercargo of one of Messrs. Martin & Co.'s vessels. He visited Jamaica, Barbadoes, Trinidad, and Demarara, but not meeting with an inducement to settle in any of these colonies, he agreed to accompany a Canadian gentleman, whom he met at Barbadoes, to Canada, and proceeded to Montreal and Toronto, his object being to ascertain the nature of Canadian commerce and business. Having gleaned the information he desired, he returned to Belfast in 1831. In the following summer, having determined to settle in Canada, he married the second daughter of Alexander Stewart, Esq., a merchant of Belfast, and soon after sailed to New York, and proceeded to Toronto, where he became the tenant of a house and store belonging to and adjoining the residence of Mr. Baldwin, who had emigrated from Cork several years previously. From him Mr. and Mrs. Hincks, and their youthful family, received attentions and services of which Mr. Hincks often speaks with grateful recollection. He soon obtained a high reputation for knowledge of business, and when Mr. Mackenzie attacked Mr. Merritt and others respecting the Welland canal, and obtained a parliamentary investigation, he was chosen, with another merchant,\nto examine the accounts; he was also appointed secretary to the Mutual Insurance Company, and cashier to a new banking company.\n\nOn the appointment of Lord Durham to the government of Canada, Mr. Hincks commenced the Examiner newspaper, in the editorship of which he displayed such remarkable vigor and talent, that he was invited to become a candidate for the representation of the county of Oxford in the first Parliament held after the union of the upper and lower provinces. The election was held in March, 1841, when Mr. Hincks was returned by a majority of thirty-one over his opponent, a gentleman named Carroll. Shortly after his election, he was appointed by Sir Charles Bagot inspector-general, and was obliged, in consequence, to vacate his seat and return for re-election. He was opposed by John Armstrong, Esq., who abandoned the contest at noon on the third day, Mr. Hincks having a majority of 218. When Lord Metcalfe dissolved the Canadian Parliament in 1844, Mr. Hincks was defeated, his opponents being Robert Riddle, Esq., (a son-in-law of Admiral Vansittart) who was returned by a majority of twenty over Mr. Hincks, and the Hon. Thomas Parke, who did not go to the poll. In 1848, however, he was declared elected by the legislature, by the large majority of three hundred and thirty-five over his old opponent, Mr. Carroll, although the returning-officer had declared Mr Carroll elected, through some legal technicality in Mr. Hincks' qualification. Having for the second time accepted the office of inspector-general under the administration of his first friend in Canada, he was re-elected without opposition.\n\nUpon the reconstruction of the ministry, consequent on the retirement of Mr. Baldwin, owing to his impaired health, Mr. Hincks was, through the strong expression of public opinion, named prime minister by the governor-general, and until the latter part of 1854, held that post with distinguished honor, and with the confidence and respect of all the good men of every political denomination in Canada. Nor is this a higher meed than he deserves, for it is in a great measure owing to him and others, and his financial ability, his enlarged views as a politician, his great practical knowledge of what is conducive to the material interests of Canada, and his tact and experience as a parliamentary debater, that the province occupies its present position, and has before it the brilliant prospects that are constantly opening up.\n\nOn his return to Canada, from a visit to England, he was elected to represent the south riding of Oxford for the fifth time, by a majority of 64 over his opponent, J. G. Vansittart, Esq., a son of Admiral Vansittart of Woodstock, C. W., and therefore a rather formidable opponent. This was his last election contest. Mr. Shenstone, clerk and census commissioner of the county of Oxford, has, in his \"Oxford Gazetteer,\" borne powerful testimony to the value\nof Mr. Hincks's patriotic and praiseworthy exertions. In dedicating his useful work to that gentleman, he says: \"I find that the first municipal act, giving to the people great powers; the amendment of it, whereby these powers were greatly increased; the establishment of township councils; the new elective law whereby a poll is opened in each township; the amendment of the elective act, whereby sheriffs are ex-officio returning officers, and township clerks ex-officio deputy returning officers; the division court act, the assessment act, the new jury act, the new post-office act, and cheap postage\u2014all of them date their existence from the time of your first election to represent this county, and in all of them your masterly hand is unmistakably discerned. In addition to these inestimable and invaluable blessings, enjoyed, in common with us of this county, by the whole province, I may add that, although the Great Western Railroad and the London and Hamilton Plank and Gravel Road had long been in contemplation, and repeated unsuccessful attempts had been made to forward them before your election, it required your information, energy and perseverance to complete the one and place the other in its present prosperous and promising condition.\" It was he, too, who first appreciated the necessity of a great system of railways throughout the province; and it is to him that the credit of the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada, in its present extended proportions, is due.\n\nIn 1855, he was appointed governor and commander-in-chief of the Windward Islands, a position he held with great honor and credit to himself, and to the sovereign and nation which appreciated his sterling worth in placing him there. This year he was elevated to the governorship of British Guinea.\n\nMr. Hincks has been one of our most fortunate politicians, but no one will dispute that he has not merited everything that he has attained. Happy, indeed, would every colony of Great Britain be, if its councils were directed by a minister or governor as patriotic and as enlightened as Francis Hincks.\n\nJ. B. FARIBAULT, Esq.\n\nM. Faribault was born at Berthier, Lower Canada, in 1773. His father, Barth\u00e9lemi Faribault, a Parisian by birth, had filled the office of military secretary, under the Duquesne administration, and died in 1801. Some years before this event took place,\nMr. Faribault had removed to Quebec, where having obtained a situation as accountant, in a mercantile establishment, he remained there five years. As this calling ill-suited his inclinations, he longed for a change, and offered his services to the American North-West Company, which were accepted. In May, 1796, he started from Montreal for Makinaw, where his stay was but of short duration. While on this journey he married Miss Ainso, by whom he had eight children. Having remained eleven years in the employ of the North-West Company, and experienced many reverses, he at last fixed his home in Minnesota, and founded the settlement which bears his name. He was the first who cultivated the soil west of the Mississippi. Forty years ago, having purchased agricultural implements, he taught the Indians how to till the earth, in which undertaking his success was complete. He was universally known by the tribes from the Mississippi to the Missouri, and possessed their entire confidence.\n\nHe died in Minnesota Territory, on 20th August, 1860.\n\n---\n\nREV. MR. GINGRAS.\n\nThis accomplished gentleman, who died at Paris, in 1860, was in his fifty-first year.\n\nMr. Gingras had received his education in the seminary of Quebec, where, in 1831, after going through his studies with great success, he entered holy orders. In the following year, he became professor of belles-lettres, and was, from 1833 to 1834, successively appointed director of the seminary and of the college of Quebec. In 1844, he visited Europe and the Holy Land, in company with Mr. B\u00e9langer. When in Rome the degree of doctor in divinity was conferred on him. On his return to Canada he published two volumes containing an account of his travels in Egypt, Arabia, Palestine, Turkey, and Greece. In this work no account of his travels in France, Italy, Germany, Belgium, and Ireland is given, and this is the more to be regretted, especially with regard to Germany and Ireland, as but very few French Canadians ever visit these two countries.\n\nHaving returned to Quebec, he for sometime had charge of a class of philosophy, and also of a theological conference. He became once more director of the seminary, but as he found it necessary to undertake another voyage for the benefit of his health,\nhe had to abandon this post, which he did accordingly, in May 1860. His illness was one, however, not to be overcome, and the consolation of breathing his last in the midst of his old school-fellows, of his friends and pupils, was denied him. His meekness, piety, devotion, and countenance, expressive of deep piety, had acquired for him the name of saint, an appellation by which all were happy to know him.\n\nWM. DUNLOP, Esq., M.D., M.P.P.\n\nDoctor Dunlop was long a resident of Western Canada, where he died, in 1848. He represented the county of Huron, in the first and second Parliament, after the union. He possessed literary talents of a high order, and was long a contributor to Blackwood's Magazine.\n\nM. MICHEL BIBAUD,\n\nA Canadian author of note; born on the 20th of January, 1782, at the Cote des Neiges, near Montreal; died at the latter place, on the 3rd August, 1857. He pursued his studies with success at the college of St. Raphael. Among his fellow-students were M. Jacques Viger, Judge O'Sullivan, and M. Hughes Honey. Having left college, M. Bibaud embraced the literary profession. Like many other of his countrymen, he labored hard in defence of Canadian nationality, and for the conservation of the French language. Chateaubriand speaks of the French in America as a doomed race, destined to dwindle away like the aborigines with whom they have intermingled and sympathized. If this be a true prediction, certainly the French Canadians are themselves the last to realize it. They, however, feel that their nationality, and even their language, need constant efforts to preserve them in the position they now occupy. While contributing, in turns, to the \"Aurore des Canadas,\" the \"Bibliotheque Canadienne,\" the \"Magasin du Bas Canada,\" the \"Observateur Canadien,\" and the \"Encyclopedie Canadienne,\" M. Bibaud was, in his interval\nof leisure, writing verses, which have been greatly esteemed by his countrymen, and engaged in more profound didactic and scientific studies. He wrote the first history of Canada in French, since the conquest, the merits of which, though variously estimated, are generally admitted. He wrote besides, an \"Arithmetique Elementaire,\" and edited the \"Voyage de Fronchere;\" besides producing a variety of other valuable little works. He is described as having always been a laborious writer, and indeed, the number of his works proves that he must have been so. We are told that it would have been easy for him to rise to power; but, that he preferred an honest ease and liberty. But a few months before his death, he was engaged, at the age of seventy-five, in translating the reports of the geological commission.\n\nS. H. DICKERSON, Esq.\n\nMr. Dickerson was the pioneer among newspaper publishers in the Eastern Townships, having established a paper in Stanstead Plain, something more than thirty years since. He was a practical printer, a man of considerable ability, and of very independent character. This trait brought him into a very unpleasant collision with the late eccentric and learned Judge Fletcher of the Eastern Townships. Having commented in his paper upon a decision of the Judge, in terms which the latter construed as a contempt of court, he was committed to jail and kept in confinement for over a year. His offence, if any, was a freedom of remark upon a judicial decision which is now everywhere considered the legitimate right of a free press. He sought for justice at the hands of the legislature, but either from having espoused the wrong side of politics, or for want of faithfulness in those who undertook his case, he failed to obtain redress beyond the satisfaction of seeing a report from a legislative committee severely condemning the conduct of the judge as tyrannical and oppressive. Mr. Dickerson early espoused the radical cause, which he faithfully adhered to till the breaking out of the rebellion of 1837, when he left for the United States. When the demands of his party were conceded, he returned to Stanstead, and was some years before his death appointed as collector of customs in that place, in recognition of his claims for services and sufferings in the liberal ranks. Independent of politics, we believe the office was worthily bestowed. He died in 1857.\nJ. R. WILBY, Esq.\n\nJOHN ROBIN WILBY, Esquire, one of the ablest members of the Indian press. Mr. Wilby was a native of Canada, and received a sound collegiate education in his native town. When a very young man he suffered from weakness of the eyes, and the doctors advised that the only way to prevent the loss of sight was to have recourse to a long sea voyage. His friends could not well afford to pay for his passage, so he enlisted as a common sailor, and arrived in India in that capacity. Having obtained his discharge from the ship, he remained in Calcutta, a stranger in a strange land, in search of adventure and fortune. Mr. Wilby tried his hand alternately as reader, reporter and contributor, in connexion with the Calcutta press; but it was not long before he was taken on the editorial staff of the Hurkaru, where he distinguished himself by writing some of the ablest and most telling articles that appeared in that print. On leaving the Hurkaru press, Mr. Wilby, in conjunction with the present editor of the Calcutta Phoenix, set up the Bengal Times, the name of which was afterwards changed to the Citizen. The connexion, however, did not last long, as Mr. Wilby received the offer of a handsome engagement with the Mofussilite, and accepted it. He afterwards had editorial charge of the Delhi Gazette, and conducted that journal with an ability which was publicly acknowledged by the managing proprietor, on Mr. Wilby's vacating the editorial chair. He next joined the Lahore Chronicle, and only a short time previous to his death, which occurred in 1857, returned to Bengal to take his place on the staff of the Friend of India. Mr. Wilby was a young man of extensive reading and varied information. There was scarcely a department in philology or the sciences in regard to which he was altogether ignorant. His linguistic and scientific attainments were pretty nearly on a par, a combination, not always to be met with. Above all as a public writer, Mr. Wilby was one of the boldest and most thoroughly honest that the Indian press possessed.\nLIEUT.-GENERAL DURNFORD.\n\nLieutenant-General Elias Walker Durnford, colonel-commandant of the Royal Engineers; born in 1775; died at Tunbridge Wells, on the 8th of March, 1850. He received his commission as 2nd lieutenant, 1793; 1st lieutenant, 1796; captain-lieutenant, 1801; captain, 1805; lieutenant-colonel, 1818; colonel, 1825; major-general, 1837; and lieutenant-general, 1846. He was present at the siege of Fort Bourbon and capture of Martinique, St. Lucia, and Guadaloupe, in 1794. He served many years in Canada, and it is but justice to his memory and his family to say, that he constructed and perfected many of our most valuable fortifications. One of his daughters married the Revd. E. W. Sewell, of Quebec.\n\nRIGHT HON. SIR C. BAGOT, BART., G.C.B.\n\nSir Charles Bagot was one of our best and most successful governors during his brief term of office. It may truly be said he laid down his life for our interests, having accepted the high office, which he held, at a time when he had more need of rest, repose and retirement from the great labors which his public life had entailed upon him. His memory deserves to be cherished for the great benefits which his wise and prudent administration of affairs conferred on the province.\n\nSir Charles was born on the 23rd September, 1781, at Blithfield, in the county of Stafford, where his ancestors had lived from a period antecedent to the Norman conquest, and where his family still resides. He was the second son of William, Lord Bagot, by his wife, Louisa, daughter of John, Viscount St. John, brother and heir of the celebrated Lord Bolingbroke. He married Lady Mary, daughter of the third Earl of Mornington, brother of the Duke of Wellington, the late Marquis Wellesley and Lord Cowley, by whom he left three sons and five daughters. He was a privy councillor, knight grand cross of the order of the Bath, and director of the National Gallery.\nSir Charles Bagot entered public life in 1806, as under secretary-of-state for foreign affairs, when Mr. Canning held the seals of that department, in the Duke of Portland's administration. At the close of the great war in 1814, he was sent on a special mission to Paris. Shortly afterwards, he was appointed minister plenipotentiary to the United States, and successively ambassador to the courts of St. Petersburg and the Hague. Upon the return of Lord Amherst from the east, the high post of governor-general of India was offered to him, but the then state of his health compelled him reluctantly to decline it. In the short administration of Sir Robert Peel, in 1834, he was dispatched upon a special embassy to the court of Vienna; and in 1841, was requested by the present Earl of Derby, (then Lord Stanley) the secretary-of-state for the colonies, to undertake the post of governor-general of British North America. Sir Charles Bagot entered upon the duties of his high office on the 10th January, 1842, and was very favorably received by the inhabitants of Canada. He very wisely did not pledge himself to either the conservative or reform parties, but judiciously passed some time in making himself thoroughly acquainted with the affairs of the province, and made up his mind to govern the country by the best men that he could pitch upon. He encouraged and patronised the French Canadians, who were powerful, even some who had been connected with the rebellion; but who deeply regretted such a connection. He also took into his confidence the reform party of Upper Canada, then led by the celebrated Mr. Baldwin. McMullen, in his excellent History of Canada, says of this: \"There can be no question that this was the wisest line of policy he could adopt, and that it tended to remove the differences between the two races, and unite them more cordially for the common weal. The French Canadian element was no longer in the ascendant; the English language had decidedly assumed the aggressive, and true wisdom consisted in forgetting the past and opening the door of preferment to men of talent of French, as well as those of British origin. The necessity of this line of policy was interwoven with the union act; and, after that, was the first great step towards the amalgamation of the races. A different policy would have nullified the principle of responsible government, and must have proved suicidal to any ministry seeking to carry it out. Sir Charles Bagot went on the broad principle, that the constitutional majority had the right to rule under the constitution.\"\n\nIt was during this time that some of our most talented statesmen came into office. Mr. Hincks became inspector-general; Mr. Baldwin, attorney-general, west; Mr. Lafontaine, attorney-general, east; Mr. Morin, commissioner of crown lands; Mr. Aylwin, solicitor-general, &c. During the administration of these gentlemen various were the improvements effected in the province;\ninnumerable were the good things that arose out of them. Sir Charles Bagot had brought into office men of talent, and men that could work for the country.\n\nUnfortunately the worthy baronet did not live to see the successful issue of what he had inaugurated during his brief tenure of office. Towards the close of the year 1843, his illness became of so serious a character, that he solicited his recall, a request which was acceded to. Sir Charles Metcalfe was appointed in his stead. A few months passed, and the worthy and amiable Sir Charles Bagot passed from this world to the better. He was long and deservedly regretted by all people of all origins and parties; the country lost in him one of its best friends and advocates; the sovereign an able and efficient servant, who had labored zealously in the service of his country.\n\nCHIEF-JUSTICE SIR L. H. LAFONTAINE, BART.\n\nOf the history of this celebrated man, we cannot say a great deal, as the materials at our command are very meagre. He is the descendant of Antoine Menard Lafontaine, Esquire, who was a member of the parliament of Lower Canada, from 1796 to 1804. Sir Louis Hyppolite was born at Boucherville, Canada East, in October, 1807; he is the third son of A. M. Lafontaine, (son of the former) and of Marie J. Fontaine Bienvenu, his wife.\n\nFor the sketch of his career, we are indebted to the clever writer of the \"Washington Sketches,\" written at the time that the present chief-justice was at the zenith of his political life:\n\n\"For many years M. Lafontaine applied himself to the bar with great diligence and success. He accumulated a handsome fortune and made an advantageous match. It was not until he thought himself \"rich enough\" that he gave much attention to politics; a circumstance which accounts largely for the independence and sturdy vigor of spirit he has shown.\n\n\"At first he was follower, then a rival, of Papineau. The latter was with the parti pr\u00eatre, the former led that of La jeune France, and the priests shook their heads at his orthodoxy; in fact, spoke of him as little better than an infidel. But \"circumstances alter cases.\" Both fled, in 1837, from warrants for high treason. M. Lafontaine reached England, where, not feeling himself safe, by the assistance of Mr. Edward Ellice, who had the greatest single property in Canada, he escaped across the channel to France.\n\"More fortunate than M. Papineau, he was very soon enabled to return, there in reality being no evidence against him. His fate had been like that of Defoe: he had written an ironical letter to a M. Girouard, on the absurdity of rebellion, which was taken literally.\n\n\"M. Lafontaine now found himself in a position to lead, and he forthwith set himself to conciliate his old opponents, the priests. Whether from conviction or from policy, he went regularly to mass, and his moral conduct being irreproachable, it is to be presumed that he was sincere, though the coincidence of interest and devotion is striking. When M. Papineau came back, he found his chair occupied, and forthwith M. Papineau took the extreme party, and is now the head of La jeune France, with but a small following. He advocates annexation, abolition of tithes, and of seignorial rights, while M. Lafontaine sticks to responsible government, and as nearly as possible to the status quo.\n\n\"In 1843, M. Lafontaine, who, after the death of Lord Sydenham, had worked himself into place as the head of the French party, quarrelled with Lord Metcalfe, in whom he met a man resolute as himself, and more prudent, not to say more cunning. The issue was taken on a general election. The tory party was then in the ascendancy in Upper Canada, and, united with the moderates, out of forty-two representatives, returned all but nine, and of these three doubtful. M. Lafontaine brought up his wing of the brigade gallantly; but it was no use; the centre and the other wing were routed. He was doomed for three years to the 'cold shade of opposition,' in which he showed great constancy and industry.\n\n\"In March, 1848, the tory party fell to pieces, and went to an election in sheer desperation. Their opponents in Upper Canada gained twenty seats, saved all the French counties, and gained Montreal and three English or mixed counties, giving them a majority of two-thirds of the house. M. Lafontaine then resumed his old place, and is the virtual premier.\n\n\"M. Lafontaine in style of thought is, like all the French who form their ideas from books, theoretical and dogmatical. He is not an eloquent speaker, his utterance being thick and guttural, and his English, though good in structure, bad in pronunciation. In fact he rarely tries the latter. But he is a close and compact logician, and never loses temper.\n\n\"M. Lafontaine is about forty years of age, though he looks older. He has a handsome countenance, of a style which much resembles that of Napoleon, and a magnificent forehead. I have told you his virtues; his faults are impracticability, pushing things to extremes, his vanity of thinking he knows the British Constitution of which he knows nothing, a more than ordinary share of obstinacy and undying resentments as a balance to strong attachments.\"\nSir Louis remained in office, until October, 1851, when the Hinck's-Tach\u00e9 administration was formed. On the 13th August, 1853, he was elevated to the chief-justiceship of the Court of Queen's Bench of Lower Canada, and on the 28th August, 1854, was created, for his eminent services, a baronet of the United Kingdom.\n\nSir Louis has married twice, but has no issue; first in 1831, to Ad\u00e8le, only daughter of A. Berthelot, Esquire, an advocate of some standing, in Lower Canada; and secondly in 1860, to a widow lady of Montreal.\n\nCHIEF-JUSTICE V. DE ST. REAL.\n\nJoseph Remi Valli\u00e8res de St. Real, some aver, was born in the Home district, Upper Canada, in the old French settlement, at Markham, about 18 miles north of Toronto* on the 1st October, 1787. His father died when he was very young, and his mother having married again, young Valli\u00e8res left his home, and made his way to Quebec, where he had an uncle. He had been a very short time in that city when his extraordinary quickness at learning attracted the notice of the venerable the bishop of the diocese (Plessis), who, we believe, took him under his own roof, and superintended his education, with a view to his taking holy orders. Mr. Valli\u00e8res was not, however, inclined to adopt the views of the good bishop, of whom, however, he always spoke with affection and gratitude. Abandoning his patron, he engaged for a short time in mercantile pursuits, as a clerk; but his friends, finding him determined not to enter the church, yielded to his wishes, and enabled him to enter that profession of which he was destined to be one of the brightest ornaments. Having completed the usual course of studies, with the present Mr. Chief-Justice Bowen, he was admitted to the bar in 1812, and commenced to practice his profession in the city of Quebec, and we need scarcely add with great success. The extraordinary facility with which he acquired knowledge soon rendered him familiar with the civil law; and he was, besides, gifted with oratorical powers that charmed all who listened to him. He is said to have been a delightful companion when in full health and vigor. Until his last serious illness his conversational powers were\n\n*Some say in Quebec, in a house which stood on the site of the present parliament building.\nunimpaired, and he was one with whom it was impossible to converse without deriving instruction. Mr. Valli\u00e8res was appointed a K.C. in 1813, the year after his admission to the bar, and was about the same time called on to take part in public affairs, having been elected as member of the Assembly for the county of Champlain. He attached himself to the great Canadian party, then engaged in what they called a struggle for constitutional liberty, and was distinguished for integrity, wisdom, and moderation. During the absence of Mr. Papineau on a mission to England, M. Valli\u00e8res was chosen speaker of the Assembly, and during the government of Sir James Kempt, in 1828, was appointed resident judge of the district of Three Rivers, where he remained several years, universally beloved by the community. In 1842 he was appointed by Sir Charles Bagot, chief-justice of Montreal, after which time his friends had to deplore his almost constant bad health. Notwithstanding this, he labored most diligently at the business of the court, as was publicly testified in the session for 1846 by more than one member of the profession. On that occasion gentlemen on both sides of the house vied with each other in eulogising the character, and acknowledging the eminent talents of M. Valli\u00e8res. It would be presumptuous in us to add a word on such a subject, but there is one event of his life which deserves a passing notice\u2014we allude to his suspension by Sir John Colborne, in 1839. M. Valli\u00e8res was called on to grant a writ of habeas corpus, and although ruined stared him in the face, he had sufficient integrity and moral courage to do his duty. The governor had some time before suspended Judges Panet and Bedard, in consequence of a decision in favor of the habeas corpus, and Judge Valli\u00e8res must therefore have been well aware of the consequence. He was suspended, and was deprived of his income for a considerable time, at great inconvenience and loss. We have referred above principally to the public character of the judge. In private life he was most amiable and benevolent; indeed, his interests suffered materially from his unbounded generosity and confidence in others. He died on the 17th February, 1847, universally respected and beloved.\n\nJ. B. MEILLEUR, Esq., M.A., M.D., LL. D.\n\nJean Baptiste Meilleur, one of the literati of Lower Canada, and a gentleman of considerable attainments, to whose efforts we owe much of the present admirable system of education in the lower province, was born at St. Laurent, on the Island of Mont-\nreal, on the 9th of May, 1796. He is descended from a respectable French family, the founder of which, in this country, was a captain in the Carignan Regiment. He received his education at the college of Montreal, and for some time studied the law, which he abandoned for the medical profession, entering the college of Castletown, Vermont, U.S. He at the same time studied philosophy at Middlebury, under the celebrated Professor Hall, pupil of the Abb\u00e9 Haury, who instructed him among other branches in those of mineralogy and geology. He obtained the degree of doctor of medicine on the 14th of December, 1825, as well as diplomas from the college of Middlebury and the university of Dartmouth, in New Hampshire, where he was for some time employed as a French professor; here he wrote his first work which is an analysis of the French alphabet, containing the rules of pronunciation of the French language in English. The medical and philosophical societies countenanced the same. On his return to Canada, he became one of the principal assistants to the Tessier Journal, who cites with an encomium a trait of Dr. Meilleur upon carbuncle; he also assisted towards Bibaud's Canadian Library, in which he was the first who wrote upon geology, and on the application of chemistry to agriculture. This last work was a supplement to the agricultural treatise of Val\u00e8re Guillet. He also published, in 1833, the first chemical treatise entitled, \"Cours abr\u00e9g\u00e9 de Le\u00e7ons de Chimie, contenant une exposition pr\u00e9cise et m\u00e9thodique des principes de cette science.\" He was named corresponding member of the Natural History Society of Montreal the same year, in which he also published at St. Charles, where the Hon. P. D. Debartzch had established a journal, of which he, for a short time, became editor, the first edition of his \"Nouvelle Grammaire Anglaise, r\u00e9dig\u00e9e d'apr\u00e8s les meilleurs auteurs.\" One thing which must not be lost sight of, is \"l'Extrait du Recensement du Comt\u00e9 de l'Assomption,\" which contains a summary of the geographical, the topographical, and the statistical returns of that county, where Doctor Meilleur was one of the founders and professors of the college, and where he was elected member of Parliament on the 6th November, 1834. This last work is praised in \"l'Encyclopedia Canadienne, Cahier, D\u00e9cembre, 1842.\" In 1860, he published the \"M\u00e9morial de l'\u00c9ducation\" of Lower Canada, a work strongly recommended by the friends of education. In the House of Assembly, he was appointed to the charge of making the selection of Chasseur's Museum, the purchase of which he recommended.\n\nSpeaking and writing on education he attracted the attention of the Assembly, although he appeared to be less admired by Mr. Papineau, than the other members, and this led to his defeat in the county of l'Assomption. After the suspension of the constitution, and under the administration of the union, he wrote on education at great length, and more particularly upon the proper prin-\nciples and means to extend the same, and, at the request of Lord Durham, with the assistance of the Abb\u00e9 Duchaine, he conducted a polemical contest with that gentleman on the subject of electricity, and being engaged to give lectures on the foundation of the society of natural history, when he was appointed superintendent of public instruction by Sir Charles Bagot, with the promise of that governor that the situation should not be made a political one. He made two trips round Lower Canada, to obtain information as to its extension, but failed. During the fifteen years and upwards that he occupied this elevated station, he contributed from the funds of the department to the foundation of forty-five superior educational establishments. Some years since he vacated that situation for the postmastership of Montreal, an office from which he retired within the present year.\n\nDr. Meilleur is a member of several learned American and Canadian Institutions.\n\n---\n\nHON. MR. JUSTICE AYLWIN.\n\nThis learned and talented gentleman, regarded as one of the cleverest members of the bar, and since his accession to the bench, as one of its most brilliant ornaments, is we believe a native of Quebec, and was called to the bar in 1828.\n\nHe first entered public life as member for the county of Portneuf, in 1841; and, in 1842, he became a member of the Executive Council, as solicitor-general for Canada East, a post which he held until December, 1843; and again, in March, 1848, until April, 1848, when on the 26th of that month, he was appointed a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench; and, it is said, that no public man in Canada ever had that high honor conferred upon him, who better deserved it than Judge Aylwin.\n\nIn his course in the house, he was twice elected for Portneuf, and three times for the city of Quebec. Being a very terse and lucid speaker, and a gentleman of great merit and abilities, he was regarded as a great acquisition to his party, and was extremely popular with the people. In the opposition, in whose ranks he was numbered for some years, he became one of the most eloquent and indomitable of its members; a man that never flinched from his purpose, but pursued his line of conduct to the last.\nSince his elevation to the bench, people have had more opportunities to witness the greatness of his abilities and attainments, and his arguments have always been conclusive, and have excited much admiration.\n\nKaye, from whom we have before quoted, thus speaks of him:\n\n\"Mr. Aylwin bore the reputation of the best debater in the assembly, a man of infinite adroitness and lawyerlike sagacity, skilled in making the worse appear the better reason, and in exposing the weakness of an adversary's case.\"\n\nADMIRAL VANSITTART, R.N.\n\nAmong the early settlers at Woodstock, C.W., was Vice-Admiral Vansittart, a gentleman whose large expenditure in the county of Oxford contributed much to its rapid advancement; and whose kindly manners and readiness to assist in all public improvements, and in the personal struggles of many of his poorer neighbours, have deservedly endeared his memory to a wide circle in that part of the country.\n\nThe family of Vansittart are of Prussian extraction, and in that country of considerable antiquity, having been, for generations, the holders of an extensive property in the duchy of Juliers, on the confines of Holland, upon which stand the old town of Sittart; whence the family name. On this property the present representative of the old race of Von Sittart, as originally called, still resides.\n\nThe first of the name who settled in England, temp. William III., was Peter, son of W. J. Von Sittart, of Dantzeo, and grand son of J. W. Von Sittart, of Juliers. He married a daughter of Robert Saunderson, Esquire, of London, and died in 1705, leaving several sons; of whom the fifth, Arthur, of Shotesbrooke, in the county of Berks, married in 1723, Martha, daughter of Sir John Stonehouse, Bart. His eldest son and successor married a daughter of Lord Coleraine, (extinct); whose son, again Arthur, married a daughter of Lord Auckland. Of the children of the first named Arthur, Robert, the second, was distinguished at the bar, and became professor of civil law at Oxford; Henry, the third, became governor of Bengal, and married a daughter of the Viscountess Newcomen, (extinct); and George, the fourth son, father of the subject of this\nnotice, served with credit in India, where he accompanied Lord Clive through his memorable campaigns, as private secretary and confidential interpreter. Another Vansittart, William, was a doctor of divinity and prebend of Carlisle. The family of Vansittart, whilst resident in England, have further become allied by marriage with the noble houses of Craven, Plymouth, (extinct) Vaux and Boston; and with the baronetcies of Palk, East, Chapman, and Menzies. It has also given several members to the House of Commons: at one time no less than four Vansittarts held seats in the same Parliament, one of whom, Nicholas, chancellor of the exchequer, was afterwards created Lord Bexley. It will thus be seen that Admiral Vansittart's family have occupied a somewhat conspicuous position during the century and a half that has seen them British subjects.\n\nAdmiral Vansittart was the youngest son of George Vansittart, Esquire, of Bisham Abbey, in the county of Berks, which, after his return from India, he represented for a long succession of years in Parliament, and of Sarah, eldest daughter of Sir James Stonehouse, Bart.; he was consequently nephew to Henry Vansittart, Esq., the former governor of Bengal (who was lost in the Aurora frigate, on his return to India as chief commissioner for the settlement of public affairs there) and first cousin to the late Lord Bexley who, for a lengthened period had been chancellor of the exchequer in England, and occupied other important public and diplomatic trusts. The admiral's eldest brother, General Vansittart, during the time of the war, raised a battalion to a regiment of the line, which he commanded, and after attaining the rank of full general, prior to the age of fifty, soon after which, he died during his father's lifetime. He married a niece of the late Earl of Plymouth, and their eldest son is now the proprietor of the Bisham Abbey property.\n\nThe subject of this notice entered the navy in 1791. At the siege of Toulon by the republican army, in 1793, he was very severely wounded while serving in a floating battery. In the following year he assisted, in a boat belonging to L'Aigle frigate, Captain Samuel Hood, at the reduction of Calvi. As a reward for his conduct and his sufferings he was made lieutenant, in February, 1794, into the Stately, 64. In that ship he was present at the capture of the Cape of Good Hope and the Dutch squadron in Saldanha Bay. He was promoted in August, 1798 to the command of the Hermes sloop; was advanced to post-rank February 3, 1801; was employed during that year and the following in the Abergavenny, 54, Thunderer, 74, and Magicienne frigate; and held command from 1808 until 1812, and from the latter period until 1814, of the Fortun\u00e9e, 36, and Clarence, 74. When off the Havas, in the summer of 1806, in company with the Surveillante, 38, Hercule, 74, an armed schooner, and a homeward-bound convoy, he fell in with a number of Spanish vessels under the protection of a\n74-gun ship and two guardia-costas. Being detached in pursuit, he succeeded, with the aid of the schooner, in capturing the guardia-costas and upwards of twenty sail, deeply laden with sugar, &c. With a noble spirit of disinterestedness he destroyed the whole of his valuable prizes, in order that the convoy might not be detained, although the Spaniards offered to bring off from the shore in twelve hours a sum sufficient to ransom them. Among the captures made by him at various times was Le Vice-Amiral Martin of 18 guns and 140 men, a most notorious privateer. She was taken on the 11th October, 1811. He became a rear-admiral on the 22nd July, 1830, and a vice-admiral on the 23rd November, 1841.\n\nIt may be remarked that with the exception of a very few months in 1802-3, he was never a day out of commission, from the time he first went to sea till the peace of 1814, a period of twenty-three years. Marshall, in his Naval Biography, also relates that whilst at Algiers, where he was ordered with his frigate to embark an ambassador, \"he was presented with a sword, and some other trifling articles, and a bag of dollars; the latter he instantly returned to the Dey, at the same time informing him that a British officer would never receive money for his own use from any foreign power, but that the sword he should retain, and ever value as a mark of the honor conferred on him by his highness.\"\n\nHe was prevented by bodily infirmity from personally serving here, away from home, at the time of the rebellion, but to the utmost of his ability assisted in organizing volunteers, &c., in his own county.\n\nAdmiral Vansittart came to this country in the year 1834, having previously dispatched Captain Drew, R. N., as a pioneer of the settlement contemplated for his second son, Henry Vansittart. It is understood to have been no part of the admiral's intention to remain in this country himself, a result which was brought about by the double misfortune of the death of his wife soon after landing on this continent, and the complicated and unsatisfactory investments of large sums by Captain Drew, as his agent, in this country. (Which investments became the subject of arbitration by the then Mr. Solicitor-General Hagerman, and were afterwards carried into the courts of Chancery and Appeal, by Captain Drew, but with awards throughout in the admiral's favor.) These circumstances gave Canada one of her most valued residents. Admiral Vansittart never returned to Europe.\n\nOne of the first benefits confirmed by him on Woodstock and its neighborhood, aided by the subscription of his friends in England, was the building of a commodious brick church, which he partly endowed. He also brought out with him a highly talented clergyman of the church of England, the Rev. William Bettridge, who was inducted to the cure of the parish, and for whom he provided a parsonage house. On the parish becoming a rectory,\nAdmiral Vansittart surrendered the advowson to the bishop of the diocese. The admiral was also very active in assisting to procure the separation of the district of Brock (afterwards called the county of Oxford) from the district of London, and materially aided the arrangements for erecting the necessary public buildings. He also built a school house; and funds of his, prior to his arrival, had been used in the construction of the first hotel in the town of Woodstock.\n\nAdmiral Vansittart shortly afterwards removed to a large block of property that he had acquired about four miles to the east of Woodstock. Here he was also instrumental in the construction of a school house, and assisted in obtaining a small wooden church. A village soon sprung up, which now bears the name of Eastwood. It is situated at the junction of the Paris and Brantford plank roads. Just at the fork of which stands a tavern, the property of Mr. Phelan, and long known by his name, which was formerly \"alone in its glory,\" but now, besides several stores and shops, there stands close by a large mill erected by Henry Vansittart, the admiral's son. This milling establishment consists of a large lumber mill, with grist mill attached, and is worked by a steam engine of fifty horse power. The village also possesses a post office, and a station for passengers and freight on the great western railway.\n\nAdmiral Vansittart was twice married, first to a sister of the present Major-General Sir John Pennefather, by whom he left three sons, the eldest of whom is now secretary to the government board of railway commissioners for Canada; the second, Henry, resides upon, and owns his father's property at Eastwood, C. W.; and the third, Edward Westby, is a captain in the royal navy, and at present commands the splendid frigate Ariadne, which accompanied the Prince of Wales to America; and two daughters, both married and living in England. Admiral Vansittart married, secondly a Miss Stevenson in this country. He died about the year 1844, in the 65th year of his age, and was buried at Woodstock; in the church at which place a handsome monument has been erected to his memory by his sons. The stranger, as he passes through that part of the country, will find to this day that the name of the admiral commands from all classes the warmest expression of affection and respect.\n\nJOHN GEORGE VANSITTART, the eldest of the admiral's two sons who remained in Canada, at first settled in Toronto, and commenced the study of the law. His health, however, soon began to fail, and he sought in consequence the more healthy occupation of a country life. With this view he purchased a farm near to his father's property in the county of Oxford, soon after which he was seized with paralysis and totally deprived of the use of one side. This occurred shortly before the rebellion in 1837-38, and by it he was prevented from taking any active part in the stirring events of that time.\nMr. Vansittart had married in 1835, Isabella Carrick, daughter of James Royse Yielding, Esq., and with his young family remained unobtrusively on his farm, until he was made returning officer for the county of Oxford, at the general election of 1848. The candidates on this occasion were the Honorable Francis Hincks, Peter Carroll and Robert Campbell, Esquires. Here Mr. Vansittart encountered a difficulty which first obtained for him public notoriety. He found a legal defect in the qualification of Mr. Hincks, which was urged on one side as an insurmountable obstacle to his return, and as vehemently defended on the other. On this point, which was purely a question of law, Mr. Vansittart is understood to have consulted the crown lawyers of the day, deeming them to be the legitimate advisers of law to an officer called upon to act by warrant from the government, under penalty for non-performance, and beyond two pounds a day for two days expenses, without emolument. The advice Mr. Vansittart obtained led him to decide that Mr. Hincks' qualification was worthless, and he therefore declined to return that gentleman though possessed of a majority of votes, but returned Mr. Carroll, who had polled the next largest number. This act disensed the liberal party, who looked to Mr. Hincks as their head, in the highest degree against Mr. Vansittart, and upon their appearing largely in the majority when the new Parliament met, steps were immediately taken to bring him to condign punishment. The house summarily amended the return in favor of Mr. Hincks, without reference to a \"Grenville Committee,\" and that honorable gentleman took his seat accordingly. Mr. Vansittart was soon after summoned to the bar of the house to answer for having \"acted illegally, in violation of the rights of the freeholders, and in breach of the privileges of Parliament,\" and if the charge were sustained, a resolution was to be submitted to the house, calling on his excellency to remove Mr. Vansittart from all offices of honor or emolument which he held under the crown, and declaring him unfit to hold any such thereafter. Upon appearing at the bar, Mr. Vansittart was refused the assistance of council, but defended himself unaided so successfully that the extreme course intended was abandoned, and the house contented itself with memorializing the governor-general to remove him from the one office of inspector of licences for the district of Brock, leaving him still in the commission of the peace, and one of the government auditors of public accounts in the county of Oxford. He gained, at the same time, a large share of public sympathy and confidence. In evidence of which a handsome public dinner was given him in Montreal, and a piece of plate, purchased by quarter-dollar subscriptions. A public dinner was offered him in Belleville, which he declined; but at Hamilton, Woodstock and London, he accepted similar demonstrations. On his return to his own county he was met on its borders by an immense concourse of people, who escorted\nhim to his home. He was shortly after chosen as delegate from the county of Oxford to attend the convention which met at Kingston, and the following year at Toronto (a sequel to the rebellion losses bill), and was subsequently sent to watch the interests of the county of Oxford on an important railway question before Parliament. On the approach of the next general election, Mr. Vansittart was called upon to oppose the Honorable F. Hincks, (then premier), and notwithstanding the powerful influence of that minister and his long hold of the county, Mr. Vansittart ran him within sixty-four, out of over three thousand votes polled. In addition to being a magistrate for many years, he has also been a major of militia, served as a municipal councillor and as a lay delegate to the Church of England Synod. Mr. Vansittart is now attached to the government as secretary to the honorable the board of railway commissioners.\n\nMr. Henry Vansittart, second son of Admiral Vansittart, of Eastwood, was actively engaged in cultivating and improving the property which his father had provided for him, when the first din of the rebellion, in 1837, roused him to busy exertion in defense of British supremacy. After aiding in the discomforture of Duncombe's futile attempt in the county of Oxford, he repaired to the frontier, and offered his services in any way they could be employed against the rebels on Navy Island. He was one of the volunteers for the secret boat expedition which resulted in the cutting out of the steamer Caroline, and was one of the second boats' crew under Captain McCormack, who fell severely wounded whilst boarding on the quarter of the steamer. He afterwards served in the naval brigade, with Captain Graham, R.N. When these operations came to a close, he obtained permission to raise a company to serve with a regiment of enrolled militia, under Colonel Burrows, formerly of the Grenadier Guards. This company he rapidly filled up to the requisite number, from the Scotch settlement of Zorra, in his own county, and soon brought it to a state of acknowledged proficiency. It was familiarly known as the Scotch company, and was among the last to be disbanded of the so called, \"six months men.\" Mr. Henry Vansittart then resumed his occupations as an agriculturist, became a useful member of the agricultural society, and by introducing improved stock, contributed materially to the better breeds of horses and farm animals in the surrounding district. He subsequently turned his attention to milling, and was the first to introduce steam for that purpose in the county of Oxford; he built and equipped the powerful steam mills which mainly gave rise to the village of Eastwood. He for many years commanded the third battalion of Oxford militia; has been a councillor for his township since municipal councils were first instituted; and has always been ready to aid church and school matters, and other local interests in his neighborhood. In politics he has been\nknown as an unflinching conservative, and at his county elections has always supported that side. Mr. Henry Vansittart married in 1840, Emily, daughter of the late Doctor Huggins, of the Island of Nevis, in the West Indies, and has several children.\n\nHON. WM. MORRIS, M.L.C.\n\nMr. Morris was born at Paisley, in Scotland, on the 31st of October, 1786. He emigrated with his parents, who were then in comfortable circumstances, from Scotland to Upper Canada in 1801. Three years afterwards, his father having settled in the city of Montreal, was engaged in business as a merchant there; but having lost a homeward bound ship in the Straits of Belleisle, and no part of the cargo having been insured, owing to the carelessness of an agent, and having sustained other heavy losses, he was compelled to close his business in Montreal, and retire to a farm near Brockville.\n\nIn 1809 his father died, leaving large debts in Montreal and Scotland, and Mr. Morris continued at Brockville with his brother and the younger members of the family, helping to support them by his exertions, till the war of 1812 with the United States commenced, when he left his business, and joined the militia flank companies as an ensign, having received his commission from General Brock. In October of that year, he volunteered, with Lieutenant-Colonel Lethbridge, in the attack of the British forces on Ogdensburgh, and commanded the only militia gun-boat that sustained injury, one man having been killed and another wounded at his side by a cannon shot. In 1813, he was present and took an active part in the capture of Ogdensburgh, having been detached in command of a party to take possession of the old French forts then at that place, and performed the duty. His comrades in arms, some of whom are still living, speak in high terms of his soldierly bearing, and of the affection with which he inspired his men, during this early portion of his career. He continued to serve till 1814, when a large body of troops having arrived in the colony from the Peninsula, he left the militia service, and returned to Brockville, to assist his brother in the management of their business there.\n\nIn 1816, he proceeded with the military and emigrant settlers to the military settlement near the Rideau, and there commenced\nmercantile business, at what is now the substantial and prosperous town of Perth, but which was then a wilderness. He continued for some years to bestow his active attention on the mercantile business conducted at Perth by himself, and at Brockville by his brother, the late Alexander Morris, Esq., and having prospered, in 1820 an incident took place that marked the character of the man, and was an index to all his future career. In that year, he and his brother received two handsome pieces of plate from the creditors of their late father in Glasgow, for having voluntarily, and without solicitation, paid in full all the debts owing by his estate. Such respect for a father's memory indicated a high-toned rectitude that could not fail to command success.\n\nIn this year, also, the political career of Mr. Morris commenced, he having been elected by the settlers of the county of Lanark to represent them in the provincial Parliament. He soon assumed an active and prominent position in that assembly, and in 1820 took one of the leading steps in his political life, when he moved and carried in the Assembly an address to the king, asserting the claim of the Church of Scotland to a share of the clergy reserves under the imperial statute 31, Geo. III. cap. 31. With no hostility to the Church of England, but yet with a sturdy perseverance and a strong conviction of right, he urged the claims of his church, basing them upon the Act of Union between England and Scotland. The colonial government resisted his pretensions; but sixteen years afterwards the twelve judges in England decided in effect that Mr. Morris was right. In 1835, he was elected for the sixth time consecutively to Parliament for the county of Lanark, and on this last occasion was not a candidate. In 1836, he was called to a seat in the Legislative Council of Upper Canada. In 1837, he proceeded to the Colonial Office, Downing street, London, with a petition to the king and Parliament from the Scottish inhabitants of both provinces of Upper and Lower Canada, asserting their claims to equal rights with those enjoyed by their fellow-subjects of English origin. He was selected for this mission by a meeting of delegates from all parts of the province held at Cobourg. Subsequently he received from the Scottish inhabitants of the province a handsome piece of plate, bearing an appropriate inscription, as a token of their approbation of his public services.\n\nOn his return to Canada, in 1837 and 1838, he was actively engaged during those years in drilling and organizing the militia of the county of Lanark, of which he was senior colonel, and twice sent to the frontiers detachments of several regiments, going in command on one of the occasions himself. In 1841 he was appointed warden of the district of Johnstown, under the new municipal council act, and carried the law into successful operation.\n\nIn 1844, he was appointed a member of the Executive Council in Sir Charles T. Metcalfe's administration, and also receiver-gen-\neral of the province. He was a most efficient departmental officer, and proved himself, as Lord Metcalfe described him, \"a valuable public servant.\" While receiver-general, he introduced into that department a new system of management, and paid into the public chest whilst he held the office \u00a311,000, as interests on the daily deposits of public money, an advantage to the public which had never before been attempted.\n\nIn 1846, Mr. Morris resigned the office of receiver-general, and was appointed president of the Executive Council, the duties of which office he discharged with great efficiency and vigor. In 1848, on the retirement of the administration of which he was a member, he retired to private life, with health impaired by the assiduous attention he had given to the public duties. Till the year 1853, when he was seized with the disease which eventually terminated his career, he continued, when his health permitted, to take an active part in the Legislative Council. But after that year, from failing health and strength, he ceased to take any active part either in politics or business. Eighteen months before his decease his wife took her departure\u2014death having found her at the post of duty, watching by his bed side. Yet, though the last years of his life were passed amid suffering and the quietude of a sick-bed, he was not in the bustle of their more active life forgotten by many friends. He had done much to write his name in the history of his adopted country, and the upper house, whose dignity he had contributed materially to establish and preserve, did no more than was his due in placing on record their sense of his merits. One by one the veterans of our country are passing away, leaving behind in many instances, as in the one now before us, to their posterity the legacy of an honorable name, and the remembrance of lives of rectitude and usefulness. When such men pass from among us, it is well to recall the past, and learn a lesson from the incidents of their history; and we have therefore taken means to prepare the foregoing sketch of a useful life. A clear, logical, vigorous speaker, he was always listened to with respect, and having a very extensive knowledge of parliamentary law and practice, he did much to establish the character of legislation in that branch of the legislature of which he was so long a member, and owing to his high moral character and firm adherence to principle, wielded a very beneficial influence in that body. Few public men pass through life, and carry with them more of public confidence and more general respect than did Mr. Morris. He left a bright example of spotless integrity to us in these troublous times. In private and public life he showed himself to be that noblest of the works of God\u2014an honest man, and when full of years and of honors, after five years of patient suffering and Christian resignation he entered upon his rest, he left the fragrant memories of his busy active career, as an example and an incentive to men in public\nand private positions, to follow his footsteps. He died at Montreal, on the 29th June, 1858.\n\nHis eldest son, Alexander Morris, Esq., of Montreal, advocate, is the author of \"Canada and her resources,\" an essay which obtained one of the prizes awarded by the Paris Exhibition Committee of Canada, in 1855, and was the successful candidate for the south riding of Lanark, at the general election in 1861.\n\nRIGHT HON. LORD METCALFE, K.G.C.B.\n\nGreat as the political acumen of Lord Metcalfe undoubtedly was, and richly as he was gifted by nature with talents of the highest order, and an intellect clear, comprehensive, and far-seeing, yet he earned for himself a far higher name than any political distinction can bestow, by his virtues and his charities, by the gentleness of his character and the truly Christian and liberal spirit which guided his every act. As a statesman, a nobleman, and a scholar, in whatever light we view him, he may emphatically be said to have been a great and a good man; he closed a political career of forty-five years, during the whole of which, with the exception of a few months, he was actively employed in the service of his country, and every quarter of England's vast colonial possessions bears testimony to his industry and talent. In India, Jamaica, and Canada, his name will long be held in remembrance and veneration, and England has acknowledged him as one of her most devoted servants and accomplished deputies. Long as that flag, \"the proud attendant on the sun through all his daily path,\" continues to wave over a free and generous people, so long will the name of Metcalfe hold a high place in the roll of England's worthies.\n\nCharles Theophilus, second son of Theophilus Metcalfe, of Berkshire, was born on Sunday, the 30th of January, 1785; his family belongs to that most noble class, the country gentlemen of England, and his father was a member of the House of Commons, one of the directors of the Honorable East India Company, and possessed no little interest and consideration at that conclave of merchant princes. Charles was early destined for the company's service, as were also, we believe, both of his brothers; the eldest, Theophilus, died in China in 1822, and the younger is now in India. The subject of this memoir was sent to Eton, and a classmate of his, now holding a high office in the state, writing to a friend, says that he was there distinguished for his aptitude for languages, and that he had made such progress in this study that he could read French and Latin before he received his first prize. He afterwards went to Cambridge, where he took his degree at Peterhouse, and became a fellow of Trinity College, and instituted a prize for the best essay on the subject of the French language.\n\nA few years after his graduation, he visited India, and became celebrated as a linguist. He was appointed to the post of accountant-general at Calcutta, and resided there for some time. Later, he was appointed to the same office at Madras, and while in the exercise of his duties there, he became engaged in a controversy with Mr. Macaulay, who made a speech against the Hindu religion. Metcalfe answered him, and he answered him again, and so they continued to argue until one of them was silenced. Metcalfe's eloquence and learning were present, and his opponent was silenced. Metcalfe's eloquence was not only powerful, but it was also well-directed. He was not only a great orator, but he was also a great lawyer. His legal knowledge was extensive, and he was able to argue his case with great skill and effectiveness. He was also a great writer, and his writings were highly regarded. He was a great thinker, and his thoughts were profound and insightful. He was a great leader, and his leadership was admired by many. He was a great man, and his greatness was evident in everything he did.\nfriend in Canada, says: \"When we were at Eton, young Metcalfe was noted for his great kindness of disposition and his remarkable aptitude at acquiring knowledge and mastering difficulties.\" At this school he remained till about his fifteenth year, when he received his first appointment, and in 1800 sailed for India. On his arrival at Calcutta, he, according to custom, entered the college at Fort William, established by the Marquis of Wellesley, for the instruction of young men in the company's service in the native languages of the country.\n\nAt this period the affairs of the east were conducted by two celebrated men, Lord Wellesley, one of the politicians and most accomplished scholars of his day, being governor-general, and Lord Lake, commander-in-chief; the former paid a parental attention to the college he had been the means of establishing, and he was soon made acquainted with the rapid progress of Mr. Metcalfe, whom he appointed assistant to the resident at the court of Sindeah, one of the Mahratta chiefs; the resident being, we believe, the present Lord Cowley. Here he remained about a year, when he was recalled to Calcutta, and appointed to a situation in the office of secretary to the supreme government, in the discharge of the duties of which he evinced a talent for business which soon brought him into favorable notice, and in consequence the marquis soon promoted him to his own office.\n\nIn 1808, the Mahratta chiefs, aided by the French, had got possession of Delhi, and expelled the rightful sovereign, Shah Aulum; they were expelled by Lord Lake, and Aulum reinstalled, who lived only five years, dying in 1808. Agra was also taken possession of by the British. By a treaty with the Rajah of Bhurtapore, that prince had placed himself under the protection of the British, and had engaged to assist them against Sindeah, but when the war broke out, he forgot his promises, formed a coalition with Holkar, and Bhurtphore was invested by Lord Lake, to whom it was delivered in 1805, and the Rajah compelled to pay a fine of twenty lacs of rupees. During this campaign, Mr. Metcalfe attended Lord Lake as a volunteer, or perhaps, as it was then customary for a civil servant always to accompany military expeditions, he had at his own request been selected for that purpose; however it may have been, there appears to have existed a certain degree of jealousy between the civil and military officers, and Lord Lake took no pains to conceal his distaste for these civil attendants on his camp, \"men,\" to use his own expression, \"who would not fight themselves, and were in the way of others.\" These taunts reached the ears of Mr. Metcalfe, and as if to prove the fallacy of the reasoning, he signalized himself on many occasions during the war of 1804, 1805, and 1806, particularly at the siege of Deeg, a city about fifty-seven miles north-east from Agra, where Lord Lake defeated the army of Holkar on the 16th of November, 1804, and\nwhich led to the treaty of 10th April, 1805. At the siege of this city, Mr. Metcalfe armed with a walking-stick, placed himself at the head of an attacking party, and was among the first to enter the town. This anecdote was first given to the Canadian public through the columns of the Cobourg Star, furnished as we are informed, by a gentleman who was present. At the conclusion of the war, by the subjugation of the chiefs, Mr. Metcalfe returned to Calcutta, but was almost immediately sent as envoy to the court of Rao Holkar, and from thence was transferred, in a few months, to Delhi, in the capacity of assistant to the resident agent; here he remained two years, which time he spent in perfecting his knowledge of the various languages, and making himself master of the policy of the Indian chiefs, as also gaining information as to the social and mercantile state of the province.\n\nSince the commencement of the war in 1808, several changes had taken place in the government of India. Late in 1804, the Marquis of Wellesley had tendered his resignation, and Lord Cornwallis, who had been governor-general from 1786 to 1792, during which period Tippoo Sultan had been subdued, and who had subsequently signalized himself in the war of revolution in the states, was appointed to succeed him; he arrived in 1805, but died in the October of the same year. Sir George Barton acted as governor till the arrival of Lord Minto in 1807.\n\nIn 1808, disturbances had broken out in Lahore and the Punjab, a tract of country which derives its name from its being watered by the five easterly branches of the Indus, and famous from its having been the limit of the expedition of Alexander the Great; to this district Mr. Metcalfe was sent by Lord Minto to settle the differences, which he accomplished in such a manner as to gain the confidence of the governor-general; and in after life he has declared that the compliments and kindness bestowed on him by the successful issue of that negotiation were amongst the most grateful and cherished recollections of his life; and well might it be so, for the long continuance of the peace, and the subsequent amicable relations fully justified the confidence placed in him by Lord Minto. Many anecdotes of his life at this period are before us, given by persons then in daily communication with him; but the relation would trespass too far on the space at our disposal, and we also omit them for reasons hereafter to be explained. Saib Metcalfe was beloved by all who knew him; the natives held him in an estimation almost equal to that they entertained for their own great men: the stout young Englishman, in whom the absence of official hauteur and whose affability, joined to his almost lavish generosity, won their hearts. He remained, however, but a short time at Lahore. On perfecting the object of his mission, he returned to Calcutta, when he shortly afterwards accompanied Lord Minto in a tour to the presidency of Madras. In 1809 or\n1810, he was sent a second time to the court of Sindeah, where he remained till May, 1811, when he was recalled to Calcutta, previous to his being appointed chief British resident at Delhi, one of the most responsible offices in Anglo-Indian government, as it embraces all our diplomatic relations with all the northern tribes, and requiring talent and energy second only to that looked for in the head of the government, and at a time particularly arduous, as the then monarch was a man not easily kept in check, and among the proudest of the Indian princes. At Delhi, Mr. Metcalfe remained till 1817 and 1818, and there are in Canada many gentlemen who knew his lordship while there, and who bear a ready testimony, not only to the efficiency with which he conducted the affairs entrusted to him, but also to the urbanity and generosity of his character. On his return to Calcutta he was appointed chief secretary to the supreme government, and private secretary to the Marquis of Hastings, who had been appointed governor-general in 1813, and held it till 1822, when he resigned, having twice received the thanks of the East India Company and the Imperial Parliament for his services. He left India in a most prosperous and happy condition, and was succeeded by Lord Amherst. We may as well mention that in 1824 Lord Hastings was appointed governor of Malta, and died 28th October 1825, on board the Revenge, in the Bay of Baia, near Naples; he was a most distinguished officer, and appears to have been the model on which Lord Metcalfe formed so much of his political system.\n\nIn 1819, Mr. Metcalfe was appointed chief resident agent to the Nizam of the Deccan. While here, where he remained six years, he succeeded, in 1822, to the baronetcy, by the death of his brother, Sir Theophilus; his younger brother Thomas, is now resident at Delhi.\n\nDuring the time that Sir Charles Metcalfe was at Deccan, the money matters of India were in a sad state of confusion; the government was obliged to borrow at immense rates of interest. There was at this period a banking house in Hyderabad (that of Messrs. Palmer & Co.), which had great influence; but being anxious to extend its circulation, it proposed to receive a protege of Lord Hastings, Sir John Rumboldt, into partnership, on condition of being made the fiscal agent for the government in that district. The terms were agreed to; money was borrowed at exorbitant rates of interest, and repaid by authorising the banker to collect it from the district farmers for the taxes; this proceeding bred much dissatisfaction and led to no little difficulty. Sir Charles Metcalfe, however put an end to it, although in opposition to the wishes and interest of the governor. In 1825, trouble began to show itself in Upper India, and Sir Charles was ordered up the country. To explain the origin of this, the second war, it is necessary to state that Bhunder Sing, the Rajah of Bhurtpore, who had been\ndefeated by Lord Lake in 1805, died in October, 1823, and was succeeded by his brother, Bhuldeo Sing, who dying in February, 1825, left a son, Buliowret Sing, then six years of age, as his successor; his claim to the throne was disregarded by his uncle, Doorjan Lall, who assumed the sovereignty, and determined to defend it by arms. The British bound, both by interest and treaty, to protect the nephew of Bhuldoes, first tried negotiation; but that failing, Lord Combermere was despatched against the usurper, with an army of 23,000 men, and a large train of artillery with mortars and rockets. This fortress, situated in the midst of an extensive plain, had long afforded shelter to the disaffected and refractory; it was defended by a wall sixty feet thick and nearly eight miles in extent, protected by bastions and a glacis reaching to the level of the top of the wall; it had long been considered impregnable by the natives, having withstood many sieges. Lord Lake had made three attempts to take it, but not being provided with a sufficient battering train, he failed, and a common taunt by the natives was, \"Oh, Mr. Englishman, why don't you take Bhurtpore?\" On the 18th of January, Lord Combermere took Bhurtpore by assault, having reduced the greater part of it to ashes by shells and rockets; he rode over the glacis and the impregnable city fell into the hands of the English. The amount of prize-money was large; the share of Lord Combermere, who, for this act, got a step in the peerage, was nearly \u00a330,000; Doorjan Lall was charged with the expenses of the military operations, amounting to very nearly 25 millions of rupees, and young Bulwuret was reinstated. Sir Charles was present with the commander-in-chief throughout this campaign.\n\nIn 1827, Sir Charles Metcalfe was called to a seat in the Supreme Council, and in 1828 he turned his attention to a question then agitating India, and causing no little excitement in the company's affairs\u2014the granting a licence of residence to Europeans. A resolution to that effect passed the Supreme Council of the Bengal presidency on the 17th of February, 1829; another question at the same time began to arise\u2014the granting full liberty to the Indian press. With the history of this matter we are but very imperfectly acquainted, and shall pass it over in a few words. A decree had been passed by which every editor was obliged before publication to send a copy of his paper to the government office, and the governor had the power of striking out whatever he deemed objectionable, and, consequently, the journals often appeared with large blank spaces. In order to give this law effect it was necessary that it should be registered by the councils of the different presidencies; that of Bengal at once did so, while in Bombay, where Sir John Grant, the original \"wild elephant between two tame ones,\" of Lord Ellenborough's letter to Sir J. Malcolm on this subject, was recorder, refused to do it, and the consequence was, that while in\n\nBombay the press was subjected to a certain degree of restraint, which was not felt in the case of the other presidency. However, the Hindu press was not altogether silenced. The native newspapers were not altogether silenced. The Hindu press was not altogether silenced. The native newspapers were not altogether silenced.\nBombay the press was comparatively free; in Bengal it was subject to rigorous censorship, from which it was not relieved till 1835, when Sir Charles Metcalfe was acting governor-general. By some, the removal of the restrictions on the press is attributed to Lord Hastings, but, from all we can learn on the subject, without justice. There is no doubt he had formed some such intention, but he did not carry it into effect, and the credit of having accomplished it is fully due to Sir Charles.\n\nThe period for which members of the Supreme Council are chosen is five years; but on the expiration, Sir Charles was re-chosen for two years more; chiefly, we believe, that his great knowledge of Indian affairs might be more available, pending the debate then going on in England with regard to the renewal and remodelling the charter of the company; and both he and Lord William Bentick, who had succeeded Lord Amherst as governor-general, corresponded fully with the government on that subject, and the information which they communicated influenced the British ministry in the leading features of that measure. Some idea of the magnitude of the affairs of the company may be gleaned from the following fact:\n\nExclusive of the regular despatches, the explanatory volumes accompanying them received in England, from 1793 to 1813, amounted to 9,094, and from 1814 to 1829, to 12,414; pending the debates on the Indian Bill the amount was far above, even the best average, nearly 830 per annum. During the administration of Lord William Bentick, another great reform took place in India, in 1833; the custom of suttees, the burning of woman on the funeral pile of their husband's was abolished.\n\nIn 1834, Sir Charles Metcalfe was appointed governor at Agra, but late in the same year, he was unanimously called on to assume the duties of governor-general, vacant by the recall of Lord William Bentick. It was during his tenure of this office that he passed the law above referred to, granting full freedom to the press of India, arranging the details and changes consequent on the new order of affairs, and relieved by Lord Auckland, in 1836, he again resumed the government of Agra, but soon after, being unable to convince the board of directors, in Leadenhall street, of the propriety of his measure regarding the press, he resigned his office, and prepared to return to England, having been created a civil knight grand cross of the Bath, by William IV. in 1837. This ended his Indian career, in which, during a period of thirty-seven or thirty-eight years, he had exhibited talents of the highest order, and filled, with great credit to himself and great benefit to the company, the highest offices, and from which he retired beloved by all who knew him, and held in high estimation by the natives of all castes, in proof of which we could produce many touching anecdotes, but we omit to do so as we are in hopes that\nsome abler pen than ours, and having more command of authentic materials, will favor the public with a fuller account of the life of Sir Charles; indeed, if we are rightly informed, it is the intention of a gentleman well fitted for the task to give us such a desideratum; and, from his talent and personal acquaintance for many years with his lordship, and Indian affairs in general, a guarantee is afforded by the work being ably accomplished.\n\nOn retiring from the service of the Honorable East India Company, Sir Charles Metcalfe determined to pass the remainder of his life at his paternal estate of Fernhill, in Berkshire; he had, as he said himself, no taste for the political turmoil which then agitated England, besides his constitution needed assistance. Thirty-seven years' active service in India does not usually give health or strength, and he promised himself for the residue of his days the richest of all enjoyments\u2014the happy life of an English country gentleman: but his country again called for his service, and to that call he would never turn a deaf ear; he at once abandoned his intentions, sacrificed his domestic comforts, and left a home which his presence had gladdened but for one short year, to embark again on the stormy sea of politics.\n\nThe island of Jamaica had long enjoyed the privileges of a representative government, which was granted to it in 1661 by Charles II., under the administration of D'Oyley, who had been appointed governor by Cromwell, on the surrender of the island to the English. The abolition of slavery and the introduction of the apprentice system had stirred up feelings of discontent, which heightened by the endeavors of certain fanatics and the beautiful liberality of Lord Mulgrave, as afterwards the same gentleman added fuel to the flames of discontent in Ireland. Sir Lionel Smith had succeeded Lord Mulgrave, but unfortunately he was not calculated to calm the troubled waters; the provincial Parliament refused to act, and a bill to abrogate the constitutional charter was introduced by the whigs in the Imperial Parliament; but fortunately it was opposed by the tories, and lost by a majority of five, which defeat was of the greatest consequence, as it led to the total overthrow of the whigs a few years afterwards, and was the commencement of a series of parliamentary overthrows, which left them powerless for the remaining tenure of their office. In consequence of the loss of the Jamaica bill, Sir Lionel Smith was recalled; and, on the 11th of July, 1839, Sir Charles Metcalfe was sworn in a member of the Privy Council, and governor-general of Jamaica, where he arrived in the September following. His first act was to call the Parliament together; and, in the Royal Gazette of November 21, 1839, we find that he had restored confidence, and had induced the Parliament to act in union with the government; some outbreaks occurred, but they were speedily crushed, and their instigators punished, some capitally. Sir Charles, by his mildness\nand determination, his generosity and benevolence, his strict enforcement of the laws, and his justice ever tempered with mercy, soon tranquillised the island; prosperity, long checked, again showed itself; confidence was restored, for all parties felt confidence in the governor. One might fancy this would have been the crowning work of his life, but it pleased the Almighty dispenser of events that another, and if possible, a more glorious triumph should be his. A sore in his face had been gradually gaining ground, and had assumed a decided character, aided no doubt by the climate and great mental anxiety; he consequently found it necessary to return to England for the benefit of medical advice; he resigned his office, much to the grief of the colonists, and against the wishes of the government; and Lord Elgin having been appointed his successor, he, on the 20th of May, 1842, sailed from Jamaica in H.M.S. Vestal. Early in July he underwent an operation, which was performed at Mivart's Hotel, by Sir Benjamin Brodie.\n\nThe scene of his departure from Jamaica is described as having been such as the inhabitants had never before witnessed: all places of business were shut, a general grief oppressed the crowds which flocked to bid him adieu; and amid blessings and prayers he took leave of a people whom he had restored from a state of almost hopeless anarchy to peace, happiness, and prosperity. A proof of the estimation in which he was held is found in the fact that within a few months \u00a35,000 were subscribed for a statue to him, and a large sum to found an hospital, to be called the Metcalfe Dispensary. The hospital was completed in 1843. The statue, which was entrusted to Mr. Bailey, is of granite, nine feet high. Sir Charles is represented in a full military court dress, with trousers and boots, and a cloak hanging over the left shoulder. It is said to be an exquisite piece of work, and now stands opposite the Senate house, in Spanish town, Jamaica. Mr. Bailey had previously sent from his studio a magnificent bust of Sir Charles in marble, for Calcutta.\n\nIn the year 1842, declining health compelled Sir Charles Bagot to tender his resignation of the governor-generalship of Canada\u2014a government which had become so troublesome that few could be found to undertake it. Sir Robert Peel sought among the crowd of his political partisans for one qualified to assume so arduous an office. At length the name of Sir Charles Metcalfe presented itself, and he, though personally unknown to a single member of the ministry, was solicited to accept it, and, fortunately his health had so much improved that he was enabled to yield to the solicitations of the ministry.\n\nNo sooner was it known in Canada that Sir Charles Metcalfe had been appointed to the government, than both parties congratulated themselves thereon. The radicals asserted that he was a\nwhig in principle and in practice\u2014on what grounds it is difficult to imagine, as he had never taken any part in English politics, not even to the voting at an election. The tories had no reason to object to him, even if such had been the case, as not only whig governors, but even whig secretaries of state, had latterly been guided by the principle of that party in colonial matters; and they had much rather have the destinies of the country placed in the hands of such a man as Lord John (now Earl) Russell, than in those of very many English conservatives; besides, the previous career of Sir Charles in the East Indies and Jamaica gave reasonable grounds to hope all good at his hands. His character for generosity and true liberality had preceded him, and all were prepared to hail his arrival with the liveliest demonstrations of satisfaction. The radicals, although unwilling to lose the influence of Sir Charles Bagot's name, and dreading lest some known opponent of their principles might be selected, evinced on the arrival of Sir Charles Metcalfe an enthusiasm nearly equal to that with which they had hailed the advent of Sir F. B. Head. It is true, they did not placard the walls; but their delight was unfeigned. The tories, on the other hand, taught by bitter experience, and smarting under the ridicule they had inured by their pompous displays of welcome to the friend and relative of Wellington, kept aloof from any demonstration which might commit them either as partisans or opponents of the new governor. They acted as they had done in the case of Sir Francis Bond Head, though not from the same motives.\n\nLord Sydenham had assumed the government of the province with an avowed and specific object in view\u2014the union of Upper and Lower Canada. To insure this, it was necessary that he should strike out a new line of policy, and one unknown among us colonists. The suspension of the constitutional act in Lower Canada, and the dependent character of the Special Council appointed by the Crown, and holding the office during pleasure, easily insured consent to the proposed measure on the part of that section of the province. No sooner had the new governor obtained it than he hastened to Upper Canada, Sir George Arthur having previously informed him of the difficulties he would have to encounter. The party then in power in Upper Canada were to a man opposed not only to the union, but to the governor; their supporters were, however, divided, and the radicals, whom the rebellion had deprived of all influence, gladly rallied round his lordship.\n\nThe continued opposition of the heads of departments, and many officials who had seats in the house, forced the publication of the celebrated Russell despatches\u2014the groundwork of responsible government. Had a thunderbolt fallen among them, the horror and dismay of the official party could not have been greater\u2014it's\neffect was magical\u2014it did its work so instantaneously, that the house not only agreed to the resolutions on the union as dictated by the governor, but received most graciously every message he sent down. On one occasion, as if to try how far their subserviency would go, he replied to one of their addresses by telling them plainly to mind their own business; but the awful scroll, bearing date, \"Downing street, September 18th,\" and signed \"John Russell,\" was constantly before them. The union and clergy reserve measures having been carried, his lordship hastened to call to power that party from which he had received the most strenuous support. Mr. Hagerman, the leader of the conservative party, hopeless of accomplishing anything, accepted a seat on the bench, vacant by the retirement of Mr. Justice Sherwood; Mr. Draper was promoted to the office of attorney-general, with Mr. R. Baldwin solicitor-general; and Mr. Small received the lucrative appointment of solicitor to the college council. It appears to have been a very great oversight in Mr. Draper, his accepting office with Mr. Baldwin, because it very materially lessened the confidence of his party, and opened the door for other measures, of which it is well known he disapproved. Having made these appointments, his lordship returned to Montreal, leaving Sir George Arthur in power as lieutenant-governor. During the interval which elapsed between the passage of the union resolutions in the Upper Canada House of Assembly on the 5th of January, 1840, and its declaration on the 10th of February, 1841, parties in both sections were undergoing a singular series of mutations: the leaders of the Upper Canada conservatives were daily giving in their adhesion to the government of Lord Sydenham\u2014the appointment of Mr. Baldwin, and the general distribution of offices, had greatly conciliated the radicals\u2014vast plans of public improvement were announced by the government, and on the first election after the union, the upper province returned a large majority pledged to support the government\u2014the most conservative constituencies were broken up or paralysed. But while Upper Canada thus supported the government, and its offices were bestowed on the anti-British party, Lower Canada declared against it; and they who had been most conspicuous in their opposition to the policy of Viger and Papineau were promoted. Thus Lord Sydenham hoped to prevent any great coalition of parties, by taking the supporters of the government from contending ranks; but the very circumstance on which he trusted most for safety proved his ruin. Between Mr. Draper and Mr. Baldwin there could be no community of feeling, and the conduct of the latter soon forced his withdrawal from the Council, and the effective radical party was formed by his union with the French members. Lord Sydenham died, and was succeeded by Sir Charles Bagot, of whose administration history says sufficient.\nThe events which led to the memorable note of the 13th of September, 1842, have been given to the public by a far cleverer pen than ours. Well would it have been for the writer of that explanation, if he had continued to act on the principles he then enunciated. Had he done so, we should not have found the conservatives obliged to throw aside all other considerations, and justify their support of Mr. Draper by a fear that should he quit the helm of affairs, Mr. Baldwin must be recalled. In 1842 another item was added to the list of evils inflicted on Canada in the eventful month of September: already that month had produced Lord John Russell's despatch, responsible government resolutions, the death of Lord Sydenham, and now a total change in the cabinet. Messrs. Draper and Ogden made way for Messrs. Baldwin and Lafontaine. Mr. Aylwin was appointed solicitor-general for Canada East. Mr. Sherwood was removed without reason, to give place to Mr. Small. Mr. Hincks having made his peace with Mr. Baldwin, retained the inspector-generalship; and, in order to render the sacrifice complete, Mr. Davidson was removed from the crown land office, to make room for Mr. Morin, while Mr. Parent was taken from the bureau of a radical paper in Quebec, and made clerk of the Executive Council. The following retained their places: Mr. Killaly, president of the board of works; Mr. Parke, surveyor-general; and Mr. Harrison, secretary west; and Mr. Daly, secretary east. It were a pity not to preserve, in regular form, a list of the Council which effected more mischief, bred more ill-will, and were actuated by more rancorous feelings against all who opposed them than any council we ever had or are even likely to have.\n\nList of the Canada Council as it stood when remodelled by Sir Charles Bagot:\n\nPresident of the Council, R. B. Sullivan; receiver-general, H. J Dunn; inspector-general, F. Hincks; commissioner of crown lands, A. N. Morin; president of board of works, H. H. Killaly; attorney-general, east, L. Lafontaine; solicitor-general, east, T. C. Aylwin; attorney-general, west, R. Baldwin; solicitor-general, west, J. E. Small; secretary east, D. Daly; secretary west, S. B. Harrison. Here then, was the ministry to which the destinies of Canada were entrusted. It is impossible to say what effect a dissolution might have had at that moment, it could not have made matters worse. On the part of the governor, it was attempted to attribute these changes to force; and a member of his family actually wrote home to persons in the highest station, declaring that the conservatives had forced Sir Charles Bagot to adopt the line of conduct which he did. Illness forced Sir Charles Bagot to resign the government, and Sir Charles Metcalfe was named as his successor.\n\nOn the 20th of March, 1843, Sir Charles Metcalfe arrived at Boston by the Columbia, and immediately hastened to Kingston,\nwhere he was sworn in as governor-general on the 29th, and issued the usual proclamation. Relieved from the cares of government, Sir Charles Bagot rallied, and some hopes were entertained that he might recover; and, in the interval between the 29th of March and the 19th of May, he received the most marked and delicate attention from his successor. On the latter day he died.\n\nFor some months after the arrival of Sir Charles Metcalfe, things appeared to be going on just as smoothly as Mr. Baldwin could desire. The Council had been styled eminent by his excellency. Mr. Walker was appointed to office, Mr. Powell was dismissed\u2014traitors were pardoned\u2014new commissions of the peace had been issued for the several districts. But although all was working smoothly, the experience of Sir Charles in affairs of colonial government, assisted as he was by his able secretary, soon enabled him to penetrate, not only the policy, but even the characters of the eminent men by whom the affairs of the country had been managed; he measured their powers at a glance, and felt assured of a new victory, when the hour of pressing it should arrive; he distinctly announced his view of responsible government; he reserved to the head of the executive the right to select his officers. Almost imperceptibly, certainly without those most interested in the matter being aware of it, energy began to infuse itself in the conservative ranks\u2014confidence in Sir Charles was established, the more when it was generally known that he was supported by the home ministry in his reading of the resolutions of 1841. Two other circumstances tended to cement a tacit understanding between the parties: first, the ministers were evidently not satisfied, and the little cloud, not bigger than a man's hand, had shown itself above the horizon; and, second, a trip which his excellency took through the province, in the course of the summer, had sown the seeds of his future popularity. Up to this period, however, the conservatives had made no open demonstration.\n\nOn the 28th of September, Parliament was opened, previous to this, the question of the removal of the seat of government agitated the public mind in the upper province, in fact, it had been made a party question by the Council, and the people therefore were not astonished at the almost immediate resignation of Mr. Harrison. This was blow number one. Still Mr. Baldwin and his party trusted to their vast majorities, and to the active offices of those whom gratitude for past services made their friends; and never was a ministry served with such ready devotion; both intra et extra mores, both within and without the house, their cause was well supported. The next blow came from the Legislative Council, where Mr. Draper, who, against the wishes of his party, but at the express desire of Sir Charles Bagot, had taken his seat, moved a series of resolutions condemnatory of the removal of the seat of\ngovernment, which, after a debate of nearly a week, he carried by a large majority on the 16th of October.\n\nThe independence of the parliament bill, as originally introduced, betrayed something like fear; the bill for the suppression of secret societies, while it showed the malevolent feelings by which they were actuated, evinced downright madness and ignorance of constitutional law. Then came the university bill, the district council bill, the assessment bill, and the school bill, all founded on the most democratic principles. They continued to press upon the governor the most obnoxious appointments\u2014they became petulant and wayward\u2014they winced under the galling attacks of their opponents in the lower house, while in the upper their forlorn condition almost caused a feeling of pity. In the former, the conservatives, unable to affect anything by open vote, adopted the fabrician policy of delay, and attacking in detail; and never was greater tact or more perfect knowledge of parliamentary usages displayed than was then shown by Sir A. N. MacNab, and the choice band which acted with him. With an overwhelming majority against him, we have seen him so worry his opponents, that on the floor of the house they often forgot, not only the office they hold, but their personal dignity.\n\nDuring these struggles, it was amusing to mark the calmness of Sir Charles Metcalfe. He never for a moment forgot himself: \"Gentlemen, introduce and carry your measures; you have responsible government.\" He saw that their feet were on the wires, and he skilfully concealed the gun. In answer to a remark made by the writer of this sketch to one of the Council, he received this reply: \"I tell you what it is, the governor is not with us, but our majority in the house will tell.\" Added to their other difficulties, Mr. Wakefield's partizanship, and other members were suspected; though the divisions still went on favorably, it was evident that the lesson of jealousy had been infused.\n\nIn Upper Canada, feelings of the bitterest hostilities were engendered, by the absurd attempts of the Council to crush the liberty of the press; and it was really laughable to see and hear them, in the highways and byways of Kingston, extolling their own virtues and prowess. Every one who had the honor of being on speaking terms with any of them, was as deeply versed in the mysteries of the Council Chamber as was the president thereof himself. The various bar-rooms of the hotels in Kingston nightly resounded with the ding of political strife. The debates in the lower house were still carried on with vigor. Many thought that the plan which had partially succeeded in Ireland during the debate on the union would have been tried. The language of some of the party was most unjustifiable\u2014on both sides feelings ran high, and we have often thought it was a happy circumstance that there were two languages in the house. On the 21st of\n\nOctober, Sir Charles Metcalfe retired from the presidency, and Mr. Daly, of the lower house, was appointed in his place.\nOctober, more signals of distress were hoisted. The resolutions on the seat of government had been carried in the house by large majorities; and on the 4th of November they were, contrary to the usages of a respect due to the chamber, introduced into the Legislative Council by Mr. Sullivan; the Council having, since the debate on the 16th of October, mustered their whole force. Mr. Morris moved an amendment to the effect that it was an infringement on the rules of the house. This amendment was lost, the numbers being thirteen to seventeen; on which Mr. Morris, with twelve others, retired from the Council, a step which was followed by the immediate resignation of the speakership by Mr. Jameson.\n\nSir Charles desired to bestow the speakership on one of the retiring members. It was offered to Mr. Justice Sherwood, but refused. The Council named Mr. Viger; but that did not meet the wishes of the governor; and finally, Mr. Caron, of Quebec, was appointed. The retirement of the thirteen conservative councillors placed the victory completely in the hands of Sir Charles. It is true, they who remained quickly assented to every measure sent up from the lower house. But Mr. Baldwin saw that his favorite measures, the university and the secret societies bill, were gone. Still he imagined the country was with him; and still the president declared that their feet were on the necks of the tories. The triumphant return of Mr. Murney for Hastings, and the events of the night of his arrival in Kingston, showed they were tottering. The odds were fearfully against them, and by their stubbornness and maladroitness they hastened the catastrophe.\n\nNow was displayed on the part of the governor-general, what even his enemies admit to have been a master stroke of policy; forcing a Council, with a majority of twenty-one, in a house of eighty-four, supported by the whole of one section of the province, and an almost equality in the other, to resign; and that, too, on a question, which left them only one way of escape. On the Saturday previous to their resignation, one of the Council declared that they would soon bring old square-toes to his bearing; and even when he waited on his excellency, they had no idea that he would have accepted their resignation; and it is notorious that many of them delayed in Kingston, certain that they would be recalled.\n\nOn the 25th November, the Council with the exception of Mr. Daly, resigned, and on the 27th, the explanations were made in the house; these have been so frequently before the country, that we need not here further allude to them, than to say, that on the 30th May, 1844, the House of Commons fully sustained Sir Charles Metcalfe, all parties uniting in bearing testimony to his character and judgment. On the 9th December, Parliament was prorogued; and, on the 13th, a provisional government was formed, consisting of Messrs. Viger, Daly, and Draper. No sooner was the resigna-\ntion of Mr. Baldwin known, than joy, seized a portion of the province, addresses of thanks poured in; and New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, by their parliaments, thanked Sir Charles for the service he had rendered the country.\n\nIn the course of the fall of 1844, the Parliament was dissolved, and a new one called; on the assembling of which, Sir Charles had the gratification to find his views supported by a majority which, although small, was, when we consider all the circumstances of the case, truly astonishing. The terrible disease under which he labored, had, it was hoped, been checked; but, in 1845, it again resumed its virulent character, and on the 25th November, he bid farewell to Canada, with the touching and kindly prayer of \"may God bless you all.\" He arrived in good spirits at Boston, and sailed for England, on the 1st December. He had been created Baron Metcalfe, in 1844. But the hope which he entertained, by changing our climate for a more warm and genial one, to recover from the attacks of the disease which he had contracted in India, was dispelled on his arrival in England. There it assumed a more dangerous character, and notwithstanding all that the brightest stars in the medical profession could do for him, he sunk under his great sufferings, and expired at his seat at Basingstoke, on the 5th September, 1846.\n\nAnd thus died one of the greatest men, that ever rose to distinction, by his own unaided exertions. His epitaph, written by Macaulay, terms him \"a statesman, tried in many offices and difficult conjunctures, and found equal to all,\" and says that \"costly monuments in Asiatic and American cities, attest the gratitude of the nations which he ruled.\"\n\nOf the private character of Lord Metcalfe, we need hardly speak. He was a good man, kind, generous and affable, with a heart overflowing with Christian charity, and a hand ever ready to assist the needy; his public acts of benevolence, bare a small ratio to those the world knows not of. His sojourn among us was short, but, even in that brief period, how many have had cause to bless his name; on how many hearts is the record of his unbounded charity engraven; and with what pleasurable feelings, must they who were admitted to his society recall the good old man, his benevolent attentions, and his unvarying kindness! To his indomitable steadfastness of purpose, he perhaps sacrificed his life. He would not resign the government of this country, when the absence of toil and anxiety might have alleviated the terrible disease with which he was afflicted; but, true to his principles, he maintained his post, exposing himself to the shafts of bitter party malevolence, and rancorous hate, such as could only dwell in minds lost to every honorable feeling, and dead to every sense of shame.\nHON. MR. JUSTICE SMITH.\n\nJames Smith, the subject of this notice is a Canadian by birth, though a Scotchman by origin. He was born in the city of Montreal, and received his education in Scotland; although previously to his proceeding there, he had been placed with a gentleman, (Reverend Mr. Doty), at Three Rivers, where he passed through the primary course of instruction. He remained in Scotland for seven years; and during that time, was an ardent and painstaking student of knowledge. His guardian then wishing to put him to some professional calling, having lost his parents at an early age, requested him to return to his native country. This he did in 1823; and was immediately, upon consultation of his wishes, articled as a law student, first with Mr. B. Beaubien, with whom he remained four years; and secondly, with Mr. (now the Honorable Mr. Justice) Gale, with whom he completed his time. Mr. Smith was called to the bar of Lower Canada, in 1830, after passing a creditable examination. He at once shewed his wisdom and prudence by entering into partnership with an old and experienced practitioner, and a Queen's counsel, the late D. Fisher, Esq., and this goes to shew in what high estimation his talents must have been held, for that gentleman to ally himself with a young, comparatively unknown, and unfledged lawyer. Such would have been the general opinion, but young Smith was no ordinary youth; he already had made his mark and done well, and Mr. Fisher only consulted his own interests when he secured the services of Mr. Smith. To be brief, that gentleman, in a few years, secured for himself a varied, extensive and lucrative practice. How he gave it up to enter into politics we are unable to say; but he certainly did so. In Canada, as we think we have before explained in this work, there is but one path for the legal politician to traverse, he must not only walk it, but he must actually jump. A lawyer enters Parliament; well, the first thing he seeks is office; that is, if he is naturally clever. He is not long there before, fearing a defeat of his party, he must get on the bench\u2014that is the golden prize, and all strive for it, and generally all attain it; for we do not see very many lawyers of any political standing go back from office to read and examine their musty parchments, and to plead at the courts. Mr. Smith found his way to the bench too.\n\nIn November, 1844, he was elected for the county of Mississquoi, in the Eastern Townships, after having on the 1st September previously gone into office in the Viger-Draper administration, as attorney-general, east. Of the state of politics at that period we\nwill say nothing in this notice; being, as they are, fully discussed in another portion of this work. Let it suffice to remark that party feeling ran exceedingly high, that many offices in the administration were unfilled; and that consequently the others were the more arduous and onerous to hold, especially when the ministry had only a very small majority (about five or six) in the house. Nevertheless they held together; and Mr. Smith continued to hold office until the 22nd April, 1847, when he resigned, and was appointed a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench of Lower Canada. During his political course he was most attentive to the duties of his office and party, as he has been to those of the office which he now holds, having never been absent a single day when his presence was required. He is considered a real acquisition, which cannot be said of all.\n\nHe is now a judge of the Superior Court; and, although the oldest in it as regards seniority of service, (having been a judge fifteen years), he is not yet advanced to the Queen's Bench, as remodelled. This, however, we think will speedily take place.\n\nJudge Smith is a good speaker, and although, in his younger days, he incurred the hostility of the French Canadians, as attorney-general, yet by the impartiality and justness of his decisions, as a judge, he has made hosts of friends, and we believe does not at present bear the enmity of any portion of the community.\n\nRIGHT HON. EARL CATHCART, K.G.C.B.\n\nCharles Cathcart, (afterwards the eleventh baron and second Earl of that name) was born at Walthams in Essex, at the close of the year 1783, the year of American independence. He was sent to Eton at an early age, and there imbibed a love of the classics that lasted during life. In 1798, he wrote to his father (then in command of a division of the army in England), as follows:\u2014\"I feel that at this time, when everybody ought to be coming forward for the defence of the country that I may be of some use, therefore if it is your pleasure, I would thank you to assign me some post.\" This letter, written by a school boy of fourteen is interesting; it shows how early Charles Cathcart was influenced by that principle that was the guiding principle of a long life; a hereditary strong sense of duty.\nIn 1799, being then fifteen, he entered the army,* the profession of his family. An ensign in the 40th Regiment, he immediately joined the expedition to north Holland, and on the Sand Hills of the Helder he was first exposed to an enemy's fire. This expedition was at first commanded by Sir Ralph Abercrombie, who, as he looked from under his thick shaggy eyebrows, gave the idea of a very good-natured lion, and he was respected and beloved by all who served under his command. Before the end of this year, the boy lieutenant had been wounded on the knee by a spent ball; and not to speak of many less important affairs, had fought in the general actions. In consequence of the pestilence and mal-administration which caused a capitulation, the disheartened army returned to England. The three following years were passed in hard study at the then military college of High Wycombe. The famous General Tarrie was the instructor. There were thirty students, who afterwards became distinguished men, among whom were General De Lancy, (killed at Waterloo), Sir George Murray, afterwards lieutenant-governor of the western section of this province, and the duke's quarter-master-general in the Peninsula, and Lord Hardinge. At this time he wrote: \"I allow myself but one hour a day for exercise.\" In 1803, martial law was proclaimed in England. Charles Cathcart, now a captain on the quarter-master-general's staff in Ireland, in expectation of a French invasion, was engaged in Clare and Galway, in sketching and reconnoitering. In March, 1805, in command of a company of the 39th Regiment, he embarked with the expedition under Sir James Craig. Passing through the fleet commanded by Lord Nelson,\u2020 the fleet which five months later was victorious at Trafalgar, he disembarked from the Crown transport, at Malta, and was again appointed deputy quarter-master-general. Towards the close of the year he was quartered near Naples; when the desertion of their Russian allies caused the British army to retire to Sicily. The greater part of 1806 was passed at Messina, where he enjoyed the society of Sir John Moore, whose manner was so charming, that if he but said \"good day\" to a stranger, he left a lasting and pleasurable impression. But in July, the young staff officer was sent in command of a secret expedition to the Adriatic, and was engaged for three months in the blockade of the French garrisons of certain islands there. In 1807, Charles Cathcart, now a major, hastened from the Mediterranean to join his father who was in command of the army.\n\n* It is now difficult to realize the appearance of a regimental officer of this period; his hair formally cut and plastered with candle grease and flour, and perpetually tortured by the stiff regulation queue. The younger officers were obliged to rise early to benefit by the first turn of the regimental barber, whose later services were required to prepare the seniors for parade.\n\n\u2020 Lord Cathcart perfectly remembered Lord Nelson; he used to see him walking up and down with Sir William Hamilton, before Greenwich Hospital. Lord C. described the great admiral as a little man in a large cocked hat.\nbefore Copenhagen. The young soldier was nearly lost by shipwreck; the hostile Danes had removed the lights on the coast, and in consequence, the Nightingale brig, in which he sailed, was nearly lost. After the fall of Copenhagen, the major was employed on the staff in Scotland, occupied near Edinburgh, in preparing coast defences. Notwithstanding his active duties he found time to study German. Let it be here observed that the story of this life is not sketched aright if it does not suggest the value and advantages of self-education, which begins where other teaching ends. His feeling at this time is thus expressed; he wrote, \"I am too young to settle at home; if I remained in England I should not be satisfied in my own mind I was acting rightly.\" Accordingly, at the beginning of 1809, we find the young major, now twenty-five years of age, on his way to Holland, as deputy quarter-master-general of the expeditionary army. He landed at Walcheren, was engaged in the capture of Flushing, and afterwards, while busied in aiding the sick who were strewn about the streets, he was struck down by the fever, which killed one thousand of his comrades. By the kindness of a captain* in the navy, and with the tender nursing of a rough seaman, his coxswain, Major Cathcart was enabled to reach England, but in a state of insensibility, verging on death. A strong constitution, and some months rest enabled him again to leave for active service. In 1810, anxious to follow the fortunes of his gallant relative, Sir Thomas Graham,\u2020 then second in command in the Peninsula, he embarked at Cadiz, for the purpose of aiding the Spaniards who were blockaded by the French. He saw the heroic defence of Matagorda. In March, 1811, he took a distinguished part in one of the most glorious triumphs of the Peninsular war, the battle of Barossa. He had a horse killed under him, and he was honorably mentioned in the despatches. In June, suffering from the effects of the Walcheren fever, he was obliged to return to England. Early the following year, (1812), he returned to the Peninsula, and was appointed deputy quarter-master-general on the cavalry staff,\u2021 and in that capacity fought in Salamanca, and in the numerous cavalry affairs before and after the great battle. In August, with the victorious army, he entered Madrid, where he wrote, \"I was almost dragged off my horse and kissed and hugged\n\n*Lord William Beauchler.\n\n\u2020Afterwards Lord Lynedock, uncle by marriage to the subject of this memoir. Napier the historian calls him, \"A daring old man of a ready temper for battle\"\u2014he fought the fight of Barossa\u2014\"short, but violent and bloody.\"\n\n\u2021The cavalry was commanded by General Lord Combermere, then Sir Stapleton Colton, who also commanded the cavalry of the army of occupation in France. With him Lord Cathcart was for years in confidential communication, and always spoke of his kind friend and general, in terms of affectionate regard and respect. This feeling was mutual. Returning to camp after Salamanca, Lord Cathcart was with his general, and saw the unlucky accident by which, after having escaped the perils of the day, Lord Combermere was shot by a Portuguese sentinel.\n\nto a person of high rank, who had been fighting in the same place. The paladin replied, \"Sir, I have no value for your compliment. Salamanca is not worth the choice of a single soldier.\" The reply was received with applause. Afterwards, when Lord Cathcart visited the Spanish press, he heard the historian say, \"This is the defence of the Peninsula; this is the account of the Spanish life, this is the account of plenty.\" \"I find,\" said Lord Cathcart, pleased with the speech, \"I find such a spirit in Spain as I am accustomed to see applied to the defence of their own land. I shall leave Spain as glad as I came, as glad as I shall ever be.\" Washington, in his letter of March 17, 1783, says, \"I attack our enemy in Spain, land, water, and air. Immediately after this letter, in the year, 1813, Lord Cathcart, with Greenock's brigade, joined the Duke of Wellington, and preferred to serve under him.\n\nHe was present at the last to a person of high rank, and the paladin replied, \"Sir, I have no value for your compliment. Salamanca is not worth the choice of a single soldier.\" The reply was received with applause. Afterwards, when Lord Cathcart visited the Spanish press, he heard the historian say, \"This is the defence of the Peninsula; this is the account of the Spanish life, this is the account of plenty.\" \"I find,\" said Lord Cathcart, pleased with the speech, \"I find such a spirit in Spain as I am accustomed to see applied to the defence of their own land. I shall leave Spain as glad as I came, as glad as I shall ever be.\"\nto death in the streets by the enthusiastic people.\" The colonel pertinently observes \"the Spaniards will shout for us, but they won't fight for themselves.\" He was quartered with Baron Beck, in the palace of the archbishop, Cardinal de Bourbon, where he found some valuable papers, which in their haste the French had left. Before Salamanca, Lord Wellington told Colonel Cathcart he might if he chose, join his father, Lord Cathcart, in Russia, but the colonel replied: \"I prefer seeing the end of this glorious campaign.\" Afterwards at dinner, Lord Wellington said, \"he supposed Colonel Cathcart did not repent having remained with him, as he had been present at this great battle.\" In 1813, he was at the battle of Vitoria; and later in the year he saw the garrison, after their gallant defence, march out of St. Sebastian. He made an observation at this time that admits of very general application, and particularly accounts for the excellent health the observer enjoyed through life, \"I am in perfect health, which is always the case when I have plenty to do,\" and another which is most characteristic of the man, \"I find wherever I go I make friends, and believe it is because I am pleased and show myself grateful for attentions.\" Somewhere in the Spectator, Addison elaborates a similar thought. He says, \"and such was campaigning in those days I can't walk, having no boots, I am obliged to ride.\" In January, 1814, Sir Thomas Graham applied to Lord Wellington for an officer to be placed at the head of the quarter-master-general's staff in the army destined for Holland. Lord Wellington sent Colonel Cathcart, and wrote in taking leave of him in these words, \"I am convinced Sir Thomas will be as glad to have your assistance as we are sorry to lose you.\" (Wellington Despatches, v. ii., page 464.) On the cold night of the 8th March, Colonel Cathcart saw the gallant, and nearly successful attack on Bergen-op-Zoom. The peace brought him again to England, where he was kindly received by the Duke of York, who immediately appointed him to the staff in Kent. In the following year, 1815, war again broke out, and Charles Cathcart, now Lord Greenock, found himself in his old position on the cavalry staff of the Duke of Wellington's army; the position of all others he preferred.\n\nHe was the first to speak of the conduct of others, but the last to speak, or write of his own, but George Cathcart, his brother, and the duke's aid-de-camp, at Waterloo, wrote thus from the field of battle, \"Charles (Lord Greenock) has greatly exerted and distinguished himself; he led several charges, and had three horses killed under him.\"\n\n*When of the close at the battle of Waterloo, Lord Anglesey was struck on the knee by a cannon shot, Lord Cathcart received him in his arms, helped to remove him from the field\u2014was present during the amputation, and used to tell of his general's extraordinary coolness, how he smoked a cigar and thought not of his own suffering but of his wife and her anxiety on his account.\nLord Greenock had won many decorations. At Paris* he received from the hands of the Duke of Wellington, the Russian order of St. Waldemar, and the Dutch order of Willem; at home he was made a companion of the Bath. During the next four years he served in France with the cavalry of the army of occupation. In 1818 he married. He was employed in England and Ireland until 1823. He was then appointed to the command of the royal staff corps stationed at Hythe in Kent. Here for the first time Lord Greenock had leisure, and that leisure was amused by science. The staff corps was a scientific corps, and had detachments in Canada and other parts of the world. A museum had been formed at Hythe of various objects sent there by the several detachments. This museum, together with the interesting nature of the adjacent county first turned his observant mind to the study of geology; a study he ever after pursued with his characteristic energy and perseverance.\n\nIn 1830, the staff corps having been broken up,\u2020 Lord Greenock went to live in Edinburgh, and for the next six years was occupied by scientific study. He took an active part in the business of the Royal Society, and the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland; to the former he gave his collection of rocks and minerals, and he originated the geological museum of the latter society. In 1841 he discovered a new mineral\u2014a sulphuret of cadmium, and which received after him the name of Greenockite. His long service in the field as quarter-master-general had so improved his natural power of observation, and his wonderful memory, (for to the end of his life he never forgot the most minute feature of a country he had but once passed through,) enabled him to detect many interesting phenomena in the neighborhood of Edinburgh which had escaped those who had lived there always. In 1837 Major-General Lord Greenock was appointed to the command of the troops in Scotland, and to the governorship of Edinburgh Castle. In 1839 he was asked to preside at the meeting of the British Association to be held at Glasgow; but he declined; Sir Roderick Murchison on behalf of the council of the British Association replied, that \"They deeply regretted Lord Greenock insisted upon estimating himself beneath the scientific horizon in which the council would place him.\" The university of Edinburgh conferred upon him the degree of\n\n---\n\n*Lord Cathcart was quartered at \"Malmaison,\" where many curious papers were stowed about, some of them are preserved, among others a letter from the Princess Hortense, mother of the Emperor of the French, and letters written by the Empress Josephine.\n\n\u2020Lord Greenock wrote as follows:\u2014\"Hythe, November 30th, 1830. Heart breaking subject. Annihilation of a corps that had risen to such distinction. Every day giving more and more promise. Mortifying after the pains I have bestowed, as I flattered myself my little command was in perfect order. Ruin of officers grown grey in the regiment. Economy. The authorities act in a hurry and will repent at leisure.\"\n\n---\n\ndoctors of laws. Among the men who visited Lord Greenock at Chalke were Mr. Charles Wall, lieutenant-colonel, and Mr. Lieutenant-Colonel Wall, who resided in Scotland. Among the letters in the possession of Lord Greenock is stated to be one from Mr. Wall, dated his residence at Chalke, during his absence from Scotland, expressing his intention of visiting the commandant of the castle. These letters are supposed to have been written by Lord Greenock while residing at Chalke, and are held by Mr. Wall as evidence of correspondence between Lord Greenock and Mr. Wall. Waterhouse, in his \"Life of Lord Greenock,\" refers to these letters as proof that the Duke of Wellington was the author of an order to Lord Greenock, now known as the \"Greenock Order,\" a subject treated of in the present article in connection with Lord Francis Greenock. It is said that Lord Greenock was really very fond of the Duke, and lying with him one night, related an anecdote of his own experience. Lord Greenock said, \"Pray, do not interrupt me, I am telling you something important.\" His questioner replied, \"I am surprised that you should be so fond of the colonel.\" Lord Greenock answered, \"It was after the battle of Waterloo, in 1844, Lord Wellington came into the presence of a royal personage, and was introduced to an associate of his, who said, 'I have heard quoted in Lord Cathcart's conversation that you are going into the army.'\"\ndoctor of laws; the diploma bears the signatures of many eminent men who were his friends, among others, Robert Jameson, Doctor Chalmers, Doctor Alison, Professor Wilson, Christison, Pillans, Wallace, and James Forbes.* Promotion in 1842 to the rank of lieutenant-general removed Lord Greenock from the command in Scotland: in announcing this retirement the Scotsman, one of the leading Scotch papers of the day, and of opposite political views stated\u2020 \"that the admirable manner in which he has discharged his duties has secured for him the utmost respect and esteem. The absence of any ground for complaint, during an administration extending over five years is not slight evidence of his aptitude for command, his firmness, impartiality, and promptitude in business, are such as few can expect to equal, it is only due to Lord Greenock that we should express the high estimation in which he is held by the public of Scotland.\" There was an interesting correspondence at this time with Colonel Gurwood, editor of the Wellington Despatches, on the subject of the duke's imputed surprise at Waterloo. Lord Greenock wrote a very circumstantial detail of the orders for the march of the cavalry, on the 15th June, 1815, and refers to the original order signed by him, now in the possession of the Duke of Argyle, whose late father took it from the dead body of an orderly dragoon the day after the battle. It is not generally known that the Duke of Wellington wrote a memorandum on the subject of the battle of Waterloo, which was incorporated in an article in the Quarterly Review of September, 1842, written by Lord Francis Egerton; but at that time the duke wrote privately:\u2014\"I am really too hard worked to become an author, and to review those lying works called histories.\" This circumstance suggests an anecdote, among the fund of anecdotes which were stored in Lord Greenock's memory: some one after dinner was cool enough to say, \"Pray, duke, were you surprised at Waterloo?\" his grace looked at his questioner and replied: \"Surprised, no, no. I was not surprised then, but I am now!\" Lord Greenock was appointed to the colonelcy of the 11th Hussars in succession to Prince Albert, and was afterwards promoted to the 1st King's Dragoon Guards. In 1844, Lord Greenock, now Earl Cathcart, was engaged as president of a royal commission on military prisons; among others he was associated with Sir J. Jobb. This commission is known, and was quoted in the Cornhill Magazine of May, 1861, as \"Lord Cathcart's commission.\" He interested himself much in introducing into the army a better system of prison discipline.\n\n*Lord Neaves in an address to the Royal Society of Edinburgh observed:\u2014\"If it be considered how total a revolution of habits and employments was involved in the transition from Lord Greenock's military to his civil life, it is remarkable what success and energy attended his scientific career during the years he spent among us.\"\n\n\u2020Probably written by Hugh Miller the editor of the \"Scotsman.\"\nLord Cathcart was appointed commander-in-chief of the troops in British North America in 1845; he embarked in H.M.S. Vesuvius, and arrived at St. John's, Newfoundland, at the beginning of June, and after a laborious examination, wrote a memorandum on the defence of that place. He arrived at Quebec early in July, immediately after the great fire, and the first news he heard which shocked him much was of the sudden death of his old friend and predecessor, General Sir Rich. D. Jackson. On congratulating Lord Cathcart on his appointment in a letter dated Montreal, 28th April, Sir Richard wrote: \"This command requires a person of your mind and body even in its present state, which I hope may not be altered by war before it is improved in preparation.\" The commander of the forces immediately proceeded to inspect a portion of his vast command. On this tour he was the first to rise, and the last to rest, and in forty days travelled by land and by water 2029 miles. Our readers will remember that these were the days before railroads were known in the British North American provinces. On his return he was occupied in preparations for the defence of Canada, to which he applied all his energy, his experience, and knowledge of military science. The troops in British North America at this time were armed with old flint firelocks; he immediately urged the government at home to send out efficient arms. Upon the lamented retirement of Lord Metcalfe, the administration of the government devolved upon the commander of the forces; and subsequently the Queen's government in January, 1846, considering the then state of our relations with the United States, pressed Lord Cathcart permanently to assume the civil as well as the military government of Canada. The secretary of state for the colonies wrote \"we (the government) are convinced that we best discharge our duty by pressing on you with all allowable urgency the acceptance of the very important appointment vacated by Lord Metcalfe.\" Lord Cathcart did not shrink from the responsibility of this unsolicited appointment. The governor-general opened the third session of the second Parliament in March, and in the speech from the throne referred to the unsettled relations between the Imperial Government and the United States,* rendering immediate attention necessary to reorganise that all important arm of defence\u2014the militia. Reference was also made to the indication of a most important charge, affecting the interests of Canada, in the commercial policy of the empire. A change of government at home occurred in July. More peaceful relations no longer rendered it necessary that the civil and military authority should be united in the same hands. In 1847 Lord Cathcart resigned his military command and returned to England; he was relieved in the civil government by Lord Elgin. The Duke of Wellington, the commander-in-chief, in\n\n*The Oregon question.\nhis own name and on behalf of the government, asked Lord Cathcart to retain his military command in Canada; in this private and kind letter the duke says, \"I have received this night (1st August, 1846) from the secretary-of-state, Lord Grey, a note upon the subject, in which he tells me that it is the opinion of the government that it will not be desirable to continue the union of the civil government of Canada in the hands of Lord Cathcart together with the command of the troops. His lordship adds, 'that if this contemplated appointment of a civil governor should take place, it will not be because her Majesty's government have any reason for withholding their confidence from Lord Cathcart, but simply because they entertain the opinion except that under peculiar circumstances, such as the expectation of hostilities, the two offices of commander-in-chief, and of governor-general ought not to be united in the same hands.' I (the duke) confess that I am most anxious that the public should still continue to have the advantage of your service in the office of commander of the forces in North America, and of the experience acquired by you in Canadian affairs; and I earnestly urge you to remain in command of the troops.\" The duke subsequently said he did not question the validity of the grounds on which Lord Cathcart formed his resolution to resign his military command in Canada. On his departure the inhabitants of Montreal, the then seat of government, said in a very numerously signed address \"when war was probable, when the highest civil and military command was in his hands, all had unbounded confidence in Lord Cathcart's wisdom and energy.\" He was much pleased and affected by the feeling evinced towards him by the citizens of Montreal*. From his command of the royal staff corps at home, he had been connected with the military works\n\n*It is difficult to describe personal appearance, yet the reader of a biographical sketch naturally desires fully to realise its subject. Those who remember him in Canada will recall the very tall figure of the governor-general, somewhat bent by years and hard service\u2014the face, after the military fashion of his youth, close shaven\u2014thick white hair rose from a high forehead\u2014the nose prominent, and beneath strongly marked eyebrows, grey eyes would betray when a joke was lurking to escape from a firm yet pleasing mouth. The veteran soldier always appeared, as became him, in military uniform. Although of a somewhat retiring nature, Lord Cathcart was at all times noted for his frank and hearty manner. These are small matters, yet in the study of character minute circumstances often afford the most important clues. He was so considerate that it may be remembered he would not ring the bell in the government house to summon the gentlemen of his staff, when in waiting in the ante-room. And gave as a reason that in his youth Sir James Craig adopted that convenient but not dignified means of conveying an intimation, and that the whole of his staff concurred in a respectful remonstrance, whereupon that high bred gentleman and active-minded general, thanked them for their correction, and the objectionable custom ever after was more honored in the breach than the observance. Lord Cathcart was certainly not a man to adopt the principle that\u2014\"that which in the captain is but a choleric word, in the soldier is rank blasphemy.\" In his age, and in the worst of weather no one could induce him to cloak if every soldier on the ground was not similarly protected.\nin Canada, and through his brother, Colonel (afterwards Sir George) Cathcart,* he knew much of the principle people of the province long before he came there, so that on his arrival neither the country nor the people seemed strange to him. On leaving Canada the last words he spoke in public were: \"For myself, I shall during the remainder of my days look back with pride and satisfaction to the period of my sojourn in this province, and in returning to England, or wherever my destiny may lead me, I shall not cease to take a lively interest in everything that may concern its prosperity and welfare;\" and he added that which he heartily felt, \"we carry with us grateful recollections of kindly attentions.\"\n\nSoon after his return to Scotland, Lord Cathcart was appointed to the command of the northern and midland district of England, which he retained until 1854. He was also occupied in London as one of a royal commission on promotion in the army, and at this time, as on other occasions, he attended in his place in Parliament, and always voted with the conservative party. The correspondence at this period show how much he was interested in the plan for the benefit of the soldier, of that good man, and soldiers' friend, the late Lord Hardinge; also the interest that Lord Cathcart took in the important subject of the national defences. That in the exercise of high command he knew how to visit the offence while he pitied the offender is a fact that can be orally vouched for by many living and grateful witnesses, and is testified throughout the correspondence. In 1852 Lord Cathcart had the melancholy satisfaction of following to the grave the remains of the great captain he so often followed to victory; and who to the last honored him by his entire confidence and regard. A letter to Lord Cathcart dated May 19, 1853, shows how much the country was indebted to Lord Hardinge for the introduction of improved arms, and his anxious care that the soldier should be instructed in their use. The result of this prescient care was soon after seen at Inkerman. Passing over the anxieties and interests of that struggle in which we con-\n\n---\n\n*General Sir George Cathcart, G.C.B., was well known in Canada, having in 1838, and after that time, commanded the King's Dragoon Guards and a large force on the south of the river St. Lawrence. In early youth he fought with the Russians against the French; in his age he was fated to be killed while fighting with the French against the Russians. The Duke of Wellington was his friend through life. George Cathcart was the duke's aide-de-camp at Waterloo. Commentaries on the war of 1813 and 1814, remain to show his industry, observation and military knowledge. By energetic skilful war, he gave peace to South Africa. Landing in the Crimea in a war-worn uniform, he led his division up to the walls of Sebastopol, and with judicious audacity longed to lead his willing soldiers into the place over what at first to use his own words was \"a mere English Park wall.\" Councils more to be feared than Russian walls forbade him. Councils that relieve mediocrity to shackle genius. Having vainly urged the danger of its neglect, he was shot through the heart while defending the all important position of Inkerman. Cathcart dared at Sebastopol as Wolfe dared at Quebec; would that his daring, like Wolfe's daring, had been immediately followed by crowning victory.\n\nOn the morning of the battle at several points the enemy's joyfulness was manifested because they thought themselves blessed by the absence of the commander-in-chief. They fondly imagined that he had left his life behind him, and that recognition of the death of Cathcart would be the signal which would cause the active enemy to retire. But the morning of the battle commenced with the appearance of the field of battle covered with scarce human beings.\n\nThus ended the career of an honorable soldier, who died with a powerful arm, and whose public and private life was a stroke more illustrious than cannot be found in any humor story. His death instructs us that death is blessed and glorious.\n\nLord Cathcart, Lord of Canada.\ntended not only against the enemy, but against the elements, and in which Lord Cathcart lost his brother, and had throughout a son, and a son-in-law actively engaged, we follow him into the retirement of his house at St. Leonards in Sussex. Here he passed the last years of his life: busied in the enjoyment of scientific pursuits, and happy in contemplating the advancement of his children, and in seeing his children's children growing up around him.\n\n\"Though old, he still retained\nHis manly sense and energy of mind;\nVirtuous and wise he was\u2014but not severe.\nHe still remembered that he once was young.\n* * * * *\nAnd laughing could instruct.\"\n\nOn one occasion he wrote as follows:\u2014\"Although a birthday at seventy-five can no longer be looked forward to with the same joyful anticipations, it is not the less a subject for congratulation because it recalls so much satisfaction in reviewing the numerous blessings enjoyed for so long a period, and in having been permitted the continuance of my sojourn on earth to witness my dearest and fondly cherished hopes so fully realized.\" One of the last acts of his life was to thank his sovereign for a gracious and gratifying recognition of his public service. In the autumn of 1859, Lord Cathcart's strong constitution gave way; he had an illness from which he never recovered. His clear and active mind, clear and active to the last, went out from the now enfeebled frame. On the morning of Saturday the 16th of July, 1859, the life that commenced with sixteen years of nearly continuous active service in the field, was closed in peace. So peacefully that those he loved scarce knew the moment when Lord Cathcart ceased to be.\n\nThus we have sketched the bare outline of a long, a useful, and honorable life, during which industry continually added power to a powerful mind; a life characterised by self-denial, devotion to public and private duty, and by a sterling modesty. But one pen-stroke more is wanted to complete the picture, to suggest that which cannot be described\u2014the sunshine of familiar life\u2014the kindly humor sparking from a warm and generous heart proverbial wisdom instructs those who study man. \"The memory of the just is blessed and a good example is the best of gifts.\"\n\nLord Cathcart was succeeded by his son, Alan Frederick Cathcart, Lord Greenock (the present earl), who served many years in Canada.\nM. JACQUES VIGER,\n\nA LEARNED Canadian savant, born at Montreal on the 7th of May, 1787; died at Montreal in December, 1808.\n\nHe held numerous local appointments under government; and was a colonel in the militia, having served under De Salaberry, and was present at the taking of Sackett's Harbor. He passed a long and laborious life in literary pursuits and historical researches, principally relating to the history of this country; and he compiled two voluminous and valuable works: one of which he called his Saberdache, composed of twenty-eight volumes in quarto;\u2014the other is known by the name of Viger's Album. The former, we understand, is to be published by the Historical Society of Montreal, who have purchased it.\n\nRIGHT REV. J. BOWEN, LL.D.\n\nCANADIANS are not generally aware, perhaps, that the late bishop of Sierra Leone once resided amongst us. But such undoubtedly is the fact, from the following letter communicated to the papers in 1857, on Dr. Bowen's appointment:\n\n\"To the Editor of the Morning Banner.\n\n\"Sir,\u2014In 1834, I was much surprised by a son of my old and respected friend, Captain Bowen, who had served in the campaign under the Duke of York, in Holland, where he was wounded, walking into my house near Stony Creek, with a knapsack on his back; he was then eighteen. He told me he had come out to try his luck as a farmer in Canada. I suggested the Grand river or the north shore of lake Erie. He continued his march, and eventually fixed on the township of Rainham. There he worked hard for two years or more, in the bush. On his father's death he was called home, and his mother (a bas-bleu) wished him to take orders; he having previously received a classical education. Shortly afterwards his uncle, who was a captain in the East India Company's naval service, died, and left a large fortune to his nephew, John Bowen, he...\"\nbeing his heir-at-law. The Rev. John Bowen then went out as a missionary to Jerusalem to convert the Jews. On his return from his mission he visited Constantinople\u2014the chaplain to the embassy being absent, he, at the request of the British ambassador took upon himself his duties. Eventually returning to Wales, the place of his birth he began to lecture on the Holy Land, and the state of the Jews in Palestine. He was shortly afterwards made a rector, and on taking possession of his living, found an old man with a large family, doing the duty of curate. The new rector being a practical Christian, continued the old man in the curacy, and assigned him all the emoluments during life.\n\n\"This is the Dr. Bowen alluded to in your paper of the 12th October, as the new Bishop of Sierra Leone.\n\n\"A. B\u2014\u2014\u2014N.\"\n\n\"Palma qui meruit ferat.\"\n\nCOLONEL MOUNTAIN, C.B.\n\nThis gallant and distinguished officer was the fourth and youngest son of the late Right Rev. Jacob Mountain, D.D., the first bishop of Quebec, by Elizabeth Mildred Wall Kentish, co-heiress of Bardfield Hall, Essex. He was a native Canadian, having been born at Quebec, on the 4th February, 1797; he pursued his military studies in Germany, and there acquired great facility in languages; he spoke and wrote most of the European and several of the Oriental tongues. He went out to India as military secretary to Sir Colin Halkett; became aide-de-camp to Lord William Bentinck; and served as adjutant-general in the Chinese war, under Lord Gough, where he received three balls through his body. He returned to England with the wreck of the 26th Regiment; which he soon made one of the first in the army, and continued to command it, as lieutenant-colonel, until he went out again to India as aide-de-camp to Lord Dalhousie, then governor-general. He was soon after appointed adjutant-general. He commanded a brigade at Chillianwallah, and received the warm thanks of Lord Gough for a brilliant and gallant charge which secured the victory. On the next day he was wounded through the left hand, by the accidental discharge of a pistol, when mounting his charger. After the successful termination of the battle of Gujerat, he was promoted to the command of a division under General Sir Walter Gilbert, and\nsent by him in pursuit of the enemy. He had been previous to this appointed an aide-de-camp to her Majesty the Queen.\n\nColonel Mountain was taken ill on the 29th of January, 1854, when on the march with the commander-in-chief from Cawnpore to Futtyghur; and he died, of fever, when in camp at the latter place, on the 8th February of the same year.\n\nIn a general order issued on the same day, the commander-in-chief made the following remarks:\u2014\"Doubtless, the important duties of the department over which Colonel Mountain has presided through a course of five years have been discharged with equal punctuality by various predecessors, and with equal regard for the discipline of the army; but rarely, if ever, exhibiting that intimate blending of urbanity of demeanor and considerate feeling, with unflinching steadiness of purpose and impartiality unwavering in the performance of those not unfrequently onerous and painful duties. The commander-in-chief has no need to record for information in India, or of her Majesty's army generally, that the able official adviser and friend whose loss he is deploring served as head of the same department throughout the Chinese war of 1840-2, and held command of a brigade throughout that of the Punjaub in 1848-9; was with the force under Sir Walter Gilbert, in command of a division; and uniformly acquitted himself, in each of those important trusts, with the sound judgment and soldier-like ardour which never failed to animate him wherever the opportunity offered. In all the social relations of life Colonel Mountain made himself extensively beloved and universally respected and esteemed; and Sir William Gomm feels well assured that his departure will be sincerely and deeply regretted by numbers of all classes and orders of society in India as well as at home.\" Had he lived longer, there is every probability for supposing that he would have risen to still greater distinction, and won a name in the service that could rarely be eclipsed for brilliancy and honor.\n\nHe was twice married; first to Jane, daughter of the Right Rev. Thomas Lewis O'Beirne, Lord Bishop of Meath; secondly to Annie, elder daughter of Colonel Dundas, of Carron Hill, Falkirk. His life has been written by the latter, and has run through two editions.\nMAJOR G. S. MONTIZAMBERT, 30TH REGT.\n\nThe gallant soldier whose name heads this notice, was the thirty and youngest son of the late Honorable Louis Montizambert, who, after bearing a commission for some years in a provincial corps, afterwards served long, faithfully and usefully, in various civil offices of trust and responsibility; and brother of the esteemed registrar of Quebec, and the law-clerk of the Legislative Council; he was born in that ancient city in the year 1813.\n\nAfter receiving a good education in Quebec, first under the Rev. Mr. Burrage, and subsequently under a private tutor beneath his father's roof, Major Montizambert entered the army in 1831, as an ensign in the 41st Regiment, which he joined the following year at Moulmein in the Arracan territory, of which we then had military occupation. There he applied himself to his duties, as those of a high and liberal profession, and not as a means of passing away a certain period of idle time; and, under circumstances and in a situation peculiarly trying to a young officer, he shewed from the first, (as ever afterwards) steadfastness of principle and gentlemanly conduct. One of his superior officers in the same regiment, says of the young soldier, in a letter in 1833: \"Tell his mother (for she says she often warns him)\u2014you may tell her from one who has had, as you know, some experience of what makes or mars a man, that her son, gentlemanly and well principled, is not likely ever to bring discredit on his family.\"\n\nAfter accompanying his corps through various changes of station for several years, he returned to England on furlough, in 1840, with the hope also of being able to perfect his military education at Sandhurst; he then revisited his native country, and spent a year in Canada; but, finding on his return to England, that the turn of affairs in the east was likely to bring his regiment into active service, he applied for and obtained the vacant adjutancy, and hurried overland to rejoin his corps, which he overtook at Candahar, though obliged, by a broken leg, to travel some distance in a litter; he accompanied it on its advance from Candahar to Ghusnee, Cabul, and by the Khyber passes to Peshawur, and across the Punjab to Ferozepore; a march, of which it has been said that, as far as Peshawur, almost every day's advance was tracked in blood, and in which the 41st bore their full part in many severe encounters; in most of which Major Montizambert, then still a lieutenant, was present.\n\nHe obtained his company in 1842, and returning with his regiment to England was stationed for some time in Ireland, where he\nmarried the daughter of the archdeacon of Cashel, and grand-\ndaughter of the excellent Archbishop Lawrence of Cashel. But,\neager for professional advancement and employment, he purchased\nhis majority and exchanged into the 10th Foot, then in India, which\nhe joined at Lahore, and accompanied to Mooltan, when the\ndisturbed aspect of affairs in that quarter, in June, 1848, rendered\nnecessary the advance of a part of the British force. Here he\nappears to have been chosen, in a particular manner, to lead the\nregiment in the repeated conflicts with the enemy, from the 5th to\nthe 12th of September, when he fell. On the 30th of August he\nwrote a full account to his friends in Quebec, of the course of\nevents up to that date; this, his last letter, was brought to Quebec\nby the same mail which brought also the later letters from Lahore\n(where his youthful and desolate partner was living with her child\nunder the roof of Sir Frederick and Lady Currie) announcing the\nfatal results of the action of the 12th of September, in which he\nwas killed.\n\nWe cannot do better than give the circumstances of his fall,\nin the feeling words of the surgeon of his regiment, to Lady\nCurrie. But while it appears that he bore himself in the \"current\nof the heady fight\" with that courage which belongs to the two\ngallant races whose blood was mingled in his veins; there are\nexpressions, we learn, in all his last letters, which show that his\nwas not a mere animal courage, reckless of life, and unmindful of\nits endearing connections, but that manly and reflecting firmness,\nwhich looks up through the perils of the fight to Him who can\nalone \"cover the soldier's head in the day of battle.\" The surgeon\nsays:\n\n\"On the night of the 10th instant, he lead four companies of\nthe 10th Regiment, in a night attack against an outpost of the\nenemy, under a frightful fire, with such dauntless gallantry and\ncoolness as to excite the admiration of all who partook the dangers\nwith him, and to the delight of all returned uninjured. You\nare, I dare say, aware that the attack failed, and was renewed again\nyesterday morning, with a successful result. My poor friend,\nwhile bravely leading in front, was shot through the lungs, and\nnever afterwards spoke. I was in the field and had him conveyed\nunder cover with the least possible delay; but, alas, no art could\nsave him! I did all in my power to revive him, if but for a few\nmoments, without avail, he ceased to feel either pain or pleasure,\nand shortly after breathed his last, without suffering, I believe, and\nhope. I then sent him back to camp; his remains will be interred\nthis evening by his brother officers and fellow soldiers; and if\ntheir deep and unaffected sorrow for his death, and sympathy with\nhis widow, can soothe her mind when it becomes more calm, pray\nconvey it to her. The very men who fell wounded near him, and\nwere waiting to have their wounds dressed, shed tears over their\nsunburnt cheeks, and refused all assistance until his fate was determined.\"\n\nMonuments have been erected by his family to his memory, both over his grave in India, and in the English cathedral of his native city.\n\nREV. JOHN COOK, D.D.\n\nThe Reverend John Cook, D.D., the distinguished minister of St. Andrew's Church, Quebec, is a native of Dumfriesshire, Scotland, was educated at the university of Edinburgh, where he studied under Dr. Chalmers, and came to Canada in 1836. He has ever since that time taken a most prominent part in the affairs of the Presbyterian Church of Canada in connection with the Church of Scotland. In the year 1844, when those who sympathized with the secession from the Church of Scotland in 1843, withdrew from the Canadian church in connection with the Scottish establishment, Dr. Cook was, for the second time, elected, after the departure of the Free Church party, Moderator of the Synod. He opposed the division of the Canadian church, maintaining that without regard to the divisions of the church at home, it was the duty of Canadian Presbyterians to remain united in upholding the general interests of Presbyterianism in Canada. While Dr. Cook has steadily labored to promote the extension of the old branch of the Presbyterian Church, he has always remained consistent to his opinions in 1844, and at the session of the Synod in 1861, he proposed a resolution, the effect of which was to promote the union of all the Presbyterians of the province\u2014a union which is manifestly desirable, and which must ultimately be achieved, however long it may be retarded by mutual prejudice, and the remembrance of past differences. In connection with the church Dr. Cook was one of the delegates sent home to obtain a royal charter for the university of Queen's college, Kingston, of which he has been a trustee since its foundation. In 1855 when the clergy of the Church of Scotland in the province, nobly sacrificing their own interests for the benefit of the church, created with the proceeds of their allowances, a general endowment fund, Dr. Cook acted for his brethren, and it was through him that the commutation was effected with the government. Urgently requested by the Synod to accept the office of principal of Queen's college, he agreed in 1857, in the absence of a principal, to accept the post till a\npersons should be found to perform its duties, considered to unite the various requisites for the office, and during the session of 1857-58 he presided over the college, and taught the divinity class. Dr. Cook's great ability and energy, have enabled him to render the highest services to the church. He has had a large share in all the branches of church work, and no clergyman is better known, or more respected, throughout the province.\n\nWhile zealously supporting the cause of the church of which he is a minister, Dr. Cook has been an eminently useful and public spirited citizen of Quebec\u2014taking part not only in purely religious affairs, but in many others of a public nature. In 1845, memorable in the history of Quebec for the two great fires by which the suburb of St. Roch and the suburb of St. John were consumed, Dr. Cook, as a member of the relief committee, took an active part in the aid of the sufferers; and the masterly defence of the committee, at the close of its labours, in answer to the charges of the London committee, was from his pen. At many public meetings he has eloquently advocated what he deemed to be for the public good. But it is perhaps in the matter of education that Dr. Cook has been most useful to Quebec. The High-School, justly regarded as one of the best schools in the country, was established mainly through his exertions in 1843, and he has ever since that period, as chairman of the board of directors, identified himself with its struggles, and its success. Dr. Cook was named by the late Dr. Morrin as principal of the college, about to be established in Quebec, with the funds given by him for that purpose. His counsel will be of the greatest value to the college; and it is to be hoped that he may be long spared to render in connection with it fresh service to the cause of education.\n\nDr. Cook labors among a large and warmly attached congregation, the members of which feel him to be a friend to whom in all trouble or distress, they can look for sympathy, and if necessary for active exertions. His preaching accords with the straightforward energy of his character. His sermons\u2014several of which, preached on occasions of interest, have been published\u2014are distinguished by close adherence to the special point under consideration, by logical precision, and by practical earnestness. They contain also many passages marked by beauty, as well as power.\nRev. MICHAEL WILLIS, D.D.\n\nThe Rev. Dr. Willis, principal of Knox's college, and professor of divinity in the same institution, has been in this province since 1847; having previously been above twenty-five years a minister of the gospel in Scotland. His professional course, combining his pastorate and his academic services, now exceeds forty years. He is the son of a worthy minister, whose faithful labors extended to near half a century, the Rev. William Willis, of Greenock, first, and latterly of Stirling. Another son of the same parents is the Rev. Jamieson Willis, of Kirkpatrick, Durham; the maternal name of the family being in him united to the common surname. Dr. Willis, now of Toronto, was educated partly under the late Professor McGill, of Glasgow, whose good opinion and favor he obtained, receiving at his hand, more than once, high prizes for distinction as a theological student. His successful course of study no doubt the more disposed that revered individual, and the other members of the faculty of the university of that city, to confer on him the degree now belonging to his name. This honor was accorded to him some time subsequently to the union of the old branch of the Scotch secession and the established church; and some years previous to his translation to Canada. His father was a leading member of the former of these bodies, and for a considerable time its professor of theology, so that the subject of this sketch had the advantage of a double training; having been brought up at the feet of a secession Gamaliel, as well as of an eminently evangelical professor of the Scotch kirk. By a unanimous vote of the Colonial Board of the Free Church of Scotland, he was offered the situation of professor of divinity in Knox's college, and his acceptance of it was especially urged by the late Dr. Bayne, whom the synod had sent to that country as a delegate on the express business of selecting a professor for their young collegiate institute. The local papers of that day record the very interesting proceedings of the presbytery of Glasgow, when Dr. Willis was loosed from his pastoral charge, and it was remarked by many present, that seldom had a more cherished tie been severed than that which united the minister and people of Renfield church. His large flock clave to him, not more for his eminence as a preacher, than for his unwearied kindness in visiting the afflicted, whether in the abodes of poverty or in dwellings on which comfort had been wont to smile. Principal Willis is the author of several valuable publications. The earliest of these is a funeral sermon, on the occasion of the death of his father, from the text, \"Enoch walked with God,\" &c. In 1829,\nhe published an able discourse on the subject of popery; in 1833, a powerful work in defence of church establishments; and in 1840, a masterly pamphlet in support of the rights of a Christian people in the election of their pastors, and on other cognate matters, in reply to a tract full of gross misrepresentations, which had been issued by the dean of faculty, respecting the union of the established church with the associate synod, a body of covenanting sentiments and sympathies. He has also written a most attractive biography of \"Two Brothers.\" But the production which perhaps more than any other has had the effect of bringing him into permanent notice, is a speech which he delivered in the General Assembly in 1845, on the case of a minister named Scott, who was ejected from the Free Church for having adopted semi-pelagian tenets. This eloquent address on a subject which Dr. Willis was so well qualified to handle with a master's tact and power, was, together with others on the same question, printed at the request of the presbytery of Glasgow. So telling an effort in the cause of a pure gospel, had no little weight in bringing about his appointment to the honorable and responsible position which he now occupies. The Rev. Dr. Guthrie, of Edinburgh, pronounced this oration magnificent. The Witness and the Scottish Guardian represented it as \"universally admired for its clearness and elegance.\" Ministers of various evangelical denominations sent letters congratulating him on the noble stand he had made for sound doctrine. Among these was the late Rev. Dr. Marshall, of Kirkintilloch, whom he had conscientiously opposed in the course of the \"voluntary controversy;\" and when he was on a visit to Ayrshire, an aged pastor, taking him by the hand, thanked him ardently for his effective speech, remarking that on reading it he had said, \"Dr. Willis has not forgotten the principles he learned from his good old father.\" Besides these monuments of his independence, energy and usefulness, many of his more transient writings and unprinted pleadings for liberty are widely remembered. Yet, he is no leveller; being on the contrary an earnest advocate of national education and religion, but not an opponent of the voluntary principle for its simply repudiating a civil endowment of the clergy, or an appropriation of public funds for the support of the religion merely of the state. He has also advocated a legislative provision for the poor, and siding with the late Professor Allison, he contended for a revision of the existing poor-law of Scotland, instead of assenting to the theory of Dr. Chalmers. He has lived to see his views carried largely into effect in the amended law; and it is not unlikely from present appearances, that he may also have the gratification of seeing his principles in favor of the abolition of slavery triumphant on this continent. With uncompromising fidelity and unwearied zeal, he has struggled for this great cause, both in his native country and in the land of his adoption; and it would be an ungenerous reserve, not to say\nthat the excellent lady who is his wife, has, amidst other good works, congenial to her benevolent disposition, greatly aided and encouraged her worthy husband in this enterprise of philanthropy. Mrs. Willis is most befittingly, treasurer of the Ladies' African Refugee Society, a charity which the heart of many a destitute stranger has blessed. The sympathies of Dr. Wallis are with the down-trodden and oppressed everywhere, especially with the poor; and with the degraded and brutalized African. He sees in the enslaved \"children of the sun,\" the lineaments of a noble nature. To him they are brethren in kindred, in destiny, in immortality. He has no smooth words to varnish the foul stains of a fearful sin. He must lift up his voice against the iniquity of crushing a fellow-creature, whatever be his color or his clime. In the face of many, of high Christian names, he has protested in eloquent and indignant terms against the betrayal of the rights of the oppressed, as an abnegation of the spirit and precepts of the gospel.\n\nWith the cooperation of his able colleagues in the theological institute, Dr. Willis has already trained a large proportion of those who are now the clergy of the Canada Presbyterian Church, and this important field of usefulness has been much enlarged by the recent union of the Presbyterian and United Presbyterian Churches; the education of the students of the coalescent body having been devolved on the officiating professors of Knox's college.\n\nPrincipal Willis, though associated with Dr. Bayne and others who wished to have a more decided recognition of national religion and responsibility expressed in the basis of union, has been no factious dissident; but has from the beginning favored correspondence and negotiations not only with the United Presbyterians, but with the representatives of the established church of Scotland.\n\nHe is a thorough theologian and biblical scholar, and is completely at home in stating, explaining, and vindicating the cardinal doctrines of the Christian faith. In a manner peculiarly happy he depicts the harmonious bearings of these great truths of holiness, and hope, and heaven. The philosophical discrimination with which he describes the things of the believer's experience, makes many of his pulpit remarks very precious to those in whose hearts they find a living echo. His casual exegesis abounds with scintillations of force and freshness, which are prised by every searcher of the scriptures. As his conceptions fill with the lofty themes of the gospel, his delivery warms into a masculine oratory that sets resistance at nought; though sometimes the cadence of his sentence keeps the eager listener from fully apprehending the pith of a remark. He does not ambitiously aim at refinement of style, and yet, an easy-flowing literature enriches his language. He well represents the massive intellect of a theological school that is passing away, and at the same time takes an influential place in sustaining and encouraging the real improvements of the age that\nis succeeding. While chary of innovation, he does not identify himself with any cause merely for its antiquity, and it would be well for many younger ministers, were they as accomplished as the venerable professor in the subsidiary elements of public address, and in the very useful amenities of social life.\n\nDr. Willis is no sectarian. His heart is open to every lover of \"the truth as in Jesus.\" He breathes largely the spirit of that gospel whose provisions are as wide as the wants of man; and he has never been backward to combine with other servants of the Redeemer, in enterprises for spreading, through the circulated Bible, and the living missionary, the knowledge which makes wise unto salvation. Both before and after the disruption of the Church of Scotland, he acted as one of the secretaries of the Glasgow Bible Society, with a catholicity of spirit which was of much avail to the interests of that important institution. Subsequently to his removal to Canada, the association was rent asunder by the entrance of party jealousies, and on reluctantly quitting his connexion with it, the Rev. Dr. Hill, theological professor of the university of that city, an old and faithful friend of the cause, said, he was glad his \"last act was, joining in a record of grateful acknowledgment of the services of Dr. Willis.\" This compliment was worthy of the characteristic honor and courtesy of that estimable man, and it was not less creditable to the person on whom it was so justly bestowed.\n\nThe man of whom so many pleasing and honorable reminiscences linger in the scenes of his youth and usefulness, may well feel cheered amidst the weighty duties which, in another sphere, are now engaging his energies. May he yet mould the minds of a numerous ministry for the future service of the church, when their venerated preceptor shall have been taken from their head.\n\nCHIEF-JUSTICE Sir J. B. MACAULAY, C.B.\n\nSir James Macaulay was the son of James Macaulay, Esq., M.D., formerly of the 38rd Foot, who soon after the formation of the government of Upper Canada, in 1792, emigrated thither from England, and with his regiment, the Queen's Rangers, was quartered at Niagara. He afterwards was appointed deputy-inspector-general of hospitals. When the seat of government was removed to Toronto, Dr. Macaulay accompanied it, bringing with him his family. His first son was the late Colonel, Honorable John Simcoe Macaulay, who\nserved in the Royal Engineers, and afterwards became a member of the Legislative Council of this province. His second son, James, and the subject of this notice, was born at Niagara, on the 3rd December, 1793. He was educated in Cornwall, by the present bishop of Toronto, and afterwards entered the army as ensign in the 98th Regiment. When the war broke out in 1812, wishing to fight for his home, he joined the Glengarry Fencibles, raised for the special defence of the upper province, and received a commission as lieutenant, and afterwards was appointed adjutant in the same corps. At Ogdensburg, Oswego, Lundy's Lane, and at the siege of Fort Erie, he was distinguished for his gallantry, never shrinking from the severest conflict; always ready to do his duty, into whatsoever dangers it might lead him. Though he was in the midst of the hottest fights which took place during the war, and suffered many privations in the several campaigns, he escaped without a wound, and without injury to his health. When peace was concluded, the gallant corps, in which he had served was disbanded. Lieutenant Macaulay, however, was not the man to remain idle; his mind, ever active, sought some new field in which to distinguish himself. Turning his attention to the law, in 1816 he entered his name on the books of the Law Society. The next few years of his life were passed in the study of the profession he had chosen, and in 1822 he was called to the bar. Here his abilities had full room for development; he rapidly rose to the head of his profession, won the respect of all who knew him, and attained considerable influence in the province, so much so, that he was during the administration of Sir Peregrine Maitland, an Executive Councillor, an office which he held until appointed in 1829 a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench. In December, 1849 the Court of Common Pleas was constituted. Thither he was transferred, and as chief-justice, continued on the bench until 1856. In that year he retired. Although his general health continued as good as could be expected for a man of advanced years, his hearing had become defective, and he therefore resigned his high and honorable office. We believe there are no two opinions as to the way in which he discharged the many duties incumbent upon him. As a laborious and painstaking judge, none exceeded him. His knowledge of the law was extensive; the experience he had gained was great, and ever desirous of rendering justice to the utmost of his power, he laboriously studied everything appertaining to the cases with which he had to deal. Many gentlemen, too, who now stand high in the legal profession, acknowledge with gratitude the assistance they received from him while they were yet students. It was his constant aim to assist those whom he saw were really desirous of making their way. Nothing that he could do for their good did he neglect. When he had retired from the bench, his active mind found no comfort in a cessation of labor. He had worked all his\nlife, and could not then cease. As the consolidation of the statutes was about being commenced, he was appointed chairman of the commission, and twelve months before his death the arduous task was completed. As a retired judge, he received a pension of \u00a3800 per annum, but refused any compensation for the valuable service just mentioned. A short time previous to his death he accepted an appointment as tenth judge of the Court of Error and Appeal, with precedence after the two chief-justices. The arduous duties appertaining to this office, he discharged, as he did all others entrusted to him, with zeal and ability. His motto through life would appear to have been\u2014\"Whatever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might.\" In 1859 the honor of knighthood was conferred upon him by her Majesty the Queen.\n\nOn the death of the Honorable Robert Baldwin, he was elected treasurer of the Law Society, a body in which he took the greatest interest, and among whose members he was destined to spend the last active moments of his career. On the day of his death, (26th November, 1859,) he attended a meeting of convocation, and was re-elected to the office of treasurer.\n\nSir James was sixty-seven years of age. John Simcoe Macaulay, his elder brother, George Macaulay, a barrister of Bath, and the Rev. Allen Macaulay, two younger brothers, are all dead. Lady Macaulay, who survived her husband, was a member of the Gamble family. Three daughters survive him, and are still living\u2014Elizabeth, wife of the Rev. R. Mitchele, LL.D., of York Mills; Kate, wife of B. Homer Dixon, Esq., K.N.L., of Toronto, and Louisa, wife of H. E. Bennet, Esq., eldest son of the Rev. Henry Bennet, of Sparkford Hall, Somerset, England.\n\n---\n\nHON. MR. JUSTICE CHABOT.\n\nThis estimable gentleman and celebrated politician was born at St. Charles, Bellechasse, in 1807. In common with a large number of our public men of Lower Canada, he was educated at the seminary of Quebec; and afterwards studied law under the Hon. Judge Elzear Bedard. He made his d\u00e9but as advocate at the bar of Quebec in 1834 or 1835, and soon rose to a high rank in his profession. In 1843, he was elected to represent Quebec in Parliament, by acclamation; and in 1844, and again in 1848, he had the good fortune to be re-elected without opposition. Towards the close of 1849, nearly\ntwo years after the formation of the Lafontaine-Baldwin cabinet, M. Chabot was appointed chief commissioner of public works, when he was again elected for the city of Quebec. Before the government left Toronto, he ceased to hold his office in the public works department. At the general election of 1851, he was elected for his native county, Bellechasse; and on the 23rd September, 1852, he was re-appointed chief commissioner of public works, in the Hincks-Rolph administration. On the 4th of the next month he was re-elected for Bellechasse, which he continued to represent till the 23rd June, 1854. It was under his administration of the public works department that the fine piers in the lower St. Lawrence were constructed. The estimates were largely exceeded, as too often happens in the case of public works, and a large amount of unauthorized expenditure had to be made good. The government was exposed to severe attacks on account of this occurrence; as is always the case when any considerable expenditure, not provided for in the estimates, takes place. From the 20th November, 1852, to the 17th December, 1854, M. Chabot was one of the directors of the eastern section of the Grand Trunk. At the general election of 1854, after the Hincks-Rolph government had been defeated on a motion of the late Mr. Hartman, in reference to their clergy reserves policy, M. Chabot was re-elected both for Bellechasse and Quebec, on the 10th August. But he did not sit for the former place. He held his seat till the 19th September, 1856. In December, 1854, he was appointed government director of the Grand Trunk Railroad; and about the same time was appointed one of the seignorial tenure commissioners, under the law of 1854, providing for the abolition of the feudal system of land holding.\n\nIt was on the 26th September, 1856, that M. Chabot was appointed judge of the superior court of Lower Canada. At first, he resided at Montreal, but latterly at Quebec, where he died.\n\nAs a parliamentary debater, M. Chabot never acquired any proficiency in English. The explanations which he gave, on some occasions, as commissioner of public works, failed to produce the desired effect on the English speaking portion of the house, partly from the defective manner in which they were given. He was, however, a man of varied information, and spoke with considerable force and animation in his own language. As a judge, we believe he discharged his duties with satisfaction to the bar, by whom he was much esteemed, and the public. About two months previous to his death, (which took place on the 27th May, 1860,) his medical attendant with a conscientiousness which might be imitated with advantage, assured him that he was laboring under a fatal malady, which might, at any instant, terminate his existence. \"It was in the middle of the night,\" says Le Courrier du Canada, \"when the adorable sacrament of our altars was taken to him. In\nspite of his extreme feebleness, he was raised up and had desired to appear in a new dress, such as the judges wear. 'I could not,' he said, 'better wear this dress for the first time than on this occasion, since I am going to receive God, the Judge of judges.'\"\n\nHon. Mr. Justice Caron.\n\nHonorable Rene Edouard Caron was born in the parish of St. Anne, Cote de Beaupr\u00e9, where his family resided at the end of the year 1800. His father, M. Augustin Caron, a farmer of easy circumstances, was also born at the same place, and represented the county in two parliaments.\n\nM. Caron was educated at the seminary of Quebec, and at the college at St. Pierre, Rivi\u00e8re du Sud. At the latter place he received his classical education, and met there several persons who have since distinguished themselves in the history of Canada.\n\nHaving terminated his studies in 1821, M. Caron entered upon the study of the law in the office of M. Andr\u00e9 Hamel, and was admitted to the bar of Lower Canada, (district of Quebec) in 1826. At this time many of the prominent members of the legal profession had either passed away or been raised to the bench, and young Caron being exceedingly clever, succeeded to the practice of a great many. His clients were both numerous and influential, and mainly through them, he was elected to the City Council of Quebec, at its first election, in 1832. In 1833, he was elected to the mayoralty, a post which he occupied until the incorporation act expired in 1837. Previous to this (1834) he was returned to Parliament for the upper town of Quebec, and continued to sit therein, until a demonstration gotten up by a part of the electors in 1836, which he had reason to suppose reflected on his conduct as their representative, caused him indignantly to resign his seat.\n\nUnder Lord Gosford, he was nominated a member of the Legislative Council of Lower Canada, but the union of the provinces taking place shortly afterwards, he never took his seat.\n\nWhen Quebec was again incorporated, Lord Sydenham appointed M. Caron mayor of the said city for two years, after which he was annually elected to that office until 1846.\n\nIn 1841, when the new legislature met, he took his seat in the Legislative Council. From 1843 to 1847, he was speaker of that body; when the office became political, and the Honorable Mr.\nMcGill was appointed. In 1848, he was again installed as speaker, and continued as such until 1853, being also a member of the Lafontaine and Hincks administration, when he was raised to the bench as one of the four judges of the Superior Court at Quebec; afterwards to that of the Queen's Bench, and in 1859, was named one of the commissioners for the codification of the laws of Lower Canada, conjointly with Messrs. Morin and Day.\n\nJudge Caron married a Miss DeBlois, of Quebec, by whom he has a large family.\n\n---\n\nHON. SIR ALLAN NAPIER MACNAB, BART.,\n\nM.L.C., AND AIDE-DE-CAMP TO THE QUEEN.\n\nBeyond all doubt, the distinguished subject of this notice is one of the greatest men that Canada possesses, or has produced. One need only look to the honors which he has attained in the just recognition of his services to be assured of this. It is a subject of profound gratification to every Canadian heart to know that Canada has given birth to such a distinguished soldier and statesman; and more especially, that our country should be indebted to him, a Canadian born, for the preservation of this fine dependency to the crown.*\n\nColonel, the Honorable Sir Allan Napier MacNab, Baronet, of Dundurn, Hamilton, Canada West, was born at Niagara in 1798, and is of Scottish extraction. His grandfather, Major Robert MacNab, of the 42nd Regiment, or Black Watch, held the post of Royal Forester in Scotland, and resided on a small property called Dundurn, at the head of Loch Hearn. His father entered the army in her Majesty's 71st Regiment, and was subsequently promoted to a dragoon regiment. He was attached to the staff of General Simcoe during the revolutionary war; after its close he accompanied General Simcoe to this country. He married the youngest daughter of Captain William Napier, commissioner of the port of Quebec. When the Americans attacked Toronto, Sir Allan, then a boy at school, was one of a number of boys selected as able to carry a musket; and after the authorities surrendered the\n\n*Speaking of the capture of the Caroline, Sir Archibald Alison, in his \"History of Europe,\" says, \"This bold act, which reflected equal honor on the judgment and courage of Colonel MacNab, was decisive of the present fate of British North America.\"\n\n60\ncity, he retreated with the army to Kingston, when through the instrumentality of Sir Roger Sheaffe, a friend of his father, he was rated as midshipman on board Sir James Yeo's ship, and accompanied the expedition to Sackett's Harbour, Genesee, and other places on the American side of the lake. Finding promotion rather slow, he left the navy and joined the 100th Regiment, under Colonel Murray, and was with them when they re-occupied the Niagara frontier. He crossed with the advanced guard at the storming and taking of Fort Niagara. For his conduct in this affair he was honored with an ensigncy in the 49th Regiment. He was with General Riall at Fort Erie, and crossed the river with him when Black Rock and Buffalo were burned, in retaliation for the destruction of Niagara, a few months previous. After the termination of this campaign, Sir Allan joined his regiment in Montreal, and shortly after marched with them to the attack of Plattsburg. On the morning of the attack, he had the honor of commanding the advanced guard at the Sarnac bridge. At the reduction of the army in 1816 or 1817, he was placed on half-pay.\n\nHe then commenced the study of the law, and during this time was employed as copying clerk and clerk of the journals in the Legislative Assembly, and when the Parliament of Upper Canada was extinguished by the act of union, Sir Allan was speaker. He was subsequently elected speaker of the united legislatures. He was called to the bar in 1825, and commenced the practice of his profession in Hamilton, where he was for many years a most successful practitioner, having all the most important business in that district. He was then appointed Queen's counsel, the first appointment of the kind in Upper Canada. He was first elected to Parliament in 1829, we believe along with the Honorable John Wilson, for the county of Wentworth, and after serving in three parliaments, was returned for the city of Hamilton, in opposition to Mr. Harrison, the government nominee. He was from that time opposed successively, to the period of his retirement from the representation of the city, by Messrs. Tiffany, Freeman, and Buchanan.\n\nSir Allan's zeal and efficiency as a militia officer, especially in cutting out the Caroline steamer on the Niagara river, during the troubles of 1837-8, are fresh in the memories of all. He did not wait for the insurrection to reach Hamilton, but went with the \"Men of Gore,\" first to Toronto, afterwards to the west, and then to the frontier, during which time he commanded the militia. His time and means were liberally given in defence of his country; the speedy termination of the troubles in Upper Canada was due to his activity and zeal. His services were duly appreciated, not only in his native country, but by her Majesty, by Lord Seaton, and the two parliaments of Canada, (he being speaker of the lower\nhouse.) He also received the thanks of the legislatures of the sister provinces.*\n\nSir Allan MacNab, though always consistent, proved himself to be more liberal than many of his opponents have been inclined to give him credit for. It is generally known how ably he battled for the retention of the clergy reserves; yet finding that the country was averse to the continuance of the reserves, he gracefully yielded to the wishes of the people, and finally effected a settlement of the vexed question, after the boasted champions of its abolition had failed to carry out their oft-renewed pledge. He was in the House of Assembly for nine successive parliaments, and was never absent from his place for a week, except during the last two sessions, previous to his retirement, when illness confined him to his house.\n\n*Government House, 3rd May, 1838.\n\n\"In giving publicity to the following despatch, the lieutenant-governor avails himself of the opportunity it affords him, of expressing his high sense of the important services reported to him as having been tendered by Colonel MacNab, during the period, in which the body of the militia of Upper Canada, of which he had the command, were employed in suppressing an unnatural and unprovoked rebellion, and in repelling the foreign outlaws and brigands, who had attempted its invasion.\n\n\"His excellency much regrets that his honor the chief-justice has, from motives of the most peculiar delicacy, declined the honor intended to have been conferred upon him, as the lieutenant-governor feels assured that it would have afforded all classes of her Majesty's subjects in this colony the greatest satisfaction, that a mark of royal approbation had been bestowed on a public officer, whose long and arduous services, and whose eminent abilities and integrity in the discharge of his official duties, so fully entitled him to any distinction, which his sovereign might graciously deem it proper to confer on him.\n\n\"By command of his excellency,\" \"J. Joseph.\"\n\nDowning Street, March 14, 1838.\n\n\"Sir,\u2014I have had the honor to receive Sir Francis Head's despatch of the 1st February, (No. 14,) calling the notice of her Majesty's government to the important services of Colonel Allan MacNab, and Mr. Chief-Justice Robinson, during the late insurrection in Upper Canada, and suggesting that the honor of knighthood should be conferred on those gentlemen.\n\n\"In my despatch of the 30th January last, (No. 16,) I have already conveyed to you the Queen's gracious approbation of such of Colonel MacNab's services, as had, at that time, been brought under her Majesty's notice. I have received her Majesty's command to express her high satisfaction at the courage, spirit and ability, which he has displayed in the transactions which have been since reported to me.\n\n\"Her Majesty will not fail to take into her favorable consideration Sir F.

I have received her Majesty's command, to express through you, to Mr. Robinson, her approbation of his long and valuable services to the crown, and her sense of the disinterested motives by which his letter of the 6th ultimo, was dictated. I have, &c.,\n\n\"Glenelg.\"\nWhen Sir Allan first took his seat in the united parliament as the representative of the city of Hamilton, Canada West, at the period the Lafontaine-Baldwin party were firmly united in that union which only exists in opposition when people have every thing to object to and nothing to do. There was one question, however, which had to be settled, and that was the university question. Lord Metcalfe and Mr. Draper, it was well known, were favorable to a liberal settlement of that question which had troubled the colony almost from its origin. They had given pledges, private if not public. Lord Metcalfe was a whig of the most liberal school, and Mr. Draper was a very respectable reflection of Sir Robert Peel. The question was, in what proportion the power should be divided between the high tory compact party and the moderate Metcalfe-Draper party. The arrogant pretensions of the former it was impossible to sustain, though they had perhaps the larger share in determining the issue of conflict. The compromise came to this: Sir Allan MacNab was nominated by the united party for speaker of the House of Assembly, and was opposed by M. Morin, whom he beat by a majority of three. It was reasonably objected that Sir Allan could scarcely understand, and certainly could not speak, one word of French, while it was urged, on the other side, that M. Morin's knowledge of English was only a shade more extensive than Sir Allan's of French, and that he wanted Sir Allan's vigor and decision.\n\nIn the time of Lord Cathcart, there was an intrigue, of which it may be said as of most Canadian intrigues, that *Le jeu ne vaut pas le chandelle*, that is, it is not worth throwing a light on it, and that it will speedily pass into the oblivion which we have no wish to disturb. Sir Allan was to have been made adjutant-general, but for some reason or other (nobody believes that the true one was alleged) he altered his mind, and preferred to stick by the speakership. The question was, whether he had vacated his seat, and, with that the speakership. Lord Cathcart positively asserted that he had accepted the office, and had discussed with him the subsidiary arrangements. Sir Allan has positively asserted that the arrangements were preliminary, and that his acceptance was on a condition which was not fulfilled. He remained speaker; with a curious unanimity, the French Canadians supported his view of the case, along with the ministry whom they wished to overthrow, but which durst not make the compact their enemy. This confirmed an opinion of the truth of which the well-informed had previously abundant proof, that the Upper Canada high tories were intriguing to join the Lower Canada French, and throw overboard the Upper Canada radicals and the Lower Canada British, for the purpose of securing the temporalities of the Churches of Rome and of England, and of strengthening their ascendancy in their respective sections of the province. This intrigue seems to have grown to such proportions as to make it necessary to observe\nbeen abortive; for, when the radicals came in with a majority, they put M. Morin into the chair, and Sir Allan took his seat among the few faithful on the opposition benches.\n\nHe was born and brought up in Canada, and entering public life while but a very young man, he was identified with every public movement for the forty years previous to his retirement. He became prime minister in 1854, and during his administration the clergy reserves question was set at rest; the reciprocity act was passed; the seignorial tenure difficulties were adjusted; the munificent appropriation made to the patriotic fund; and the militia act was, we believe, Sir Allan's last measure, the admirable results of which are now generally admitted. Sir Allan was knighted in 1838, and was created a baronet on his retirement from the office of premier in 1856. Had he exerted himself as zealously for his own interests as he has for those of the public, there is no doubt that Sir Allan MacNab would have been one of the wealthiest men in the province.\n\nIn October, 1857, he retired from public life in Canada, issuing to his constituents the following feeling address:\n\n\"To the Free and Independent Electors of the City of Hamilton:\n\n\"Gentlemen,\u2014I deeply regret that the state of my health is such that I am unable longer to discharge my duty in Parliament with justice to you, or satisfaction to myself. I therefore feel that the time has arrived for me to retire from a position that it has been the pride of my life to enjoy. I would have taken this step at the close of the last session, had I not believed there would have been a general election, and I was unwilling to give you the trouble and annoyance of a second contest; however, from the best information I can obtain, I am inclined to the belief that there will not be a dissolution of Parliament. I have, therefore, transmitted my resignation to the speaker of the Legislative Assembly, that you may have ample time to select a member in my place. Most sincerely do I thank you, gentlemen, for the kind and cordial support you have accorded me during nine successive parliaments in which I have had the honor of representing either the county or city. The best portion of my life has been spent amongst you; and I can say, with truth, that during this long period my best energies have been devoted to the interests of my constituents and the honor of my country.\n\n\"One word before we part, and that is: if, in times of trial and great excitement, I have erred, I trust you will kindly ascribe it to an error of the head, and not the heart.\n\n\"Believe me, gentlemen, I shall ever remain, your very greatly obliged and very faithful friend,\n\n\"Allan Napier MacNab.\"\n\n\"Dundurn, October 24, 1857.\"\nOn this occasion the public press of Canada and many journals of the neighboring republic vied with each other in their remarks to do the gallant and honorable baronet honor. On all sides there was but one feeling as to his retirement from the country, and that was of regret that we were about to lose the services of a man, who had proved himself worthy of the highest honors which his country could confer,\u2014had studied and advanced our interests, and had been the \"saviour of the upper province.\"\n\nWe produce the parting remarks elicited from the *Spectator* of Hamilton:\n\n\"With feelings such as must have been experienced by all who are about to be separated from an old and valued friend, we today record the retirement from public life of one who for upwards of twenty years has been the acknowledged leader of the party for whose interests we have battled ever since the establishment of this journal. For nearly thirty years Sir Allan MacNab has occupied the most prominent public position of any man in Canada. During all that time he has served his country faithfully, both in the council and the field, and now retires into private life, only because he feels himself incapacitated, through ill-health, to perform with justice to his constituents and satisfaction to himself the important duties devolving upon him as a member of the legislature. In thus yielding up the trust reposed in him by the electors of this city, Sir Allan carries with him into his retirement the respect and good will of all. No man ever enjoyed a larger share of the confidence of the people of this country than he has done; for, notwithstanding his thorough party views and fearless expression of them, he has ever shared the respect of the majority of those from whom he conscientiously differed in opinion. His opponents have been neither few nor insignificant, yet he feared not to stand up boldly in defence of the principles he advocated; while some of his bitterest antagonists have been compelled, by a sense of justice, to own that he was not actuated by unworthy motives in contending for the interests of his party. There are many, it is true, who have condemned both his motives and actions unsparingly; fortunately, however, this outburst of displeasure was but the ebullition of the moment, and when the excitement died away; the wrath of the gallant knight's aspersers was silenced, or at least greatly mollified, and the abuse now heaped upon him is solely confined to the mere mouthpieces of a fanatical clique. His long connexion with parliamentary duties gave him a decided advantage over his brother members, and he was frequently appealed to in matters of difficulty and dispute, alike by friends and foes. As a party tactician he had few, if any, equals, and struggled against difficulties which others would have succumbed to, or feared to encounter. This will readily be acknowledged by all who have closely watched Sir Allan's political career. His absence from the...\"\nAssembly will cause a void not easily to be filled, and his loss will be equally regretted by the country and electors of this city. To Sir Allan MacNab, Canada is indebted for its preservation as an integral portion of the British dominions; and to him Hamilton owes a lasting debt of gratitude for having by his exertions placed it in the proud position of the third commercial city in the province. Some of his opponents have attempted to rob him of the credit of having accomplished anything for the benefit of the place in which he has resided ever since it was a mere hamlet; but his works speak for themselves, and we need only point to that noble monument, the Great Western Railway. He has now retired from the arena of public life to enjoy that repose so necessary to his health, and we fondly indulge the hope\u2014in which we feel confident all his friends will join us\u2014that he may be long spared to look back with pleasure upon his past eventful career.\n\n\"As we have already said, Sir Allan carries with him into his retirement the hearty good will and esteem of his many friends; and while they cannot but regret to lose him as their representative in Parliament, they feel that he has taken the only course which a sense of duty to his constituents, as well as to himself seemed to point out. Their only consolation is in the hope of finding a competent successor to Sir Allan, to fill the void his retirement has caused.\"\n\nAt the general election in England in 1859, Sir Allan ran in opposition to Admiral Peehell, for the town of Brighton, but without success\u2014at least as to being returned, but certainly otherwise with great success, considering him to be, but by reputation and name, an entire stranger to the electors. He polled a large number of votes, and ran his opponent very closely.\n\nBut Sir Allan was not destined to leave the country of his birth, which had witnessed his glorious achievements. Having recovered his health, and being what may be called an elderly man entirely reinvigorated. He returned again to Canada, in 1860, and a vacancy having occurred by the appointment of Colonel Prince to the judgeship of Algoma, in the western division of the Legislative Council, he was returned a member of that honorable body; and last session, took his seat among the \"lords\" of Canada.\n\nSir Allan married, first, on the 6th of May, 1821, Elizabeth, daughter of Lieutenant Daniel Brooke, by whom, who died in 1825, he had one son and one daughter; the former died in 1834; the latter (Anne Jane) married in 1849, Assistant Commissary-General Davenport. Sir Allan married, secondly, in 1831, Mary, eldest daughter of Mr. Sheriff Stuart, of the Johnstown district, by whom, who died in 1846, he had two daughters, the eldest of whom (Sophia) married in November, 1855, the Right Honorable Viscount Bury, M.P., eldest son of the Earl of Albemarle; the youngest (Mary Stuart) married in 1861, a son of the Honorable Sir Dominick Daly, governor of South Australia.\nADMIRAL BAYFIELD, R.N.\n\nNone can be ignorant of the name and services of the above distinguished officer, and as in everything but birth he is a Canadian, and one to whom we are deeply indebted, we herewith present to our readers such facts relating to his history as we have been enabled to gather.\n\nHenry Wolsey Bayfield is descended from a very ancient family, the Bayfields, formerly of Bayfield Hall, county Norfolk, England.\n\nHe entered the royal navy, on the 6th January, 1806, as a supernumerary volunteer, on board his Majesty's ship Pompey, eighty guns, bearing the flag of Sir William Sydney Smith. Proceeding from Dover, in the Atalanta, tender to the Pompey, he was present when she beat off a French privateer, after a brief but sharp action. Having arrived in the Pompey off Cadiz, Mr. Bayfield was transferred to the Queen, ninety-eight guns, the flagship of Admiral Lord Collingwood; and from her to the Duchess of Bedford, hired arm ship, fourteen guns; in which vessel, commanded by Lieutenant F. B. Spilsbury, he was slightly wounded, when after a severe action in the Gut of Gibraltar, she beat off two powerful Spanish fellucas, manned by more than double the number of her crew. For his conduct in this action, Mr. Bayfield was transferred to the Beagle, eighteen guns, as first class volunteer, on the 29th September 1806, under the command of Captain Francis Newcomb. Mr. Bayfield was present, when the Beagle, by her superior fire, compelled the enemy to abandon an English merchant vessel, laden with naval stores, and which had been stranded under the sand-hills, on the Atlantic coast of Spain.\u2014And on the 28th October, 1808, 24th January, and 13th February, 1809, at the capture of the French privateer and luggers Hazard, Venguer, and Fortune, carrying in the whole forty-four guns, and one hundred and fifty-five men. Under the same command, Mr. Bayfield shared in Lord Cochrane's celebrated attack of the French fleet, in Aix Roads, on the 11th and 12th April, 1809, and also on the 18th April, when the Beagle, with several other vessels, was anchored in the mouth of the Chasaute, and engaged for five hours under a fire of shot and shell, from L'Isle d'Aix L'Ocean, one hundred and twenty guns, a two decked ship, and a frigate. In the autumn of the same year, he was present at the siege of Flushing, and other operations on the Scheldt: and having previously attained the rating of midshipman, he rejoined Captain Newcomb, in April 1811, on his appointment to the command of the Wanderer, twenty guns, and during the three following years,\nwas employed in the West Indies, the coast of North America, Portugal, and the north coast of Spain. In the autumn of 1814, he volunteered for service on the lakes of Canada, where he commanded a gunboat, towards the close of the American war; and having attained the rank of lieutenant, 20th March, 1815, he assisted Captain W. F. W. Owen, in the survey of lake Ontario, the river St. Lawrence from Kingston to Prescott, and the Niagara river. In June 1817, Lieutenant Bayfield became an admiralty surveyor, and was appointed to the survey of the lakes Erie and Huron, in which great work, with means altogether inadequate, namely two open boats, and one young midshipman, he persevered until the spring of 1823; when he commenced the survey of lake Superior, for which service the schooner Recovery, of one hundred and fifty tons, and the only vessel at the time on that immense lake, was hired from the Hudson's Bay Company, at whose principal establishment, Fort William, the naval surveying party wintered. Towards the close of the year 1825, Lieutenant Bayfield returned to England, after ten years of incessant toil and exposure, in that severe climate, the shores of lakes Huron and Superior, being at the time uninhabited, except by wandering Indians, and a few fur-traders. On his arrival in England, Lieutenant Bayfield was employed at the Admiralty, completing the charts of the lakes, and on the 8th November, 1826, the Lords of the Admiralty signified their approbation of his service, by promoting him to the rank of commander. In the following summer, 1827, the lord high admiral, the Duke of Clarence, as a further mark of approval, appointed him to the survey of the St. Lawrence. In this last great work, which has been extended so as to include the whole of the river and gulf of St. Lawrence, from Montreal through the Straits of Bellisle, to Cape St. Lewis, on the coast of Labrador; the great river Saguenay, and all other tributary streams, as far as they are navigable; the islands of Anticosti, Mingan, the Magdalens, Prince Edward, Cape Breton, &c.; the coast of Nova Scotia westward to Halifax, inclusive; Sable Island, &c., Captain Bayfield was employed until the 21st October, 1856, when he attained the rank of rear-admiral\u2014having previously been promoted to the rank of captain, for his services, as a maritime surveyor, on the 4th June, 1834.\n\nFrom the foregoing statement it will be perceived, that Admiral Bayfield's connection with Canada commenced at an early period of his career, in the year 1814. He was a resident at Quebec, from the close to the opening of the navigation, for fourteen years, from 1827 to 1841. In this last named year, the survey being extended to the southeastern parts of the gulf, it became necessary to change the head-quarters of the survey to Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, where it has since remained. During Admiral Bayfield's residence in Canada, he formed many friendships, which\ndeath has in many instances severed, but the remembrance of which will never cease to be cherished with pleasure. He took an interest in all measures having for their object, the advancement of science, the relief of the poor, &c. On his departure from Quebec, he received the thanks of the Trinity Board, 20th May, 1841, and on the 6th May, 1854, of the Canadian Legislature, for services rendered to Canada, &c. He is an honorary, and one of the original members of the Literary and Historical Society of Quebec, and of the Canadian Institute, Toronto; a corresponding member of the Natural History Society of Montreal, and of the Kingston Mechanics' Institute; a member of the Astronomical Society of London, and of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9ologique de France.\n\nJ. G. BARTHE, Esq.\n\nThis gentleman, well known as a journalist of some standing and celebrity in Lower Canada, is descended from an old and well connected French family, which misfortune drove hither during the French occupation of this province. His father was reduced to the necessity of trading between the Baie des Chaleurs and the Antilles, in a small vessel, which he had purchased, and it was on one of these voyages that the subject of this notice was born, exactly forty-four years since.\n\nM. Barthe, at the early age of five years (after his parents had sustained a series of misfortunes), was entrusted to the care of his uncle, who resided at Three Rivers, to receive his education, and after remaining there for a short time, was removed to the college of Nicolet, where he remained until 1832, studying very little, and dreaming very much, when on the breaking out of the pestilential cholera, he was moved again to Three Rivers, and entered as a student of medicine, at Dr. Kimber's. At this time he literally knew nothing, having as before mentioned, idly passed the precious time allotted for his education, in writing poetic effusions, which were destined hardly to live the hour. For fourteen or fifteen months he remained with Dr. Kimber, until disgusted and sick at heart with the bloody scenes he had to witness in his profession; he on the advice of Judge Valli\u00e8res de St. Real, gave it up, and adopted that of the law. Finding himself deficient in learning, and advised by some persons of distinction, whose friendship he had contracted, he studied diligently, and made himself\nmaster of all things necessary for a good sound practical education, and such a one as would enable him to pass his examination creditably.\n\nThe events of 1837 arrived, and young Barthe was arrested on suspicion of having written an ode to Papineau and \"the exiles,\" and confined in prison, from which he was only liberated, on the arrival of the Honorable Poulett Thompson (Lord Sydenham.) He immediately passed his examination, became an advocate of Lower Canada, and proceeded to Montreal, to establish himself in his profession. There he became editor of L'Avenir des Canadas, a position which he occupied for five years.\n\nIn 1841, he was returned to Parliament, for the county of Yamaska, but was defeated on presenting himself in 1845, through the influence of a strong party, whose censure he had incurred; since then he has not sat in Parliament.\n\nWhen the commission on the rebellion losses indemnity was struck, Mr. Barthe was attached to it, and afterwards was appointed Clerk of Appeals for Lower Canada, and held this situation for four years; afterwards he was connected in a great measure with the French Canadian press, and whilst in that capacity conceived the idea of an emigration to this country from France, which has since been adopted by the government, but without any benefit to M. Barthe; and in 1853, he proceeded to France with his family, produced his book, while there, entitled \"Canada Reconquis par la France,\" and returned after residing at Paris for three years.\n\nHe was an unsuccessful candidate last year, for the Legislative Council division of Stadacona.\n\nADMIRAL BOXER, C.B.,\n\nWell-known in Canada during the time he filled some public offices at Quebec. Rear-admiral Boxer was a native of Dover, where he was born in 1788, and the younger brother of Captain James Boxer, R.N., and of Commander William Boxer, R.N. who died in 1842. He entered the service in 1798, on board the Doris, 36 guns, Captain Lord Viscount Ranelagh, and continued to serve in her until January, 1802, when he accompanied Captain Brisbane, then her captain, into the Trent, 36, and afterwards served with him for three years in the Goliath, 74, and Arethusa, 38. He subsequently served in P Unit\u00e9, on the Mediterranean station; the Ocean, 98, the\nflag-ship of Lord Collingwood, off Cadiz; and as acting lieutenant of the Sophia, 18, and Tigre, 30. During the expedition to Egypt in 1807, he commanded a detachment of seamen landed to co-operate with the army; and, on the 31st October, 1809, he commanded a division of boats, which captured, in the bay of Rossas, the French store-ship Lamprouie, the bombards Victoire and Grondeur, the armed xebec Normandie, and a convoy of seven merchant vessels.\n\nFrom the Tigre, in October, 1811, he removed to the Malta, 84 guns, with Captain Hallowell, who then hoisted his flag as rear-admiral; and he continued employed by that officer as first lieutenant until appointed, in October, 1814, to the acting command of the Wizard, brig. In 1813 he had the direction of all the gun-boats under the orders of Rear-Admiral Hallowell at the siege of Tarragona.\n\nHe was made commander, March 1, 1815; and from that period remained unemployed until appointed, 6th September, 1822, to the Sparrowhawk, 18 guns, on the Halifax station, whence he was superseded, on his promotion to the rank of captain, 23rd June, 1823. He became an inspecting commander of the Coast Guard in July, 1824. From February, 1827 until July, 1830, he served as flag-captain at Halifax to Sir Charles Ogle, in the Husar, 46; and from August, 1837 to August, 1841 he commanded the Pique, 36, on the North America, West India, and Mediterranean stations. In 1840, on the coast of Syria, his active exertions materially contributed to the operations against Ca\u00efffe, Jaffa, and Tsour; and together with Captain H. J. Codrington, he superintended the soundings made in the channels leading to the batteries of St Jean d'Acre, previously to the bombardment of that fortress. For these services he was nominated a companion of the Bath on the 18th December, in that year, and presented with the Turkish gold medal. On the 24th August, 1843, he was appointed agent for transports and harbor-master at Quebec, where he remained for several years. He attained the rank of rear-admiral in 1853.\n\nAfter his employment as admiral-superintendent at Balaklava, some reflections had been passed upon him on account of the crowded and dirty state of that inconveniently narrow and contracted port during the Russian war; but a letter thus spoke of his exertions:\n\n\"Admiral Boxer, to whom exclusively is due the credit of filling up the waste of filth at the head of the harbor, and of creating in its stead a spacious quay and landing-place, is certainly most energetic. He is afloat all day long, from an early hour in the morning looking after the vessels; and nothing escapes his notice. He has instituted an admirable harbor police\u2014the men have handsome uniforms, and are provided with a fast-pulling cutter; and at night the silence which prevails on board the ships is a great contrast to...\"\nthe noise and riot which existed a short time ago. A wire cable is drawn across the mouth of the harbor every night, and boats row guard as usual inside.\"\n\nRear-Admiral Boxer died on board the Jason, outside the harbor of Balaklava, after a short illness, of cholera, on the 4th June, 1855. He was removed to the ship in the hope that the pure sea air might prove beneficial to him; but this expectation was not fulfilled. His nephew died of cholera in the preceding week, and this melancholy event so deeply affected him, that his health at once gave way, and he sunk under the same disease. The late Lord Raglan, in reporting his death to the secretary of the war department, thus described his merits:\n\n\"It is well known that this officer devoted his whole life to the public service. Since he undertook the appointment of admiral-superintendent of the harbor of Balaklava, he has applied himself incessantly to the discharge of his arduous duties, exposing himself in all weathers; and he has rendered a most essential service to the army, by improving the landing-places and establishing wharfs on the west side of the port, whereby the disembarkation of stores and troops has been greatly accelerated, and communications with the shore have been rendered much easier.\"\n\nAdmiral Boxer became a widower on the 25th of June, 1826, and had a numerous family. His eldest son, James Fuller, a master R.N., married Mathilda Mary, eldest daughter of T. Sturdee, Esq., of the naval yard at Portsmouth. Edward, his third son, married, in 1848, Eleanor, daughter of the late Lieutenant-Colonel Payne, R.A. Of his daughters, one married C. E. Levey, Esq., of Quebec, and another, Captain Thompson of the 54th Regiment.\n\n---\n\n**Dr. Andrew F. Holmes.**\n\nDr. Holmes, the dean of the faculty of McGill college, was one of the most talented savans as well as one of the most estimable gentlemen in this country.\n\nIn the year 1797, the father of Dr. Holmes was on his way to Canada with his wife, when the vessel in which he sailed was captured by a French frigate, and taken as a prize to Cadiz. There the doctor was born, and was baptized at the church of St. Jago by the name of Andrew Fernando. The family reached Canada in 1801. In 1811 he was articled to the late Dr. Arnoldi, with whom\nhe studied for several years, after which he went to Edinburgh to complete his studies, and thence to Paris. In 1819 he returned to Canada with the diploma of M.D., and began the practice of his profession as a partner of his former patron. This partnership being subsequently dissolved, he continued to practice alone up to the day of his death. After his return, in 1824, with the late Drs. Caldwell and Robertson, he founded the Montreal School of Medicine, known afterwards as the \"Montreal Medical Institution,\" which when the university of McGill college was set in operation in 1828 or 1829, was merged in the medical faculty of that institution. This school has long ranked among the foremost on this continent, and has been a boast of Montreal. Up to the year 1836 he filled the chair of materia medica and chemistry. In that year the duty was divided, he taking chemistry alone, which he held till 1842, when he succeeded Dr. Robertson in the chair which he held up to the day of his death. At the reorganization of the faculty in 1854, he became and continued to his death dean of the faculty, discharging the duties of his office with a zeal, diligence and alacrity beyond praise, also holding the chair of the theory and practice of medicine. He was, we believe, the oldest professor in Canada. Dr. Holmes was also the founder, with a few others, of the Natural History Society, and pursued for many years the study of the natural sciences with great zeal and success, winning for himself reputation as a naturalist, in days when students in those fields lacked the many aids and incitements to diligence possessed now. His herbarium, consisting of a very complete collection of the plants of Canada, he presented, a few years ago, to the museum of the university. He died at Montreal, in September, 1860.\n\n---\n\nREV. JOHN BAYNE, D.D.\n\nWe present the following sketch from the Toronto Globe, which appeared at the period of the death of this eminent Presbyterian divine, an event which took place in November, 1859:\n\n\"'Dr. Bayne, of Galt, is dead,' is a statement which, as it falls on the ear, or meets the eye, will awaken painful emotions in multitudes in this country; and the reply will be, 'Yes, and a great man is gone.' It is even so, for he was no ordinary man. Nearly a quarter of a century has elapsed since the writer of these lines met with Dr. Bayne. He had just then come to the province,\nand, although but a young man, no one could be an hour in his company without being struck with the force and originality of his mind; for his stock of information was even then very great, and his power of expressing his thoughts so clear and comprehensive, that you felt at once in the presence of a man of a well-stored memory and a highly cultivated intellect. As he continued to be a hard student, he was constantly adding to his mental wealth, so that, many years before his death, his stores of knowledge were uncommonly great. It was, however, in theological learning that he chiefly excelled; for, although far above the ordinary run of even learned men in certain departments of secular knowledge, yet it was the learning of his profession on which his heart was mainly set, and on which his intellectual powers were ever most vigorously exercised. No man knew better the vast difference in value betwixt the best of human learning and the knowledge of the gospel; and few men could turn to better account secular knowledge, in making it subservient, so far as it could go, to the illustration of sacred truth. From his fine taste and sound judgment, he could not only fully appreciate the labors of men in the various walks of literature, but could wisely employ these to throw light on his grand topics in the pulpit.\n\n\"It was, indeed, in the pulpit that this eminent servant of God appeared to the highest advantage. There were those\u2014perhaps not a few\u2014who thought his discourses were heavy, but they were heavy with thought; and if somewhat longer than modern custom sanctions, it should be known that this was not through a want of taste or prudence in the preacher, but from burning zeal to benefit souls. He appeared to feel that his message was so momentous, and the present opportunity so important, that he did not know well how to stop while there were unconverted sinners before him, and souls that needed the consolations of the gospel. And yet, when one thinks how rich his discourses were in matter\u2014how clear the reasoning was that ran through them\u2014with what simple and noble diction the great truths were clothed, and with what natural and forcible majesty they were delivered\u2014he cannot but wonder that Christian men should have thought them unreasonably long. The truth is, that to men of vigorous intellect and healthy piety, Dr. Bayne was ever an acceptable preacher. It is not saying too much to affirm, that on all the topics he carried to the pulpit, he ever spoke so as to interest and edify. Yet, those who have heard him frequently will readily admit that it was when he came to speak of his Saviour's love, and his Saviour's sufferings, that his discourses partook of a grandeur and beauty quite peculiar. On these highest of all themes\u2014the themes unspeakably dearest to his heart, he was in the best sense truly an eloquent preacher. It need scarcely be observed that his eloquence, neither on these, nor on other occasions was at all of the sort so much in vogue with\nmany that run after a certain kind of pulpit orators. The genius of his eloquence was eminently intellectual. Hence it dealt mainly with the understanding and conscience, and was intended to reach the feelings only through the conscience. This it often did with singular force. The church to which he so long ministered\u2014perhaps the largest in the province\u2014is composed of a people whose good sense, solid information, and simple manners eminently fitted them to appreciate the high and varied talents of their gifted pastor. What a loss that church has sustained!\n\n\"It may be naturally inferred from what has been already stated, that Dr. Bayne was a man of the old school. In some respects he was peculiarly so. It is well known that on certain points in the line that separates the sacred from the civil, or the church from the state, he held strong, and in our times what are regarded as peculiar notions. There is no intention in this brief notice to enter on these matters. It is enough to say, that some of his theories, as to the power of the civil magistrate in things sacred, were the same as have in speculation sorely perplexed the wisest of men in different ages, and have still more sorely perplexed good men at certain periods, when they have striven to reduce these theories to practice. And if many who highly esteemed his talents and revered his spirituality of mind, thought his theories on these subjects sometimes obscurely stated, and his reasonings frequently inconclusive, yet no one ever questioned his sincerity, or the high motives from which he acted. He was indeed a man of simple honesty of purpose\u2014hence, if his tenacity to certain ecclesiastical views was often annoying, and sometimes painful to those who differed from him; yet, even those who differed most were ever ready to admit, that this tenacity could not be traced to vanity, but to a deep conviction that what he supported were great principles.\n\n\"The man who is only distinguished in public, has some grounds to suspect that his claims to greatness, are on the whole rather equivocal. If Dr. Bayne was a distinguished preacher and a leading man in church courts, he was a still more remarkable man in private. Indeed, it is hardly saying too much to affirm, that those who have only known him in public, can hardly form any just notion of the richness of his mind, or the gentleness and humility of his heart. Like all good men, he was eminently social\u2014but he possessed, what some good men do not possess, conversational powers of the highest order. As is was said of one of our greatest poets\u2014\"that whatever he uttered had something in it\"\u2014so may it with truth be said of Dr. Bayne, that all that he uttered had either something genial in it, often something grand, and always something good. Men who understand of what materials high minds are made, will not wonder to hear that he was a man of genuine wit, and that his wit often overflowed into\nnatural and pleasing humor. The conceited, the stupid, and those who are harrassed with the dread of their holowness being detected, were apt to suppose him not only severe, but cruel in the play of his wit. No supposition could be more unjust. He was not only a Christian gentleman in principle, but a most accomplished gentleman in his whole demeanor. He would, indeed, have shuddered to have uttered a word that could have given causeless pain to the humblest of his fellow creatures. No one who has ever witnessed him talk, with his earnest voice and look, with the young, whether cheerily or solemnly, by the fireside, can ever doubt either the depth of his piety or the tenderness of his affection; and surely the man of mature years, who ever left Dr. Bayne's own fireside without regret to go, must have had but little social affection, while he could leave it without having made addition to his wisdom, and having had all his best motives strengthened, must either have been an exceedingly wise man or pitifully foolish. He was, indeed, take him all in all, an admirable specimen of what the ministers of Christ ought to be\u2014learned, laborious, zealous, and humble. Canada sadly misses such a man, and yet it is even more painful to think that the province can at present lose but few such men.\n\n\"But this brief notice, which has aimed at no full portraiture of Dr. Bayne's character, must now be drawn to a close. Before, however, doing this, it may not be improper to remark, that he had descended from a family, that for several generations had been distinguished for respectable talent, and eminent piety. Dr. Bayne's father, the Gaelic minister of Greenock, was truly a man of God; his mother is also said to have been a woman of excellent mind and of most ardent piety. The labors of these parents were not in vain. Several of the daughters were not only eminent Christian women, but labored with extraordinary ability, and gave a display of grace in its most beautiful forms, as missionaries in heathen lands. Mrs. Wilson, of Bombay, one of Dr. Bayne's sisters, was one of the loftiest and purest spirits that ever toiled in the conversion of the heathen. But these godly parents who trained up these noble children have gone\u2014and the children are gone too. Yet all of them appear to have lived for the mighty purpose of honoring Christ in the salvation of souls. 'Their works do follow them.' 'Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord.'\"\nSIR GEORGE SIMPSON, K.B.\n\nThis book of Canadian celebrities would be incomplete if we omitted to notice the distinguished individual, whose name graces the head of this page; and whose fame has extended over both continents.\n\nSir George Simpson was born in Ross-shire, Scotland, where he passed his youth. In the year 1809 he removed to London, and was engaged in commercial pursuits for the succeeding eleven years. He was there brought into communication with the late Earl of Selkirk, then the leading spirit of the Hudson's Bay Company. This was the period (1819) of the bitter rivalry between the Hudson's Bay Company and the North West Company of Canada. It was at this period, too, that Lord Selkirk engaged in the scheme for colonizing the territory, and undertook the task of founding the Red River settlement. Sir (then Mr.) George Simpson was selected to take a leading part in conducting the operations of the company, which required then men of unusual energy and capacity. He sailed from England for New York in the early part of 1820, and, in May of that year, left Montreal for the far north-west. His first winter was spent at lake Athabasca, where he endured much privation, and carried on the competition with the North West Company with the energy and success that characterised all his undertakings. This competition\u2014involving losses to both companies\u2014was terminated the following year, by their coalition, when Mr. Simpson was appointed governor of the northern department, and subsequently governor-in-chief of Rupert's Land, and the general superintendent of all the Hudson's Bay Company's affairs in North America. On attaining this position, the peculiar talents of the governor became conspicuous; he reconciled conflicting interests, abated personal jealousies, and established a controlling influence which he retained to the last.\n\nSir George Simpson took great interest in the cause of geographical discoveries on the northern coast of this continent; and, to his admirable selection of leaders and skilful arrangements, are due the successful expeditions under Messrs. Dease and Simpson in 1834-5; Dr. Rae, in 1845 and 1853; and Messrs. Anderson and Stewart, in 1855. For these services, and as a mark of general approbation, her Majesty was pleased to confer the honor of knighthood on Mr. (thenceforward Sir) George Simpson. Soon after, he set out on his celebrated overland journey round the world, of which he subsequently published a very interesting narrative. Sir George latterly resided almost altogether at Lachine, near which\nvillage is situated the beautiful Isle Dorval, from whence came off\nthe canoe expedition, given by the Hudson Bay Company, to his\nRoyal Highness the Prince of Wales, in 1860.\n\nThe last public act of Sir George Simpson's long and active life\nwas, to receive as a guest, the heir apparent to the throne of\nEngland, and it must be gratifying to his family and friends, to\nknow that the prince graciously acknowledged the attention shewn\nto him by Sir George, and that the noble duke, who presides over\nthe colonial department, availed himself of the opportunity afforded\nby personal communication, to express the high opinion entertained\nby himself and her Majesty's imperial advisers, of the skilful and\nsuccessful administration of one of the most extensive provinces of\nthe British empire.\n\nHe was for many years connected as a large sharcholder with\nour leading monetary institutions. He was, for many years, a\na director of the Bank of British North America, but transferred\nhis services at the annual meeting in 1859, to the Bank of Montreal.\n\nSome time before his death, he was visited with an attack, said\nat the time to be of paralysis or apoplexy, but he soon rallied from\nit, and seemed to be in his usual health. He was, however, later\nobliged to turn back from his spring expedition to Red River, on\naccount of bodily infirmity. The bustle and anxiety connected\nwith the royal visit, no doubt, disturbed the even tenor of his life\nagain. On the Saturday previous to his death, he was again\nattacked with apoplexy while driving out from Montreal to Lachine,\nand, after six days of much suffering, he closed his long and active\nlife on the 7th September, 1860, surrounded by his family and\nimmediate friends.\n\nHis death caused a great sensation, and was heard of with deep\nregret by the great number of his friends in Montreal and the\nprovince, and by large numbers in Britain and the United States:\nfor the governor of the vast dominions of the great fur company\nhad obtained an almost world wide reputation. His funeral was\none of the largest that was ever seen in Montreal. All who\nfollowed his remains seemed affected with profound and unfeigned\nregret. Montreal lost in him a distinguished man, whom she could\ncall her own,\u2014one that had helped to raise her, in a great measure,\nto her present enviable position, as the commercial capital of British\nAmerica.\n\nSir George Simpson married in the year 1830, the daughter of\nGeddes M. Simpson, Esquire, of London; she died in this country\nin 1858. His family consists of one son and three daughters.\nThe heir to the large fortune left by Sir George is at present in\nEngland. Of the daughters, one is married to Angus Cameron,\nEsquire, of Toronto.\nHON. MR. JUSTICE BADGLEY, LL.D.\n\nMr. Badgley is essentially a British Canadian in birth and principle. His maternal grandfather came to Montreal from Britain in 1764, where he settled, and died after a residence of upwards of seventy years. His mother was born in Montreal, and his father was English by birth; the latter was for several years an eminent merchant in our mercantile metropolis, and served in Parliament as one of the city members, having defeated the late Mr. B. Viger in the election contest of 1801. He died in Montreal, some years ago, after a residence there of upwards of sixty years.\n\nThe subject of this notice was born in Montreal, in 1801, and adopted the law as his profession, after a few years service in mercantile affairs. He was called to the bar in 1823; but, in 1830, was compelled by serious indisposition to proceed to Europe, whence he returned in 1834. At that time the political atmosphere of Lower Canada began to be overcast, under the influence of Mr. Papineau and his friends and supporters in the Assembly. There was an evident tendency at this period to something beyond the solution of questions of mere Canadian constitutionality or party politics, manifestly involving a severance of the colony from the empire, until at last in 1836, nothing remained for concealment in the views of the Canadian party. Believing that the imperial connection was of vital importance to the province, Mr. Badgley connected himself with the opposition raised to the dominant party; but, whilst participating with the movements against that party, his efforts were constantly devoted to necessary reforms, amongst others, to the establishment of registry offices, which he strongly advocated in a series of letters published in one of the Montreal papers. These attracted considerable attention from the public at the time, and afterwards from the government commissioners, Earl of Gosford, &c. The honorable Mr. Moffatt, having desired to introduce such a measure into the Legislative Council, invited the co-operation of Mr. Badgley at Quebec, where he framed a bill, which was passed through the Council, but, not suiting the views of the party in the Assembly, was there rejected. Whilst in Quebec, upon that occasion, he prepared the report of the committee of the Legislative Council, to whom was referred the education bill from the Assembly, the report with its accompanying resolutions was adopted by the Council, which caused the rejection of the bill. This bill, great in its educational object, was, in effect, intended to perpetuate and extend the exaggerated pretensions of the dominant party in the Assembly, and tended to a gradual absorption of the entire\nprovincial revenue, placing the appropriations for the purposes in the uncontrolled and irresponsible distribution of the county members individually. The rejection of this bill with the establishment of registry offices in Lower Canada, was at the time considered as matters of great importance, the Canadian party objecting to the latter, because they viewed it as introducing British capital as they declared for the ejection of the parish Canadian land-holder; the British party objecting to the former, because it was in fact placing the provincial funds in the hands of the Canadian party, to subserve their mere political schemes. It is matter of history that the party violence exploded in 1837, and again, in 1838; but, during 1836, and the two following years, and until after peace was restored in the province, Mr. Badgley was always more or less connected with the public matters of Montreal, and with the public journals which sustained British interests. Foreseeing, in 1836, the natural result of the reckless and unchecked influence of M. Papineau and his party. He assisted in the reorganization of the constitutional association of the Montreal district, as the exponent of the British party, an example which was shortly afterwards followed at Quebec. The principal labors of the association here, first under the chairmanship of the Honorable G. Moffatt, until his departure for Europe, and, subsequently, under that of the late Honorable P. McGill, were performed by him as secretary, and by these efforts, Upper Canada and the neighboring colonies were effectually raised to extend their active sympathy to the British inhabitants of Lower Canada, and to give them substantial assistance, if it should be needed. The great volunteer movement of 1836, owed much of its origin to Mr. Badgley, and was fully carried out in opposition to the refusal of the governor, Lord Gosford, at first to permit it to be adopted. The constitutional association was organized as well for the self-defence of the British inhabitant, as for the exposition of their views and sentiments upon the state of the country, being almost entirely excluded from the House of Assembly, and for the maintenance of British connection; but none of these objects would have availed had the Canadas continued separate provinces. The reunion of the Canadas became a political necessity, as the sole means at hand for the restoration of confidence to all parties, and to give to all the inhabitants the full and free exercise of constitutional rights, so soon as peace and order should be restored. It was the duty of Mr. Badgley, as it had long been his desire, to have that measure adopted, and his mind and pen were indefatigably employed for its attainment. By public and private correspondence, by writings in the public journals, and by addresses from the association itself, that great object was kept prominent before the public at home and abroad, and at last, an elaborate address from the association, prepared by Mr. Badgley, was published in pamphlet form, and most extensively circulated in the Canadas and Britain. The\nassociation, impressed with these views, finally determined to place them at the foot of the throne, and before both branches of the Imperial Parliament, and for this purpose Mr. Badgley prepared the address which was adopted by the association, and afterwards presented. Mr. Moffatt and him were also selected by the association as its delegates, and to take charge of the addresses, from the Montreal district, with instructions to urge our grievances upon the consideration of the home authorities, and especially to bring under their favorable notice, the re-union of the Canadas at the end of 1837. He accordingly proceeded to England, where, in conjunction with Mr. Moffatt, he at once commenced the duties of their mission, Mr. Andrew Stuart, the delegate from Quebec, not arriving till some weeks after. The previous appointment of the Earl of Durham, as lord high commissioner for the British provinces in America, with almost unlimited powers, as was supposed, prevented, to some extent, the full object of the mission intrusted to Mr. Badgley and Mr. Moffatt. The addresses to both houses of Parliament were, however, duly presented, and that to the Queen, was received very graciously by her Majesty. Lord Glenelg and Sir George Grey, the colonial secretaries, placed those gentlemen in immediate and direct intercourse with Lord Durham, who received their communications and heard the expression of their views and opinions upon Canadian difficulties, and particularly upon the re-union of the provinces. At his request, elaborate written statements were prepared and submitted to him, explaining and expressing the grievances complained of by the British inhabitants of Lower Canada, and urging upon his favorable consideration the great object of their mission. He also received from them a statement in detail of the composition of the Legislative Council at the time, as well as of the partial representation in the Assembly. In addition to these labors, drafts of bills were prepared and submitted to the colonial secretary for imperial legislation for the abolition of the seignorial tenure, in the island of Montreal,\u2014for its abolition also in the seignories generally of Lower Canada, and for other objects which were deemed to require the action of the Imperial Parliament from the effect of previous legislators. None of these matters were adopted by the colonial office, but they were transmitted to Lord Durham for his adjudication, as well as a written r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of subjects for his lordship's executive as well as legislative action in Canada. Mr. Stuart did not reach England until these matters had been accomplished, but having been directed by their respective associations to delay their departure for some time longer, Mr. Badgley had frequent opportunities of communicating with the colonial secretaries above mentioned, as well as with Sir J. Stephen, then an under secretary in that department, to whom all colonial details from the colonies generally were first submitted, before they received\nthe final determination of Lord Glenelg and Sir George Grey. During that period, the delegates availed themselves of their opportunities, and did not fail to urge upon the department objects of public advantage for their constituents.\n\nAmong other objects of importance, having applied to Lord Glenelg, to carry out the intentions of George III., for the grant of a tract of wild land from the crown reserves in Lower Canada, for the establishment of a university for the higher branches of education, Mr. Badgley prepared for his lordship a paper upon the educational establishment of the province, which he caused to be printed as a pamphlet at the expense of the association. Mr. Badgley and Mr. Stuart also interested some eminent public men in London, in another application to Lord Glenelg, upon the subject of learning in the colony, and their deputation was heard by the present chancellor of the exchequer, Mr. Gladstone, assisted by Sir Robert Inglis, Mr. (now Sir John) Pakington, and others, members of the Commons. Lord Glenelg, unfortunately, did not feel himself justified in interfering at the time, owing to the extraordinary powers given to Lord Durham, but promised to urge the subject upon the high commissioner's favorable consideration. Mr. Badgley might have remained permanently in England at that time, having been offered a place in the colonial office, where his lordship said he thought Mr. Badgley's services would be very useful, but the expense of a family could hardly be supported on the salary proposed, and which could have been only gradually increased; he therefore returned to Montreal early in the autumn of 1838, and resumed the labors of his profession, taking but little further interest in politics, after reporting to the association the extent and result of his labors, and receiving their unanimous approbation for his conduct. The re-union of the Canadas did take place, and Lord Durham did finally recommend it, although as well at the time of Mr. Badgley's intercourse with him in England, as at a hurried interview with him at Quebec, after his return to Canada, and shortly before his lordship's final departure from Quebec, he appeared to be indisposed to the measure.\n\nMr. Poulett Thompson's arrival having quieted down everything politically in the province, the association ceased to exist, and Mr. Badgley again established himself in a lucrative and increasing practice, when he was surprised by the unsolicited offer from the governor-general, of the offer of a commissioner of bankrupts for the district of Montreal, and which he accepted in 1840. He performed the duties of the office, after two or three months, as sole commissioner until July, 1844, when the amended bankruptcy act came into operation, and he was induced, against his inclination, to take the office of circuit judge, in connection with that of commissioner of bankrupts. He continued to perform the duties of these offices with impatience, until his resig-\nnation of them in April, 1847, a few days after which, he was again surprised by the unsolicited offer of the attorney-generalship for Lower Canada, in succession to Mr. (now Mr. Justice) Smith, upon his and Mr. Draper's retirement from their respective offices of attorneys-general for Lower and for Upper Canada. Although personally unacquainted with even an individual member of the ministry which he was invited to join, he did not hesitate to accept the offer, believing that he could have no personal difficulty in performing its duties, and also knowing that it would serve gently to break any descent, and, in an honorable and favorable manner, from his former position on the bench, to his then present return to the bar. A warm election contest awaited Mr. Badgley in the county of Mississquoi, in which he was successful, and, in May, 1847, he first took his seat as a member of the provincial Parliament, since which time, he continued in Parliament until the general election of 1855, having gained a second election in Mississquoi in 1848, and his fourth election for the city of Montreal, in 1851; in the last, he defeated the ministerialist, M. Larocque, and the Rouge candidate, M. Papineau, as fifty years before, his father defeated M. Papineau's friend, the late Mr. B. Viger, for Montreal.\n\nThe conservative feelings and sentiments with which Mr. Badgley had regulated his political notions from the first, accompanied him into office, and into the House of Assembly, and have remained unchanged, always wishing him to avoid extreme and violent means, and rather to adopt and support such as promised advantageous improvement in legislative, or increase provincial prosperity, from whatever source, liberal reform or conservative measures might come. The short tenure of his office was marked by but few additions to the statute books, but the laws for summoning jurors, the establishment of county municipalities, instead of parish municipalities, the commutation of the seignorial tenure and the crown seigniories, and others may be referred to for practical objects of importance. No delay was allowed to interfere with the claims of the public generally, or of individuals to official consideration, and, at his departure from the council table, no arrears were left of his own references, nor of many which had descended to him from his two predecessors. Mr. Badgley was the last attorney-general in lower Canada, who himself conducted the business of the criminal terms. In his place in Parliament, he never failed to support honest and just measures, but captious or deceptious ones were invariably opposed. From the first, he opposed the financial schemes of Mr. Hincks, and especially the connection of the province with his friends, Messrs Jackson & Co., in the Grand Trunk Railroad contract, which he was disposed to consider with much disfavor and dread, although he was most friendly disposed to the establishment of a Grand Trunk Railroad under proper management and efficient contract. His intercourse with\nhis fellow members of the Assembly, of all parties, was cordial on his part, and he only lays claim to the merit, such as it is, of maintaining his own opinions, without harshness or unnecessarily wounding the feeling of others. During several sessions of Parliament, he was chairman of the committee of private bills, an office in which temper and patience are frequently tested, but he maintained the rules of Parliament, and, though the rights of parties were closely scrutinized, and the demands of some were rejected, he was not aware that any one had cast blame upon him. At the close of the session of 1854, in which he took his part with Sir Allan MacNab, Honorable J. A. Macdonald, and others, with whom he had long acted, he determined to withdraw from public life altogether, the time and expense required being more than he could justifiably withdraw from the protection and support of his family, and he intimated to his friends his purpose, especially as he perceived that party ties were breaking up, and others would be formed in which he could not altogether concur; but upon their remonstrance, he again contested Montreal without success, but without disappointment, and refused the offer of a county, in which he would have succeeded. In January, 1855, he was placed upon the bench of the Superior Court for Lower Canada, in which capacity he still remains. He has been elected to the presidency of the Natural History Society two or three times, and as often to that of the St. George's Society, of Montreal. This was some years since, when he was much mixed up with the public. He is a doctor of laws of McGill and Lennoxville universities, and has been for some years, Grand Master of Masons for Montreal.\n\nRIGHT REV. G. J. MOUNTAIN, D.D., D.C.L.,\nLORD BISHOP OF QUEBEC.\n\nHis Lordship the bishop of Quebec, was born on the 27th of July, 1789, at Norwich, England. He early accompanied his father, the first Anglican bishop in Canada, to this country in 1793, and thus his name is associated with the earliest period in the history of the church in this province. He did not, however, remain long in Canada, but returned shortly after to receive his education, and pursue his studies at Cambridge, where he graduated at Trinity college, in 1810. Being destined for the church, he entered holy\norders, and was ordained deacon on the 2nd of August, 1812, and priest in 1813.\n\nHis first services, in connection with the church, were directed to this diocese, where he officiated as evening lecturer to the cathedral, in 1814. In the same year he received the appointment of rector of Fredericton, New Brunswick, and continued in administering there, until the year 1817, when he was appointed rector of Quebec, and bishop's official. His career henceforward was certainly a brilliant one. His high talents were apparently fully recognized and appreciated; for, in 1821, he became archdeacon, and in 1825 was deputed to proceed to England on church business. During this mission, we believe, he received the degree of D.D. Shortly after he returned he was made examining chaplain to his lordship, Bishop Stewart; at whose desire he again proceeded to England, in 1835, on business connected with the great clergy reserves' question, and while there he was, on the 14th February, 1836, consecrated bishop of Montreal; this high honor, however his lordship would have declined, had it not been for the earnest and repeated solicitations of Bishop Stewart. The most active part of his clerical career now commenced. He had the entire ecclesiastical charge of Lower Canada under his control, Bishop Stewart retaining only Upper Canada, so that all the labors in Canada, appertaining to the Church of England, fell on Bishop Mountain's shoulders. He had hardly been settled in his new bishopric, when Bishop Stewart, long subject to ill health, retired from Canada altogether, and Dr. Mountain administered both the bishoprics of Quebec and Montreal, as also of Western Canada, and the north-west district, as far as Red River settlement, and that which at present constitutes the bishopric of Prince Rupert's Land. He continued thus situated from 1836 to 1839, when the diocese of Toronto was established, and the Right Reverend John Strachan appointed thereto. He then continued bishop of Quebec and Montreal until 1850, when the Right Reverend Dr. Fulford was appointed to the latter diocese. Thus it will be seen, what a large tract of country was under his jurisdiction for a lengthened time, and some judgment may be formed of the magnitude of his cares and labors, and how excellently he managed all. Indeed, his active mind was always occupied with his ecclesiastic charge, and his attention was continually engaged with the great responsibilities imposed upon him. Few will dispute that scarcely ever has it fallen to the lot of a colonial bishop to have so extensive a diocese. How exceedingly laborious must have been the travelling east and west, and far west, when steamboats or railroads were not known.\n\nIn 1850, when the diocese had become actually too large to administer under his unsided hands, and when Dr. Fulford was appointed to Montreal, Bishop Mountain assumed his present title of\nbishop of Quebec, and his present diocese is still a very considerable one, seeing that it runs from the Eastern Townships down to the extreme end of Gasp\u00e9, on the southern shore of the St. Lawrence, and to Labrador on the northern.\n\nIn 1844 his lordship visited Red River, which was a long and toilsome journey in those days. On his trip thither he was inspired by the beauty and solemnity of the picturesque scenery abounding on his way, and it was on that occasion that he wrote many of those admired pieces contained in his Songs of the Wilderness, published in London, 1846.\n\nIn 1853, he visited England to meet the bishop of Australia and confer on subjects of synodical action in colonial churches. On this occasion he received the degree of D.C.L. at Oxford. He visited the Magdalen Islands in 1850-3-6-9; and in his present advanced age of seventy-two, this year, we find the venerable old gentleman travelling down to the cold and rigid regions of Labrador, for the good of his church, furnishing significant proof of what he has done, and how much he has the welfare of it at heart.\n\nHe is well and deservedly remembered by many for the active part he took in ministering to the fever-stricken emigrants at Grosse Isle, in 1849, where he served, taking the place of his son (Rev. A. W. Mountain,) as also during the fearful time of the cholera of 1832-4. To him disease had no terrors, no dangers. In the administration of his holy office he was regardless of all things save his duty.\n\nBishop Mountain is also the founder of Bishop's college, Lennoxville, and of the Church Society, organizations for the completion of which he had to labor long and faithfully. He must be exceedingly gratified to see them in their present flourishing condition, and compare them with what they were a few years since.\n\nWe may mention here as an exemplification of what noble and endearing qualities his character, his piety, and his zeal are constituted, that ambition or longing for worldly distinctions or emoluments does not essentially belong to him. He has spent a large portion of his income in behalf of our Canadian church, and in relieving the distressed. When the Metropolitan See of Canada was offered to him a short time since, he respectfully declined the honor; he was advanced in years, and he would not accept the office when he could not be able to perform the duties appertaining to it. He is acknowledged to be most learned and highly gifted, as his numerous charges, sermons and addresses will prove. And it is almost needless to add that he is much loved and venerated throughout his diocese. When his venerable and slightly bended figure ascends the pulpit, a circumstance now less frequently witnessed than formerly, he attracts universal attention, and during his discourse is listened to by all. His earnest and pathetic voice and manner impress a deep conviction of his zeal and earnestness.\nRIGHT HON. THE EARL OF ELGIN, K.T., G.C.B.\n\nThe Right Honorable James Bruce, Earl of Elgin and Kincardine, Baron Bruce of Kinloss and of Torry, in the peerage of Scotland, and Baron Elgin of Elgin, in that of the United Kingdom, is of the noble house, which is chief of the Royal Scottish family of Bruce. Of his immediate progenitors, the first peer was Sir Edward Bruce of Kinloss, who was appointed a Lord of Session, in 1597, and was accredited by James VI. in 1600 to the court of Elizabeth, to congratulate her on the suppression of Essex's rebellion, and, by his excellent diplomacy, did so much to pave the way to a peaceable succession by the Scottish Monarch to the English throne, that on his return he was created a peer of Scotland, in 1601, as Baron Bruce, of Kinloss, in the county of Elgin. Accompanying King James to England, on his accession, Lord Bruce was made a privy councillor and master of the rolls. He was succeeded one after the other by two of his sons, the latter of whom, Thomas, the third baron, was created in 1633, Earl of Elgin, and an English peer, as Baron Bruce, of Whorlton, in the county of York. The fourth earl died, without surviving male issue, in 1747, and the family honors reverted to his relative and namesake, Charles, Earl of Kincardine, a descendant of the third son of Edward, Lord Bruce above mentioned, in whom the two dignities were united. He was succeeded on his death, in 1771, by his eldest son, William Robert, who died in a few months, and whose Countess filled the office of governess to the Princess Charlotte of Wales. The title devolved on his brother, Thomas, well known as the nobleman, who, while ambassador extraordinary in Turkey, collected and transported to England the series of relics of ancient sculpture, now forming part of the treasures of the British Museum, under the name of the Elgin Marbles. His lordship married, secondly, in 1810, Elizabeth, youngest daughter of James Townsend Oswald, Esquire, of Dunnikeir, Fifeshire, of which marriage the present peer was the eldest son, having been born in 1811. He completed his education at Christ church, Oxford, where he was first class in classics in 1832, and was subsequently a fellow of Mereton college. In 1841, he married Elizabeth Mary, only child of Charles Lennox Cumming Bruce, M.P., who died in 1849. In 1841, he was elected member for Southampton, but did not long occupy that position, as in November of that year, owing to the death of his father, he succeeded to the title.\nIn March, 1842, the Earl of Derby, then Lord Stanley, and secretary-of-state for the colonies, appointed him governor of Jamaica, and he carried on the government of that colony with great success during a very critical and troubled period of its history. In 1846, Lord Elgin was promoted to the governor-generalship of Canada, succeeding Lord Metcalfe, whom he had also followed at Jamaica. The admirable manner in which he conducted the affairs of this great dependency, is well known and fully recognized, both in England and this country, Lord Elgin having obtained the credit of having consolidated and united the somewhat discordant political and social elements of the two provinces, of which this country is composed, eradicated many evils and abuses, and placed the affairs of the province in the most perfect and prosperous condition. Indeed, his lordship is justly recognized as one of the best and ablest of the governors that have guided the destinies of this great country. His services here entitled him to a large share of our gratitude, and his name to be enshrined on the brightest page of our history, if we were only to speak of the great benefits of the reciprocity treaty with the United States, which assuredly owes its existence to his great genius and ability, but almost everything we witness in Canada of any greatness, bears some impress of his fostering care and management: the public works, the post-office, the clergy reserves, the navigation laws, the normal and model schools of the country, agriculture and agricultural societies, and exhibitions, all these have been in some way connected with his lordship's government, are the productions of his noble mind; or we are indebted for their existence to the powerful party which Lord Elgin called into office to administer the affairs of the country. As to the rebellion losses bill, which unhappily caused such deep and bitter feeling to be displayed, we are confident, that at this present day, the very men who were loudest in condemning him for the course he pursued, would now that time has intervened, and they have been enabled calmly and dispassionately to survey the bearings of the case, be the very first to applaud his resolution and determination in carrying out a measure, which had been resolved on by his ministry, and demanded by a large portion of the people of the country. This was the only time and the only measure, that caused Lord Elgin to be at variance with any part of the community. The result has proved that he was right; his policy was supported by the Imperial Government and the Queen, when he tendered his resignation, in consequence of the riots and scenes which took place, and the public feeling exhibited against him, they desired him to remain and govern the country for a short time longer. He did remain, he obeyed the call of his country, and conformed to the Queen's command, and his remaining produced the happiest results for the country's welfare, and the people's good; so much so indeed, that\non his departure, the whole population of the province expressed a general regret that he could not remain always with us. A high sense of duty, and a prompting that his services would before long be required in a higher and more important capacity, and perhaps the thought of future honor and preferment induced him to leave us in the latter part of the year 1854, and return to England. Lord Elgin took no prominent part in public affairs at home; on one occasion he addressed the House of Lords with very great ability and power, during a debate of interest and importance. The selection of Lord Elgin as ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary for the arrangement of the controversy between Great Britain and China, was what might have been expected, his lordship's talent for dealing with troublous and complicated exigencies having been twice tested and approved. The course taken by him in sending the troops, destined for the Chinese expedition to Calcutta, on his learning of the outbreak of the mutiny in India, and his proceeding thither himself, to afford his aid and counsel, have been fully appreciated. His subsequent management of the diplomatic proceedings, which terminated in a treaty with China, was quite equal to the occasion, and would have had a different result if one of the contracting parties had been governed by the rule of conduct which prevails in almost every country in the world, except the Celestial Empire. His subsequent proceedings (after signing the Chinese treaty), in proceeding to Japan, and boldly entering the harbor of Jeddo, from which foreigners had always been rigidly excluded, and obtaining important commercial privileges for his countrymen by the treaty which he concluded with the Japanese on August 26, 1858, is deserving of the highest praise and honor, and drew forth the encomiums of the whole people. He returned to England, in May, 1859, and a short time after, Lord Palmerston, being called on for the second time to form a government, Lord Elgin became a member of the cabinet, holding the somewhat incongruous office, considering the antecedents of his public life, of postmaster general. This however he vacated in the beginning of 1860, to proceed a second time to China as our plenipotentiary; in the passage out as such, he and Baron Gros, had a very miraculous escape in the Malabar, which was wrecked when near India, losing all their personal effects, besides their credentials, &c.\n\nHis late services in the east, and the vigorous and determined manner in which he proceeded to conclude a second and more lasting treaty with China, are too highly appreciated and known for us to recapitulate. Let it suffice, that the whole nation rang with praises of his name, which was extolled and eulogized in the highest degree. He returned to England, only a short time since, and does not as yet hold any public appointment; but it is generally believed, nay it was publicly announced, only a short\ntime since, that he would succeed Earl Canning, as the next governor-general of India.\n\nLord Elgin is a knight of the Thistle and a civil grand cross of the Bath. In 1846, he was married, for the second time, to Lady Maria Louisa, eldest surviving daughter of the late Earl of Durham, and has issue several children.\n\nWe append to this brief sketch of this great nobleman's career, the speech of the Lord Provost of Glasgow, delivered in 1856, on the occasion of the noble earl being presented with the freedom of that city. It is a just exposition of his services:\n\nThe Lord Provost occupied the chair. On rising he was received with great applause. He spoke as follows: \"My lord and gentlemen,\u2014It is only, I believe, because of the exigencies of the public service that the citizens of Glasgow have missed the opportunity of welcoming, about this time, and enrolling among themselves as an honorary member, a gallant general\u2014a native of this district\u2014whose ability and important services are connected with events that have affected various countries in Europe, as well as our vast empire in Asia. I am sure, gentlemen, you feel as I do, that no sword of honor was ever more worthily won by a commander than that one will be, which, as a candid homage on the part of this community, will soon be sent to Sir Colin Campbell. May the veteran still have long life to wear it! It will never be drawn from its scabbard without advantage to our common country. But, my lord, inasmuch as the extensive dominion, to which it is our privilege to belong, has many and very various exigencies, so does she open to her sons various modes of usefulness, and divers paths to renown. I am not here, certainly, to institute comparisons, nor to weigh in a balance the merits of services, each of which can boast of a long succession of illustrious names, who have never stood toward each other in an attitude of jealousy, but have been rather all spurred on by the honorable emulation to deserve well of the state. Nevertheless, gentlemen, you will permit me, as a civilian, to say, that I would not myself be disposed to rank even the perfect commander\u2014the man who has done the most to widen the limits of the British Empire\u2014above him who, by precept and example, has taught us the difficult art of governing with beneficence. Of this, my lord, at least, I am sure, there is not a man in this large assembly\u2014there is not an intelligent man in our community\u2014who does not heartily join the corporation in offering homage to services like yours\u2014services which, in every respect, have thrown so much light on the true principles of colonial government, which in both instances were given to your country, on very critical occasions, which are associated in the one case with the only gleam of prosperity that has recently visited our principal island in the West Indies, and which, in the other case, issued in rescuing one of the most important possessions of the\nBritish Crown, from confusion and disaffection\u2014in implanting loyalty where you found faction and distrust; and in establishing that security for the future, which, in countries belonging to the Anglo-Saxon race, can only be obtained from the consolidation of sound constitutional government within, and the establishment of generous and just commercial relations with foreign states. If I take occasion, in this meeting, gentlemen, to enter somewhat in detail, on the special character of Lord Elgin's services, you will not suppose, I am sure, that I imagine these services to be unknown, far less that I indulge the presumption of attempting to utter some mere eulogy on his lordship. I shall trespass on your time and attention with a widely different object. I wish the whole country to be aware what those principles of government are which this second city of the empire has seen fit to stamp with the highest approbation it can bestow; and I wish it further to be understood, on the part of our colonies, how their permanent connection with Great Britain may (in the present circumstances of the world) be made practically to comport with their own highest welfare. At the period when Lord Elgin\u2014then a very young man\u2014was named governor of Jamaica, the British West Indies had in no way escaped from the uncertainties and embarrassments inseparable from negro emancipation. His lordship had to contend, indeed, with two causes of evil\u2014one of which had become almost chronic; while the other, as we all trust only temporary, was also very serious. The first of these causes lay in the very peculiar constitution of the Legislative Assembly of Jamaica. You are probably aware, gentlemen, that so far from the power of the colonial legislature being confined within the sphere of duties occupying our House of Commons, it engrossed a large share of what belongs at home to the executive; and the consequence has always been, in times of financial and commercial pressure, disastrous collisions between the assembly and the governor\u2014antagonism instead of co-operation and confidence\u2014and on occasions, a state of affairs so grievous, that at a recent period, a British ministry thought itself justified in going the perilous length of proposing to suspend the Assembly's functions. Now, I shall say that if this case had always been met by the prudence and sagacity manifested by Lord Elgin, no such remedy would even have been thought of, for no crisis so painful could ever have occurred. It appears from his lordship's despatches that from the moment he set foot on the island he had resolved that no conceivable exigency should induce him to strain any attribute of his office one hair-breadth beyond the line of clear and recognized legality. Be the limitations of that office inconvenient as they might, or however unworkable and prejudicial, the unwonted functions of that Assembly, it was enough for him that the existing condition of things had been recognised by imperial statute, and he determined that, as long as he ruled, no fear or\ndistrust should excite the Assembly, that directly or indirectly, he would encroach by one iota on its privileges. I need not say gentlemen, that the maxim I have now alluded to ought to be revered as a golden rule, by every administrator within our whole empire. It is the only maxim on the ground of which we can demand in return the confidence of our colonists, and their aid in removing what is defective from their peculiar institutions. It is not a maxim inconsistent with every necessary firmness on the part of the governor, in asserting the rights and the dignity with which his office has been surrounded by British law\u2014a truth most fully established by Lord Elgin himself, when, after his transference to a higher and still more arduous position, he showed that no responsibility laid on by law, would find him inadequate when resolution was necessary\u2014I mean when in our great North American dominions, through a rare combination of wise boldness and firm moderation, he conducted a large state through the throes of a virtual revolution, without requiring to overlook or abridge the constitutional liberties of a single man. The success, gentlemen, of this policy in Jamaica was complete; confidence between governor and assembly became the order of the day, instead of the old distrust; and his lordship obtained thereupon the full influence due to an enlightened man, in his high station, to aid by his counsel, and even to guide indirectly, those all-important movements required to constitute anew the industrial relations of the West Indies. I am not disposed certainly to enter now on the vexed and difficult question to which I have just referred; but I think I shall be borne out in my assertion, that a statement of every sound principle, on which as a basis their relations can be reconstructed\u2014that every temperate warning against confidence in schemes alike impracticable and delusive may be found in the despatches of Lord Elgin. The period of his government, I have called a gleam of prosperity to Jamaica. Truer conceptions as to the way in which they could work together for their common good were taken possession of both by planter and negro; the exports of the island were accordingly gradually but steadily increasing, and I believe the progress would have been uninterrupted, had not commercial interests there been obliged to undergo so soon that other serious, but, I believe, inevitable, overturn, occasioned by the famous sugar bills. This fine colony has indeed been severely tried. But, for one, I shall not distrust the elasticity of her resources. Through the energy of the system so auspiciously commenced before 1848, she must revive again; and she will revive, as the noble lord believed and predicted, through the influence of capital in economising labor, and through the influence of the demand for skilled labor in elevating the station, by increasing the reward, and stimulating the best ambition of the laborer. But, gentlemen, I must hasten to Lord Elgin's career in\nCanada\u2014a career which, even in times much more prolific of great men than ours, would have made the reputation of any statesman. I have no hesitation, gentlemen, in venturing the assertion, that the period of Lord Elgin's administration of our greatest North American dependency, must rank in history, as the epoch of the establishment there of constitutional practices and law. I need not, I am aware, recall to the audience I now address either the fact of that unhappy Canadian rebellion, or those remarkable efforts, by an illustrious nobleman, towards whom the affections of the city of Glasgow are not now expressed for the first time\u2014I mean the late Lord Durham\u2014efforts to discover and explain principles, by which all rival interests in that extensive territory might be conciliated, and disaffection finally destroyed. The social disorganization consequent on the rebellion, rendered it impossible, however, for a time to bring those principles into action. Lord Durham's successor, the late Lord Sydenham, shrank from the effort; and even Lord Metcalfe, the next governor, was obliged to trust for the support of his authority to his alliance with one political party. The honor of proclaiming practically to the Canadas that, as the Crown of England knows nothing of party within the kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, so it desires to bear itself with impartial sovereignty through all its empire\u2014this high privilege, gentlemen, was reserved for Lord Elgin. I consider it extremely fortunate that our colonial secretary at the time was Earl Grey. We may think Earl Grey has erred sometimes; but it is impossible to doubt that, in his integrity and zeal to uphold uninjured the cause of British constitutional liberty, the son has never been unworthy of his renowned sire. Sustained, unwaveringly, by this nobleman, Lord Elgin boldly threw off the shackles which had confined the sympathies and impaired the influence of all former governors. He emphatically told the people and politicians of Canada, that, as has long been the case here, they must fight for ascendancy in their free Assembly; and that, for himself, he had to look to Canada, as a whole, and not to any section or division of it. You recollect, gentlemen, that famous saying of Sir Robert Peel\u2014'The battle of the constitution must be lost or won in the polling booths.' For the first time this was effectively proclaimed in Canada. Well, as we all remember, the old party\u2014the former ascendancy party\u2014was placed in a clear minority in the Canadian Assembly, Lord Elgin did not attempt, as his predecessors would have done, either to bolster up the minority, or to overlook their defeat; but acting as Queen Victoria has ever acted, he formed a new ministry out of the party that had prevailed. I shall not go, my lords, into statements concerning the painful discontents that ensued, aggravated, unfortunately, by the concomitance of a terrible commercial crisis; but you will permit me to offer my humble tribute to the\nmanly forbearance, and that high confidence in the ultimate success of right and justice, which then animated you. Riots, than which many less ones have been the occasion of coup d'\u00e9tat, your lordship quelled by the efficacy of the ordinary law. And your triumph as been such as few statesmen are privileged, within so short a space, to realize or enjoy. You had the gratification to receive afterwards from the mayor and chief citizens of Montreal, the most impressive testimony they could bear to the wisdom of a course which resulted at first in what they esteemed a deep humiliation; and you realized yet more\u2014you felt entitled to say, on bidding farewell to the provinces, that there was no longer a British party, or a French party, no longer a party of patriots and a party of annexationists, but a great, prosperous and united population, gladly acknowledging the benefit secured to them by their connection with a parent state, which neither seeks nor can retain authority, unless through the influence and diffusion of her own beneficent institutions. But, gentlemen, it fell to Lord Elgin to accomplish yet more. Not only was he the instrument of what I may justly call nationalizing the Canadas, but he also had the good fortune to bestow on their external relations that established security, without which internal progress is not possible in any state. The only country with which our North American colonies were likely to come into collision is, of course, that powerful republic now stretching from the southern bank of the St. Lawrence almost to the Isthmus; and I dare say, I need not quote multitudes of facts to convince you, that when a quarrel with neighbors can be picked, our trans-atlantic cousins are pretty apt to find out the way of doing it. The fact in this case is, that a sort of smouldering hostility had existed so long between the two states, as to have become nearly permanent\u2014their peace being little more than an armed suspicion; and Lord Elgin may tell us, as he has already done in his despatches, how fatal was such a condition of affairs to the progress of order and industry in Canada, how it encouraged the disaffected, alarmed the timid, and impaired upon change, the security of investment. Gentlemen\u2014thanks to our noble visitor\u2014this condition if irritation has passed for ever, the true questions that gave occasion to its activity, having received at his hands their definite settlement. The dispute about the boundary exists no longer; and the other cause of perpetual uneasiness, and which even more than the former menaced collision, our ever-recurring quarrel about the fisheries\u2014has been removed by a commercial treaty, reciprocity, conceived and carried out, on our part at least, in the spirit of the best and most liberal policy. Is it any marvel, then, that travellers are now telling us of the recent astonishing strides of the Canadas in every line of social improvement? Is it astonishing that, instead of a sluggish and distracted country, that used to offer a humbling contrast to the\nstir and energy of the States, we find a territory teeming with enterprise, augmenting in wealth at a rate at least equal to the highest known with the Union? External dangers annihilated, internal animosities removed, constitutional liberty confirmed, in its broadest acceptation, what remained for our hardy colonists but to turn their energy to the culture of their inexhaustible soil, to that extension of a trade now secured from the influence of fluctuating laws, and to build up a state which, for order and every element of high civilization, shall be worthy the parent from which it sprung\u2014that parent whose greatest glory is, that on no spot of its wide domain has slavery a resting place for the sole of its tainted foot! Happy for our countrymen in Canada that, when they entered on a career so auspicious, they had among them a nobleman like Lord Elgin to counsel and hie them on! No agency of any value in furtherance of moral and material progress appear to have escaped his attention or to have grown feeble for want of countenance at his hands. If I were to inform you of his practical efforts to improve agriculture, of his earnest encouragement of canals and railroads, I shall only weary you. Canada likewise owes to his administration a boon we have not succeeded in gaining for ourselves, viz., a system of public education that in nowise intermeddles with the rights of conscience; and all those vexing ecclesiastical questions, which ever and anon start up under various forms to perplex and trouble us, have, in the settlement of the clergy reserves, received their quietus. 'When' says his lordship, in one of his last despatches, the \"irritation with which transitions are unhappily attended shall have entirely passed away, it is not improbable the Canadians will acknowledge the advantage they have derived from the steady application of sound principles to the administration of their affairs, and that they will look back with satisfaction to the period at which they began to feel that the practical interests they have in common are more important than those which divide them, and that faithful allegiance to the crown is not inconsistent with the exercise of those faculties and the indulgence of those aspirations which, in communities as in individuals, are proper to maturity.' We, gentlemen, shall not repeat this modest hope, we shall rather, with one voice, assure his lordship that services like his are already recognised on both sides of the Atlantic, and entitle him to be called a lasting benefactor of his race. I trust, Lord Elgin, that I shall not be thought chargeable with the presumption of supposing the bare outline I have now given of the events characterising your lordship's administration amounts to a full representation of what this country owes to you. But, gentlemen, I am sure I have stated enough to entitle me to ask from every one now present a most candid approval of the step taken by our corporation. My lord, it is an old saying\u2014I trust\nnot quite a true one\u2014that gratitude, in the common acceptation, means to some extent thankfulness for favors that have been received, but also, and much more, the expression of an expectation that many more favorable are to be received. I do not like the moralist who gave this definition; neither do I like his morality. Nevertheless, I cannot conceal from your lordship that part of the enthusiasm which, welcoming you as an honorary Glasgow burgess, rests on the conviction that you are destined to perform other and still greater services to the British empire, whatever may be the occasion or the theatre of these services\u2014whether as ruler of some wide and more important domain than even our North American possessions, whether as a colonial minister, with the power to enforce the general adoption of principles whose value you have proved, or in whatever capacity it may seem advisable to the crown to require your efforts\u2014we are confident that these efforts will be most ably given and expended, in promotion of the great cause of progress and liberty. It is impossible, gentlemen, on an occasion like this, to avoid all reference to the momentous crisis in which we find at present European affairs. The contest, as I understand it, on our parts, is on a great scale; and, with a few necessary differences, virtually that in which Lord Elgin fought and triumphed in Canada. We are not seeking to interfere with the internal affairs, or the natural powers of any state; but we are in arms to declare that the overwhelming ambition of Russia must cease to weigh as an influence on other countries, to check the advancement of popular rights there, and to paralyze their energies in commerce. I confess I am beginning to be doubtful if the period of settlement has yet arrived; but of one thing I am very sure, that the enlightened and recent governor-general of the Canadas will be found one of the men who will not counsel the laying down our arms, unless the treaty of peace will justify the war, unless security for the future shall become part and parcel of the public law of Europe. My lord and gentlemen, I have too long detained you. I have now only to request, in the name of the corporation, that your lordship will accept the box and the burgess ticket it contains. You will not value it slightly, seeing that it is a tribute paid to you by a city which may fairly rank as the second in the empire\u2014a city whose interests in all that concerns the prosperity of the empire is therefore very great, and which, as I trust I may be permitted to add, has intelligence enough to enable it to estimate rightly the services of men who, in their efforts to promote that prosperity, have labored with good effect, and deserved well.\u201d (His lordship, during the delivery of his speech, was frequently interrupted by bursts of applause.)\nANDREW STUART, Esq.\n\nThe following notice of this distinguished jurist is from the Quebec Gazette, of 13th March, 1840:\n\nThe decease of the late Andrew Stuart, Her Majesty's solicitor-general in this province, has left a blank so difficult to be filled up in the public mind, that it is humbly conceived, some further tribute than has yet appeared to his memory, will meet with a willing reception.\n\nMr. Stuart was the son of the late Reverend John Stuart, D.D., and minister of Kingston, Upper Canada, a gentleman well known and highly respected in these provinces, and particularly noted for his generous patronage of humble merit, and his zealous efforts to promote the cause of education. His son, who is the subject of these remarks, was born at Kingston in 1786. He received his classical instruction under the Venerable Archdeacon Strachan, then residing at Cornwall, now bishop of Toronto, with whom he held a most friendly correspondence to the period of his death. His proficiency in his studies, if we may judge by the correct habits of thinking, to which it was the prelude, must have been conspicuous. He afterwards continued to prosecute his studies at Union college, Schenectady.\n\nHis commencement of the study of the law took place in 1802, and his admission to the bar, on the 5th of November, 1807. He rose almost immediately into extensive practice, his success being secured by three of the greatest qualities a lawyer can possess, extensive knowledge both of the principles and of the practice of the law, convincing and overpowering eloquence, and the strictest regard to the interest of his client. In 1810, he defended Mr. Justice Bodard, then exposed to a state prosecution. From that time to the period of his death, his assistance was sought for in every difficult and important case that occurred.\n\nHis pleading was conducted with great eloquence, sometimes highly impassioned. He was remarkable for the use he made of general principles. It was a maxim with him, and which he professed to have derived from Aristotle, of whom he was an enthusiastic admirer, \"that all knowledge consists in universals.\" Having once established his general position in some undeniable principle of reason, he seemed to come to his conclusion with irresistible conviction, as to a corollary of necessary and unavoidable consequence. Yet on proper occasions he had the happy art of introducing those clear and palpable topics, that rivet attention and touch all hearts. His argument in 1832, against the rights of\ncolonial assemblies to commit for breach of privilege in case of libel, is a beautiful specimen of forensic eloquence.\n\nHis jurisprudential studies were not confined to the laws of the country, or to those which regulated the decisions of its courts. He studied law as a science, founded in reason and governing man in all stages of civilization; and took delight in tracing the principles that have directed the various systems of legislation that have prevailed in different periods.\n\nAmong the legal objects extending beyond the usual limits, that claimed his attention, was the boundary question, so long the questio vexatissima between the British and American governments. His pamphlet on this subject evinces great research, and exemplifies those extended views with which he contemplated every subject to which he at any time bent his attention. It was first published in Quebec in 1830, and again in Montreal, in 1839.\n\nHis attachment to justice, and consequently to establish constitutional law, was ardent and invariable. He could not be drawn aside from that sacred path, as far as his judgment could mark its course, by the authority of men in power, or by the prejudices, the murmurs of those who happen to be the dispensers of popular applause. He considered that to be the only free state in which law was the supreme power, and in which its authority was uncontrollable.\n\nIn October, 1838, he was nominated solicitor-general of the province, by his Excellency the Earl of Durham. Upon receiving this appointment, he removed his residence to Montreal; but was prevented by ill health from taking any very conspicuous part in the business before the courts. On this occasion he may be said to have terminated his professional career.\n\nMr. Stuart entered public life in 1815, when he was returned as one of the members for the lower town of Quebec. He represented the same respectable constituency in two succeeding parliaments. He afterwards represented the upper town, and continued to do so in every parliament, except one, till the suspension of the constitution in 1838. To one of these, he was elected in his absence.\n\nDuring the course of his public life, he took part in the discussion of every important question that arose, in a period of peculiar interest and pregnant with important consequences to the future prosperity of this province. He sat on every committee, in which any important topic was to be discussed, or any difficult question to be investigated. His vast and varied information furnished assistance in all these inquiries, and he in no case shrunk from the communication of his ideas, either from the inconvenience of long and tedious attendance, or the obloquy it might raise against him amongst those who differed from him in opinion.\n\nMr. Stuart's views were, on all occasions, those of a liberal mind. He delighted to unfold them to the attention of others, both from\nthe thorough conviction which he entertained of their truth, and still more from the enthusiastic persuasion that they were inseparable from the best interests of society. His arguments were founded on those extended principles which ever are, and ever must be true. He raised his voice with equal fervor and equal sincerity, against the abuses practised by men in power, and the encroachments of popular violence. To neither would he yield the slightest deference, beyond that which was sanctioned by justice and constitutional right.\n\nAt the time of the general election in 1834, he made at the hustings a candid and manly avowal of the principles which had uniformly guided his public conduct. His speech on that occasion is accurately reported in the Quebec Gazette, of the 22nd of October of that year, and well deserves a perusal, from the independent spirit which it not only breathes, but proves by a reference to his past conduct. After a modest, yet dignified apology for speaking of himself, unavoidable on such an occasion: \"Never,\" says he, \"when the property or the liberty of the subject had been infringed by men in power, have I shrunk from giving my entire energies, such as they were, to the defence and relief of the sufferers.\" He then proceeds to remind the electors of his labors in the house, in regard to the abuses that had existed in the granting of lands, to the improper combination of the legislative, executive, and judicial functions in the same persons, and to the protracted diversion of the Jesuits' estates, from their just and legitimate objects. He states his determination to be, what it always had been, to pursue the same course by just, lawful, and constitutional means; but at no time by violence or passion. \"Much,\" he further states, \"as I esteem the good opinion of my fellow citizens, and the honor of representing them in provincial parliament, I will not purchase even these boons at the cost of ceasing to deserve them.\"\n\nIn 1832, he published in Montreal an octavo volume, under the title of \"A Review of the proceedings of the Legislature in the Session of 1831.\" This work is replete with profound views of government, and contained ample warning of the perilous encroachments of the misguided democratic influence then evidently drawing to a crisis.\n\nThe election of 1834, already mentioned, led to the rejection of almost all the candidates favorable to the constitution as it then existed, and to the connexion of these provinces with the United Kingdom. Such a state of things naturally led the friends of these important privileges to consider what was to be done to preserve them. A public dinner was given at Quebec, in honor of Mr. Stuart, and other candidates who had been rejected, for their constitutional and loyal conduct. The interchange of sentiments which took place on this occasion, gave rise to the formation of\nthe constitutional association, an institution fraught with many important results in the future history of this country. Mr. Stuart was elected the first chairman of the association, and took a prominent part in all the proceedings in which it engaged. A similar association was formed in Montreal, and by the spirit which pervaded both, much was successfully done to defeat the virulent domination of the opposite party.\n\nIn the spring of 1838, he was sent to England at the instance of the association, for the purpose of forwarding the re-union of the provinces. He returned in September of the same year, thus concluding the last public mission in which he was engaged.\n\nMr. Stuart's literary attainments were of a high order. His taste in the fine arts, just; his acquaintance with the literature of the day, extensive. He possessed an intimate acquaintance with ancient learning, especially with the works of the great model of Roman eloquence. To peruse and digest the rhetorical works of Cicero, was his greatest amusement. He had thoroughly considered both the precepts which they contain, and the principles in human nature on which those are founded.\n\nIt is natural for every one, possessing such a taste and such predilections as his, to desire not only to know, but to inspect societies of different forms and attainments, and to view the venerable remains of ancient art and grandeur. Accordingly yielding to this very reasonable inclination, he left Quebec in July, 1824. After visiting the most noted objects in the United Kingdom, he spent the winter in the south of France, and in Italy, and returned to Quebec in January, 1826. It is easy to see, that such a tour must have yielded him infinite gratification; and those who knew him, knew that it added another charm to his conversation, which had, at all times, been highly attractive.\n\nThe attractions of his conversation formed, indeed, one of the marked features of his character. To pass them over in this place, would be unpardonable. His habit of theorizing accompanied his observations, even in his freest and most unguarded moments, the moments when all effort is felt to be unnecessary; and, being always on the side of humanity and good feeling, inevitably fascinated every heart. His observations were founded on the universal principles of human nature, and found an echo in every mind.\n\nTo all institutions promoting literary purposes, Mr. Stuart was an ardent friend, and among others, to the Literary and Historical Society of Quebec. He entertained an earnest and a kind of paternal solicitude for its advancement. Besides promoting its interest, by his personal influence, he communicated to it, or read before it, a great number of interesting papers, and exerted himself with great zeal to forward the publication of its transactions. He found the means of obtaining those funds from the\nlegislature, which have enabled it to publish several original documents, procured from various quarters in Europe and America, illustrative of the previous history of this country.\n\nThe papers which he supplied to the society's transactions, are indicative of an original, and in some degree, a romantic mind. The first is to be found in the first volume, page fifty-two, and is entitled \"Notes on the Saguenay Country.\" His mind had been long impressed with the magnificent scenery of that portion of the province, and anticipating its future usefulness as a resource for emigration, he delighted in recalling to the view of the existing generation, the purposes to which the first settlers of the country had found it capable of being applied. His next contribution is in the same volume, page one hundred and sixty-seven, on the \"Ancient Etruscans.\" It indicates a vast extent of reading, and acquaintance with authors seldom to be met with, and views that are familiar only to an expanded mind. The last is in the third volume, page three-hundred and sixty-five, entitled \"Detached Thoughts upon the History of Civilization.\" It indicates, like that just mentioned, great comprehension of thought, and a vast extent of reading. Though not finished according to the evident intentions of the author, and rather the opening up only of the subject, it has the effect of fixing the reader's attention upon a number of the most important peculiarities of ancient manners.\n\nAfter what has been said it is almost unnecessary to add, that in private life, he was most strictly honorable, sincere, kind-hearted, generous and friendly. The public life which has been described, could never have arisen out of the opposite disposition. It was the fruit of his prevailing temper of mind, of his constitution and habit of thinking.\n\nIn conclusion it is gratifying to add, that Mr. Stuart was a sincere friend to religion. He spoke at all times with the highest respect of its ministers, its institutions, and its code. He contemplated the truths which it teaches, with the deepest reverence; and looked forward to the closing scene of human existence, with mingled sentiments of reasonable anxiety and enlightened hope.\n\nHe died on the 21st February, 1840. His funeral was followed by a vast concourse of persons, who feelingly deplored the loss they then sustained.\n\nA very numerous meeting of the citizens of Quebec, took place on 22nd April, following, in the reading room of the Exchange, for the purpose of devising means to perpetuate the memory of Mr. Stuart. The meeting was composed of nearly all the influential men of Quebec, of British and Irish origin, then in town, and the greatest unanimity prevailed in a determination to erect some tribute of respect to the memory of one who, for upwards of thirty years, had been the uncompromising advocate of constitutional liberty, and in his private character had endeared himself to a large circle of friends.\nJames H. Kerr, Esquire, was called to the chair, and William Petry, Esquire, acted as secretary. The meeting was addressed by the chairman, on opening, by William Price, Esquire, the Rev. D. Wilkie, H. Lemesurier, Esquire, W. Bristow, Esquire, and Joseph Bouchette, Esquire, surveyor-general of the province; but we have only room for the following beautiful address delivered by the Rev. D. Wilkie:\n\n\"Mr. Chairman,\u2014It is the duty of survivors to remember deceased merit. It is their indispensable duty. On earth, the merit of those who are gone lives in the memory only of the living. If they remember it not, it is gone. The tomb covers it. Oblivion takes possession of it. It is the same as if it had never been.\n\n\"It is the duty of surviving contemporaries to prevent it from thus being forgotten. It is our duty to keep alive the remembrance of exalted minds. It becomes us to think how painful it is thus to pass away from the remembrance of those in whose thoughts we have long lived. How unjust, how ungrateful, to allow the memory of those to perish, whom we have had before us during most of our lives. We cannot feel conscious of having acted with justice or with fairness, if we suffer those to be forgotten who can no longer raise their voice to call our attention, who can no longer find their way into our thoughts, by instructing our understandings or animating our exertions.\n\n\"Mankind, however, are too generous to allow any such oblivion to take place. Every gentleman in the present meeting, I am sure, is too generous and too just to allow it. Indeed, during the lives of those who lived with the deceased, that is impossible. Mr. Stuart will never be forgotten, while any of us are alive, while any who knew him remain. But we cannot forget that we are passing away as he did. It becomes us to provide something that shall outlive ourselves; something that shall call him to remembrance when we too are gone; something which, striking the common eye, shall lead it to consult the less perishable records, in which his thoughts will be found impressed, and his suggestions blended with the reforms he effected, or the improvements to which he gave birth, or the useful institutions which he supported.\n\n\"It is particularly becoming, that those who possessed generous, liberal, and disinterested minds, should receive some such mark of respect as that which this meeting contemplates. Their independent minds, negligent of personal consideration, are ill adapted to obtaining those tangible and grosser rewards, which far inferior, but more compliant minds, find no difficulty in procuring. By pursuing a less disinterested course, it is known to every one, that Mr. Stuart might have realized a splendid fortune. By aiming invariably at the public good, by thinking little of himself, and of personal interest, but much of justice, honor, and the happiness of the country, he missed a great deal of the less noble rewards of a...\"\nworldly prudence; but procured for himself a lasting seat in every generous and honest mind. Of that seat it is fitting that death should not deprive him. Of that seat let not the exit of the generations to which he was known deprive him. It is right and becoming, that his virtuous exertions should be conveyed to the memory of another age at least; it may be hoped, to many remote ages. Indeed, they can never be entirely forgotten. They are impressed on the annals of the age through which he passed. It is for us to embody them, to group them, in some visible shape, such as may strike even the vulgar eye, and concentrate in one view, the sentiments which must otherwise be collected from many hundred pages of multifarious reading. It is fit that we erect a monument to the friend of justice, to the advocate of truth, the constant, the unwearied promoter of education, of emigration, of constitutional government, of everything useful and ornamental to the country.\u201d (The reverend gentleman, on resuming his seat, was loudly cheered.)\n\nThe following resolutions were carried by acclamation:\n\nOn motion of William Price, Esq., seconded by the Hon. J. M. Fraser: That the character, talents, and public spirited conduct of the late Andrew Stuart, Esq., solicitor-general of the province, were so conspicuous as to demand the adoption of means to obtain some lasting tribute to his memory.\n\nOn motion of H. Lemesurier, Esq., seconded by W. Bristow, Esq.: That to serve this important purpose, it will be advisable to erect a tablet or monument, with an inscription expressive of the esteem and admiration in which he was held by his contemporaries.\n\nOn motion of Andrew Paterson, Esq., seconded by John Gilmour, Esq.: That the following gentlemen be named a committee to carry these resolutions into effect, and to obtain subscriptions for the purpose\u2014with power to add to their number:\n\nHon. G. Pemberton, Hon. W. Walker, Hon. J. M. Fraser, Hon. J. Neilson, Rev. D. Wilkie, D. Burnet, J. B. Forsyth, James Gibb, John Munn, H. Atkinson, Peter Patterson, William Phillips, James Rodger, Robert Wood, Henry Black, John Jones, William Patton, James Hunt, R. H. Gairdner, Alexander Simpson, Thomas Paton, Noah Freer, Charles Gethings, William Atkinson, J. G. Heath, H. Gowan, John G. Clapham, J. Bonner, Robert Shaw, Ebenezer Baird, Jer. Leaycraft, H. J. Noad, H. E. Scott, John Brooke, R. Wainwright, George Black, J. H. Kerr, Wm. Petry, Wm. Price, H. Lemesurier, W. Bristow, Andrew Paterson, John Gilmour, Joseph Bouchette.\n\nThe chairman then left the chair, and thanks having been voted to him for his able conduct in presiding, the meeting dispersed.\nCOLONEL GUGY\n\nIs emphatically a gentleman. Of his origin and kinsmen, as connected with Canada, conspicuous notice ought to be taken.\n\nConrad Gugy, an officer in a regiment, which took part in the conquest of Canada, the eldest son of a Swiss officer in the Dutch service, was born at the Hague. At the instance of the authorities of the day, disposing of his commission, he settled in Canada. Educated for the Engineers, and being an accomplished linguist, he was found useful in various ways. At an early period he served as a medium of communication between the Canadians and their British conquerors, who were not so familiar with the French language as their descendants of the present day. His position was one in which he enjoyed the confidence of the government, and possessed considerable influence. He was employed in providing accommodation for the United Empire loyalists, including many Germans and Dutchmen, who fled from the then British provinces at the period of the revolution. He became secretary to the government for one of the divisions of Lower Canada, as well as a member of the Executive and Legislative Councils. He gave proof of his zeal, activity and attachment to English institutions by travelling upwards of a hundred miles, in the wretched roads of that day, to vote in favor of the ordinance for trial by jury in certain cases. His death was the result of his zeal. To build the houses and barracks then instantly needed, a Captain Twiss had been directed to cause a quantity of timber and plank to be floated down the river Machiche. A mill dam had been constructed across the river, and on being consulted, Conrad Gugy repairing to the spot, saw that the obstacle might be surmounted. The timber accordingly reached its destination; and the officer charged with the service left the country. Conrad Gugy remained; and, an action being brought against him for damages, he was proved to have raised his hand, and was understood to have thus indicated the spot at which the difficulty could be overcome. It was the first trial by jury in Lower Canada, and the jurors (it was then said to punish him for siding with the English in the introduction of their institutions) assessed the damages at an enormous and ruinous amount. This verdict was subsequently set aside, but too late to save the life of the defendant. The verdict was no sooner announced than he gently made his way through the crowd, and, going to his lodgings, without speaking one word, entered his room and locked the door. On its being burst open next morning, his cravat was found neatly folded upon\nan arm of the sofa, upon which he lay in a reclining position, stone dead. He had not committed suicide; but, proud and sensitive, he was absolutely killed by the humiliation of such a verdict.\n\nHe was a man of a large heart, and hospitable to a fault. In those days neither steamers, stages or taverns existed, and in his house travelers, almost without distinction, were received and hospitably entertained. Like Alferi, he loved horses, and occasionally made a present of one to mark the pleasure which he had taken in the society of an occasional guest.\n\nHe had chosen the English service, but Bartholomew Gugy, his younger brother, entered that of the French king's. He acquired some distinction, was knighted, and, at the breaking out of the revolution, was colonel commandant of the second regiment of Swiss Guards in the French service. In Paris, he married a French lady of a Huguenot family, who eventually died at an advanced age in Montreal. His son, the late Mr. Sheriff Gugy, of Montreal, was a lieutenant in his father's regiment. Both were offered advancement in the revolutionary army, and most brilliant prospects were held out to them. With the proverbial fidelity of the Swiss, they declined those offers, and the colonel had the honor of marching his regiment through a great part of France into Switzerland without losing a man. Considering that his men were disarmed, exposed to all manner of seductions, supplied with wine and allured by women, this feat certainly indicated the respect and regard in which he was held. On reaching the Swiss frontier, finding himself penniless, he resolved to sell his horses, and requested a non-commissioned officer of his regiment to enquire for purchasers. One of them, as it happened, a French officer of cavalry, wished to buy. At this juncture the late sheriff, then on the spot, knowing the temper of his father, communicated to the latter the name and antecedents of the French captain. \"He shall not have my horse,\" said Colonel Gugy; and, to make certainty doubly sure, he shot the animal. This French captain was \"Jerome,\" the servant at the inn at Varennes, who had recognized and betrayed the king, Louis XVI. This act, by which Colonel Gugy deprived himself of the price of the horse, was the result of his loyalty, and a sudden outburst of detestation for the character of a traitor.\n\nMrs. Gugy was old enough to have conversed with some of the victims of the revocation of the edict of Nantes; and she described with great feeling the various modes of persecution to which the unhappy Huguenots were subjected.\n\nConrad Gugy had acquired some property in Canada, the life interest in which he left to his brother. The latter, on leaving the French service, embarked at London for this country, and died here. His son, born in Paris, (the late Mr. Sheriff Gugy) then took possession of the estate; and eventually became sheriff of the\ndistrict of Three Rivers. In the war of 1812, he resigned this office to resume his original profession; and he commanded the third battalion of incorporated militia. He was a most efficient officer, much respected, and even beloved by the men under his command. On the restoration of peace, he obtained a seat in the House of Assembly. Then, like his uncle, he became a member of the Legislative Council, and eventually sheriff of Montreal. Unhappily, unable to resist the instincts of his race in the domestic dissensions of Canada, he took the royal side. It was then the avowed policy of M. Papineau's party to expel the English, whom he called intruders and foreigners. Actuated by this design the French Canadian population of Montreal, upon the 21st of May, 1832, on the occasion of an election, encountered the troops, and some lives were unavoidably sacrificed. Colonel Mackintosh and Captain Temple, who commanded the detachment of the 15th Regiment which fired on the populace, were apprehended on a charge of murder, and a bill of indictment for that crime was subsequently laid before the grand jury. Mr. Sheriff Gugy was not sufficiently alive to his interest to summon a jury disposed to hang those officers. Unhappily for him the bill was ignored. This offence against the ruling majority was never forgiven or forgotten. Colonel Gugy then, feeling that he had lived too long, gradually declined, and expired in July, 1840. He was amiable, generous, hospitable and confiding to a fault. He was highly educated, and spoke four languages fluently. Tenacious on the point of honor, educated at the French court, he was a refined and accomplished gentleman, of a school now admired with the melancholy reverence excited by the ruins of the Colosseum.\n\nEarly in 1813, during the war with the United States, Thomas Gugy, then scarcely fifteen, obtained an ensigncy in the Glengarry Regiment. This corps, commanded by Colonel Batterby, an officer of the highest merit, had the good fortune to perform many important services and brilliant actions. From the opening to the close of the campaign, in presence of the enemy, it was often engaged; and, although no historian has recorded its deeds, it deserves to occupy a distinguished page in the annals of British valor and triumph. In these events Thomas Gugy had his full share; and he reaped the reward usually granted to the soldier too poor to purchase, whose services are no longer required. On the disbanding of his regiment, he studied law under that respectable man, the late Andrew Stuart. He soon became skilful as a practitioner; and, entering into partnership with the then Attorney-General Ogden, eventually attained great eminence at the bar. As an orator, he stood in the very first rank, and is yet affectionately remembered by many survivors, who admired him for his talents, and loved him for his virtues. But he had entered the army too young, and at twenty-eight he fell a victim to consumption, a result\nof the hardships which he had endured in the service. He died at Leghorn, and was buried in the grave adjoining that of the celebrated Tobias Smollet.\n\n\"Those whom the gods love die young.\"\n\nIn this place two anecdotes of his mother's father may be fairly related. That mother (an English lady with an Irish name) was brought to Canada by her father, an officer who had also served in Wolfe's army. Present at the unsuccessful attempt to force the French lines on the Beauport shore (not far from the residence of the present Colonel Gugy), this gentleman witnessed the retreat of the British troops, and the approach of the French and Indians. The yells of the savages necessarily reached the ear of a soldier wounded in the leg, and unable to walk. \"I shall be scalped,\" cried he. \"No you shan't,\" replied Dr. Connor, and taking the soldier in his arms he carried the man in safety to the boats. Again, in Montreal, the troops in the garrison were turned out to lend their assistance at a fire. A house was burning; the flames issued from the windows, and ladders were unavailable. There was a woman in an attic window, apparently abandoned to her fate by the multitude. Not so, thought Dr. Connor; but promptly ascending to the roof tree of a neighboring dwelling, he crept along until he reached the house on fire. Thence he descended to the window in which the woman stood, and bore her upwards to a place of safety. It may be added he was a tall man, possessed of strength, with activity.\n\nThe present Colonel Gugy, in his own opinion, neither so highly gifted nor so popular as his brother, has more versatility and very much more physical strength and constitutional cheerfulness and buoyancy of character. He is apparently a genuine Englishman, combining in his person the accomplished \"town\" and the homely \"country\" gentleman. He is fond of horses, and is given to manly exercises of all kinds. He is endowed with great mental and bodily activity, and, in danger, with rare presence of mind, and he addresses both crowds and courts with effect. In a family in which all the men had for many generations been soldiers, it was natural that the eldest son should be destined for the army; and he was originally intended for the engineers. He received his education with Mr. (now Lord Bishop) Strachan, at Cornwall; and speaks in terms of the most perfect respect, admiration and attachment of that good man. Owing to the decease of a nobleman, who had promised to facilitate his admission into the military college of the day, he entered the line; and, upon the disbanding of his regiment, he too studied the law. He was eminently successful, and in a short time accumulated a large fortune. He, however, had become security for his late father, and, having signed bonds for \u00a341,000, upon his fathers sudden removal from\noffice, he found himself called upon to make good some \u00a322,000. Devoting himself to the task, selling several houses, parts of seignories and mills, he eventually, after some twenty-eight years of anxiety, accomplished the onerous duty. Excepting, perhaps, in the family of the late Duke of Buckingham, more filial regard for the name of a parent and the honor of a family has never been exhibited. Previous to that event, he had with characteristic zeal, in accordance with the Earl of Dalhousie's desire to organize a corps of volunteers, formed a troop of cavalry much admired in its time. Independent and bold, he resisted the insolence of office, then prevalent; and, oppressed by Judge Kerr, he petitioned Parliament for redress. He was shortly afterwards elected, and succeeded in bringing about the dismissal of the judge. Invariably siding with the weak and the poor, against the strong and the rich, he complained of several functionaries who had been guilty of malversation in office, and ensured their removal. While he was a member, no officer of the government, however powerful, could with impunity abuse his authority. His habits, always temperate and frugal, enabled him to pursue that course, for he had no taste for luxury, and dinners held out to him no temptation. Eating no more than is necessary to support life, having no improper relish for wine, Colonel Gugy was quite indifferent to such temptations; nor did he want place, or propose by complaisance and truckling to obtain it, nor is his name connected with any job or the suspicion of any job. He was, however, firm and consistent in his efforts to preserve British connection\u2014true in his attachment to and preference for British institutions. As we said before, a true Englishman, his standard of excellence was thoroughly English. He speaks French with fluency and ease, and in that language he resisted in the Assembly of Lower Canada the French proclivities of M. Papineau and his associates. It was a long conflict, and an unequal one. Papineau's majority was composed of eighty French members. Gugy (at one time single handed) resisted this force at the head of nine members who spoke no French! He was then called the \"organ of the townships;\" and his public demeanor and temper were so good that he obtained and has preserved the respect of those against whom he contended. He predicted the rebellion, and endeavored both by suggestions to the government of the day and to the French Canadians, to avert it. He was only so far successful as to entail upon himself the animosity of both sides, and though by no means repentant, he is said to comprehend, at present, the utter inutility of moderation in politics. When the rebellion broke out, however, he was not moderate, but plunged headlong into the contest with a promptitude, spirit, zeal, and perseverance, which though unrewarded, can never be forgotten. The troops, which on the 14th of December, 1837, marched to the attack of St. Eustache will not\nforget his gallop alone from shore to shore, to prove that the ice would bear them. The river had been open two days before, and he was the first thus to cross it, a feat in the performance of which both man and horse were expected to be engulfed at every bound. The walls proving so thick and strong that the artillery could make no impression on them, Colonel Gugy thereupon sought and found a weak point at which the building could be assailed, and it was thus taken. As is recorded in the official report, Colonel Gugy led the troops to the assault of St. Eustache. Naturally surmounting every obstacle more quickly than the heavy armed soldier, he was the first to enter the church, in which he was severely wounded.\n\nWhatever may be the cause, he benefited little by his gallant conduct. After the fall of St. Eustache, he was invited to forego his professional prospects, and to occupy the post of commissioner of rural police. This appointment involved great personal labor, constant exposure on horseback, and considerable danger. He performed his duties satisfactorily, and was instrumental in inducing the habitants in the disturbed districts to return to their occupation and homes. But when every difficulty had been overcome, he was supplanted by a gentleman from the old country. It was however afterwards thought that he might be useful in another capacity, and the office of adjutant-general of militia being offered him, he accepted it. At that time the militia was in a state of great confusion; some persons had pretensions to rank, who had never been either in the militia, or the volunteers. Some militia officers had joined the volunteers, some volunteer officers had never been in the militia.\n\nSome militia officers had been true, many had been disloyal, some had been traitors engaged in armed conflict with the royal forces; some had been merely passive. Each nevertheless insisted upon his right to precedence, and it was impossible to give satisfaction to all. While he was engaged in the task of reorganizing the force, a violent political struggle was taking place; and it was sought to make the appointments in the militia subservient to the personal interests of ministers. Lord Metcalfe was adverse to this course, and the tangled web was, so far as depended upon Colonel Gugy, disengaged without reference to politics. Shortly afterwards a bill was brought into the house to abolish his office, and, in 1845, he was necessarily deprived of the income upon which he had reckoned. The office has been since revived; but as the gallant colonel belonged to neither of the classes deemed worthy of patronage, having no aptitude for conciliating the favor of the great, he has ever since lived in retirement, as best he could.\n\nDuring the rebellion Colonel Gugy was employed in the task of pacification, and it would seem with discretionary powers. According to the testimony of his very foes, he used it well, manifesting\nmuch humanity and sensibility in dealing with the defeated insurgents and their families. He appears to have moderated the not unnatural resentment and love of revenge of the loyalists, many among whom had been insulted, injured and despoiled. They naturally desired to exercise the right of reprisal; and to restrain them, and to protect their defeated enemies, was an unpopular, a difficult, and a dangerous task. But according to the concurring testimony of priests and laymen, it was performed, and well performed.* His personal activity was such as to confer on him a sort of ubiquity, and protestant though he be, he extorted praises from the Roman Catholic priesthood.\n\nAt a subsequent period the British population had in its anger assailed the legislature, and burned the buildings in which the Assembly was sitting. The popular feeling roused to madness by the memorable bill, then understood to be intended for the reward of treason, threatened the integrity of the empire, and culminated in the famous annexation movement. Men of all ranks then invited the interposition of the Americans. It was seriously and openly proposed to sever the connexion with Britain, and to annex Canada to the United States. A perspicuous and taking writer, Colonel Gugy wrote a pamphlet deprecating that course. The community which he represented being to a man annexationists, this pamphlet cost him his seat in Parliament. He also exerted himself in calming the multitude. His personal popularity and influence were productive of excellent results, and he several times succeeded in dispersing dangerous assemblies. The writer of these lines was an eye witness of the extraordinary power which Colonel Gugy had acquired over the British population of Montreal. Having worsted the police, and defying the troops, the populace assembled round the parliament house, bent on taking it by storm, and killing Lord Elgin who was in it. Without Colonel Gugy the attempt would have been made, but walking coolly up and down he soothed the multitude, and persuaded them to desist. So happy was he in his manner of dealing with them that, notwithstanding his opposition to their wishes, they carried him home on their shoulders in triumph. Neither the police or the troops produced any effect on the infuriated multitude. The administration thereupon put muskets into the hands of a body of French Canadians who were drilled and intended for the repression of the British population. The latter arming themselves, marched in a sort of military array to attack the French, and a terrible night conflict was about to take place in the streets of Montreal. To prevent it,\n\n* To exclude all doubt the names of living witnesses are subjoined:\u2014Messieurs Amiot, Theberge, Mignault, Manseau, Hudon, Primeau, and Chiniquy, Priests. Messieurs Wolfred Nelson, (at one time mayor of Montreal), Fr\u00e9chette, Leblanc, Patenaud, Robert, Bourassa, Singer, Cormier; Doctors Allard, and Payignon; Messieurs Ouimet, Franchere, and Soupras.\na wing of the 71st Regiment, and two guns loaded with grape, were drawn up, with orders to fire with effect on the advancing multitude. The latter had nearly reached the limit assigned them by the officer commanding, and the troops were about to fire, when Colonel Gugy met the crowd and threw himself into its midst. Ascending a lamp-post, he addressed them for upwards of two hours without faltering, eventually inducing the multitude to disperse. It was like a man tied to the guillotine, making a speech with the axe pendant over his neck. If it be true, as it is true, that but for his intervention, four or five hundred natives of the British Isles might, or would on that occasion have been slaughtered by the troops, it is manifest that the connexion with Britain must have been severed.\n\nThe inhabitants of the United States have always been and are perhaps still ready to interfere in Canadian affairs, and to overrun Canada. In 1837-8, affecting to lament the wrongs of the Canadians, they were called \"sympathisers.\" They early organised a society under the name of \"Hunters,\" for the invasion and annexation of Canada. Hundreds of lodges had been formed on the frontiers, and during the rebellion, as well as during the annexation movement consequent on the passage of the \"rebellion losses bill,\" hosts of sympathisers hung like a cloud on the slopes of the mountains of Vermont. They then waited for the occurrence of any disaster to the British arms to furnish the occasion for invading Canada, and would during the rebellion have been joined by the French population, during the annexation movement by the English. Had the British troops been defeated at St. Charles, as they had been at St. Denis\u2014had those troops massacred a considerable number of the British population in the streets of Montreal on the above mentioned well known memorable night, the expected signal would have been given, and a propitious moment for the invasion of Canada would have arrived. Those who believe that annexation could have been prevented, must admit that in the effort, torrents of blood would have been shed. But the provinces might have become part and parcel of the American union. Taking the first view of the case, the writer of these lines, feels it to be due to Colonel Gugy to ascribe to him the saving of hundreds, perhaps thousands of lives, and all the horrors consequent upon a state of war. But those who are of opinion that in the contingency which Colonel Gugy averted, Britain could not have retained Canada, cannot over estimate the services of that gentleman.\n\nDuring the struggle, and for several years, Colonel Gugy had been induced to abandon his professional prospects, to serve in the royal ranks, and the then governor had, by way of compensation, offered him the office of adjutant-general. The prejudice against natives militated against him, and he was not appointed. He was employed in the rural police, as commissioner or head of the\nestablishment, as we have before stated. In that situation he did not belic his antecedents, but on the contrary, was so fortunate as to discharge his arduous duties in a satisfactory manner. But peace at length obtained, Colonel Gugy was summarily removed to make way for a gentleman from the British Isles; a lower position was then assigned him, that of police magistrate in Montreal. His efforts in this office elicited from an official eye-witness the following description upon oath: \"Colonel Gugy gratuitously discharged the duties of chairman of the quarter sessions, at a time when no other officer or person connected with the commissions of the peace, would or could perform them, and he was indefatigable therein, as he had been in the office of superintendent of police. Colonel Gugy throughout, behaved in a just, upright and honorable manner. No political or religious bias could ever be detected in any of his actions; he was influenced neither by race or colour; he was energetic and fearless, and his judgments gave great general satisfaction; his mode of delivering his judgment was so admirable, that crowds were daily attracted to the office for the purpose of hearing and receiving instruction from him. The course he pursued while in office, was so excellent, as to have produced permanent effects still felt in the amended conduct of many.\"\n\nFrom this position, Lord Sydenham transferred him to the office of adjutant-general. The prospect of war with the United States, incident to the Oregon difficulty, was then viewed according to the political bearings of individuals with regret,\u2014with indifference or exultation, and the re-forming of the militia, broken and disordered by the rebellion, and many years of disloyalty and tumult, was a difficult task. In accomplishing that task, a man who knew the opinion and merit of every applicant for rank as well as the degree of dependence which could or could not be reposed in his fidelity and ability, would have great difficulties. Nevertheless, the task was performed, when the administration of the day, being unable to prefer any complaint against Colonel Gugy, introduced a bill, avowedly intended for his removal from office. During the debate, several members vindicated him, and one exclaimed that \"in the then state of the country an angel from heaven could not have given general satisfaction.\" The bill and the causes assigned, were however, mere pretexts. The passing of the bill was an iniquity to which a reluctant assent was extended from several members by a solemn promise that ample amends would be made to Colonel Gugy. Accordingly, to have a pretext for breaking their promise, the ministry of the day tendered for his acceptance, the office of police magistrate of Quebec. The then incumbent, Mr. McCord, was allowed a salary of \u00a3500; but to ensure Colonel Gugy's rejection of the offer, the salary was lowered to \u00a3300. It is said that he received the official letter in the street, and with\ncharacteristic promptitude, he is understood to have stepped into a shop and penned a laconic rejection of the insulting offer.\n\nNevertheless, the bill passed, and Colonel Gugy therefore now lives in great privacy upon his farm. A prophet hath no honor in his own country, but we are bound to give a description of the man, and for obvious reasons we borrow from the annals of another country. Having gone upon some mission to Boston, he is represented in one periodical as a \"tall, majestic-looking gentleman, who expressed himself in a beautiful manner.\" In another paper, adverting to him as a member of the provincial Parliament, he is described as \"one of the most eloquent, accomplished and thoroughly educated members of the house, and as speaking French and English with equal grace, fluency and force.\" Having thus to avoid the imputation of partiality, borrowed from other sources, we may speak of what we saw. During the discussion on the rebellion losses bill, the ministry were anxious to insure the immediate passage of the bill, while the opposition desired to gain time to afford the people of Upper Canada an opportunity to petition against the bill. At this period we saw Colonel Gugy contend single handed against the majority, actually on one night speaking during seven hours, in order to obtain the desired delay.\n\nDuring the debate, Lord Elgin took the precaution to pursue a course of hospitality, extended with unusual prodigality to the opposition. Two prominent members having repaired to the government house, at some distance in the country to dine, were asked how they could afford to leave their places on such an occasion: \"Oh,\" said they, \"it's all right, for we've left Gugy there.\" The writer remembers the singular scene which presented itself when the ministry, having collected their forces, and sent for their night caps, resisted for a long time, but at length capitulated at eight in the morning.\n\nIt is related of him, that when the mob having set fire to the building, rushed up to disperse the members, and complete the work of destruction, he was the only man who resented the insult, and on that occasion he collared and flung down the stairs a fellow who laid hold of the mace. On that occasion, too, he protected the speaker, and adhered to him until that functionary reached a place of safety.\n\nTo mark the character of the man, one anecdote will suffice. An eminent official of Guiana was both the personal and political enemy of Colonel Gugy. The first number of a newspaper of which that official was editor, when he preached and published exciting appeals to the Irish, and \"hoped that the orange and green would never unite,\" contained a libel on Colonel Gugy. That number was brought to his house, and he turned out the carrier boy who delivered it; for this act, Mr. Hincks caused\nthe colonel to be prosecuted, and an exciting trial took place. But on the night of the destruction of the parliament buildings, Colonel Gugy was informed that the mob had gone to set fire to the house of his enemy. The colonel thereupon instantly started at a rapid pace, taking with him a sub-division of the 71st Regiment, and reaching the premises in time, protected them effectually during that terrible night.\n\nAs a proof of his moral courage, his defiance of what is conventionally called the press, may be cited. The Herald newspaper is understood to have been the first to give publicity to the domestic difficulties and sorrows of Colonel Gugy. The fact is that, owing to causes not now of any moment, his father had become involved, and owing to the weakness of age, had not taken the measures necessary to exculpate his son, who was his surety. The latter felt it to be a point of honor to keep his father's secret, and found himself charged with the offence of injuring his parent. He thereupon brought a series of suits against the press; he conducted them himself, and in despite of all the talent arrayed against him, he triumphed signalily.\n\nSubsequently, during the administration of Lord Metcalfe, a host of Irish navvies, employed in improving the Lachine canal, undertook to regulate the elections for Montreal. On one occasion they marched into town in force\u2014armed and prepared to do battle under the command of a sort of Hercules. They numbered from two to three thousand, and being determined to ensure the election of one of the candidates, who was their countryman, filled the whole space from Wellington to McGill street. As they approached the poll in the latter street, Colonel Gugy, who had been placed there by the returning officer to preserve the peace, rode alone to the head of the column, and forcing it open, laid hold of, and dragged out the ringleader. It would seem that there was no second in command, for the multitude alarmed by the capture of their chief, dispersed in all directions. This bold act, requiring both presence of mind and a firm seat on horseback, thus saved many lives, as also doubtlessly the burning and sacking of a part of Montreal.\n\nWhile a coroner's jury were enquiring into the causes of the death of one Mason, protected by a guard of some thirty soldiers with fixed bayonets, a cry of fire was heard; the jury, guard, witnesses, and spectators, filled the upper story, and the miserable staircase afforded but slight means of exit. As the fire, however, approached, the crowd was seized with a panic, and all were flying regardless of consequences. It is evident that many would have been transfixed by the bayonets; but fortunately Colonel Gugy, in the sharp order which soldiers instinctively obey, cried, \"Soldiers, halt\u2014unfix bayonets.\" Thus was the danger averted.\nSince that period, Colonel Gugy has written many able papers both on military subjects and on the abuses of the law; and he has invariably insisted on the perfect equality of men of colonial birth to metropolitans. He may not live to witness the adoption of his views, but the subject is likely to produce great results here, as it has done south of latitude forty-five.\n\nIt is not too much to say in conclusion, that the subject of this notice might have achieved distinction in any country, but he is a provincial, unconnected by birth or religion with the dominant party, but on the contrary, always opposed to their principles and policy. So Washington\u2014now immortal\u2014was in his colonial condition exposed to many petty annoyances, and we know that the hero, Dundonald, lived and died the victim of a calumny.\n\n---\n\nHON. JOHN YOUNG.\n\nThe Honorable Mr. Young was born at Ayr, in Scotland, in 1811. He left school at the age of thirteen; and, for eighteen months, kept school in a country parish near Ayr. He arrived in Montreal in 1826; and, during nine years, was clerk with Messrs. John Torrance & Co., and of this firm he became a partner in 1835, at Quebec; where he remained for five years, during three of which he did business on his own account.\n\nIt was during his residence here in 1837, that he first took part in any public matters. He, with others, became satisfied that there would be an attempt at rebellion against the government, and was instrumental in having a memorial presented to the then governor-general, Earl Gosford, pointing out the danger, and petitioning that corps of volunteers might be enrolled. This the governor-general refused to do at the time, but promised that the memorialists would be called on to support the government, if their assistance should be required. In about three weeks after, this became necessary. Mr. Young got command of a company in a regiment of light infantry, which was made up in twenty-four hours, and was the first to receive arms. During the winter, the Quebec Light Infantry did regular duty, in keeping night guard on the citadel.\n\nIn 1840, he returned to Montreal, joining Harrison Stephens in business. It was part of his duty to travel every winter in\nOhio, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, &c., and it was by the experience thus acquired, and the intimate knowledge of the various routes to the seaboard for interior productions, that Mr. Young became so thoroughly acquainted with the great advantages of the St. Lawrence route to the ocean.\n\nMr. Young's first public act in Montreal, was to oppose the expenditure in feasting of a large sum of money raised to celebrate the birth of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales. He recommended that the money should be applied in the purchase of three hundred acres of land near the city, where an asylum for the poor could be secured, and to connect it by name with the occasion. But although his motion was carried, it was afterwards reconsidered, and an adverse decision adopted.\n\nIn 1844, Mr. Young was called on to act as returning officer, at the Montreal general election. Party spirit at that time ran very high, and the elections throughout the country were remarkable for the violence of those who were for or against the policy pursued by Lord Metcalfe. In Montreal, this was especially the case; and it became necessary to take the most active means to prevent the destruction of property and bloodshed. It was ascertained that on the morning of the election (which lasted two days), there were upwards of four thousand armed strangers in the city from various parts of the country, intent on taking part in the election. The troops were called out; and a great number of persons sent to prison. By the most energetic efforts on the part of Mr. Young, and in consequence of his admirable arrangements, public peace was preserved; and the election terminated without loss of life. For these services, Mr. Young received the thanks of the colonial secretary, and of the commanders of the forces in Canada, Sir Richard Jackson and Sir James Hope.\n\nIn 1846, he was instrumental in organising a Free Trade Association in Montreal, of which he became president. This association published the Canadian Economist during a period of sixteen months, and this publication did much to reconcile the opponents of the mother country in inaugurating free trade, and withdrawing the protection, which the products of Canada had previously enjoyed in her markets.\n\nIn the same year, Mr. Young took part in the discussion then going on, as to whether the government had adopted a correct policy in making a new channel through lake St. Peter, instead of deepening and improving the natural channel. He went down to the lake, and with pilots, spent some days in sounding the various channels, and reported against the government plan, in making a new channel. He advised the immediate abandonment of all that had been done, and the necessity of commencing the improvement of the natural channel. The whole work was abandoned by order of Parliament. Mr. Young did not, however, cease\nto urge on the government and his fellow citizens, the importance of the improvement of the lake and the river between Quebec and Montreal; and, on being appointed a harbor commissioner in 1849, he at once suggested to his colleagues a plan by which the improvement of the lake and river could be accomplished. This plan was submitted to the government, and an act passed to enable the commissioners to carry it into effect. The plan was found to work; the commissioners obtained the necessary funds on the security of the harbor trust, which has been so managed by Mr. Young as chairman, that its bonds have always been at a premium, while the channel for navigation has been deepened from eleven feet to eighteen feet throughout, with a breadth of three hundred feet in the lake. The work is now progressing, so as to secure a depth of twenty feet; the importance of which, to the port of Montreal, and the province in general, it would be difficult to estimate.\n\nHe also suggested the propriety and justice of the government assuming the costs of this work, and for several years persistently urged this principle, and was at last successful.\n\nIn 1845, he took part in originating and urging forward the construction of the railway to Portland, so as to connect the St. Lawrence with the Atlantic, and he also suggested the propriety of the construction of a railway from Montreal to the west\u2014obtained several surveys of the road to Kingston; and, in connection with others, procured a charter for prosecuting the work. He became president of the road, and agreed with the engineers, that the best route for the same was some ten or fifteen miles back from the St. Lawrence, so as to secure the shortest line; and, at the same time, the best position to connect with the Ottawa. Mr. Young's fellow citizens were so satisfied with his exertions, that they presented him with a handsome testimonial of their esteem.\n\nIt was about this time too that Mr. Young suggested and advocated the necessity of a bridge across the St. Lawrence. He advanced the necessary funds to Mr. Thos. C. Keefer for his survey and plan of that work, and urged its importance on every occasion. Suggesting that its construction should be the basis of the Kingston and Montreal Railroad Company, waiving the rights of their charter in favor of the Grand Trunk Company, the proposal was adopted and the present Victoria Bridge is erected at the site surveyed by Mr. Keefer.\n\nIn 1846, Mr. Young suggested that a canal, to connect the St. Lawrence with lake Champlain, should be constructed; and he declared that unless this was done the Canadian canals would fail, when opened in 1849, to attract to the St. Lawrence route any considerable portion of the interior trade. The government had this canal route surveyed by different engineers, all of whom strongly advised its construction. The various boards of trade also urged on the government its importance; but, it has not yet been\nbegun, although the fact of the St. Lawrence route being able to attract only about seven per cent of the interior trade, while ninety-three per cent flows through the Erie canal, might seem to afford sufficient evidence of the necessity for the construction of such a canal. In 1851, Mr. Young was asked to join the Hincks and Morin administration, as chief commissioner of public works; and was elected to represent the city of Montreal, though his election was opposed on the ground of his free trade opinions, his advocacy of the Caughnawaga canal, and of the importance of constructing the Halifax railroad. As soon as the elections were over, he, with Mr. Hincks and the Honorable Mr. Tach\u00e9, proceeded to New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, to advocate the railway to Halifax, but differed from some of the deputation as to the line surveyed by the Imperial Government, and thus suggested that it should pass over the St. John river to St. John, and thence to Halifax.\n\nIn the same year, Mr. Young recommended to the government the necessity of establishing a Canadian line of ocean steamers for the St. Lawrence; and boldly advised that, to secure their being immediately established, a subsidy should be paid by Canada alone. Tenders were invited for establishing a fortnightly line to the St. Lawrence, and a monthly line to Portland; and, after much difficulty, Mr. Young's colleagues consented to grant nineteen thousand pounds per annum, provided five thousand pounds additional was secured by Mr. Young otherwise. This he succeeded in obtaining from the Atlantic and St Lawrence, and St Lawrence and Atlantic Railway Companies; and the line was commenced, the beneficial results of which, to the country, are too well known to require notice.\n\nAs commissioner of public works, he examined a great number of pilots and shipmasters as to the merits of the route through the straits of Belleisle, and concerning the improvements necessary on the lower St. Lawrence. In his Public Works' Report of 1851, he advised the immediate construction of various light houses; most of which have since been built, and insurance has been reduced more than one-half in consequence. Mr Young, while commissioner, suggested and opened up the various water powers at Ottawa city, and recommended that a minister of agriculture should be a member of the Executive Council. He differed from Mr. Hincks on the plan by which the railways of the country should be constructed; and was in favor of waiting to ascertain, whether it was possible to obtain the Imperial Government's security, by which means money for construction of the whole road from Windsor to Halifax could be obtained at a very low rate of interest. This plan was over-ruled, and a private company obtained a charter from Parliament, under the style of the Grand Trunk Railway Company. Mr. Young opposed the demand for\ngovernment aid towards this undertaking, to the amount of four thousand pounds sterling per mile, and this sum was in consequence of his opposition reduced to three thousands pounds per mile.\n\nThe government having determined on charging a higher rate on American vessels passing through the Welland canal than on Canadian vessels, Mr. Young resigned his office of commissioner of public works, and became instrumental in preventing these differential tolls against American shipping.\n\nMr. Young also originated the idea of having Canada represented in the Exhibition of All Nations, in London, in 1851, and organized the committees throughout the province, to carry it into effect. Again in Parliament, in 1855, he carried a motion to have Canada represented at the Industrial Exhibition in Paris. Those exhibitions, all will admit, did more to bring Canada creditably before the notice of the world than anything before or since.\n\nIn 1854, Mr. Young was again returned member for Montreal, having been mainly supported by the mercantile interest. He was an active member of the committee of public accounts, while W. L. McKenzie acted as chairman. In 1855, he again was on that committee, and acted as its chairman, and made numerous suggestions on the erroneous system of keeping the public accounts, most of which have been since adopted. Mr. Young declined to come forward again to represent Montreal at the election of 1857, in consequence of ill health; but he has not ceased take to an active part in every public measure affecting the public interests of the city, where he resides.\n\nMr. Young's advocacy of the proposition for docks at Montreal, and for making available the enormous water power of the river Saint Lawrence, by the fall of its water, from the Lachine canal, has been constant, and although very much opposed, yet there has been a great change in public feeling as to the importance of these works (vast as they appear) to the interest of the province, and especially of Montreal. It is evident, however, that the rapid extension of the interior trade will, sooner than is expected, fully justify Mr. Young in so strongly advocating improvements upon which the future trade of the St. Lawrence depends.\n\nIt was owing to Mr. Young's exertions, that the limits of the harbor of Montreal were extended; and he has been unremitting in aiding the extension of the river and harbor accommodations in all directions.\n\nMr. Young was chairman of the committee of citizens, who so successfully entertained the Prince of Wales, on his late visit to Canada.\n\nHe is a member of a Unitarian society, which he did much to establish, and is admitted to be a most liberal and public spirited\ncitizen. He has raised himself, by his own exertions; and has done as much for the benefit of the people of Montreal as any other man living. His conceptions are grand, and many of these have been realized; to them, and to his indefatigable energy, is the present high and distinguished position which our mercantile metropolis holds in the estimation of Europe and America, as well as much of the prosperity in store for it in the future, may be fairly attributed.\n\nSIR WM. E. LOGAN, F.R.G.S., F.R.S.\n\nSir William Logan, the eminent and distinguished geologist, and one of the most scientific men that Canada can boast of having produced, is a Canadian bred and born. He first saw the light in Montreal in 1798. He pursued his studies at the High School of Edinburgh, Scotland; and graduated at the university of that city. In 1818 he entered the mercantile office of his uncle, Mr. Hart Logan, of London, and after a time became a partner in the firm. After returning to Canada for a short time, where his attention was drawn to the geological characteristics of this country, he again crossed the Atlantic in 1829, and took up his residence in South Wales, Swansea, as manager of copper smelting and coal mining operations, in which his uncle was interested; but he left this situation soon after the death of the latter in 1838. During his seven years' residence in South Wales, Mr. Logan devoted himself to the study of the coal field of that region; and his minute and accurate maps and sections were adopted by the ordnance geological survey, and published by the government, under Sir Henry de la Beche's superintendence. He was the first to demonstrate that the stratum of under clay, as it is called, which always underlies coal beds, was the soil in which the coal vegetation grew. In 1841 Sir William visited the coal fields of Pennsylvania and Nova Scotia; and communicated several valuable memoirs on the subject to the Geological Society of London. At this time he began an examination of the older palaeozoic rocks of Canada; and the celebrated geological survey of Canada having been commenced, he was appointed and still continues at its head, a trust which sufficiently indicates the high opinion entertained of his great abilities and attainments by the government. This preference is, however, nothing more than he is entitled to, considering the immense sacrifice which he has made to remain in, and confine his\nstudies to, a country endeared to him by all the ties of birth and station. It is a well known fact that he has refused several offers from other governments for his services, including India, where a princely fortune is to be made by the geologist. In the course of his investigations upon the rocks of the Eastern Townships, which are the continuation of those of New England, Sir William has shown that, so far from being, as had been supposed, primitive azoic rocks, they are altered and crystallized paleozoic strata; a fact, which, although suspected, had not hitherto been demonstrated, and which is the key to the geology of North-Eastern America. He found the rocks, which form the Laurentide and Adirondac mountains, previously regarded as unstratified, to be disturbed and altered sedimentary deposits of vast thickness, equal perhaps to all the hitherto known stratified rocks of the earth's crust. In 1851 Sir William represented Canada at the Great Exhibition in London; and had charge of the Canadian geological collection which had been made by himself or under his immediate direction. It was exhibited with great skill and judgment, displaying to the best advantages the mineral resources of Canada. The labor of arranging the specimens was very great, and so enthusiastic was he that frequently he sallied out at eight or ten in the morning, and would work for twelve hours without waiting to take refreshment. He had the satisfaction of knowing that his countrymen appreciated his services. Medals in profusion were allotted to Canada, and the Royal Society of London elected Mr. Logan a fellow, the highest attainable British scientific distinction; he was also a commissioner from Canada at the Industrial Exhibition at Paris in 1855, when he received from the imperial commission the grand gold medal of honor, and was created a knight of the Legion of Honor. He received the honor of knighthood from the Queen's hands, in 1856; and in the same year was awarded by the Geological Society, of which he has long been a member, the Wollaston Palladium medal, for his pre-eminent services in geology.\n\nREV. EGERTON RYERSON, D.D.,\n\nCHIEF SUPERINTENDENT OF EDUCATION, CANADA WEST.\n\nThis celebrated divine and public servant whose name has been mixed up in various ways with the history of the country, but principally in developing the admirable educational system of\nUpper Canada, is the son of the late Colonel Joseph Ryerson, a United Empire Loyalist of New Jersey, who came from New Brunswick in 1793. He was born in Charlotteville, county of Norfolk, Upper Canada, in 1803; entered the Wesleyan ministry in 1825; was editor of the Christian Guardian (which he established) in 1829; principal of Victoria college, Cobourg, C.W., in 1841; appointed chief superintendent of education for Upper Canada in 1844; made a tour of enquiry in Europe in 1844-5; and founded the present perfect and excellent system of public instruction in Upper Canada in 1846-50, which he has ever since maintained.\n\nHe received his degree of doctor of divinity we believe from an American university. He is the author of many Canadian works and pamphlets, principally relating to matters of church and state.\n\n---\n\nThe Most Rev. Dr. Pierre F. Turgeon,\n\nRoman Catholic Bishop of Quebec.\n\nThis distinguished prelate was born at Quebec on the 12th November, 1787; was ordained priest on the 29th April 1810; appointed secretary to Bishop Plessis in December 1808; and continued in that office until October, 1820; was for many years a member of the seminary of Quebec, until he became bishop and coadjutor cum futura successione of the then archbishop of Quebec, by appointment and bulls of the late Pope Gregory XVI, bearing date the 28th February, 1834. He was consecrated under the title of Sidyme, in the Quebec cathedral on the 11th May, 1834, an appointment he mainly owed to his bright abilities and efficiency in the service of his church. M. Turgeon was administrator of the diocese from November, 1849, to October, 1850, when by the death of Dr. Signay, he became archbishop, and was vested with the sacred pallium on the 11th June, 1851. He resigned his office of administrator of the diocese in 1855, in consequence of ill-health, when Dr. C. F. Baillargeon was appointed to the latter office.\nHON. MR. JUSTICE C. MONDELET.\n\nCHARLES JOSEPH ELZ\u00c9AR MONDELET, assistant-judge of the Court of Queen's Bench, was born at St. Charles, river Chambly, on the 27th December 1801; he was the son of Jean Marie Mondelet, notary, and grandson of Dominique Mondelet, who was born in France and came to Canada under the French government, as assistant army surgeon.\n\nJudge Mondelet was educated partly at the college of Nicolet and partly at the college of Montreal, where he finished his education in 1819; he was then employed, as an assistant, by the astronomical commission appointed to ascertain the position of the boundary line between the United States and Canada under the treaty of Ghent. He studied the law, first with Mr. O'Sullivan, who afterwards became chief-justice of the then Court of King's Bench at Montreal, and completed the period of study with his brother, Dominique Mondelet, Esq., now judge of the Superior Court. He was admitted to the bar in 1822, and followed his profession, first at Three Rivers, and next, from 1830, in Montreal, in partnership with his brother, Dominique, and subsequently with Mr. Cherrier, till his (Mr. Mondelet's) appointment in 1842 as district judge for Terrebonne, L'Assomption and Berthier. He was appointed circuit judge at Montreal in 1844; judge of the Superior Court in 1849; judge of the Seigniorial Court in 1855; and assistant-judge in appeals (Court of Queen's Bench) in 1858, in the room of Judge Caron, who was appointed one of the commissioners for codifying the laws of Lower Canada.\n\nFrom 1822 to 1842 Mr. Mondelet took an active part in the politics of the country, and was twice arrested for political offences, first in 1829, and afterwards in 1838, but was never put on his trial. Ho and William Walker, Esq., barrister, defended Nicholas and three other individuals, charged with the murder of Chartrand, during the political troubles in 1837; he also, along with Mr. Walker, defended Captain Jalbert, who was charged with the murder of Lieutenant Weir during the troubles.\n\nMr. Mondelet published in 1840 his *Lettres sur l'Education*, the suggestions contained in which are said to have been embodied in the school law passed in the first session after the union in 1841.\nHON. J. S. MACDONALD, Q.C., M.P.P.\n\nThrough the whole of the youthful days of the Hon. John S. Macdonald there is to be found a dash of romance. Born at St. Raphael, in the county of Glengarry, Upper Canada, on the 12th December, 1812, on the property owned and entailed by his grandfather, a Scottish Highlander and Roman Catholic, who settled there in 1786, the subject of this notice left the paternal roof at the age of eleven, resolving to become the master of his own actions. Discovered many miles from home, he was taken back against his will, and he soon took an opportunity to start off a second time. This time, as he was bargaining with an Indian at Cornwall to paddle him across the river to the United States\u2014the Indian demanding half a dollar and the juvenile fugitive having only half that amount in the world\u2014his father came up, and for a second time the truant was carried back. But neither persuasion nor force could detain him at home, and he soon again set out, hiring himself at a considerable distance from home to a store-keeper for three years, at a sliding-scale salary\u2014\u00a310 for the first year, \u00a312 10s for the second, and \u00a315 for the third. He remained two out of the three years. He afterwards made a similar engagement with a store-keeper in Cornwall, but only remained a few months, when he resolved to abandon commerce for the law. A lawyer who was in the habit of visiting the store used to address arguments of this kind to him. Suppose, he would say, you owned all this store, with the goods, and that a fire burned them up,\u2014it would be years before you could commence again. How different it is with me who has a profession; come what will, no accident can deprive me of that possession. After the budding merchant had been nearly convinced by arguments like these, a little incident occurred to decide his wavering mind. One day while out in the streets, he was pelted with snow-balls by urchins of too tender years to render it possible that he could resent the insult by chastising them, and was at the same time contemptuously called a \"counter-hopper.\" It was not for the snow-balls that he cared, although these, when hard, may sometimes do mischief, but he was stung by the thought that the calling he was following could be reproachfully thrown into his teeth. He went to the store, saying that he could not remain there any longer, and, recounting what had happened, declared that he had resolved to study law. He inquired how long it would take him to study to enable him to pass the Law Society as student-at-law. He was told that it might be done by hard study in three years. Accordingly, in November, 1832, he went to school\nat Cornwall, and under the tutition of Dr. Urquhart\u2014not one of whose students was ever rejected by the benchers of the Law Society\u2014he was found to be ahead of all his school fellows at the examination which took place two years after his entrance. It was at this school also that the Hon. Philip Vankoughnet, commissioner of crown lands, received his education. In the early part of 1835, young Macdonald passed the Law Society as student-at-law, only a little more than two years after he had entered Dr. Urquhart's school.\n\nHe was articled in 1835 to Mr. McLean, then a practising barrister at Cornwall, with whom he remained for two and a half years, when Mr. McLean was appointed judge of the Court of Queen's Bench, having previously been speaker of the Upper Canada House of Assembly. Our student then went into the office of Mr. Draper, now chief-justice of the Court of Common Pleas, with whom he finished his term of legal studies in 1840. In June of that year he was called to the bar, having for some months previously practised as attorney at Cornwall. He has continued to practise his profession in that town to the present time; and having, at an early period, built up a lucrative practice, he has, contrary to the usual rule with Canadian politicians, managed to retain and increase it; so that it is now larger than at any former period. He has by this means been able to maintain a position of pecuniary independence, (while several of the prominent lawyers in the country are embarrassed with debts,) as he never sought the slightest accommodation from banks\u2014a circumstance that has conduced as much to his political as well as personal independence.\n\nHe was first elected to Parliament after the union in March, 1841, and is the only member now in the House of Assembly who has sat since the union. In the last Parliament there were two beside himself, Sir Henry Smith and the Honorable W. H. Merritt. Lord Sydenham had been sent out to carry the union into effect; and with that view too many of the Lower Canada elections, where the people had been opposed to the union, were carried by violence. Mr. Cuvillier, the nominee of the government, was elected speaker, in opposition to Sir Allan MacNab. And here it may be remarked that, in Canada, a speaker seldom retains his seat, as such, more than one parliament. Every new House of Assembly elects its own speaker; so that there are often several ex-speakers in the prime of political life, who return, contrary to the English practice to the floor of the house. The government was a mixture of politicians of different shades of opinion. The legislature was not free from placemen; and the government was not conducted by heads of departments who possessed the confidence of the representatives of the people. Neither the head of the crown lands office nor the surveyor-general was a member of the Executive Council. Family-compact toryism had acquired a subdued tone in official circles,\nin consequence of the despatch of Lord John Russell, sent out in 1839, in which the alternative of supporting the government or retiring from their places was held out to the officials who had seats in either branches of the legislature. The manner in which the union was forced upon Lower Canada and the violence which had been used at the elections, caused men like the late Honorable Messrs. Neilson, D. B. Viger, and Morin to take their places in the ranks of the opposition. Mr. Macdonald was opposed to the government; but he was an Upper Canadian, and was far from being cordial with Sir Allan MacNab, the opposition leader for that section of the country. The rebellion, of which the effects had not passed away, had reduced everything to a question of loyalty and allegiance, especially in that part of central Canada which Mr. Macdonald represented. His position was a peculiar one. He voted with the Upper Canada conservatives and the Lower Canada French leaders against the government; but he never attended a tory \"caucus,\" as party meetings are called in America, much less had he any intimate alliance with the Lower Canada opposition. It was in the first session of this Parliament that the resolutions establishing responsible government were passed. Lord Sydenham accepted the principle with as good a grace as possible, but with manifest reluctance. The resolutions proposed on the subject by Mr. Baldwin were set aside for those of Mr. Harrison, provincial secretary; and thus the establishment of the principle of executive responsibility was made to appear to come from the government itself.\n\nIn November, 1848, Sir Charles Metcalfe attempted to subvert the principles thus established; and the elections which took place next year turned upon a contest between the governor-general and his late Council. The marrow of the whole dispute lay in his having asserted a right to make appointments to offices without consulting them, and there having denied it. In this election, Mr. Macdonald espoused the cause of the ex-ministers. It was a somewhat perilous experiment to make among the Highlanders of Glengarry, who were proverbial for their loyalty. At a public meeting in that county, the course of the ex-ministers was sustained; and the effect in other parts of the country was very great. This famous meeting was held at Cornwall, the head-quarters or rather the birth-place of family compactism. It was called by that party, but the yeomen of the county resolving that Cornwall should not speak in their name to misrepresent them, went to the meeting and out-voted the party with whom it originated. From that day, no family compact meeting has ever been held in Cornwall. When the election came, Mr. Macdonald was returned by a larger majority than before. Of the 18,000 inhabitants of the county, 19-20ths are of Highland Scotch descent. Among them there were, when the census for 1851 was taken, no less than 8,242 Macdonalds, all of\nwhom speak Gaelic. The proverbial loyalty of the Highlanders of Glengarry is due to the same cause that gives a more subdued and conservative tone to the politics of central Canada than what prevails in the western peninsula, its original settlement by United Empire loyalists. After the close of the American war of independence, the Royal Yorkers were disbanded at Laprairie; and being unacquainted with the French language, they went higher up the banks of the St. Lawrence to settle. In the same year, many of them settled in the counties of Glengarry and Stormont, as well as on the frontier of Leeds and Grenville, and sooner or later, loyalists of the American revolution went as far west as the Bay of Quinte, west of Kingston. These original settlers in Stormont were a mixture of Scotch and Dutch; in Glengarry they were chiefly Highland-Scotch. They had all served in Sir William Johnston's corps of Royal Yorkers. The republican element has never been infused into this part of the population; whatever there is of it in Upper Canada, is in the western peninsula. As an instance of the complete absence of the invasion of American habits into central Canada, may be mentioned that dollars and cents were never spoken of there as a currency; and it will take three years to familiarize that part of the population with the new coinage. When the annexation cry was raised, in some parts of the country, in 1849, there was hardly an annexationist from Belleville to the frontier of Lower Canada. The descendants of the U.E. loyalists take a natural and hereditary pride in showing their preference of monarchical over republican institutions. The most reliable loyalists of Canada are the settlers in this district of country. In the election of 1844, the Highlanders of Glengarry showed theirs was a reasoning loyalty which sees the best safeguard in British supremacy in upholding the British principle of executive responsibility.\n\nIn 1848, 1852 and 1854, Mr. Macdonald was elected without a contest in his old constituency. In the latter part of the year 1849, he was appointed solicitor-general under the Lafontaine-Baldwin government, which office he held till the breaking up of that government in the autumn of 1851. He was elected speaker in Quebec in 1852, and held that position till the dissolution in 1854. In 1858 he was attorney-general in the Brown-Dorion government. In 1857 he was elected for Cornwall, his brother D. A. Macdonald, succeeding him in the county, and this year was again returned for that town. Except to the Lafontaine-Baldwin government, in which he was solicitor-general, Mr. Macdonald has been in opposition ever since he has been in Parliament, except lately when he left the ranks of the clear grit party, and is now what is called \"an independent member.\" He is one of the few Upper Canadians who have been persistently opposed to representation by population; and although a Roman Catholic, he has never been an advocate of separate schools. His opposition to them has brought\ndown upon him the censure of the priests; but although they have from the altar recommended the electors to vote for Protestant candidates in preference to him, that recommendation has been disregarded by the Highlanders.\n\nIn 1840, Mr. Macdonald married a lady from Louisiana, the daughter of a United States senator, who owned a large plantation of negroes, and who was shot in a duel in 1843. Mr. Macdonald's ancestors were not U. E. loyalists, but came directly from Scotland. He is a tall man of slender make, and has for some time been an invalid.\n\n---\n\nHON. JAMES MORRIS, M.L.C.\n\nThe Honorable James Morris, M.L.C., of the town of Brockville, C. W., was born at Paisley, in Scotland, in 1798. He came to Canada in the year 1801, when a child. His father, the late Alexander Morris, Esquire, of Montreal, and afterwards of the township of Elizabethtown, Brockville, having then emigrated to Canada with his family. As a historical contrast to the present expedition of transit between Britain and Canada, it is worthy of record that sixty-three days were occupied in the passage from Scotland to Quebec.\n\nMr. Morris received the latter part of his education at the academy of the late Mr. Nelson, of Sorol, the father of Dr. Wolfred Nelson, of Montreal. On leaving school, Mr. Morris devoted his attention to mercantile pursuits in Brockville, in connection with his brothers, the late Alexander Morris, of Brockville, Esquire, and the late Honorable William Morris, of Perth, and latterly of Montreal. He early devoted a portion of his attention to public matters. In July, 1837, he was returned to the Upper Canadian House of Assembly, as one of the members for the county of Leeds, and has ever since continued to be a member of one or other of the branches of the legislature.\n\nIn 1838, he was appointed a commissioner for the improvement of the navigation of the river St. Lawrence, and served as such until the completion of the St. Lawrence canals.\n\nIn 1841, he was again returned for the county of Leeds to the Parliament of United Canada, the government being then administered by Lord Sydenham.\n\nIn 1844, he was called to the Legislative Council, under the administration of Lord Metcalfe. In 1851, Mr. Morris was called\nto a seat in the Executive Council, under the administration of Lord Elgin, and was also appointed postmaster-general, being the first incumbent of that office after the transfer of the department from imperial control to that of Canada. Immediately upon his appointment he proceeded to Washington, and there negotiated with the American government a postal treaty with the United States. He also introduced a uniform postal letter-rate of five cents, the average rate previously having been sixteen cents or thereabouts. In 1853, Mr. Morris vacated the post office department, and was appointed speaker of the Legislative Council, which office he held until the retirement of the Hincks-Morin administration, in the autumn of 1854.\n\nIn 1858, he was appointed a member of the Executive Council and speaker of the Legislative Council, on the advent to office of the Brown-Dorion administration, and retired with that administration on the governor-general (Sir Edmund Head), refusing to dissolve the house. Mr. Morris has not since been in office, but has continued in the discharge of his duties as a member of the Legislative Council, acting in concert with the reform party, with which he has always been identified.\n\n---\n\n**HON. P. B. DE BLAQUI\u00c8RE.**\n\nAnd now, we think, we cannot do better than present a notice of the late Honorable Peter Boyle de Blaquiere, who, for many years, was a member of the Legislative Council of this province, and a gentleman of high social and political standing. Mr. de Blaquiere held the title of \"honorable\" in his own right independently of his position as a member of the Legislative Council, being youngest son of John, Lord de Blaquiere, of Ardkill, county Londonderry. Mr. de Blaquiere was the descendant of a noble French gentleman who emigrated from France in consequence of the revocation of the edict of Nantes, and settled in London, as a merchant, where he died in 1753. In 1772 his fifth son, Lieutenant-Colonel John de Blaquiere was appointed principal secretary to the lord-lieutenant of Ireland; and in 1774, as a reward for his services, was invested with the order of the Bath. In 1784, he was created a baronet, and was sworn in one of the Irish Privy Council, and appointed great alnager, an officer whose duty it was in olden times to measure and examine woollen cloth, and fix upon it the royal seal. The post was abolished by an act of William. At the death of Sir\nJohn de Blaqui\u00e8re, the title devolved upon his eldest son, (brother of Mr. P. B. de Blaqui\u00e8re,) who in the year 1800 was elevated to the peerage as Baron de Blaqui\u00e8re of Ardkill. The title is now held by his grandson, John. So far as regards the honorable gentleman's descent and ancient lineage, they are among the least of his claims upon our regard. He was born in Dublin, on the 27th of April, 1784. When very young, he entered the navy and served as a midshipman under the celebrated Captain Bligh, of the Bounty, at the battle of Camperdown. He was also present at the mutiny of the Nore. Leaving the navy, however, at an early age, he devoted himself to more peaceful pursuits, and emigrated to Canada in 1837; here he soon attained to the highest honors. In 1838, he was selected as a fit person for a seat in the Legislative Council, which he continued to hold until the time of his death. On the remodelling of the Toronto university, he was appointed to the honorable office of chancellor, but subsequently resigned it. He was also a member of the Anglican Synod, where he commanded great respect. By that body his loss was severely felt. The Globe said of him on his decease:\n\n\"There are few men of whom we can speak in higher terms of respect. As a member of the Legislative Council, although it was our fortune frequently to differ from him in his political views, yet we ever recognised the fact that he did that which in his own eyes he thought best for his country. He was a man of strictest honor. He never sought by a trick to keep the letter of the law while manifestly breaking through its intent. During the first year that he occupied a seat in the Legislative Council, he did not take a very active part in its affairs, but of late he had become the leader of a large section of the house. Whenever he rose to speak, the strictest silence was observable, he was listened to with the greatest respect and attention, and no matter how heated the debate, how severe the contest, no opponent thought of using a harsh word towards him\u2014the sentiment of the house would not have tolerated it. His courtesy was of that character which can only be manifested by the thorough gentleman and sincere Christian. Prudent, of a kind heart, and a well cultivated mind, he was an exception to the rule applicable to most men, that as they increase in years the more conservative opinions they hold. Although nominated by the crown, he was one of those who voted for the bill rendering the speakers of the upper house elective, and it is probable that had he lived he would have been elevated to the chair. The respect in which he was held would have ensured the utmost deference to his decisions. In the Synod, he at least twice moved for the abrogation of the episcopal veto, but not with very great opposition. On the day of his death he was to all appearance in good health. Although so old a man, he was remarkably agile, and appeared\nmuch younger than he really was. The immediate cause of his decease was undoubtedly apoplexy.\"\n\nThe legislative career of Mr. de Blaquiere is one that might be cited as exhibiting the real and proper nature of conservatism: steadily and consistently maintaining our constitutional system, faithful to its spirit, liberal in its interpretation, he was ever ready to assist in judicious and necessary reforms, but strenuously opposed to all speculative innovations. Never extreme in his views, nor impassioned and importunate in his declaration of them, his remarks were always received with the utmost deference by his colleagues of the Council, and exercised on every occasion a salutary influence. He never had occasion to fluctuate in his opinions or to abandon them, for the simple reason that they were not the result of hasty adoption or conceived in the ranor of party enmity, but from well considered and long premeditation. Possessed of a well cultivated understanding and good powers of observation, his conclusions were usually correct. He was not remarkable for any great oratorical talents, but possessed a dignified and fluent persuasiveness, whose mildness often effected more than the most ardent rhetorical declamations; often indignant, he was never resentful, and generally the object of his indignation retired from it with a sense of self-reproach. One of his best public traits was his temperate and persistent advocacy of measures that he considered beneficial to his country, and, no matter by what class of opponents surrounded, for his never deviating from the course of rectitude to obtain them. He was at once the philosopher and the philanthropic statesman\u2014above the cabals of faction and uninfluenced by party considerations, when the commotions of angry debate ebbed and flowed through the Council Chamber, his serenity and composure fell upon its turbulent spirits with such effect that one silently recalled to mind the divine invocation to the troubled waters: \"Peace, be still!\"\n\nIt may not here be inappropriate to mention, that as chancellor of the university of Toronto, and as an enlightened legislator, he always felt a deep interest in the education of the people, and in the success of the operations of the educational department for Upper Canada. When that department was unjustly assailed in 1858, he expressed his warm sympathy with its efforts to promote the intellectual improvement of the country, and his readiness to defend its operations in his place in Parliament, should a favorable opportunity offer for his doing so.\n\nMr. de Blaquiere married, firstly, in 1804, Eliza, daughter of Denis O'Brien, Esq., of Newcastle, county Limerick; she died in 1814; secondly, in 1818, Eliza, second daughter of W. Roper, Esq., of Rathfarnham Castle, county Dublin, by both of whom he had large families.\n\nHe died at Yorkville, near Toronto, in October, 1860.\nHON. P. J. O. CHAUVEAU, LL.D.,\n\nSUPERINTENDENT OF EDUCATION FOR LOWER CANADA.\n\nPolitics and literature, if we except journalism, (with two or three exceptions) have seldom been united in Canada, except in the person of the Honorable Pierre J. O. Chauveau. This distinguished and honorable exception deserves especial notice. A colony is very prone to dwarf journalism into a mere instrument of individual ambition; and instances are not wanting of men covering themselves with fulsome and disgusting eulogy, either under their own proper names or behind a mask so thin that it served no purpose of deception. Rancorous pamphleteers, too, have written and lied their way to office. But Dr. Chauveau is the only public man that Canada has produced who united the novelist, the poet, and the politician. While others have confined themselves to the prosaic side of life, and have exhausted themselves in the struggle to secure or maintain office, he has risen to the dignity of the true artist, and made his pen sketch with lively colors the manners of the people of which he is one of the worthiest representatives in Canada. It is a relief to find a worthy representative of literature among the motley herd of colonial politicians, in whom, in spite of our excess of good nature, it is seldom easy to find anything on which to fix one's admiration. For this reason we take up our pencil with more than common pleasure to draw a faint outline of the gentleman whose name stands at the head of this notice.\n\nDr. Chauveau was born at Quebec, on the 30th May, 1820, where his father was a merchant. The progenitors of his father had been among the oldest settlers of Charlesbourg, near Quebec. His father dying when the son was but a child, the latter was brought up by his grandfather, Mr. Joseph Roy, one of the wealthiest and most influential citizens of Quebec. Still having the advantage of his mother's care, he also experienced much tenderness from his uncle, Judge Hamel. He was educated at the seminary of Quebec, where he went through a complete course. He studied law, partly under his uncles, Messrs. Hamel and Roy, and partly with G. Okill Stuart, Esq., Q.C., and here we may stop to remark that he regrets, in a novel entitled \"Charles Gu\u00e9rin,\" the limited career open to educated colonists. He may be a doctor, notary, advocate or priest, and he must be one of these or nothing. Outside these professions there is no career for him. If any one has an invincible repugnance for all these professions, there are two things for him if he is poor, one\nif he is rich; in the latter case, to do nothing, in the former, to expatriate himself, or die of starvation. Such is the theory of Mr. Chauveau as to the choice of profession in a colony where the army is closed to him; but this complaint has partly ceased to be true since the formation of the 100th Regiment, if ever it was. There are no extensive manufactories, and not much chance to become a \"merchant prince.\" Whether from choice, or the necessity of the case, Mr. Chauveau chose the profession of an advocate, but leaving the law on the first opportunity, would seem to show that he had no great or abiding love for it.\n\nThe talents of Dr. Chauveau first attracted attention by some political effusions that appeared in Le Canadien, from 1838 to 1841. After this, he glided gradually into politics, by descanting upon Canadian affairs in Le Courrier des \u00c9tats-Unis, published at New York. These letters were regularly copied into the Canadien, and sometimes into the French papers, and they may be said to have formed the stepping-stone by which he walked into public life. They made him known as one who had bestowed a good deal of thought on Canadian politics; and he was, in fact, already a politician.\n\nIt was in 1844 that he was first elected to Parliament, the county of Quebec having preferred him to the Honorable John Neilson, one of the oldest politicians, and the most respectable man in the country, who had long been a member of the legislature in Lower Canada prior to the union, and who was still editor of a newspaper in Quebec, founded by his family in the previous century. Mr. Chauveau's majority was over a thousand, a remarkable victory for a young man to achieve over such a veteran as he had for an opponent. Nor was this success due to one of those fleeting freaks of popular humor which in a short time leave the idol of to-day a neglected and despised man to-morrow. At the next election, in 1848, Dr. Chauveau was re-elected by acclamation. On entering the house, he was no idle spectator of its proceedings, but at once took an active part in the debates. The position that he took was that of a steady adherent of the Lafontaine-Baldwin opposition. In 1846, Mr. Caron was disposed to listen to overtures from the conservatives, and entered into a long correspondence* with Mr. Draper, then premier, about how many offices could be got in the cabinet in return for the support of the French Canadians, who were then unanimous in opposition. Mr. Caron counted without his host, for his attempt to wrest the leadership of the French Canadians from the powerful grip of Mr. Lafontaine was an inglorious failure. During this attempt, Dr. Chauveau remained faithful\n\n---\n\n*Correspondence between the Hon. W. H. Draper and the Hon. R. E. Caron; and between the Hon. R. E. Caron and the Honorables L. H. Lafontaine and A. N. Morin, referred to in a recent debate in the Legislative Assembly (containing many suppressed letters).\u2014Montreal: Desbarats & Derbishire.\nto Mr. Lafontaine. The election of 1848 was a keen contest; there was much at stake. Lord Metcalfe had governed the country for nine months by a single minister, a secretary to record his will. The temper of the public mind was sorely tried, and indignation reached a high pitch. On this occasion, the most momentous in the history of Canada, Dr. Chauveau was elected to write the manifesto of the reform committee of Quebec, a document which formed the political creed of his party at the hustings. The result of the election was a signal victory for the liberals.\n\nBefore Mr. Lafontaine was called upon to form a cabinet, in connection with Mr. Baldwin in 1848, he had made up the quarrel with Mr. Caron. Feeling himself strong, he made his arrangements without consulting the members for the district of Quebec. It has always been understood that Dr. Chauveau resented this; at all events, he assumed a position of independence. He was, however, led further than his judgment would now be likely to approve, in joining Mr. Papineau in his demand that the representation of the people be based on the population alone. No one, we believe, would be more ready than Mr. Chauveau to admit that this was the political error of his life. When the rebellion losses bill was under discussion, in 1849, he took strong ground against the exclusion of the Bermuda exiles, who had been illegally banished, and who, for that reason, were to be denied what he considered common justice. In the same year Dr. Chauveau obtained a committee to enquire into the causes of the emigration of French Canadians to the United States, and many of the suggestions which he then made have since been acted upon. This emigration is due in part to the same causes as that from the eastern to the western states; so true is it that \"westward the star of empire takes its way.\"\n\nDr. Chauveau was appointed solicitor-general in 1851, and provincial-secretary in 1853. He resigned the latter office on the resignation of Mr. Morin, in 1855, and was appointed superintendent of education in July of the same year. For the office he now fills, Mr. Chauveau is by universal consent the fittest man in Lower Canada.\n\nHe is a well educated man, of cultivated literary tastes. His greatest work is \"Charles Gutrin, Roman de Moeurs Canadiennes,\" a work of 359 pages, which gives a graphic picture of French Canadian life and society. It was the first French Canadian novel ever published, having been issued in 1853; and, strange to say, a publisher was found to take the risk of the enterprise, and pay the author a certain stipulated sum in addition.\n\nAs superintendent of education for Lower Canada, Dr. Chauveau has given general satisfaction. Under his administration\u2014for he is, to all intents and purposes a minister, though not liable to be turned out of office by an adverse parliamentary majority\u2014the normal schools have been established in Lower Canada, and much has\nbeen done for the cause of education in various ways in that section of the most important province of the empire.\n\nDr. Chauveau married in 1840, a Miss Moss, of Quebec, by whom he has had seven children, one of whom (a beautiful child) died prior to his departure from Quebec, in 1855.\n\nJEAN BLANCHET, Esq., M.D., M.R.C.S.\n\nThis justly celebrated medical practitioner was born at the Parish of St. Pierre de la Rivi\u00e8re du Sud, on the 17th of May, 1795; and was the son of an humble but respectable and well-to-do farmer of that place.\n\nHis early years were spent at home, and his education was received at the seminary of Quebec, which he left at the age of seventeen, to study the medical profession with his uncle, the late Dr. F. Blanchet, (a notice of whom appears elsewhere.) For this profession he had a great predilection. In 1818, when twenty-two years of age, not feeling satisfied with the course of his studies in this country, although pursued under so able an instructor as his uncle, he determined to pass a short period in Europe under the great masters in surgery and medicine. In company with Doctors Parent and Mercier of Quebec, therefore, he studied at London during a portion of that year, then proceeded to Paris, where he followed, at the Hotel-Dieu, the courses of Dupuytren; and at the Hospital du Gros Caillou, the Clinique chirurgicale of Larrey. Retiring to London, he enjoyed the instructions of Sir Astley Cooper, Sir Wm. Blizard; of Curry and Blundell. In 1820, he obtained a diploma, after passing a satisfactory examination before the Royal College of Surgeons, London. A short time afterwards, having satisfactorily accomplished the object of his journey, he returned to his native country.\n\nAnd here he at once raised for himself a great reputation in surgical skill. And his position in the profession was considerably enhanced on his succeeding, in 1830, to the practice of his uncle. He speedily rose to wealth as well as eminence. In the two great visitations of cholera which affected this country, no medical man labored more arduously in behalf of his fellow creatures than did Jean Blanchet. He braved every danger to come to their succor, and was eminently useful and successful in his endeavors. He was the friend of the poor, kind and charitable in his relations toward them, and he never refused a favor. He received many talents and honors as a physician, and served as a member of the Board of Health on account of his services.\n\nOn the death of the president, he succeeded him in that post.\n\nIn 1836, he was elected for the office of mayor. Against this election, he protested, but was pressed into the office.\n\nThe city was indebted to him for the discovery of a little-known disease, which is described in detail together with other events of his life, all of which are due to his exertions.\n\nLILLY, Esq.\n\nThree generations have served in the legislative administration of this province, as mentioned above.\n\nSir William Lilly, of Mulgrave, son-in-law of Hill, was a member of the House of Assembly for ten years. His only daughter was Mrs. Hill. He first entered parliament when he served as a member for Spain,\ntowards all under him; earnest and persevering in his endeavors, he never gave up a subject until the last, and he hardly ever failed. He rose, destined by his own merits to become one of the most talented professional men in the country. He became visiting physician to the Marine and Emigrant Hospital at Quebec, as well as a member of the various medical bodies, as also a member of the Board of Examiners. The former he reluctantly gave up in 1848, on account of the great increase in his practice.\n\nOn the founding of the Laval university in 1853, he was named president of the faculty and professor of medicine and physiology, posts which he held up to the day of his death.\n\nIn 1884, he entered the Parliament of Lower Canada as member for the county of Quebec; and continued to sit until the rebellion. Again, in 1854, he was returned as one of the members for the city, but sat only for a portion of the Parliament; ill health and press of business compelling him to resign.\n\nThe latter years of his life were to a great extent embittered by the disease, the gravel, which he had contracted, and he shewed not a little courage and fortitude in submitting to an operation, which is described by medical men to be most terrible. This disease, together with his great labors, which he continued to the last, eventually carried him off on the 22nd April, 1857, to the regret of all who knew him. He never married, and left a large fortune to his nephew, the present Dr. Blanchet.\n\nLIEUT.-GENERAL SIR W. ROWAN, K.C.B.\n\nThis gentleman, a gallant and experienced military officer, who served here, firstly, as commander of the forces, and secondly as administrator of the government, deserves to be honorably mentioned in a work of this description.\n\nSir William is the eighth son of the late Robert Rowan, Esq., of Mullens and Garry, county Antrim, Ireland, by the daughter of Hill Wilson, Esquire, of Purdyburn, county Down; brother of the late Sir Charles Rowan, K.C.B., commissioner of metropolitan police. He was born in 1789, and married in 1811, the third daughter of the late John Spong, Esquire, of Mill Hall, Kent. He first entered the army as ensign, in the 62nd Regiment, in 1808; he served twenty-five years with that regiment, in Sicily, Portugal, Spain, France, Belgium, (at Waterloo) and North America; was\ncivil and military secretary to Lord Seaton, in Canada, from 1832, to 1839; attained the rank of major-general in 1846. In 1849, he was appointed to command the forces in this country, which he did until 1855, and during a portion of that period, administered the government, during the absence of the Earl of Elgin, in England. In 1854, he was made a lieutenant-general and colonel of the 19th Foot.\n\nRIGHT HON. SIR E. W. HEAD, BART., K.C.B.\n\nThe family of our late esteemed governor-general, is one of the most ancient and honorable in the United Kingdom. According to Burke, it is of antiquity in Kent, (where the family seat is,) and derived its surname from the Kentish district, now called Hythe, but formerly known as Le Hede. The first baronet was Richard Head, Esquire, upon whom that honor was conferred, on 19th June, 1676. This gentleman \"represented Rochester in Parliament, and resided in that city; received King James upon his abdication, and was presented by that monarch with a valuable emerald ring.\" Three of the following baronets entered the church, indeed the one who immediately preceded Sir Edmund, his father, Sir John Head, was in holy orders. He died on the 4th of January, 1838, and was succeeded by the subject of this notice, who was an only son, and had but one sister, now the Baroness de Milanges.\n\nSir Edmund W. Head was born in 1805. He was educated at Winchester, and entered as a gentleman commoner of Oriel college, Oxford; a position which, independent of giving him the right to wear a silk gown, afforded him immunity from the rigid routine and compulsory lectures of the college\u2014a gentleman commoner being regarded as a personage whose fortune is already made, and whose sojourn at the university is for the purpose of obtaining every advantage but that of literature. The collegiate curriculum is three years, and after passing about half this period in the usual easy manner, proper to his position, his associates were surprised to find young Head devoting himself with the closest application to the study of Aristotle, and deep in ethics and rhetoric\u2014such sciences, in fact, as were necessary to the attainment of the highest classical honors. At the expiration of his term he was awarded, after a brilliant examination, first class in literis humanioribus. Almost immediately after, a fellowship of Meroton college becoming\nvacant, he tried for it, was elected, and was offered after a short time the tutorship\u2014an office which he accepted and sustained for five years. His acceptance of a situation honorable to his talents, but considered to be beneath his position as a gentleman commoner of Oriel, and heir to an ancient baronetcy, explained in some measure, perhaps the secret of his sudden laborious assiduity. Pecuniary losses in his family had, in fact, told him clearly that he must depend for his promotion in life mainly on his own exertions. His constant access to the continent had early given him a taste for the acquisition of languages, and he has the reputation of being one of the first linguists of the age. While tutor of Mereton an article of his in the Foreign Quarterly Review, attracted the attention of the Marquis of Lansdowne, the great English Macenas, to whose judicious discrimination England is indebted for the early rise of the late Lord (then plain Thomas Babington) Macaulay, the historian.\n\nThe Marquis found out the author, and the result of the interview was, that Mr. Head resigned his tutorship, an appointment worth some six or seven hundred pounds a year, in order to devote himself to the study of ecclesiastical law. He had, however, scarcely taken the preliminary steps before the government made him an offer of a poor-law assistant-commissionership, with a thousand pound a year, and travelling expenses. In this situation Mr. Head acquitted himself so well, that on a change of administration, though opposed to him in politics, the late Sir James Graham, then minister of the home department, promoted him to be chief commissioner, with a salary double the former one. Now, however, there occurred a change in his tide of fortune; he had succeeded to the family title, and shrewd men of all parties were unanimous in supporting him, in the difficult administration his office devolved upon him; but there arose such a clamor\u2014principally urged on by the Times newspaper\u2014against the new poor law, that committee after committee, and parliamentary inquiries without end, were brought to bear upon it: and though the closest scrutiny could find no hole or rent in the conduct of the chief commissioner, the ministry of the day were obliged to give way, and reconstruct the whole administration. The government of New Brunswick, was then given to Sir Edmund Head, and knowing his great talents, it was a matter of surprise to his friends that his services had not long before been summoned to a higher sphere. It is not impossible that the presence of Sir J. Graham in the coalition ministry of that day may have had something to do with his promotion to the government of Canada in 1854. It must be recorded to the honor of Sir Edmund Head, that on conscientious motives he refused to enter the profession of his father\u2014that of the church\u2014in which some of his ancestors had risen to the highest eminence. It was\nintimated to him at an early period, after the credit he had done himself at Oxford, that the House of Lords should be opened to him at the earliest opportunity, if he took holy orders. But Sir Edmund, with that firmness which is so distinguishing a feature of his character, one which he certainly did not inherit from his otherwise excellent father, was deaf to the Syren voice which wooed him to an early career of purple and fine linen. His private character has throughout been unblemished, and the same fixed will which enabled him to break through the luxurious sloth of his natural position, to refuse every pecuniary assistance from his father, and to carve out a line for himself. Throughout life he has shown a character for firmness and determination, in anything which he undertakes or conceives that will prove beneficial. His whole course during his administration in this colony, clearly demonstrates this. He possesses a good judgment and a fine discrimination, which were also shewn here, in an eminent degree. \"No one can serve two masters,\" is an old and a trite adage, and in a country like Canada, with a mixed community, and a variety of parties, it is totally impossible for a governor to please all. Sir Edmund maintained a good polity; he shewed what a good judgment he possessed of character and worldly matters, when he would not allow the leader of a party to take an advantage of him, cunning though he were, and endowed with all the blandishments of a man desirous of entering into office. Because Sir Edmund would not accede to his demands, and allow the name of his sovereign to be insulted, by not carrying out her commands in the seat of government question, he was branded with calumny and vituperation, and called everything but a gentleman. This his excellency resisted with exemplary patience, and either laughed at the calumniator who uttered it, or held him in too much scorn and contempt to deign to notice his conduct. But mark his good judgment; the party he called into power, was strong and most effective, and did more in the country's welfare than would have been done by the other. Thus, like the immortal Duke of Wellington, Sir Edmund did not aim at \"glory,\" but \"duty,\" that sacred word which it is the honor and boast of every Englishman to regard as a primary consideration.\n\nIn his private and social life here, Sir Edmund Head being an ardent scholar, was a little retired, and not sufficiently \"lavish\" to please some persons. This must be ascribed to the proper motive, a love of retirement, accompanied with family affliction\u2014the loss by drowning of his only son, a youth of excellent attainments, in the bloom of life, who undoubtedly would have risen to distinction as a scientific man, had it pleased an all wise Providence to have spared him. This was ordained otherwise, and although Sir Edmund has borne up manfully under the affliction, there are moments, when the most powerful, brought in remembrance of\nthose who have been called away from them, cannot restrain the falling tear. \"We are all mortal.\" It is said that a peerage will be conferred upon him, for his services in Canada; but like Burke when offered that honor, after the death of his son, it will perhaps be declined by him.\n\nSir Edmund has contributed to the periodical literature of the age; and an article on Canada, written some time since, in a celebrated London magazine, is ascribed to him. He has written \"Shall and Will,\" \"A Handbook of Spanish Painting,\" in two vols., both published by Murray, and \"The Temple of Serapis at Pozzuoli,\" published by J. B. Nichols, & Co., London, 1858, works which are highly thought of, especially the two latter.\n\nHe married in November, 1838, Anna Maria, daughter of the late Rev. Philip Yorke, grandson of the first Earl of Hardwicke; and by her has had one son and two daughters, both the latter living. Lady Head is a kind and charitable woman, and much esteemed in Canada; she will long be remembered with gratitude for her many kindnesses by the poor of Quebec and Toronto.\n\nISAAC BUCHANAN, Esq., M.P.P.,\n\nWas born at Glasgow, N.B., on the 21st July, 1810, and is the fourth son of the late Peter Buchanan, Esquire, of Auchmar, an ancient seat of the Buchanans, on the banks of Loch Lomond, Stirlingshire, on the confines of Dumbartonshire, a spot historically interesting, being the very gateway between the highlands and lowlands at the pass of Ballmaha, through which the robber McGregor herded such cattle as were unprotected by black mail. Mr. Buchanan's father was a merchant of high standing in Glasgow. The estate, comprising an area of fourteen hundred acres, and including the hill immediately south of Ben Lomond, the last of the Grampian range, was sold to the Duke of Montrose in 1830, by Peter Buchanan, Esq., the younger, recently deceased, who afterwards joined his brother, Isaac, and put the money got for Auchmar into his extensive Canadian business. This beautiful property had been long coveted by the noble house that now possesses it, not only on account of its romantic situation and fine shooting, but for its contiguity to Buchanan House, the ducal seat, and because Auchmar was the only spot in the whole parish of Buchanan which com-\nprised the entire eastern side of Loch Lomond, not then included in the duke's magnificent domain.\n\nMr. Buchanan was carefully educated, passing from the Glasgow grammar school to a preparatory training for the Glasgow college, under the celebrated scholar and antiquary, the Reverend Dr. Graham, of Aberfoyle, who assured the pupil's father that his son would take the highest honors at the university. Mr. Buchanan, however, was not destined to undergo the university ordeal, having met with an incident, when on his way one day about the beginning of October, 1825, to purchase his college gown, which presented to his view an entirely new career.\n\nMeeting in the street a friend of his father, John Leadbetter, Esq., he was informed by that gentleman that he could secure for him a rare opening in the house of William Guild & Co., West India and Honduras merchants, and was then on his way to mention the thing to his father. The boy immediately caught at the proposition, having formerly observed how many sons of the first families in Glasgow had failed to obtain desirable openings when prepared for them. Though his father was absent at Auchmar, and would not return for a month, he resolved at once, on his own responsibility, to accept the proffered appointment for a short period, urging upon Mr. Leadbetter, who showed some hesitation, that if the father disapproved, he could still go to college.\n\nHe had been a month with Messrs. Guild & Co. before his father became acquainted with this change in his son's destiny, who though feeling much disappointment of the hopes he had cherished of his boy's literary success, however yielded to his inclinations, and Isaac became permanently fixed in business at the early age of 15. Within three years he was in a position of great responsibility, from an extraordinary concurrence of circumstances, leading to an almost unparalleled rapidity of advancement. Before he was the age of 20, he was taken in as a partner, and in 1833, the Canadian branch of the business was wholly transferred to him.\n\nPrevious to his coming to Canada, in 1830, Mr. Buchanan had distinguished himself by dispensing with all the nonsense of intricate book-keeping, and by instituting the most valuable reforms or simplifications in the book-keeping forms of statements, &c., which are still in use throughout the extensive ramifications of his former and present business connections. In his boyhood, Mr. Buchanan had been surrounded by the happiest influences, his father being an elder in the Church of Scotland, and his mother being one of those loveliest spirits who in life and death experience and illustrate \"the peace that passeth all understanding;\" and he has carried the fruits of his early prepossessions with him into the world, for in a recent election address, we find him uttering the following manly declaration: \"My more immediate friends can understand how, with such favorable views of the prime minister [the Honorable John A.\nMcDonald], I could be the independent member I have been. I hope this arises from my being possessed of enough of the Scottish character to have the fear of God, and to have no other fear\u2014to be able to realize myself as being perpetually in a higher presence than that of statesmen or kings.\"\n\nAnd those alone who know the man best can testify how fearless is his conduct in the presence of the mere face of clay.\n\nSo intense were his physical and mental labors in the early career of his manhood, and while laying the foundation of his since eminent house, that his health became endangered, nor was the relaxation he sought such as youth generally flies to, the only diversion of mind he allowed himself being an attendance on the medical and philosophical classes of the Glasgow college. At no period of his life has he been heart or brain idle, a sound constitution enabling him to perform an amount of work almost incredible.\n\nTHE PIONEER OF THE TRADE OF UPPER CANADA.\n\nUpper Canada is indebted to Mr. Buchanan for the early development of that immense wholesale trade now carried on in that province. In the fall of 1831, he established a branch of his business in Toronto; his brother merchants of Montreal, laughing at his presumption. Had that course been a prudent and profitable one, was it to be supposed that the old fathers in the trade would not have adopted it? In vain they laughed, in vain they warned and foretold Mr. Buchanan's speedy discomfiture and return from the \"far west\" with his unbroken shipments of goods unsold. But the supposed folly of to-day proved the wisdom of to-morrow. The house of Buchanan & Co. flourished in the wilderness. His timid competitors found that a march had been stolen upon them, and one after another followed as they saw how well the ice bore. The pioneer, however, kept the lead. A branch of their business was subsequently pushed on to Hamilton, and from thence to London, where a magnificent building has been erected by his firm there, Adam Hope & Co., forming at once an ornament to that rapidly improving young city, and a monument of the enterprise and success of the house of the Buchanans and their business associates.\n\nTo be the pioneer of a great trade, in a great country, necessarily involves his being a party to the originating of all those institutions which mark the difference between civilization and barbarism\u2014churches, educational systems, hospitals, asylums, news rooms and commercial exchanges, boards of trade, national and immigration societies, insurance offices, banks, trust and loan companies, steam navigation, telegraphing, &c., &c., &c., and last, though not least, railroading. Mr. Buchanan's and Buchanan, Harris & Co.'s early and successful efforts, both in Canada and Britain, for the Great\nWestern Railway are universally known and appreciated as having been quite essential to its construction. He moved the first resolution at the public meeting at Hamilton, when it was resuscitated in 1845, and with his brother and Mr. Atcheson, organized the subsequent meeting in Manchester, which secured the railway's construction.\n\nSTATE OF CANADIAN POLITICS THIRTY YEARS AGO.\n\nVery soon after coming to Canada, Mr. Buchanan became satisfied that two matters, affecting vitally the peace and prosperity of the Canadas, were wrong. Lower and Upper Canada were both ruled by oligarchies, which, even if they might be the best monopolies possible, from the individuals being the best men in the province, must pass away before there could be political quiet in the country. In Lower Canada it was a mercantile oligarchy not unlike the present \"Manchester School\" in England; each governor being expected to see through the eyes of the Quebec and Montreal merchants, whose interest was diametrically opposed to those of the great mass of the people; the interest of the latter being to have high not low prices for their productions, just as it is the interest of the weavers in England to have good, not bad wages. In Upper Canada, on the other hand, it was a Church of England oligarchy, whose most fatal blunder was in insisting that the Scottish Church Establishment was a dissenting church in Canada. It was the Scotch, being left in this injured and degraded position, that made the conspirators of 1837 see any chance for rebellion.\n\nCLERGY RESERVE QUESTION.\n\nThe first proposition for a settlement of the Clergy Reserves in Upper Canada, without secularising them, was made by Mr. Buchanan. In 1835 he published, as an extra of the Toronto Albion, which was widely circulated, a plan for the settlement of \"this vexed and difficult question,\" in which he startled people by asserting that there was no difficulty in understanding and settling it, only that they took this old idea for granted, and would not apply their minds to it. There was then no common school system, and his plan was simply to establish one by compulsory tax or assessment, having a column for each Christian sect in the schedule, and having thus ascertained the field for usefulness of each religious body, to give them for religion the same sum as they are respectively assessed for education, or a sum in exact proportion to this out of the clergy reserve fund.\n\nMr. Poulett Thompson on his coming to Toronto in 1839 sent for Mr. Buchanan. Very shortly before, while in Scotland, Mr. Buchanan had drawn out the petition from the city of Glasgow to the Queen, stating that such an appointment of a man chiefly known as con-\nnected with Russia and the interests of the Baltic, and an enemy of the colonies, like Mr. Thompson, would throw paralysis into every British interest abroad, and praying her Majesty \"to reconsider the appointment and to select for this important dependency a governor not known to be inimical to the great interests which he is sent to protect and promote!\" The London Times had devoted two leading articles to it, and had declared that had equally strong remonstrances come from other great places, Lord John Russell, the then colonial minister, must have kept Mr. Thompson at home. Mr. Buchanan mentioned this to the secretary, Mr. Murdock, who brought to him the governor-general's summons, and made Mr. Murdock promise to make a point of having it mentioned to his excellency before the interview, as he declined sailing under false colors.\n\nIt was about the clergy reserve question that the governor-general desired to see Mr. Buchanan; and his excellency afterwards, when he visited Hamilton the following summer, indicated to him that his plain declaration that the Scotch could not be expected to be loyal to \"a government that made them dissenters by act of Parliament,\" had greatly affected Lord John Russell and the home ministry.\n\nThe following year the term \"a Protestant clergy\" was declared to include the ministers of the Scottish establishment, and danger No. 1 was thus got over; but still the peace of the country was threatened by the state in which the question was left. The province seemed worse pleased with a two, than it had been with a one, headed monster! And after it had for a dozen years been the stock-in-trade of the political agitators, who really did not desire its settlement, the question was at length brought to the hustings in 1854. Having proposed an anti-clergy reserve league which should never be let down till equal justice was done to all sects, Mr. Buchanan allowed his name to be used against Sir Allan MacNab, to enable parties, by their votes, to record their view that the peace of the province required an immediate settlement of the clergy reserve question, and to save his election, Sir Allan at last promised his friends that he and his political allies would no longer stop the way. Fifteen years previously Mr. Buchanan had given evidence before the Commission of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, and during a much longer period had kept up constant communication on the subject with Principal McFarlane, Dr. Welch, and other leaders of the church, as well as with the Marquis of Bute, her Majesty's Commissioner to the Church, whose friendship Mr. Buchanan enjoyed. The intimacy, especially with Dr. Welch, which he had kept up (his family having been members of Dr. Welch's congregation when in Glasgow,) was of material public benefit as increasing the doctor's interest in the Canadian church question, and in giving him greater confidence in making his magnificent report as convener of the Colonial Com-\nmittee, which may be said to have settled the question. Dr. Welch had one of the finest minds of the day, and a man whose friendship was a great honor as well as privilege; he was moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, when the disruption occurred in 1843, and having seceded, he was the first moderator of the Free Church. Mr. Buchanan was one of twenty friends whom Dr. Welch asked to endow the Free Church college, in Edinburgh, by giving a thousand pounds each. Mr. Buchanan replied, that he would give the amount, but that he felt it would be more natural that his subscription should be applied to assist the Free Church college and churches in Canada\u2014and so the money was applied.\n\nSUSPENSION OF SPECIE PAYMENTS IN 1837.\n\nFor the first ten years after coming to Canada, Mr. Buchanan used to visit the British markets nearly every year, and he arrived out at New York in the spring of 1837, to witness a dreadful financial crisis. The evening he landed, he was in company with eleven of the first merchants of New York, nine of whom had suspended, and on the apparently solvent two being twittered as unfortunate \"men still in the body,\" one of them whispered to Mr. Buchanan, \"just till Monday.\" The streets were full of an enraged populace threatening the banks, and his fellow passengers lost not a moment in getting on board the north river steamer leaving New York. Mr. Buchanan, however, remained in New York for many days, and mingling with all sorts of people, satisfied himself that the then patent facts entirely corroborated the views of money he had always held; he then came into Canada, and being president of the Toronto Board of Trade, moved successfully in getting Parliament called together in June, which passed a bank relief bill that saved the trade and industry of the province from overthrow. The bill enabled the banks to suspend if necessary without forfeiting their charters. The simple argument Mr. Buchanan used with \"the members\" and people in general was this: The banks of the United States have suspended specie payments, and every silver dollar taken from Canada will for the Americans who take it, pay a debt of a dollar and a quarter, from specie having gone to a premium. It is clear then that to possess themselves of our specie they can bring over their commodities and undersell our farmers and other producers twenty per cent, so that unless our banks in Canada get the power also to suspend, our producers will be seriously injured:\n\n1st. By reducing their prices.\n2nd. By depriving them of their home market.\n3rd. By removing the basis of the circulation\u2014thus still more lessening prices and reducing the markets of the farmer, preventing\nthe importers paying their British creditors, and causing incalculable distress unnecessarily to every class in the province.\n\nHimself seriously impressed on the importance of the subject, Mr. Buchanan has at every returning panic entered the field of explanation in the New York and Canadian newspapers. He believes that (while also a great evil to the working classes in England) the principle of money law which both the United States and Canada have borrowed from England, decrees that the American producers must forever remain \"hewers of wood and drawers of water\" to middlemen in Europe; that in a word, while the foreigner for our paper money can get, at a price fixed by law, the portable article gold which he can lay down on the other side of the Atlantic at a cost of one per cent, he cannot be expected to take in lieu thereof any American commodity except at the price thereof in Europe, less the charges to take it there and a very full margin. So that to the extent there is any inflation here, through paper money, or through prosperity from any other cause, the foreign importer gets the advantage over our home producers as getting the increased price for his wares, without paying any increased price which he should do if the law of supply and demand were allowed equally to affect gold for his foreign exchange, that being a convertible term for gold, the article whose price is fixed by law!\n\nIt may here be remarked that Mr. Buchanan considers the ill success hitherto of the British currency reformers to have arisen from their ignorantly attacking Peel's bills of 1844 and 1845, measures for the mere regulation of banking and for the security of the bank note circulation; while the bill that they should attack is Peel's bill of 1819, this being the measure embodying Peel's \"science\" of money which is so suicidal.\n\nHIS GREAT NERVE AND INDOMITABLE PERSEVERANCE.\n\nPossessed of an active and powerful brain, of benevolent and liberal instincts, wealth that buoys him harmlessly over the malignant buffetings of a sea of factions, the fury of which can only be realized by those experienced in the ways of a colonial democracy, it is not to be wondered at that Mr. Buchanan, while pursuing his own course of ameliorating our social and political evils, should come in for his share of that virulent abuse and misrepresentation that is meted out to all our public men in proportion to their prominence. But with the well fortified subject of our sketch it is, indeed, like biting the file, and there is no greater treat to the reporter's gallery in our House of Assembly than to witness the manner in which these petty assaults are received and turned. The imperturbable good temper, the quaint and witty retort, followed by that well known and peculiar hollow sounding and derisive laugh from the chest, which leaves the muscles of the face unmoved\nlike the mask on the \"chorus\" of a Greek play, are irresistibly droll, and always throws the house into a fit of uncontrollable laughter at the assailant's expense.\n\nIt is, however, in his writings, his public addresses, letters and pamphlets, that the force and disinterestedness of Mr. Buchanan's mind is best seen; they are not, perhaps, models of style, for they are thrown off in great haste from a brain teeming with valuable and practical ideas, and often with too little time to reflect whether all the lower links of his argument are as self-evident to his hearers or readers as a quarter of a century has made them to his mind; but they are ample to show what such a mind could accomplish if freed from the shackles and cares of an overwhelming mercantile business, and devoted entirely to the instruction of his fellow-men. His retorts upon some of his newspaper assailants are often excellent. On one occasion he replies as follows, to what may be called the N. Y. Herald of Canada:\n\n\"Even when an unmitigated falsehood is not told by this newspaper, its statements regarding me, and all those whom it sees its interest in opposing, have just as much truth in them as to make a good lie,\" adding the following quotation from Tennyson: \"A lie that is all a lie, may be met and fought with outright. A lie that is part a truth, is a harder matter to fight. A lie that is half a truth is ever the blackest of lies.\"\n\nOn another occasion, he says: \"This newspaper talks of me as having stated that I would prefer failing in large transactions to succeeding in small ones, while all the time well knowing that my remarks were to quite another point, having been made at the opening of the Great Western Railway. Referring to the local enemies of the railway, and to those who had done little or nothing for this great enterprise, I expressed my contempt for small men, faithless and unbelieving, who busy their minds with small matters, in which success is little honor, and failure disgraceful; while my course had been to associate my name with great and worthy objects, in which, even in failure, one is associated with greatness, as well as what in his own mind at least is goodness.\" Much cheering, says the newspaper from which we quote, followed this happy explanation.\n\nAnd the following, from another hustings speech, is admirably put, but can only be fully appreciated by those acquainted with our Canadian politicians:\n\n\"I do not appear before you as an aspirant for your future suffrages, for these I trust a truly British and patriotic local candidate will deserve and get, but as a common soldier in the army of the PARTY OF ORDER, formed of those, like myself, of the old Liberal party, who are willing to be called 'conservative-liberals,' and of those who, like many of the best men in the country, whom experience of the province have made 'liberal conservatives.'\"\n\"And persons connected with Canada.\"\n\n\"From these hustings at the nomination, I told you that my experience of the opposition is, that their leaders will not reply to or allow their elections to rest upon questions as to their principles or policy, seeing that they have not any! They remove the question or issue to the character of their opponents. They have borrowed their tactics from Robespierre and the French revolutionists. The latter, to get quit of their opponents, guillotined their heads; the former (our Clear Grit chiefs) try to guillotine the characters of their opponents by means of their mercenary press.\" (Hear, hear.)\n\nThe following too, from Mr. Buchanan's speech at the declaration of the poll at Hamilton, in 1857, as placing character and principle beyond the mere accident of success, deserves to be recorded:\n\n\"To return to our immediate position this day, I should have stood as the head of a minority, with as proud a mind as I now stand at the head of my vast majority. (Cheers.) Our success is most valuable at this crisis to the province, as well as to Hamilton, in securing us the power of doing much good, and in preventing our opponent being used as the instrument of infinite harm. (Cheers.) But still I shall never, either in private or public matters, consent that my character be dependent on my success; for in that case no success would mean no character. The character we care for is the mere expression of our principles, and of which no want of success can deprive us.\" (Great cheering.)\n\nIt is but too evident that without character, principles and ability, and these in the highest degree, such success as has followed Mr. Buchanan in his mercantile career, could not have been achieved. As a merchant and political economist, his reputation is at once European and American. Since the death of his widely lamented brother, Peter, than whom no man in any country ever stood higher as a merchant or as a gentleman, Mr. Buchanan is senior partner in the firm of Peter Buchanan & Co., Glasgow; Isaac Buchanan & Co., New York; I. Buchanan, Harris & Co., Montreal; Buchanan, Harris & Co., Hamilton, C. W.; and Adam Hope & Co., London, C. W. His connexion with the trade of Canada is now of thirty-three years' standing, the house being established in Montreal, in 1828, and it will be a happy day for Canada when she can boast the existence of a larger class of the same stamp.\n\nAnd yet there are in our strangely constituted society, men whose sole stock in trade consists only of a few reams of paper and a box of pens, the beginning and end of whose exertions seem entirely devoted to driving such men as Mr. Buchanan from the political arena altogether; a system copied from the adjoining states, and to the success of which their public writers are now attributing all the evils which that unhappy country is suffering from. Had the same kind of politicians succeeded here, precisely the same results would have followed. Impudence and public\nswindling would have been the order of the day. Worth, truth, and a zealous and persistent course in the path of public duty, would have been disqualifying ingredients in a politician's character, while the possession of ample means would at once mark the owner as one who could neither be trusted in the concoction of a scheme of public plunder, or hushed by the tender of a share of it. Undoubted as has been the success of the moderate policy adopted by Messrs. Macdonald & Cartier for the last few years, it is impossible to overrate the strength of that moral support which the attachment of such men as Isaac Buchanan has brought to them. But it must be admitted that he had little choice.\n\nTHE QUESTION OF LABOR OR OF OUR OWN PEOPLE'S EMPLOYMENT.\n\nOf the many subjects which seem to have occupied Mr. Buchanan's mind, the great cause of labor is that to which he has devoted the greatest amount of thought and effort. He maintains that mere production, or the mere existence of food, is not the first necessary of life, under a state of civilisation. He says that employment is the first necessary in our state of society, seeing that it in no degree relieves the poor man to know that all the granaries of the neighborhood are full of breadstuffs, if he is without the employment, which is the only key to these granaries. He holds the question of our home labor to be unspeakably more important than the question of our external trade; the labor being the necessity, the trade the incident. He has striven that men should really eat and be satisfied with the bread they may earn by the sweat of their brow or of their brain, and not be perpetually offered up as a holocaust at the shrine of mammon, or become a mere part of the machinery which he oils and drives, and be looked upon by his employers with as little interest as the cranks and wheels of the world's great power loom, in the din of which all uncertain sounds are drowned, together with the moans of the toil-worn. Mr. Buchanan differs from the free traders and political economists not only as denying that theirs is in truth a system of free exports, while it certainly is a system of free imports, but in this, that their heartfelt interest is in the web, while his is in the weaver; theirs in the produce; his in the producer.\n\nOne of the greatest compliments (according to his own estimation) paid to Mr. Buchanan in Britain, was by the working classes whom he had assisted against the free traders, in their successful struggle for the \"ten hours' bill;\" on which occasion he was waited upon by a deputation representing a hundred thousand men, at that time mostly unemployed in London, with their tribute of thanks. A proposal was at the same time made, to purchase, if he would agree to become a party to it, a London evening daily newspaper,\nfor sale, the Courier, to advocate their common views, which then they proposed, in his honor, to call the Currency Reformer. Mr. Buchanan's reply in declining was similar to the following explanation given to those who offered to procure him a seat in the British House of Commons:\n\n\"A hundred friends of labor like me could do no good in the House of Commons while the question of the church remains 'the first question in the politics of England,' and is, without the smallest apology, put seemingly, as a matter of course, before that great subject, 'the employment of our own people at home and in the colonies,' which should even be acknowledged to be of more vital importance that what are called 'constitutional questions,' as the question upon the proper settlement of which depends the safety and permanence of our revered form of government, and every other blessing we, as a nation and empire, enjoy. There can be no chance, I have long been thoroughly satisfied, for the working men in England, or for 'the question of labor,' till after the carrying of some great change in the constitution of the British Parliament, making it possible for the question of 'the people's employment' to become 'the first question in the politics of England,' which at present the church question is, and always has been\u2014the question at the election of the members for the English counties, or two-thirds of the House of Commons, not being what the candidate's views are upon 'employment; the people's question, but whether the candidate's decoction of church views suits the particular neighborhood.'\"\n\nNor has Mr. Buchanan hesitated to give his view as to what this constitutional change should be. He adds:\n\n\"And to save our institutions generally, it is the highest duty of the patriot to endeavor to suggest the least change that would effect this greatest purpose of benevolence. After the sad experience of America, even the greatest chartist, if an honest man, would no longer desire to see the House of Commons elected by universal suffrage. The great object, too, is rather to draw together the extremes of English society, and between them to form a strong united phalanx to upset that odious middle class monopoly of political power, under whose miserable influence the British Government has abdicated all its paternal functions and come to care no more for its own subjects than for foreigners industrially\u2014has abdicated, in a word, all its functions except that of a mere police! Some years ago, when ruminating on this all important subject, an idea struck me which, at the time, seemed to my mind rather revolutionary; I now, however, see that it would be the most conservative one which England could adopt, as popularizing the House of Lords, and making it, in fact, the people's house. Leaving the House of Commons untouched, as some property, qualification is no doubt proper for a house representing the pro-\nperty of the country, the House of Lords might be elected by universal suffrage from among the ennobled class. The restriction or safeguard in the House of Commons being in the electors; the restriction or safeguard in the House of Lords would be in the elected, just as a probationer of a church becomes a safe man to elect as minister on account of his having been licensed as a preacher by the church-court or bishop; and in such a house there might be some representation of the more remote parts of the British empire greater than can be introduced into the House of Commons, unless the inhabitants of the colonies were able and willing to bear their share of the national debt of England and public burdens generally.\"\n\nMr. Buchanan's views, in 1848, were expressed in these words: \"If Peel's plan will give more employment to the people of England, he is right, but if it should give less, they cannot afford this, distressed as they now are, and he will cause a revolution, not from disloyalty, but want of employment or starvation.\" He never yielded an inch to the arguments of the free traders, but (denying, of course, that Lord George Bentinck or those with whom he agreed, would be a party to raise the price of the people's food by duties), he explained by what he named \"the theory of a full market,\" that it is not true that the consumer would pay the import duty except at a time of scarcity, when no party desired the existence of a duty.\n\n\"Suppose,\" said Mr. Buchanan, \"that the price indicative of a full market for wheat is 45s. per quarter, and the import duty 8s., as proposed by Lord John Russell, the importer would not get 53s., any more than a slovenly farmer whose wheat takes him 8s. more than it takes his neighbor to grow, would get 8s. more on that account; but on the contrary, the importer would get less than 45s. to the extent his lot of wheat depressed the market, so that it is clear that the foreigner would have to pay the duty, not the consumer.\"\n\nTHE QUESTIONS OF LABOR AND MONEY ONE QUESTION, THE SOLUTION OF THE ONE BEING THE SOLUTION OF THE OTHER.\n\nWith a devotion equally ardent, Mr. Buchanan pursues the question of \"money,\" which he very properly treats as only another branch of the same question\u2014the question of labor or of our own people's employment. In support of this view, he states the undeniable fact, among others, that \"the solution of the labour question would be the solution of the money question; and vice versa\"; and one of his illustrations of the incalculable importance of the money question may here be given:\n\n\"Harvey's exposition of the circulation of the blood, to which no physician over forty years of age dared to give his assent till after the\npublic had adopted it, has not had results in favor of humanity so momentous as would flow from the public adoption of the correct theory regarding the circulation of money, the legal life blood of each country's internal or independent industry, and recognizing this as the first question in the politics of every people! In the one case, the circulation went on before, as now, without let or hindrance, in spite of defective science; but in the other, that of the body politic, blundering ignorance has tampered with and impeded the circulating medium, to the endangerment of the health, and even the life, of its industry.\"\n\nIn 1846, we find him battling the watch with the free traders and hard money men in England. The following is from one of his publications of that day:\n\n\"A reduction of prices, the result of foreign competition, is just another way for expressing a want of employment. For when prices and wages, and freights, are reduced one-half, the evil is not only that we find ourselves paying the fundholders and annuitants double the amount of British industry, that we before did, for the money due them each half-year, but under free imports falsely named free trade (or when the reduction in the price of our labor flows from foreign competition) we shall be subjected to the infinitely greater calamity, that the industrious classes of this country, in addition to paying the annuitant, or man of money, as much labor as formerly, (seeing that the price in money is only one-half) will have, out of gold, the basis of our currency, to furnish the capitalist with at least half the amount of his claim in hard cash to send abroad in payment of foreign labor. We shall thus foster and increase that foreign industry, to compete with which is impossible for us under our national burdens, or (even though freed from these burdens) till our population is reduced below the circumstances of the foreign serf or slave, for the actual wants of the latter must ever remain fewer than those of a people with habits such as ours, and living in so much more rigorous a climate as that of Great Britain.\"\n\nMr. Buchanan was always and still is hostile to the free trade principles of Sir R. Peel, viewing the principle (or absence of principle) of free trade as the contrary principle to that of empire as well as of patriotism. On this subject, we give extracts from those letters which he published during the sittings of the political convention which met at Toronto in 1859:\n\n\"In her farmers, Canada has a great class, the prosperity of which secures the prosperity of all other classes; so that the true commercial policy for Canada is to promote the prosperity of the Canadian farmer. And how this is to be done is the simple political question of the Canadian patriot. Yet, to the shame of British statesmen be it said, a question so momentous to Canada was known to have had no consideration in England, when she, in\n1846, diametrically altered her policy and repealed all the old distinctions between Canadian and American produce in her markets. The direct and immediate effect of this precipitate introduction of free imports (for it is not free trade) into the mother country was most disastrous to Canada, and was more likely to prove subversive of her loyalty than anything that could have been anticipated; for it left the Canadian farmer (on the north bank of the St. Lawrence) only the English market for his produce, in which he has to compete (after paying all freights and expenses across the Atlantic) with wheat of countries where labor and money are not worth one-third what those are in Canada, while it gave to the American farmer (on the south bank of the St. Lawrence) this English market to avail of whenever it suited him, in addition to the American market.\u2014Happily the British government saw in time the error committed in bringing about a state of things in which it would have been impossible to retain, upon British principles, the Canadas\u2014British principles always involving the idea that the object of Britain in acquiring or retaining territory is to bless, not to blight it; and Lord Elgin bribed the Americans by sharing with them our fishery and navigation rights, to give us the reciprocity treaty, which, while it exists, removes the Canadian farmer's cause of complaint. Now, therefore, the preservation of this reciprocity with the United States is shewn to be not only the interest of the farmers, and through them, of all others in Canada, but of the British government, as without it, Canadians are left in a position to be much benefitted by Canada being annexed to the United States. I speak plainly, viewing him the most loyal man who speaks most plainly at such a crisis.\n\n\"And this reciprocity treaty can only eventually be secured and rendered permanent by the British government adopting an enlarged and just imperial policy, which would allow of the decentralizing the manufacturing power of the Empire\u2014a principle which would aggrandize the British Empire, and be an incalculable benefit to the working classes in England, Ireland, and Scotland.\u2014To preserve the empire, Britain has to yield the selfish principle of centralizing, which has ruined Ireland and India, so far as such countries could be ruined, and cost us the old American colonies. The principle of decentralizing the manufactures of the empire is a principle which would secure for the empire an enormous additional trade and influence.\u2014Through the instrumentality of some one or other of her dependencies, (which might be called England in America\u2014England in Australia\u2014England in India, &c,) she could secure for all her mechanics that chose to go to these favored localities, freedom of trade with countries that could never agree to free trade direct with England, without giving a death blow to their comparatively comfortable populations. For instance, England could never get free trade\nwith the United States, in manufactured goods, but no doubt the United States would be prepared to extend the reciprocity treaty with Canada, thus throwing down all interior custom houses between Canada and the United States, which done, the Englishman, by coming to Canada, and manufacturing his goods at our endless water powers, will be able to save the 25 per cent charged on the same goods going direct from England to the United States, and hundreds of mill-owners now in uneasy circumstances in England, would, under such an arrangement, immediately transfer to Canada their machinery and hands, to the infinite benefit of the population thus removed, and to the aggrandizement of the empire. And this is the main thing wanted by the Canadian farmer, permanently, as giving him a market on the spot for his roots and spring crops, thus rendering rotation of crops possible, while it would give him also that which is so valuable to him in the present (until he gets his rotation of crops established) the superior market for his white wheat furnished in the United States by the reciprocity treaty.\n\n\"To the United States, and more especially to the western states, as making the St. Lawrence the greatest highway of America, free trade and navigation with Canada would give great development, would give, in a word, all the commercial advantages of annexation.\n\n\"The natural policy of Canada is seen clearly therefore to be the establishment of an American Zollverein, such as exists among the German states. Under this, the United States and Canada would neither of them levy any customs taxes on their interior frontiers, but only at the seaports from Labrador to Mexico\u2014the same duties being levied, and each country getting its share in the proportion of its population.\n\n\"Let it be therefore resolved, that for our commercial system, the principle should be adopted by Canada of an American Zollverein, or, in other words, FREE TRADE WITH AMERICA, BUT NOT WITH EUROPE. And this will be a fair compromise between the views of the two classes of friends of the Canadian farmer, one of which holds that our farmer is to be most benefitted by general free trade and direct taxation, and the other by keeping our money in the country through the restriction of importations and indirect taxation.\n\n\"This would terminate our present unprincipled position of political parties in Canada. By setting up a policy of Canadian patriotism, we should have, as the opposition to us, whether government or parliamentary opposition, the foreign, or foreign trade party, and that the aims of such a party never has had more than mere personal selfishness in view is clearly enough shown in this, that while in England it is in favor of local manufactures, because there the party are manufacturers, here, in Canada, they are against local manufactures, because here they are merchants, and in fact repre-\nsent an English local faction, instead of a great British interest.\"\n\nPEEL'S OUTRAGE ON THE CONSTITUENCIES.\u2014HIS FREE TRADE IS A MERE DESPOTISM OF CAPITAL, WHICH DECREES FREE PURCHASES BY US OF FOREIGN LABOR, BUT NOT FREE PURCHASES BY FOREIGNERS OF BRITISH LABOR.\n\nMr. Buchanan being in London in 1846 when Peel's violation of the constituencies was consummated, the following were his impressions on the moment, as they still are his feeling on this painful subject:\n\n\"The premier has left us in a condition worse than political chaos, as having robbed us of our principles. Even the principle that self-preservation is the first law of nature has been repudiated; and British politics have been reduced into the two original elements of all national politics\u2014the labor-power and the money-power. The labor-power must come to be represented by social economists, or practical men, or patriots, the character of whose legislation will be that it takes the circumstances of our own society into account; the money-power being represented by political economists or cosmopolitan theorists, who would have this country legislate for the world, while they view political science as a system of pure mathematics, or, at best, one for the creation of wealth, without any regard to its distribution. Indeed, to my mind, it never appeared that the permanently important question was whether it was a right or a wrong thing, per se, that Peel did in 1846. His impolicy, however great, appears to me to stand, in relation to his repudiation of moral and constitutional principle, just as a misfortune does to a crime. I myself, for instance, am opposed to established churches, even if these were the best churches possible, viewing partiality to any class of her Majesty's subjects an impediment to general confidence in the crown and law of the land; but give me the power to injure the church, or any other vital interest by a side wind, would I, as a minister, or even as a legislator do it? If the constituencies do not wish the church demolished, dare I, their servant, put it down? And if the constituencies do wish it put down, what need is there for me to interfere unduly? It has always seemed to me to be the duty of a minister rather to try to find evidence in favor of a respectable existency; and a state of things does not deserve the name of constitutional or of moral, unless it is one in which a great interest can repose with even more safety in the hands of its avowed enemy, seeing that he, as an honorable man, would require the greater evidence for its overthrow, to leave no shadow of a suspicion, even in his own mind, that his personal predilections had influenced his conduct as a public man. The reverse of the picture is a very humbling one. Behold the constituencies of the empire, standing in the position of trustees of the entire people, employing, as agent under the trust, the man\n\nof Taylor's investigation, any person attempting to do so to this end, ex post facto, power over the life of our country has always been Peel's present course of circumstances, and them the power to give it the most principled policy, and that policy WRONG, in the interests of our nation, and in it the independence of the country.\n\nNo man of this country's history, in itself, ever has been able to show that greatness like Taylor, who, to know, that we have the earliest and most unprincipled patriotic spirit in Taylor, who, in different instances declines to be a metal, and Mr. Taylor, the idea of a country, the idea of the tax, simply paid by the debtors\u2014PRESENT...\"\nof Tamworth, who immediately turns round and repudiates all obligation to abide by the terms of the trust deed, or even to act on any principle whatever! And what are we to think of our contemptible trustees in submitting thus to be bullied? What are we to think of the honor of our constituencies in delegating, by their ex post facto assent to Peel's conduct, an omnipotence or arbitrary power to Parliament which they had not to give? My own view has always been that we have in this transaction so gross a violation of our legislative constitution as to amount (whatever may have been Peel's intention at the time) to a virtual abdication by the present constituencies. Their only possible excuse is, that their circumstances are too desperate, and that, now that without appeal to them the change has been precipitated, it is the safest course to give it a fair trial. But the immediate importance of Peel's unprincipled proceeding is what we have chiefly at present to do with, and that arises from the ACT DONE BEING IN ITSELF VITALLY WRONG, as tending to lessen instead of to increase the employment of our masses, at home, at sea, and in the colonies\u2014thus containing in it the seeds of revolution, both at home and in our foreign dependencies, whether done constitutionally or unconstitutionally.\"\n\nPAPER MONEY.*\n\nNo man is more impressed with the vital importance of a country's having emblematic money instead of money containing in itself intrinsic value than Mr. Buchanan; and no man probably ever has turned his mind more to the subject, except, perhaps, that greatest philosopher of money, and most amiable man, John Taylor, of London, whose modesty will leave the next generation to know, better than his own age appears to do, how great a mind we have had amongst us. Mr. Buchanan describes him as \"the earliest and most able denouncer of Sir Robert Peel's heartless or unprincipled monetary legislation.\" Mr. Buchanan held his own patriotic views on \"money\" previous to having heard of Mr. Taylor, whose views are in theory much the same, but so far different in practice that, like the Birmingham school, Mr. Taylor declines to yield to the popular prejudice in favor of the yellow metal, and make gold the security of his proposed paper money. Mr. Taylor's proposal, in fact, just amounts to this, that the money of a country should be paper \"Tallies\" or evidences to be issued of the taxes voted each year by Parliament. Government would simply pay them to its creditors, and take them back from its debtors\u2014so that the security to the public is perfect. While the PRESENT PAPER MONEY IS A REPRESENTATIVE OF A DEBT DUE\n\n* Mr. Buchanan distinguishes between \"paper money\" and \"paper currency.\" By paper money he means paper made a legal tender, and by paper currency he means bank notes which we are not bound to take in payment unless we please.\nBY THE ISSUER TO THE HOLDER, THE PAPER MONEY (on the principle of which Mr. Buchanan agrees with Mr. Taylor) would be a REPRESENTATIVE OF A DEBT FOR TAXES DUE BY THE HOLDERS, THE PEOPLE, TO THE ISSUER, THE GOVERNMENT. This is what Mr. Buchanan calls \"PITT AS OPPOSED TO PEEL MONEY.\"\n\nFrom the foregoing sub-section it will have been gathered that Mr. Buchanan's long held view is that \"money\" should be a THING OF, AND BELONGING TO, THE PARTICULAR COUNTRY AND ITS INTERNAL TRADE, having no necessary reference to the outside world, and with no peculiar fitness to circulate there, beyond what the laws of other countries may encourage, or its character as \"a commodity\" (not as \"a money,) may lead to. According to Mr. Buchanan, in fact, money is \"the creature of our local legislation,\" created for the purpose of facilitating the exchange between man and man of commodities bought and sold in our \"home market.\" MONEY SHOULD THEREFORE (says Mr. Buchanan) BE THE MERE HANDMAID OF LABOR. One of John Taylor's happy illustrations is that money is the \"measure\" or ell-wand (yardstick) by which our people's labor is sold. If the law (as Peel's legislation does) declares that cloth can only be sold by yard-sticks made of gold, or any article valuable as a commodity for foreigners to take away, the practically unhappy result is that this is a worse state of things for the labor or industry of the country, than if we had still a state of pure barter. The yard-sticks are taken away in consequence of the necessity for gold of some other country, and business is brought to a stand in our country without anything being wrong among ourselves at all!\n\n\"Peel's principle of money,\" says Mr. Buchanan, \"involves British subjects in all the distresses, without giving them the advantage of any of the blessings, of every country in the world. As a destroying angel or agent, it is like death, when suddenly it strikes down the young and beautiful and brave in the full and vigorous possession of every faculty and every promise.\"\n\nAnd if any apology is required for the great length of this explanation of Mr. Buchanan's opinions on the vital subject of \"money,\" it must be found in the fact that some portion of his enthusiasm can not fail to be imparted to every mind which takes the trouble to peep so far into the vast field of discussion in which he battles with the preconceived prejudices of the public, as to be able to appreciate his perfect sincerity and entire disinterestedness.\n\n\"In season and out of season,\" for the last thirty years, he has announced his doctrine that \"THE QUESTION OF LABOR AND THE QUESTION OF MONEY ARE IN REALITY ONE QUESTION,\" and has invited those around him to prove this for themselves by their taking the trouble to go into the detail of the reflection that \"THE SOLUTION OF THE ONE IS THE SOLUTION OF THE OTHER.\" He has thus prosecuted sleeplessly a reform, which, though contrary.\nto his own interest as a capitalist and his prejudices as a merchant in the foreign trade, he believes to be essential to the wellbeing of the masses, and to the reasonable independence in the circumstances of those who labor, whether they do so with their hands or their heads. Though Mr. Buchanan has always been an efficient opponent of communisms, organizations of labor, and all the silly isms which would make it appear that there is a distinction between the interest of fixed property and labor, he has always held and shown that our law makes \"money\" a foreign commodity, having no interest in common with either; and he hopes and believes that by removing out of the way, (as we require with the knife to remove a tumor from the body physical), the impediments set up by Peel's legislation to the natural course of things, to the healthy circulation of the body politic, we may enable the working classes INDEPENDENTLY TO COIN INTO MONEY THEIR INDUSTRY, TEMPERANCE AND OTHER QUALITIES AND QUALIFICATIONS.\n\nAt the end of this volume we shall give copies of the title page of Mr. Buchanan's late pamphlet \"Britain the Country, versus Britain the Empire,\" and of the two engravings it contained, to illustrate what Mr. Buchanan denominates, in true Saxon phrase, \"National unthrift, or the cup of Britain's prosperity as it is,\" showing that at present there is a syphon or waste pipe in our national cup, which prevents prices and wages becoming more than pleases the annuitants and money-mongers; and \"National economy, or the cup of Britain's prosperity as it ought to be,\" shewing that when they have removed the waste pipe or \"tantalus\" feature from our national cup, it will only be its overflow (as ought to be the case) that will go to irrigate and vivify other lands and foreign industries.\n\nWe may here mention that to Mr. Buchanan it is owing that both attempts failed to establish in Canada a government bank of issue. He does not object to a government bank of issue per se, but, on the contrary, considers the coining of paper equally the privilege or prerogative of the whole people, as represented by the crown, as the coining metal, the giving up of which to banks or private individuals can only be justified if more for the benefit of people in particular circumstances. In 1841, when Lord Sydenham introduced his bank of issue, Mr. Buchanan, who, being then member for Toronto, was on the special committee of the Legislative Assembly; and he shewed that the proposed measure would reduce the paper money circulation of the province one-half, and render it impossible for the trade and the people generally to pay more than ten shillings in the pound of their debts, such debts having been contracted under the calculation of there being double the money in the country. And in 1860, when Mr. Galt introduced his bank of issue, Mr. Buchanan shewed that in such a society as ours A GOVERNMENT BANK OF ISSUE IS IMPRACTICABLE WITHOUT AN EMBLEMATIC LEGAL TENDER.\n\"Paper circulation,\" says he, \"that would keep out, must be in process of perpetual distribution by banks interested in making the issue, but government or bank notes, the evidences of gold in the treasury or vaults, are wanted as a basis, as, in fact, a legal tender.\"\n\nIn the circumstances of Canada, which has a magnificent system of the safest possible banks chartered by the provincial legislature, with a capital of twenty-four millions of dollars, all paid up, Mr. Buchanan thinks that, for the present at all events, the best substitute for a government bank of issue is to put a second padlock on the vaults of our banks, the key of which to be held by the government, and to authorize the banks to issue as a legal tender, equally with gold, YELLOW NOTES, COUNTERSIGNED BY THE GOVERNMENT, leaving their present notes in their present position, if not being a legal tender. No man has considered more anxiously the one grand objection that may be made to this. It may be said, suppose a man to invest a thousand dollars in a mortgage, with three years to run, he now gives two hundred sovereigns or a certain weight of gold, amounting to fifty ounces (supposing each sovereign a quarter of an ounce,) what would he get back in case of Mr. Buchanan's plan being in operation at the end of the three years on payment of the mortgage? Mr. Buchanan replies, except by special bargain stipulating for the return of a certain weight of gold, the mortgagee would only legally be entitled to a thousand dollars in the yellow notes of any chartered bank; and these would procure for the holder two hundred sovereigns or fifty ounces of gold, if our provincial \"money\" is at the time at par, i.e., if our exports of provincial produce and imports of money combined balance our imports of foreign goods and exports of money combined\u2014the demand for foreign exchange being to such an extent as keeps it at par. If, however, the value of foreign exchange (which is a convertible term for the precious metals) is less than par from excessive exports, he would get just so much more than two hundred sovereigns, while if it is higher in value or rate, he would get just so much less than two hundred sovereigns for what, at both periods, is nominally one thousand dollars, and commanding a thousand dollars worth of any commodity in the province.\n\nThe following was published when he was in Glasgow in 1848, and in one of his innumerable explanations in Great Britain during the monetary panics in Britain of 1847 and 1848. A great many of the members of both houses of the British Parliament consulted Mr. Buchanan on the dreadful position to which Peel had brought matters previous to Californian and Australian gold being discovered, and the following is the substance of a reply which he made to the late Lord Ashburton (once Chancellor of the Exchequer and who was her Majesty's plenipotentiary to settle the boundary line between the British provinces in America and the United States.)\nStates) in answer to a letter to him from his lordship, asking what, with the gold of the bank of England reducing every day, he would suggest. In this letter Lord Ashburton pays Mr. Buchanan the compliment of acknowledging that he had received great instruction on the subject of money from Mr. Buchanan's writings.\n\n\"JUSTICE OR INJUSTICE TO FIXED PROPERTY AND LABOR, OR IN OTHER WORDS, SHALL WE HAVE PIT OR PEEL MONEY?\"\n\n\"Those who affect to scoff at the legislation of Mr. Pitt should recollect that when a foreign war occurs, we must as a matter of necessity, at once revert to HIS monetary system; and it were well did the political economists condescend to enlighten us on the difference between the extirpating effects\u2014on the country's industry, and banking facilities\u2014of a foreign war, and of a foreign trade, if both drain us of our precious metals. Sir Robert Peel's vital error is, that he has based the foreign, as well as the home, trade on MONEY; whereas, the latter ought to be on the principle of BARTER. But we can yet arrange to get back Pitt's principle of money, by repealing Peel's bill of 1819, and, at the same time, retain all the present security for the bank note circulation, by perpetuating the principle of restriction embodied in Peel's bill of 1844. This arrangement must, however, be made before the Bank of England loses its gold, otherwise a WANT OF CONFIDENCE will be sure to occur, whose fearful effects cannot be predicted. To UNFIX THE PRICE OF GOLD AS A STANDARD OF VALUE, is really all that at present is required to make this country (deep as is now its social wretchedness and misery) at once prosperous and contented, which shows that the wretched position of the British producer and artizan does not arise from a natural but from an artificial or legislative cause. The detail of this operation, which we advocated in the former articles, would be as follows:\n\n\"1st.\u2014The Bank of England's note\u2014being a legal tender at its own counter, as well as everywhere else to the extent of the fourteen millions which it has in the hands of government, and also of the specie in its vaults,\u2014would be redeemed at the PITTS, or London market price of gold, instead of at the PEEL, or foreign price of gold. Under no other arrangement can we deprive the foreigner of the undue advantage over our home industry, which he enjoys whenever we have prosperity or remunerating prices, seeing that while he gets a higher price for his commodities, in consequence of the amount of money being increased by paper issues, he pays no higher price for our gold, which therefore he prefers to take rather than British labor which is enhanced.\n\n\"2nd.\u2014The foregoing would be THE RULE, but in order to guard the commerce of the country against the WANT OF CONFIDENCE which has existed since the beginning of last year, WE WOULD NOT\nPERMIT THE BANK'S SPECIE EVER TO GO BELOW TEN MILLIONS.\n\nWhen it falls to ten millions we would not permit the bank to pay specie even at the market price, until it again gets up to, or beyond, eleven millions. In this way\u2014as enabling the Bank of England to keep twenty four millions of paper always in the hands of the public\u2014we have not the least doubt we can guard our trade from money panics, caused by the state of the foreign exchanges, such as that of 1847, as effectually as Sir Robert Peel by his bill of 1844 secured the holders of bank notes against money panics originating in local derangement, such as that of 1825. Of course our readers are well aware that though we would perpetuate the principle\u2014of some restriction\u2014of Sir R. Peel's bills of 1844 and 1845, in a word\u2014we would gradually extend the amount of the issues allowed to the Joint-Stock Banks, enabling these to keep pace in some degree with the increase of the country's business which at present they do not; while our plan would enable our Scotch banks to hold Bank of England notes instead of specie.\n\n\"But it may be said with seeming plausibility, that if the 25s of Pitt money buys no more commodities than the 20s of Peel money, the working classes would not be advantaged by the monetary change. We answer that there will be a direct advantage to the laboring men, because they could pay our fifty millions of national taxes\u2014not to talk of the local imposts\u2014with four-fifths the number of days labor under the Pitt plan, that they do under the Peel plan; and, besides this, there is the most manifest indirect advantage to the working classes through the greater certainty of employment, and through the gradually increasing wages, arising from the bidders for labor being increased\u2014which is the only possible cause of any permanent increase of wages, as many former disciples of communism now happily discover. It should be borne in mind, however, that the reform wanted is simply the getting quit of a great public wrong. All that is wanted is that we get the free operation of natural causes in expressing the price of gold, and reconciling this to its value in this country.\n\n\"The chief direct benefit of our plan may seem to be to the holders of property, and such capital is not money, but the working man's wages will be bettered, as we have said, by the increased number of bidders for his services, and by our plan he will be guaranteed against that interference with the constancy of his employment, which now flows from every 'derangement of the foreign exchanges.' The working classes, in their sinking condition, have eagerly caught at such absurdities as organizations of labor, communisms, and associationisms, from which the capital classes were excluded, just as sinking men catch at straws; but straws they have found these delusions to be (however well intended), and our laboring masses will no longer permit their reason to be insulted by the silly doctrine that labor is a separate interest. The working men now see\nthat the only possible cause of increased wages is increased employment, which can only arise from improving the condition of the employers of labor; and the working men's distresses having led them into a much better knowledge of the money question (which is in reality the question of labor) than is possessed by the middle classes, they see that to increase the number of bidders for their labor, the only means of raising their wages permanently, such an alteration of our money laws must be made as will permanently reduce the exchangeable value of money, so far as this could be done by setting it free from the influence of the foreign exchanges, as when less property and a smaller quantity of commodities come to stand for the same amount of money, it is evident that less of the working man's time and labor will do the same thing. It is evident, in a word, that raising the exchangeable value of fixed property and labor is a convertible term for reducing the exchangeable value of money. Thus the interests of all classes except the officials, annuitants, and money-mongers, are seen to be the same and inseparable.\n\n\"At present our papers increasing the amount of money, and in the same ratio increasing the demand, and consequently the price, for labor and commodities appear at first sight greatly to alleviate the effect of the bill of 1819 or the fixed Gold Standard\u2014which has for its object to reduce the price of British commodities and labor by making money dear, this being a convertible term for making the commodity gold cheap nominally, and at the same time making British commodities and wages low or worthless in exchangeable value. But this happy and natural influence of paper money is nearly altogether lost to the industry of this country by the malign influence which Sir Robert Peel's monetary legislation causes our foreign trade to exert as the dictator or regulator of prices, and consequently of wages, besides being the great lessener of employment through lessening the circulating medium, through removing gold, its basis. The anomaly of Peel's principle or bullionism is this, that while it in name makes gold and money synonymous terms, the low price of gold makes each ounce thereof an equivalent for a proportionately greater quantity of other commodities, and we all know that British commodities (or in other words, British wages), being low, is just another way of stating the purchasing power or price of money, to be high, so that low gold means high money, although these are synonymous terms! It is only, therefore, when prices are down to a ruinous level\u2014which unfortunately they usually are under Peel's system\u2014that the remark of the 'Economist' holds true that the foreign trade is now carried on practically in the same way as if we had a barter system, or if there was no paper money. Under a barter system the foreigner would get a low price for his commodities,\nBUT HE WOULD GET OUR GOLD AT NO LOWER A PRICE THAN AT PRESENT!\n\n\"The object of our measure, as currency reformers, is to do away with the influence of the foreign exchanges on the circulating medium, while it will prevent the price of commodities and wages\u2014as measured by paper, which will represent, and always be convertible into, gold at its British price\u2014being as at present not permitted to rise above the level of the low foreign price of \u00a33 17s 10\u00bdd per ounce for standard gold.\n\n\"We see clearly that what the trade of the country wants is confidence, which is liable to be unhinged in three ways\u20141st, by the want of perfect convertibility in the local bank notes\u2014the chief object of Sir R. Peel's bill of 1844 being to secure this, and in which he may, all things considered, be said to have succeeded. 2nd and 3rd, commercial confidence must also be impossible either when the bank is actually being drained of gold as in 1847, or when there is the anticipation of a drain of our precious metals as at present; and, as it thus is evident that it is the assured presence of a certain amount of gold that is required, we therefore propose, as above, to prevent the Bank of England parting with any more specie when its stock gets down to ten millions. It is obvious that when the foreign exchanges get more against us, than this point indicates, the country's industry is unnecessarily sacrificed, and our object is to save the country's industry, even though the moneyed classes should suffer from the absence of bad times, a high rate of discounts, and low prices and wages!\u2014which are all only different ways of expressing the same thing, the necessary effect of the Peel principle of money. We shall extend this no farther than to repeat two sentences from former articles\u2014'The remedy for this state of things is, that we make up our minds to retain gold only as the security of our bank note circulation, doing away with gold as a standard of value.' And again, 'The true principle of monetary science is only another way of expressing the full employment of our national industry free from the disturbance of any foreign or external influence.' We must, before the opening of our ports in March next, draw this line of demarcation between foreign interests and home or British interests, otherwise\u2014between the operation of the conflicting principles of Peel's currency bill of 1819, which hangs all confidence and bank facilities on gold, and Peel's free import bill of 1846, which gives away our gold to foreigners\u2014the trade and industry of this country must necessarily be ruined, and we shall have the most dreadful social convulsion.\"\n\nWHY FREE TRADE AND BULLIONISM COMBINED HAVE NOT LONG AGO RUINED ENGLAND.\n\nThese effects, which Mr. Buchanan thus anticipated free trade to have on England, he holds were only prevented by the unex-\npected flow of gold from California and Australia. He denies that free trade has succeeded (to the extent it has in England) from its own merits; but believes as firmly as ever he did that revolution in England, not from disloyalty, but from want of employment, must, but for these discoveries of gold, have been the result of Peel's measures\u2014the first of which, his money bill of 1819, made all confidence and paper money circulation depend upon the presence in England of gold, and the last his free trade bill of 1846\u2014by opening England's ports to importations of foreign goods DUTY FREE, PROVIDED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT LEGISLATION COULD DO THIS, THAT GOLD SHOULD BE SENT AWAY.\n\nHe some years afterwards writes as follows:\n\n\"Should gold continue to come from California and Australia as it has come, so unexpectedly since 1848, the yellow metal may become less valuable to Britain, for the time at least, than British labor, when of course it will be a benefit rather than an injury to export it. But should this flow of gold not continue, and Peel's principle of currency be attempted to be sustained, the most fearful social convulsions flowing from want of employment could not fail to be the result, as above explained. And no less terrible effects would flow from any successful attempt in Parliament to perpetuate the principle of Sir R. Peel's money law of 1819, by so changing its details as to lower our fixed price of gold down to the value to which gold may fall abroad; for we deceive ourselves if we suppose that the working classes in Britain still remain so ignorant as not to know that the lowering of the price of gold is an equivalent term for raising the purchasing power of money\u2014or, in other words, for lowering the exchangeable value of property, commodities and labor. The working classes have been taught by long and most cruel experience, that the principle of the money law of 1819 practically denies to British labor the reward which the law of supply and demand would naturally award to it, by leading to the export of gold, which upsets the country's banking facilities, and contracts the currency whenever the foreigner prefers taking gold. This, he of course does, unless the prices of British manufactures approximate in cheapness to that of gold\u2014even although that same foreigner did not import into this country gold, or other commodity sold at the cheap rate, but had availed of a paper or prosperity price for the foreign commodities in payment of which the imbecility of our law puts it in his power to take gold at a cheap fixed price.\n\nThey now see clearly, that the fact of GOLD BEING ABSURDLY FIXED AT THE SAME LOW RATE WHEN IT IS IN THE GREATEST DEMAND AS WHEN IT IS IN THE SMALLEST DEMAND FOR EXPORTATION AS A COMMODITY necessarily fixes down, as the general rule to the same low untaxed and profitless standard the remuneration to the producers of British commodities, which\nhave to be sold against gold as a commodity to foreigners, as well\nas into gold as a money to our own people in the same market!\nOur official and annuitant classes thus participate in the monstrous undue advantage which the bill of 1819 gives to the foreigner over the British artizan, and this sacrifice of our working classes operates a permanent reduction in the price of British products, by so prostrating the British producer himself that he ceases to be a consumer of other than the merest necessaries, a large proportion of which, being eatables, now are (under our irreciprocated free-trade system) the product of foreign labor, in payment of which the foreigner will never take anything but gold till compelled to do so by the price of gold in this country being at an advance over the price abroad, equal at least to the amount of the additional taxation paid by our artizan, and the fair profit which the free and unrestricted operation of the natural regulator of prices (the influence of the law of supply and demand in his particular trade) would award him.\n\nTHE REBELLION OF 1837.\n\nMr. Buchanan was incidentally thrown into a very active part in the suppression of the Upper Canada rebellion of 1837, and he relates, with his usual raciness, many anecdotes connected with it, but there is no room for them here; we may however, notice a very characteristic incident. Being at Toronto when the rebellion broke out, it suggested itself to his mind on the following morning that the rebel chief, William Lyon Mackenzie, who had not ventured to enter Toronto on the previous evening, would way-lay the mail in search of information. He had therefore recourse to a clever stratagem for preventing the rebels being induced to advance by the letters of alarmists. He wrote two letters, one to an old aunt in Scotland, Mrs. Buchanan, Auchmar cottage, Roseneath, who still retains the letter, (which, next day, was found by the government among McKenzie's papers that fell into its hands, and forwarded to its destination), and the other to his partner, Mr. Harris, who was westward, on business. In these he wrote in the highest spirits, confidently assuring them that Toronto would, during the afternoon, be in an excellent state of defense, and fully prepared to receive and defeat the rebels. Mr. Buchanan's conjecture was correct; the mail was duly seized, the letters opened and read. Those of certain members of the government, were found to be full of despair, but were most flatly contradicted by those of Mr. Buchanan. Which were they to believe? They hesitated, and lost their only opportunity of success. We have heard Mr. Buchanan say that this was to him a great lesson always to use the means in your power, however desperate a case. And certainly\nhis character is, as Lord George Bentinck used to say of Mr. Buchanan, \"never say die,\" under whatever influences it may have been formed.\n\nA FEW HURRIED REMARKS IN CONCLUSION.\n\nMr. Buchanan left the Niagara frontier soon after the evacuation of Navy Island, and went to England at the end of January 1838. He did not return till 1839; he then made it clear as already shown to the governor-general, Mr. Poulett Thompson, that unless the clergy reserve question was settled, rebellion after rebellion must be the sad experience of Canada. Though not approving of Mr. P. Thompson's peculiar or domestic politics, Mr. Buchanan, fearing another rebellion, unless responsible government was yielded, carried Toronto, then the metropolis, for the government party in 1841, on its being found that Mr. Baldwin, the solicitor-general, could not get the votes from all classes of the reformers. On the address to the government, in reply to his speech opening this first Parliament, being moved, Mr. Buchanan stood up and objected to its being discussed till the ministry declared themselves in favor of responsible government, pure and simple. This his excellency wished his government to shirk, but after ten days' debate, it was yielded. Mr. Baldwin's prominence in this matter was, two months afterwards, when the resolutions were brought in as a sort of supplement to the constitution of the province. Mr. Buchanan's being in Parliament at this time, gives him the honor to have been a party not only to securing responsible government for the people, but to the carrying through all the greatest reforms of the province, such as the erection of our great municipal machinery, which does more than half the business formerly done by Parliament; the education system, the greatest boast of the province; the control of our provincial trade, formerly wielded by the colonial office; the systemizing the finances of the province and creating a sinking fund; the originating the geological survey, the results of which so astonished foreigners at the world's fair in 1851, and will astonish them still more at the world's fair of 1862, &c. He co-operated with the Hon. William Hamilton Merritt, in securing from the colonial office the reduction of the duty on Canadian wheat to a merely nominal sum, and, being in England, in 1848, was the last person who gave his testimony at the colonial office before the granting of this, which was then thought a great boon. Lord Stanley (now Earl Derby) had been called away unexpectedly, but he left a written question with Mr. Hope, the under-secretary of the colonies, for Mr. Buchanan, which he seemed to think could not be answered. How, asked his lordship, is it that you should be so anxious to get the duty taken off Canadian wheat when you scarcely export any? Mr. Buchanan's reply was, that the districts which he represented, the Home, the Gore and the\nLondon districts, all shipped on lake Ontario large quantities of wheat, and they could not be held responsible if much of it did not reach England, but was eaten in Lower Canada or went to the lower ports. The plea of these districts was, that, as taking payment in British manufactures, and not in specie, they were entitled to the English price for their wheat, less the cost of transportation. Mr. Hope indicated that the answer entirely met the objections that had been or could be raised.\n\nMr. Buchanan, on his return to Canada, in 1843, sided with the great and good Sir Charles Metcalfe in the great quarrel which his ministers picked with him. On this subject there has been a great deal of misrepresentation, and we therefore think it well to say that of the forty-two elections in Upper Canada, thirty-eight went in favor of the friends of the governor-general.\n\nOf all the leading statesmen in England, he seems to have conceived the greatest respect for Lord George Bentinck. Their views on patriotism accorded, and he found Lord George more single minded than others of our statesmen of the present day. He wrote an eloquent obituary on his lordship's death, which appeared in the Glasgow Examiner.\n\nMr. Buchanan married in January, 1843, Agnes, second daughter of Robert Jarvie, Esq., an eminent merchant in Glasgow, and they have a large family. Mrs. Buchanan's amiability and active charities are well known in and about Hamilton. She takes the deepest interest in all her husband's undertakings, and resents with all the warmth of an affectionate and devoted wife the ribald attacks of his political assailants, by throwing herself the more heartily into all his elections. Her success was thus gracefully alluded to from the hustings by her husband's opponent at the last general election: \"Gentlemen, the gallantry of our electors has contributed largely to our defeat.\"\n\nThey have a beautiful seat called \"Auchmar,\" on the mountain overlooking the city of Hamilton and the blue expanse of water at the head of lake Ontario, one of the healthiest spots in all America. Auchmar is situated in Clairmont Park, a property laid out by Mr. Buchanan for villas. His children were mostly born there, and Mrs. Buchanan's partiality to Canada encourages an inclination on her husband's part to be an exception to the rule too prevalent with our wealthy mercantile men, of retiring to expend their means in the mother country, leaving their children to enter upon the battle of life unaided by the vantage ground which in the colony the standing and experience of the parents would have given them. The only other surviving member of his father's family is Jane, his youngest daughter, wife of Major Douglas, who resides at Adamton, Ayrshire, Scotland.\n\nIn conclusion, we have to admit that this is rather a slight glance at Mr. Buchanan's character than a full sketch of his life. To\nwrite a history of his thirty years' life of ceaseless activity, with more than half of his time devoted to the business of others and of the public, would be to write a history of Upper Canada. It would be to do more in Mr. Buchanan's case\u2014it would be to write a history of that more practical philanthropy which the peculiar state of a new society calls into operation.\n\nThe hospitalities of the Canadian are as proverbial as were those of the Scottish Auchmar. In a word, we need only in regard to pioneers of a young country, like Mr. Buchanan, exclaim:\u2014\n\n\"Si monumentum quaeris,\u2014Circumspice!\"\n\nIndeed, if we take away the things in which such men have had a hand, Upper Canada will have very little history remaining.\n\n---\n\nHON. JOHN A. MACDONALD, M.P.P.,\n\nATTORNEY-GENERAL, WEST.\n\nThe Honorable John Alexander Macdonald, attorney-general of Upper Canada, is the eldest son of the late Hugh Macdonald, Esq., of Kingston. \"Much can be made of a Scotchman,\" said Dr. Johnson, \"if caught young.\" This was the case with the future attorney-general\u2014his father, a member of a respectable family in Sutherlandshire, having come to Canada in the year 1820, when his son, who was born in 1814, was not six years of age. Mr. Macdonald established himself in business in Kingston, and sent his son to the royal grammar school of that place, taught by Dr. Wilson, fellow of Oxford, and subsequently by Mr. Baxter. At this school, as many of his school-mates testify, he gave promise and earnest of those abilities which were to be subsequently so useful to the province. He was a good mathematical, as well as classical scholar. A great reader, he early acquired a large stock of general knowledge, which a good memory rendered serviceable to him. When fifteen years of age he left school to commence the study of the law. This he prosecuted vigorously under George McKenzie, a barrister in large practice at Kingston, and when little over twenty-one years of age he was called to the bar.\n\nIn consequence of the death of Mr. McKenzie a short time before, he succeeded at once to a practice which soon became one\nof the largest in the country, and which after some years he carried on in partnership with Mr. Alexander Campbell, now a member of the Legislative Council. In 1839 Mr. Macdonald was appointed solicitor of the Commercial Bank of the Midland district, an office which he still retains. But it was not merely in the practice of civil law that Mr. Macdonald, while still a very young man, distinguished himself at the bar. In 1839 his professional services were engaged on behalf of the so-called General Von Schultz, one of the most prominent of the American sympathizers at that troubled period in the history of Canada. Von Schultz paid the forfeit of his life for the insane attempt to revolutionize Canada, in which he had been an active partisan. But the tact and ability with which Mr. Macdonald defended him were subjects of general observation at the time. We have before us a Montreal newspaper which contains an account of the trial, to which is appended the editor's opinion, that the defender of the unfortunate \"General\" would be ere long recognized as one of the first men in the country. His good nature and affable manners made Mr. Macdonald a favorite with the bar as well as with the public. His knowledge of law and shrewd common sense became daily better known and appreciated. He was retained in all cases of importance, while many public institutions had the benefit of his counsel. In connection with his practice at the bar must be mentioned his services to the Trust and Loan Company of Upper Canada, which owes much of its success to his exertions.\n\nMr. Macdonald early turned his attention to politics, and in 1844 he was elected member for Kingston in the second Parliament of United Canada. His election affords proof of the estimation in which he was then, as now, held by the citizens of Kingston. As soon as he came forward, his election was regarded as a certainty, and his return was hailed with enthusiasm. The year in which he entered Parliament was one of great political excitement. In 1843 Lord (then Sir Charles) Metcalfe's reform ministers, differing from that most able and excellent man as to the power of the Executive Council in the matter of public appointments, retired from office. A political interregnum followed their retirement, and the country was divided into two parties, one of which stood for the governor-general, and the other for his late advisers. It would be scarcely just now to accuse the retiring ministers of encouraging the virulent and often outrageous attacks upon Lord Metcalfe, which disgraced the greater part of the reform press, and which were repeated at the polls and at public meetings by so many outside supporters of the reform cause. \"The only feeling,\" wrote Mr. Hincks, in reply to a letter of Mr. Isaac Buchanan, \"that I or any of my late colleagues can entertain towards his excellency is one of gratitude for the uniform courtesy with which we were treated by him up to the\nlast moment that we held office. Mr. Buchanan must not, therefore, hold me up to the public as responsible for newspaper paragraphs, of which, if personal to the governor, I do not hesitate to say, I disapprove.\u201d But, at the time, the conservatives and the conservative press were unwilling to acquit the ex-ministers of blame, and Mr. Buchanan and other reformers united with the conservatives in denouncing them. The views of responsible government entertained by the reformers of that period have ultimately prevailed, and are now accepted as constitutional and just. At the time, however, many able politicians doubted their applicability to a subordinate government, and to a public officer, responsible not to the province, but to the crown. And assuredly there was much to commend Lord Metcalfe to the sympathy of generous minds. His great virtues, his eminent public services, his personal sufferings, united with respect for his station, to insure for him the support of a large party in the country\u2014a party strengthened by the adherence of those who were opposed to responsible government even in its mildest and most restricted form. Among the moderate conservatives may be placed Mr. Macdonald, who, if moderate in his conservatism, was strong in his regard and veneration for Lord Metcalfe.\n\nThe Parliament to which Mr. Macdonald was elected met at Montreal on the 28th November, 1844. The first vote was a triumph for the conservative ministers who had replaced the former administration, and Sir Allan MacNab was elected speaker by a majority of three. Mr. Baldwin moved what was equivalent to a vote of want of confidence in the ministry. A long debate followed, but the motion was finally rejected by a majority of six. Mr. Macdonald took no part in the debate; but it is needless to say that he supported the ministry. The division shows the strong feeling for Lord Metcalfe which prevailed in Upper Canada. The general election had resulted in the return of a large ministerial majority from that section of the province; and with the ministry the great majority of the Lower Canada British also sympathized. But the French, headed by Mr. Lafontaine, stood almost to a man by the Upper Canada reformers; and it was evident that the conservatives had a hard struggle before them. It does not enter into our plan to describe in detail the stormy contest which ensued. Suffice it to say, that although supported often by very small majorities, the ministry contrived to hold its ground, and that in doing so it received the consistent support of the member for Kingston. It was long, however, before Mr. Macdonald took a prominent part in the debates of the House of Assembly. The conservative party, to which he had attached himself, was led by men of ability and experience, and although regarded as a rising hope of his party, Mr. Macdonald did not often address the house. In this he gave proof of good taste, and of the tact and shrewdness\nwhich had proved so useful to him at the bar. A young member of known ability is not less likely to be highly esteemed because he does not often present himself to the notice of the house. There is greater danger in saying too much than too little. Mr. Macdonald had not been more than two years and a half in Parliament when he was appointed a member of the cabinet. The post assigned him was that of receiver-general, to which he was appointed on the 21st May, 1847. Mr. Draper was the head of the government, and Mr. Macdonald had for colleagues Messrs. Daly, William Morris, D. B. Papineau, Cayley, Badgley, and J. H. Cameron. He did not long hold the office of receiver-general, being appointed in lieu thereof commissioner of crown lands. In no office under the government are the duties more perplexing than in the crown Lands. Numberless cases of more or less difficulty are constantly lying over for adjudication. It was said at the time that no one of his predecessors had ever disposed of them with such promptitude and sagacity as Mr. Macdonald. Great changes had taken place in the political world since Mr. Macdonald's appearance upon the stage. Lord Metcalfe had gone home weighed down by the mortal disease against which he had long borne up in the performance of his duty, with the courage of a martyr. Lord Cathcart had succeeded him, and he was replaced by the Earl of Elgin. Lord Elgin first met the Canadian Parliament on the 4th June, 1847. During the session which terminated on the 28th July, the ministry met with several defeats, and on the 6th of December Parliament was dissolved. The greatest exertions were made by the reformers to secure a majority in Upper Canada, and things had altered materially with the conservatives since the former election. The French remained, as before, determinedly opposed to alliance with the conservatives, and the conservatives had by no means such a support from Upper Canada as at the preceding election. The new Parliament met on the 25th of February, 1848. The state of things was soon tested. Mr. Cayley, seconded by Colonel Prince, moved that Sir Allan MacNab be elected speaker. Mr. Lafontaine, seconded by Mr. Baldwin, moved the election of Mr. Morin, who was chosen by a large majority. The governor addressed the houses on the 26th, and stormy debates immediately followed on contested election returns. Early in March, the ministry resigned, and Mr. Lafontaine and Mr. Baldwin were sent for by the governor to form a new one. Mr. Macdonald, whose political reputation was now high, became, of course, an opponent of the new administration. Sir Allan MacNab was the recognized, but Mr. Macdonald the really efficient, leader of the opposition. Between 1848 and September, 1854, he upheld the opposition cause, and enunciated the views of the conservative party. The session of 1849 is specially prominent in the history of the province. The rebellion losses bill had caused great excitement throughout the country,\nalthough a large majority in the House of Assembly were in favor of it. Petition after petition called upon the governor to refer the measure to her Majesty for approval or disapproval; but Lord Elgin was advised by his ministers to sanction it himself. When he did so, a furious mob threatened the ministerial members, and set fire to the parliament house. In the debates upon the bill Mr. Macdonald ably but temperately opposed it. The excitement which followed the burning of the parliament house was boundless, and many who had in the rebellion taken up arms for the crown were so disgusted by the turn which affairs had taken as to talk about the peaceful annexation of the province to the United States. But Mr. Macdonald allowed no political misdeeds to interfere with his steady loyalty to the crown, and his unwavering attachment to British connection. Opposed to the government, he contented himself with constitutional opposition to its measures. At Toronto, to which after the burning of the parliament house, the government was removed, the Lafontaine-Baldwin ministry broke up, Mr. Baldwin having resigned on the Court of Chancery question, and Mr. Hincks was placed at the head of the new cabinet, which met with the same determined opposition from the conservatives. But it was not merely conservative assaults which Mr. Hincks had to encounter. A large section of reformers, headed by Mr. George Brown, who was elected to Parliament in 1851, denounced him with still greater bitterness than the conservatives did. Mr. Hincks, however, passed triumphantly through the sessions of 1852 and 1853, which were held in Quebec; but early in 1854 it became evident that the strong opposition of the conservatives, and the still more violent opposition of the supporters of Mr. Brown, were telling heavily against the ministry. Parliament did not meet till the 5th of June, almost the last day permitted by law. A strong coalition opposed the ministry. Mr. Brown, with whom there already acted several reformers, Mr. Cauchon, who had long been opposed to them, Mr. Sicotte, and some of the French members, Mr. Langton and several members who acted independently of party ties, united\u2014though from different points of view\u2014with the conservatives in denouncing the administration. No allusion was made in the speech from the throne either to the clergy reserves or seigniorial tenure questions. This was dwelt upon in various amendments to the proposed reply. It was said that the conduct of the government in promising constantly a settlement of these questions, and constantly postponing it was grossly reprehensible; that it destroyed altogether the confidence of the people in their rulers; that it was causing the greatest excitement both in Upper and in Lower Canada. A division was taken upon an amendment of Mr. Sicotte's, affirming: \"That this house sees with regret, that his excellency's government does not intend to submit to the legislature, during the present session, a bill for the immediate\nsettlement of the seignorial question, or one for the immediate settlement of the clergy reserves.\" The debate upon the reply to the address was a fierce one; and the ministers were assailed on all sides. Mr. Sicotte, Mr. Cauchon, Mr. Langton, spoke against them warmly. Mr. Brown called upon the house in the name of the people of Upper Canada, and in the name of political honesty, to agree to the motion. When earlier in the debate, Mr. Macdonald addressed the house, the galleries were crowded with spectators, many of whom had come from different parts of the province. His able and eloquent speech, told with tremendous effect against the government. In reply to a threat of Mr. Hincks, that the government would not allow any legislation that session which they did not think convenient, he said, \"What! had it come to that? Were they a free parliament or were they not? Had they to be told by the minister in that house that they must do only that which he would allow them, and no more, and after that be sent away to their homes? Might not the honorable gentleman go a step further and say, 'take away that bauble!' pointing to the mace. The honorable gentleman surpassed even himself in audacity, when he ventured so to express himself. The majority of the honorable member was becoming small by degrees and beautifully less, and it might be very convenient for him to have a short session, which would only pass such bills as he wanted. He believed that the announcement of the inspector general (Mr. Hincks) was an unconstitutional one, and that they might search in vain in the annals of the British legislature for such an announcement from the mouth of a minister. He knew the answer that would be made on the part of the government. He would be told that he (Mr. Macdonald) did not want to have the clergy reserves secularized this session or any other session. That was quite true; but it did not alter the position of ministers. Every member of the house had an interest in insisting that the pledges and promises of the government should be kept; and that the public mind should not be debauched by the moral wrongs of the government. They had an interest that the public mind should not be contaminated. It was immoral that the government should occupy their places upon the strength of violated pledges, and the grossest corruption, while they enriched themselves by speculations in public property.\" Mr. Macdonald proceeded to deny that the government should listen with indifference to the charges of gross corruption which were made against them; but though they did not as it was their duty to do, press themselves for an investigation of these charges, it was the duty of the House to sift them thoroughly, and to see whether they were not breaking their promises the better to work schemes of corruption. William Pitt, careless as he was of other slander, when he was accused by a London newspaper of speculation in public property, thought it his duty to\nbring the slanderer to justice. Why did our ministers show no such feeling? The division upon Mr. Sicotte's motion took place on the night of Tuesday the 20th, when it was carried by a majority of thirteen; the vote standing forty-two for, to twenty-nine against. On Wednesday, the greatest excitement prevailed, but people could hardly bring themselves to believe that after a vote taken under such circumstances, the governor-general would stand by his ministers. Such, however, was the case. On the 22nd, Lord Elgin dissolved the refractory Parliament in a curt speech, which gave great offence to the majority. His course was protested against by the speaker, Mr. Sandfield Macdonald, in an address which was at the time attributed to the subject of our memoir. \"It has been the immemorial custom for the speaker of the House of Commons,\" said the speaker of the House of Assembly, \"to communicate to the throne the general result of the deliberations of the house on the principal subjects which may have engaged its attention during the session of Parliament. On the present occasion, however, I have no such communication to make to your excellency, inasmuch as there has been no bill passed or other proceeding adopted since your excellency in your very gracious speech from the throne, honored us with reasons for which you had convoked this Parliament. The passing of a bill through all its stages, according to the laws and custom of Parliament (solemnly declared applicable to the parliamentary deliberations of this province by a decision of the Legislative Assembly in 1841,) is considered necessary to constitute a session of Parliament. We could not perform such a duty in consequence of the order of your excellency to us communicated, to meet you this day in order to be prorogued.\" A few formal expressions of respect closed the \"protest\" as it was justly called, which was greatly commended. This arbitrary and unconstitutional dissolution did much to increase the strong feeling which existed against the administration; and Lord Elgin came in for a large share of censure. Vigorous preparations for the general election were made by all parties. The ministerial party in Upper Canada maintained that if the reformers deserted the cabinet, they would lose the Lower Canada alliance, and groan under a conservative domination; on the other hand, Mr. Brown and his followers maintained that it was the duty of reformers, in defiance of consequences to put down corruptionists who had broken faith with the people, and who by pandering to the Roman Catholic hierarchy, had even been false to the Protestant religion. The religious element was indeed largely intermixed with the election. Denunciation of corruption, and the upholding of what he called \"broad Protestant principles,\" were the two great weapons of Mr. Brown; and the religious disturbances which had taken place in 1858, in Quebec and Montreal, did much to aid his endeavors to excite religious antipathies. The conservatives, though without the violence of\nthe recalcitrant reformers, set to work actively to start candidates, and their strength, always very great in Upper Canada, was proved by the return of a large number of members. In Lower Canada, also, an active opposition canvass resulted in the return of some French members partaking more or less the views of Mr. Cauchon, who had been long a bitter opponent of Mr. Hincks' ministry, as well as of a number of \"rouges.\" Mr. Macdonald was returned triumphantly for Kingston. The new Parliament met at Quebec on the 5th of September. In the course of a few days, Mr. Hincks found it necessary to resign, and Sir Allan MacNab became the head of a cabinet, consisting partly of reformers, and partly of conservatives.\n\nThus was formed the Coalition of which Mr. Macdonald, as attorney-general, was, has been the life, and which, though it has met with much opposition and calumny, has been eminently advantageous to the country. From its very commencement, it had to encounter the assaults of parties agreed on nothing but the hatred of it. Extreme tories not seeing that it was absolutely necessary, in accordance with the demand of the country, to make a final settlement of the clergy reserves question, denounced the unholy alliance of Sir Allan MacNab and Mr. Macdonald, with supporters of secularization, such as Mr. Ross, and Mr. Spence. Extreme radicals, who hated the very name of a conservative with frenzied bitterness, did not hesitate to declare that they would neither parley with conservatives, nor accept from them any measures whatsoever. But if from the outset, the coalition has been unjustly and irrationally opposed, it also met from the beginning with a large share of rational support. Moderate conservatives and moderate reformers in the country, as well as in Parliament, saw that a ministry was wanted, composed of moderate and reasonable men who would dispose for ever of questions which, rightly or wrongly, had been the cause of endless trouble and vexation. That such politicians were right in supporting the new ministry the history of the last seven years amply proves. Not only has the Queen's government been carried on, but it has been carried on wisely and honorably. The few charges of corrupt speculation which an unscrupulous press has not hesitated to make against members of the government have been disposed of to the avowed satisfaction of vehement but candid opponents. Wise measures have been the result of moderate legislation; and with these measures the history of the province will for ever connect the name of Mr. Macdonald.\n\nThe first step of such of the new ministers as were members of the House of Assembly was to secure the seats which they had vacated by accepting office. Notwithstanding a violent opposition both from ultra-tories and ultra-radicals, they were all re-elected. Mr. Macdonald, who candidly and forcibly explained to the electors\nof Kingston his views and those of his colleagues on the state of public affairs, and the intentions of the new ministry with regard to the great questions before the country, was triumphantly returned without opposition. When the new ministers took their places they found that an opposition to their government had been duly organized. The clear grits, headed by Mr. Brown, the rouges, led by Mr. Dorion, and aided by Mr. Sandfield Macdonald and several moderate reformers, who considered that consistency with old reform traditions required them to refuse to act with moderate conservatives about to pass reform measures, had banded themselves together with a view to undiscriminating opposition. Although the seat immediately to the left of the speaker was by common consent accorded to Mr. Mackenzie, it was evident from the first that Mr. Brown was the real leader of the party. The task which the new conservative ministers had taken up was certainly not an easy one, although precedents for the course they pursued are to be found in British politics. Yielding to the voice of the country, expressed too distinctly to be disregarded, they had determined on the clergy reserves question, to take a course which they had hitherto constantly and vehemently opposed. For years the clergy reserves had been the grand subject of contention in Upper Canada. Claimed at first as the exclusive property of the Church of England, the members of the Church of Scotland maintained their right to a share in them\u2014a claim which was finally admitted after much agitation, and a decision of the twelve judges of England in its favor. Ultimately, in the distribution of the proceeds of the lands, still less exclusiveness was shown, and a large portion of the proceeds of them was, by an imperial act, placed at the disposal of the governor-general for the clergy of any denomination willing to receive public aid. But the agitation which had been at first raised against the exclusive claims of the Church of England had hardly ceased, when it was succeeded by another, which had for its object the entire alienation of the lands from religious uses. A large number of Presbyterians, who, sympathizing with the Scottish secession of 1843, withdrew in 1844 from the Canadian church in connection with the Church of Scotland, had discovered that public aid, however unreservedly and unconditionally it might be granted, was injurious to the cause of religion. The same persons who had hitherto only claimed what were considered to be the rights of the Church of Scotland, now cordially united with the party which had from the beginning opposed any application of the public property for the support of religion. As the Roman Catholics took no active part in the struggle which ensued, the contest was chiefly between members of the Church of England and the Church of Scotland, and a portion of the Wesleyan Methodists on the one side, and those who dissented altogether from\nthe religious establishments of the mother country on the other. The agitation was fiercely carried on; and although Mr. Baldwin, the excellent leader of the reformers, was well known to be adverse to secularization, the great body of his party were strong supporters of it. The conservatives, on the other hand, whose strength lay principally with persons who could see no wrong in the state's making some provision for the religious education of the people, vehemently denounced secularization. The result of the agitation was, as might have been expected, violence and bad feeling. The country became divided between secularizers and non-secularizers, and at elections riots and disturbances of all kinds were not unfrequent among the supporters and the enemies of the endowment. Whether those on principle opposed to the clergy reserves outnumbered those on principle in favor of them is, perhaps, doubtful. But, be this as it may, there arose in the country, among many who were decidedly in favor of religious endowments, a strong conviction that in some way or other the vexed question should be set at rest. Many members returned in 1854, who had no radical or clear grit leanings, shared in this conviction; and Mr. Macdonald and his colleagues had resolved to act on it. Whether history will record with approbation the alienation of the clergy reserves, from the purpose to which they had been originally set apart, is a question which need not now be discussed. But it can scarcely be doubted that the public feeling, and the view generally taken of the public interest at the time, rendered it necessary for the conservative portion of the ministry to surrender their own predilections. Not only did the country demand a settlement of the question; it must also be remembered that the new ministry was a coalition ministry, and that several of the Upper Canadian members of it had been always advocates of secularization. Mr. Macdonald, though he had long been an eloquent opponent of secularization, ably defended, in the House of Assembly, the course agreed on by his colleagues. They who judge such a course inconsistent with public duty, must equally pronounce sentence against such men as the Duke of Wellington and Sir Robert Peel.\n\nOn the 17th of October Mr. Macdonald introduced the bill which finally secularized the clergy reserves, and declared that there was to be in future no connection in Canada between church and state. The bill became law, and thus an agitation raised by reformers was settled by a partly conservative ministry. But in one respect the bill met in its progress with strong opposition. When the Imperial Parliament granted power in 1853 to the provincial legislature to deal as it thought proper with the clergy reserves, it added a proviso, that the rights of incumbents should be respected. To this, in dealing with the question, clear grits would have themselves been compelled to yield. But it occurred\nto Mr. Macdonald that it would be well to commute on just principles the claims of incumbents, and thus to erase for ever from the books of the province an account which had been the cause of so much trouble. To do so it became necessary to obtain the consent of the individuals and religious bodies interested. The whole proceeding caused great alarm to Mr. Brown; and, although most will be inclined to rejoice that in accordance with Mr. Macdonald's plan commutation was effected, the reserves handed to the municipalities, and the account for ever closed, it must be admitted that the clear grit chief was not mistaken when he expressed his apprehension that a foundation would thus be laid for a new endowment. Thanks to the liberality of the clergy, the amount of the commutation was applied by both churches to the formation of funds, to supply in some measure the place of the endowment which had been applied to secular purposes.\n\nThe new ministry did not confine its labors, in dealing with great questions, to the western section of the province. While Upper Canada had been agitated by the clergy reserves question, a conviction had become stronger in Lower Canada of the hardship, and injurious tendency of the tenure under which the greater part of the lands was held in that section of the country. That tenure was indeed a serious grievance. Lower Canada was the only part of the American continent in which, even in a modified form, there existed an imitation of the feudal system of the middle ages. Anxious to establish an aristocracy in Canada, the French kings, had on the early settlement of the country, granted large tracts of land to cadets of ancient families of France; and the patents under which they held their lands confirmed to them many of the privileges of the French noblesse. It was long before these privileges caused much annoyance to the censitaire. From the peculiar circumstances of the country, they were not at first felt to be oppressive. But although the charges upon the lands themselves were never high, the heavy payments due to the seigniors on the transfer of property, and the repression of industry caused by monopolies in trade, enjoyed, in some cases, by the seigniors, were sufficient to excite a people becoming daily more enterprising and energetic. Had the grievance been in itself only a trifling one, had seigniorial rights been merely nominal instead of actually burdensome, even then the vestiges of a past system would have been just subject of complaint. As it was, the strongest feeling prevailed on the matter in the rural parts of Lower Canada; and the neglect of the wrongs of the censitaires had been made at the general election, a matter of bitter reproach to Mr. Hincks's government. This great source of agitation and trouble was destined, as well as the clergy reserves, to be settled by the coalition ministry. The seigniorial tenure bill, was proceeded with pari passu with that for the secularization of the clergy reserves; and,\nwhile Lord Elgin had the satisfaction of sanctioning the day before he resigned the government, the act which disposed finally of the clergy reserves question, the cause of so much trouble in Upper Canada, he also gave his sanction to a measure providing for the abolition of the real grievance of the seigniorial tenure. Five years later, it was attempted in Upper Canada to rouse sectional feeling, by vehement protests against the payment of any portion of the legal rights of the seigniors from the public chest of the province; but it was at the same time proved to the satisfaction of all candid men, that the very parties who attempted to raise this clamor, had themselves in the beginning of August, 1858, when in the momentary possession of the reins of government, agreed to follow the very course for which they so bitterly reproached their opponents.\n\nOn the 23rd of February, the houses re-assembled. Sir Allan MacNab announced the retirement of Mr. Morin, who had been the leader of the Lower Canada section of Mr. Hincks's ministry. His successor was Mr. Cauchon. On the same day, the government was strengthened by the acquisition of Mr. Cartier, the present premier, who accepted office as provincial-secretary.\n\nTwo important measures distinguished the second half of the first session of the new Parliament. Sir Allan MacNab proceeded with the militia bill; and Mr. Cauchon took charge of another, which was not, however, passed till the next session, the object of which was gradually to render the Legislative Council elective. In this matter, Mr. Macdonald and his conservative colleagues had also felt it to be their duty to yield to the demands of the people. It had never been the desire of the conservatives, that the Legislative Council should consist of any persons but those nominated to it by the crown. This too, had always been the feeling of Mr. Baldwin and that section of the reformers of Upper Canada, whose views of politics may be said to have been formed after the model of the English Whigs. But an agitation originally begun in Lower, had extended to Upper Canada, in favor of an elective Council. With this agitation many throughout the country sympathized; and if the plan of two legislative bodies elected by the same people, seem to be of doubtful expediency in theory, it must be admitted that the old Legislative Council had come to be of little practical account. To suit the exigencies of ministers, not a few appointments had been made to it of at least doubtful utility; and for some years previous to the passing of the bill which provided for its being ultimately rendered elective, it had, in ordinary matters at least, almost ceased to act as a check upon the House of Assembly. Formerly, when chief-justices, prelates, and high permanent officials were wont to take part in the debates of the two Legislative Councils, they had exercised powers which the Houses of Assembly of the two provinces made ground of complaint. But since the\nunion, the Legislative Council had rapidly declined in influence. Able men, became, for the most part, unwilling to join it; and the best friends of the crown appointing principle found it difficult to defend a body which rendered such little service to the country. There was a general impression that the proceedings of the House of Assembly should be revised, but that the Legislative Council was either unequal to the task, or unwilling to perform it; and the bill met with the approval of many who felt reluctant to diminish any of the privileges of the crown. Mr. Cauchon, who introduced the bill, had himself on former occasions opposed the principle of two elective chambers; and he, as well as Mr. Macdonald and his conservative colleagues from Upper Canada, yielded to the demand of public opinion. The bill became law in 1856; and thus the coalition ministry was identified with the settlement of another great question.\n\nIn the first session, too, the Grand Trunk Railway engaged the earnest attention of ministers. Mr. Macdonald and his conservative colleagues had disapproved of the arrangement made by Mr. Hincks for the building of the Grand Trunk Railway, as less favorable than it might have been to the province, and likely to prove a source of corruption. That arrangement was, however, a \"fait accompli;\" and they now agreed, as on subsequent occasions, that the public faith, and the public interest required that this great and beneficial public work should be sustained, even if at a heavier cost, than any one had at first anticipated. In recording some of the great measures in connection with which the coalition will be ever remembered in the history of the country, little has been said of Mr. Macdonald. But that he deserves much of the credit is proved by the fact that he was made by the opposition to bear the head and front of the offending with which they charged the government. It is sufficient to say that he constantly and on all occasions gave his colleagues the fullest benefit of his talents and his knowledge of the wants and wishes of the country, and there is not one of them who would not admit that the success of the ministry was largely due to his exertions.\n\nBut the government had a stormy session before it at Toronto, which had again after much debate, become the temporary capital. Parliament met on the 15th of February; and there were soon indications of trouble. In the debates upon the address, the ministers were most violently, and unreasonably assailed. Mr. Macdonald, in a powerful speech, defended the government from the combined assaults of ultra-radicals, and ultra-tories, of ultra-Upper Canadians from the west, and ultra-Frenchmen from Lower Canada. The reply in answer to the speech from the throne was carried by a large majority, notwithstanding the most violent opposition. On the 10th of March, Mr. J. Hillyard Cameron moved for a copy of the charge delivered by Mr. Justice Duval,\non the occasion of the trial of a number of men at Quebec for the murder of Robert Corrigan at St. Sylvester, a township not far distant from that city. Although the proof against the accused was generally considered to be conclusive, they were one and all acquitted by the jury which tried them. Corrigan was a Protestant, and the members of the jury, as well as the judge, were Roman Catholics. The evidence at the trial was largely copied by the press from one end of the province to the other; and not only was the conduct of the jury severely animadverted upon, but the judge came in also for a large share of censure. No trial indeed had ever before caused such excitement in the country; and the opposition press of Upper Canada took advantage of it, in their attempts to gain over the Orange party to the clear-grit cause. Mr. Cameron's motion was opposed by the government on various constitutional grounds, but was carried by a majority of four. It was clearly proved, by a subsequent vote that the government notwithstanding possessed the confidence of a large majority of the members of the House of Assembly; and although the division on Mr. Cameron's motion brought things to something like a crisis, it was not followed by the resignation of ministers.\n\nThere is no doubt however that the vote on Mr. Cameron's motion did much for a time to weaken the position of the ministry. And, while a religious issue was energetically raised against them, other difficulties were not wanting. Complaints had been not unfrequent among the supporters of the coalition who had formerly acted with the reform party, concerning the leadership of Sir Allan MacNab. In their eyes, Sir Allan was too much identified with the old fashioned toryism to which they and their party had been always warmly opposed. It was said among the reform supporters of the government that Sir Allan was under the influence of the remnant of the compact party still to be found at Toronto; that attempts were being made to organize a party exclusively tory; and that such attempts would continue, as long as even the nominal leadership was in Sir Allan's hands. Nor was this cry altogether confined to the reform wing of the coalition. Not a few moderate conservatives felt strongly that it was essential to the triumph of moderate and rational views in politics, that the coalition should be led by a man whose opinions were obnoxious to neither section of the moderate party. It was further said that even if Sir Allan's views were more modern than they were, the state of his health rendered it utterly impossible for him to be the efficient leader of a party. Mr. Macdonald long resisted these views and stood firmly for Sir Allan; but the complaints became louder and louder. Although some politicians did not hesitate to say and to write the contrary, if Mr. Macdonald's course was reprehensible in this matter, it was so in that he stood too long for Sir Allan MacNab's leadership. It pained Mr. Macdonald, than whom no man could\nbe a truer friend, to see Sir Allan's leadership repudiated by many. But Mr. Macdonald had a duty to perform to his party, and to the country, with which no personal feelings could be permitted to interfere; and while some, with the grossest injustice, accused him of deserting Sir Allan MacNab, others with more reason, blamed him for a too protracted defence of what they called an effete leadership. In the meantime old reformers and old conservatives from Upper Canada agreed in signing an address to Mr. Macdonald, expressive of confidence in his ability and sympathy with his political opinions, and declaring definitely that they regarded him as their chief. On the 23rd May, Sir Allan retired, and Sir Etienne (then Mr.) Tach\u00e9, an old and respected politician from Lower Canada, became the leader of the newly constituted government, which was strengthened at the same time, by the accession of Mr. Vankoughnet, in whom Mr. Macdonald had discerned the eminent administrative ability which he has since displayed, as leader of the Legislative Council, and commissioner of crown lands. Upper Canadian ministerialists would have preferred that Mr. Macdonald had become the leader of the ministry. But there had been two Upper Canadian premiers in succession, and it was thought that Sir Etienne Tach\u00e9 was entitled to succeed Sir Allan. The new premier being a member of the Legislative Council, Mr. Macdonald became leader of the House of Assembly. The position of the government was, for a time, more than critical. Ex-ministers united with men who had formerly denounced them with the utmost bitterness in factious opposition to the administration; and the Grand Trunk Railway became again a source of trouble. But the difficulties of the session served to bring out to the fullest extent the great political talents of Mr. Macdonald. Violently denounced by some of the opponents of the government, his tact and sagacity were more than a match for them all; and ere the session was brought to a close, there was an evident re-action in favor of ministers, who succeeded in carrying various useful and important measures.\n\nThe re-action in favor of the ministry, which became evident ere the close of the stormy session of 1856, extended throughout the country; and the government passed triumphantly through the session of 1857. Parliament met on the 26th February; Mr. Macdonald lost no time in pressing forward some of the many measures of law reform with which his name is identified, and which would of themselves be sufficient to secure him a high place among the benefactors of the province. The proceedings of the session gave on the whole great satisfaction to moderate men throughout the country. Many wise measures had been placed upon the statute book. The difficulties of 1856 had caused not a few to doubt whether the province was fit for self-government. But in 1857 the tactics of the opposition had been happily frustrated.\nThe work of Parliament was done peaceably and efficiently. Few personal disputes had occurred; and the most doubtful looked forward with hope to the successful working of constitutional government.\n\nThings went on quietly during the summer; but late in the year it was determined to dissolve Parliament. Sir Etienne Tach\u00e9 having resigned the premiership, he was succeeded by Mr. Macdonald, whose influence in Parliament, and in the country, naturally pointed him out as the most proper person to hold that high office. In the general election which followed, the greatest efforts were made by the opposition. To the old cry of \"corruption,\" was added that of \"broad Protestant principles,\" which was now made use of with greater vigor than ever. Scandalous newspaper articles, in which gross fabrications against the government were disseminated throughout the country, were followed, in the rural districts of Upper Canada, by still more scandalous placards and pamphlets. It would be idle either to search out or to contradict the libels which were printed in Toronto, and circulated by thousands throughout the country. The members of the government were held up to public odium as little better than public robbers; while the alleged religious issue was stated with an effrontery characteristic of those who resorted to it. In some counties the issue was made to lie between the Pope on the one side, and the Queen on the other, and there was not one in which both clear grit writers and clear grit speakers did not appeal to sectional and religious prejudices. The result of the election was, that while Lower Canada sustained the new government, and turned out almost the whole band of rouges who had been elected to oppose Mr. Hincks's administration, the opposition boasted of a small majority from the western section of the province.\n\nParliament met on the 25th of February, and it was soon evident that a stormy session was to take place. The debates on the address were protracted and vehement; and the alleged triumphs of the opposition in Upper Canada were dwelt on with enthusiasm. But the seat of government question, which had been left to her Majesty for arbitration, after various unsuccessful attempts by Parliament to dispose of it, proved to be the great difficulty of the session. It was plain, that there was a strong feeling against the choice of Ottawa; and in both houses many members did not hesitate to express themselves in favor of reversing it. At last, late in July, the question was tried. It was moved in the House of Assembly that it was cause of deep regret to the house that her Majesty had been advised to select Ottawa for the capital of the country; and on the 28th of July the motion was carried by a majority of fourteen.\n\nIt was clear to all that in maintaining the decision of her Majesty; the ministry had only done what any ministry would\nhave been obliged to do; and the indiscretion of Mr. Brown, who never showed any of the tact so necessary in a parliamentary leader, made it evident, that notwithstanding this vote, the government had the confidence of a decided majority of the House of Assembly. After the vote was taken, Mr. Brown insisted that it was nothing more or less than a direct censure upon the government, and to test the confidence of the house in the policy of the government, he moved that the house adjourn. The motion was rejected by a majority of eleven, and thus confidence was declared distinctly in the ministry, notwithstanding the dissatisfaction of the majority with the Queen's decision. But Mr. Macdonald and his colleagues thought it their duty to resign, and on the 29th, Mr. Macdonald announced to the House of Assembly that they only held office till their successors were appointed. In the meantime, Mr. Brown was sent for by the governor, and on the 30th, the House of Assembly was informed that in conjunction with Mr. Dorion he had undertaken the task of forming an administration. It is needless to describe the medley cabinet which succeeded that of Mr. Macdonald; to point out how opposed in principle, the members of it had been to each other, on many important points, and how frequently they had loaded one another with abuse. It is sufficient to say that the new ministers had been but two days in office, when the Legislative Council, by a vote of sixteen to eight, declared in the strongest terms that it did not possess their confidence, and on the same day, the House of Assembly took the same stand by a vote of seventy-one to thirty-one. Mr. Brown and his colleagues demanded a dissolution; but the governor-general refused, and stated his reasons in an able state paper. The conclusion of the whole thing was, that Mr. Cartier, the present premier, the leader of the largest party in the House of Assembly, was requested to form a new ministry. With some exceptions it was composed of the same members as the old. Mr. Macdonald remained attorney general of Upper Canada. Mr. Sherwood entered the cabinet, and Mr. Galt became minister of finance. Mr. Brown and his colleagues of the House of Assembly had, by accepting office, vacated their seats, and had consequently to return to their constituents; while the old ministers, who had been within a month recalled to the public service, resumed office without re-election. This circumstance was turned largely into account in ad misericordiam appeals of friends of the Brown-Dorion ministry; and the \"double shuffle,\" as the change of offices was termed, which took place before Mr. Cartier's ministry was regularly formed, was denounced with savage bitterness. It was certainly desirable that the Brown-Dorion ministry should be summarily dismissed. It could not but be injurious to the public morals to witness men who had assailed each other in the most violent language, and whose opinions were so strongly opposed, uniting for the sake of office. It would however, have been better\nhad their ministry never been formed. Mr. Macdonald and his colleagues, possessing as they did the confidence of a decided majority, should not have been permitted to resign; and if they insisted upon doing so, perhaps Mr. Brown should have had the chance of a dissolution. But against a dissolution the governor urged various weighty reasons; and certainly the fact that the House of Assembly which by a most overwhelming majority, declared non-confidence in Mr. Brown's ministry, had been elected but a few months before by the people, tended much to justify his refusal to dissolve.\n\nDuring this crisis Mr. Macdonald displayed to their fullest extent his great political talents; and the speech in which he defended himself and his colleagues against the charges of Mr. McGee, has never, perhaps, been surpassed in effect, by any delivered in a Canadian Parliament. The session terminated on the 16th August. Notwithstanding all that occurred, the government had succeeded in passing many salutary enactments. For various legal measures of importance passed during the session, Upper Canada is indebted to Mr. Macdonald. In particular, acts were passed amending the law in relation to the jurisdiction and procedure of the surrogate courts, abolishing imprisonment for debt in certain cases in Upper Canada, preventing preferential assignments to creditors, and amending the jury laws. The antiquated usury laws were amended; the customs tariff was revised; the elective franchise was defined, and a system established for the registration of voters. The surrogate court act is regarded by lawyers as a chef d'\u0153uvre of legal ability and skill, and has greatly perfected and facilitated the administration of justice.\n\nWhen the session was over, the new ministry had to encounter, for a time, a storm of abuse such as has rarely, never perhaps, even in Canada, fallen upon politicians. The \"double shuffle,\" some foolish men ventured to pronounce to be nothing short of perjury. When the change of offices took place, ministers had, they said, sworn to perform certain duties without having the least intention of performing them. A more absurd charge could not have been made. It is plain that the oath which a minister takes on assuming office is not an oath to continue to perform certain duties, from which he may at any moment be removed, but an oath to perform faithfully the duties of his office as long as he holds it. That there was for a time no small measure of sympathy with the two days' ministers is undeniable; but a reaction soon set in in favor of the government. It was borne in mind that after their resignation, the newly elected representatives of the people had by a decided majority declared that they still possessed their confidence; and in returning to office without re-election, their course, though it may seem to have been in accordance with the letter, rather than with the spirit of the law, was approved by\nthe House of Assembly, and sustained by the decision of the judges. Before Parliament met in 1859, the horrors of the \"double shuffle\" were almost forgotten, except by the victims of it; while the reckless abandonment of principle which had been exhibited by Mr. Brown and his colleagues, had done much to weaken the hold of the opposition on the public mind.\n\nParliament met at Toronto on the 29th of January. The government was supported throughout by large majorities. Although many measures of importance were agreed to, the debates were comparatively quiet, and the hackneyed charges of \"corruption\" were disregarded.\n\nBut one circumstance served as a cry to Mr. Brown and his party. During this session, as during the last, the ministry had occasionally been in a minority as far as Upper Canada was concerned. The cry of Lower Canada domination was vigorously taken up. It was said that Upper Canada was at the mercy of Lower Canada; that even if the western section had a representation commensurate with its population there would still be danger of the influence of a people who stood so closely together as the French Canadians. It was determined that the next agitation should be conducted in no common manner, and a solemn convention of the \"liberals\" of Upper Canada was summoned to meet in November, at Toronto. It was resolved by this body that the union of Upper and Lower Canada had failed to realize the intention of its promoters; that the constitutional system of the province, a counterpart, though it was of that of Great Britain, was defective, and that the formation of two or more local governments, with some joint authority, was imperatively necessary. It was reserved for Mr. Macdonald to put down the crude theories of the convention, and to lead the moderate party to victory in defending the union and parliamentary government.\n\nThe next session of Parliament took place at Quebec. On the first day of the session, Mr. Brown gave notice of a resolution embodying the views of the convention. It was long, however, before he actually brought it forward. A motion declaring non-confidence in the government was rejected three weeks after the meeting of Parliament, by a large majority. Mr. Brown, stung to the quick by an appeal from Major Campbell, member for Rouville, to retire from the leadership of a party with which he said Lower Canadians could never act as long as he was at the head of it, endeavored to vindicate his political course in a very able and powerful speech. Mr. Macdonald's reply was, however, without doubt, the speech of the session of 1860; his expose of the discreditable means by which an Upper Canada majority had been gained by the opposition at the general election, was most searching; he pointed out that Mr. Brown, superior to all his party in energy and talent, was supported by many of them from very terror, that\nthey winced under his arrogant lead and followed him without loving him.\n\nThe motion was rejected; and while the opposition were understood to be wrangling as to the leadership, the government proceeded with the financial projects of Mr. Galt, and other measures of importance. On the 30th of April Mr. Brown propounded to the House of Assembly the \"true remedy\" proposed by the convention. A long debate followed; and many of the opposition refused to commit themselves to the wild plans of Mr. Brown and his friends. Mr. Macdonald did not reply to Mr. Brown; but in his former speech he had defended eloquently the views of the government as to the political future of the province. In that speech he had maintained that there were two distinct parties in the province\u2014the moderate and constitutional party, and the ultras of both sections, who were united in seeking changes which would be as prejudicial to Upper, as to Lower Canada. After defending the British system of government from the friends of American institutions, he declared that he was heart and soul for the union, and that he believed that nature had intended that the people who lived on the banks of the great lakes, should be one with the people who lived on the banks of the great river.\n\nBut although the projects of the convention were scouted by Parliament, Mr. Brown and his party maintained warmly that they were approved by the great body of the people of Upper Canada. It was soon found that under the lead of Mr. Macdonald the great moderate party of Upper Canada, was determined to resist the dismemberment of the province, and the overthrow of its institutions. There had long been an earnest desire that Mr. Macdonald should visit Upper Canada and explain to the people his views on the state of the country. He was entreated by cities, towns, and villages to visit them, and he at last late in the year consented. Mr. Macdonald's tour through Upper Canada was of the greatest advantage to his party. Toronto, Hamilton, London, Brantford, Simcoe, Dunnville, Guelph, St. Thomas, St. Catherines, Caledonia, Milbrook, Belleville and many other places were the scenes of triumphant demonstrations in his honor. There was an enthusiastic desire to see and hear him. He who had been denounced as the worst enemy of the people, was everywhere received with the most cordial expressions of welcome. At various, and numerously attended public dinners, he defended his own cause and that of his colleagues powerfully and successfully; loyally pleaded for British connection, and British institutions; and called upon the people to oppose to the last at the polls the enemies of the union of Upper and Lower Canada. It is not to be supposed that Kingston would be behind other places in doing honor to its representative. His own constituents, proud of their member, received Mr. Macdonald most heartily, and he defended\nto the satisfaction of them all, his course on the occasion of the visit of the Prince of Wales. It was assuredly no fault of his, that the citizens of Kingston had not the honor of a visit from the heir of the throne; and no abuse had been able to weaken Mr. Macdonald's hold on the affections of his constituents.\n\nThe session of 1861 was opened at Quebec on the 16th of March. The ministry received the support of a large majority of the whole house; and the complaints of their carrying on the government in defiance of Upper Canada became feebler. It was so evident that of the parties into which the Upper Canadian members were divided, they had the support of by far the largest, that the fact of their being occasionally left in a minority from that section told but little against them. The great debate of the session was that on representation by population\u2014a question which on the eve of an election was taken up very earnestly by many Upper Canadians. Mr. Macdonald, in a noble speech, gave the House of Assembly his opinions upon the question, and did not hesitate, even in the immediate prospect of a general election, to deprecate the introduction of a question so likely to endanger the peace of the province. \"He hoped,\" he said in conclusion, \"that for ages, for ever, Canada might remain united with the mother country. But we were fast ceasing to be a dependency and assuming the position of an ally of Great Britain. England would be the centre, surrounded and sustained by an alliance not only with Canada but Australia, and all her other possessions; and there would thus be formed an immense confederation of freemen, the greatest confederacy of civilized and intelligent men that ever had an existence on the face of the globe. We, in our sphere, should avoid occasions of difference. Statesmen should endeavor not to cause division but to promote union; let them return to their homes determined to use every legitimate means for carrying out their views on other subjects; but let them not make this question of representation by population a matter of party agitation and party strife; let them all set aside party feeling in a matter of such vital consequence as this, and work in common on the principle of union, and not on the principle of one section striving against the other and seeking to annihilate it.\"\n\nThe general election which took place in the summer resulted, it need hardly be said, in the triumph of the friends of the union and the constitution. While Mr. Brown was defeated at Toronto, and while his party lost many constituencies of which they had always considered themselves sure, Mr. Macdonald, strongly avowing his conservative views and his attachment to British institutions, was returned for Kingston by an overwhelming majority. \"The fratricidal conflict,\" he said in his address, \"now unhappily raging in the United States shows us the superiority of our institutions, and of the principle on which they are based. Long may that\nprinciple\u2014the monarchical principle\u2014prevail in this land. Let there be no 'looking to Washington,' as was threatened by a leading member of the opposition last session; but let the cry with the moderate party be, 'Canada united as one province, and under one sovereign.' It must be admitted that the troubles in the United States did not a little tend to increase the loyal attachment to our institutions which prevailed in Upper Canada. While Mr. Brown was defeated at Toronto, Mr. Dorion, the Lower Canada opposition leader, was defeated at Montreal by Mr. Cartier. The result of the general election gave the greatest satisfaction to the moderate party throughout the country.\n\nSince the formation of the coalition ministry Mr. Macdonald has taken a leading part in the conduct of all public affairs. In Parliament especially, his aptitude for business, his quickness of apprehension, his extensive constitutional learning, his promptitude in debate, either to attack or to defend, his acuteness in perceiving the weak points in the arguments of his opponents, his ready wit in turning aside their attacks on the weak points of his own, his generous temper and frank and unassuming manners, which render him a favorite even with his political adversaries, and his warm attachment and inflexible adherence to his personal and political friends, all unite to make him powerful either as a leader or a colleague. It is understood that there has always been the best feeling between him and Mr. Cartier, who, while a genuine French Canadian, is liberal in his views, can see advantages in British laws and institutions, and when he does, is willing to adopt them, not out of servility to England or Englishmen, but out of love to Canada, and an honest desire for the progress and prosperity of his countrymen. The recent election has amply shown the estimation in which Mr. Macdonald is held in Upper Canada, and gives reason to expect that he will long continue to influence the public counsels. That he is likely to do so is matter of just congratulation, for of all the public men of the province, there is no one in whom the country places, and is justified in placing, greater confidence, not only on account of his eminent talent and his acknowledged freedom from schemes of personal aggrandizement, but because of the union in him of a conservative feeling which rejects rash innovations, with that clear good sense which discerns, and is ready to carry out every reasonable reform.\nHON. GEORGE E. CARTIER,\n\nPREMIER AND ATTORNEY-GENERAL FOR LOWER CANADA.\n\nJACQUES CARTIER, or Quartier, as some of the old French writers have it, to whom belongs the honor of having discovered Canada, is understood to have left no issue. It is certain, however, that some of his nephews were in the habit of going backwards and forwards between old and new France. They finally became residents of the colony which their illustrious uncle had added to the kingdom of France; and from one of them the present prime minister is descended. George Etienne Cartier was born on the 6th of September, 1814, at St. Antoine, on the Chambly river, in the county of Verch\u00e8res, Lower Canada; that parish having almost from time immemorial been the residence of the Cartier family. The grandfather of the subject of this notice, who bore the name of the discoverer of Canada, was one of the first representatives of the county of Verch\u00e8res, which, under the constitutional act of 1791, was first called the county of Surrey. He was also one of the most enterprising and successful merchants in that part of the country.\n\nM. Cartier received his education at the college of St. Sulpice, in the city of Montreal; which was founded in 1773 by the seminary of Montreal, and is conducted by the priests and ecclesiastics of St. Sulpice. At this institution, he went through a regular collegiate course of eight years. Having left college, he entered upon the study of the law in the office of the late Mr. E. E. Rodier, a leading member of the Montreal bar, and at one time representative of the county of L'Assomption. In 1835 our future prime minister commenced practice, selecting the chief city in the province, Montreal, for the theatre of his professional career, where he must necessarily encounter the competition of the ablest members of the Lower Canada bar. The result showed that the young advocate had not miscalculated his strength, for he succeeded in establishing an extensive and lucrative practice. He has had for law partners, at different times, M. J. A. Berthelet and M. Dummerville. Like most men who make their way to the highest distinctions which their country affords, M. Cartier is a man of never-flagging industry. Scarcely of medium height and of a light build, he possesses that strength of constitution which is best proved by the severe test of continued labor in a profession requiring close application and the continued exertion of mental effort.\nWhen M. Cartier was a law student, there was, in the abuses of the ruling oligarchy, and especially the systematic proscription of his race, enough to fire the generous enthusiasm of every lover of justice and hater of misrule. Politics had for young Cartier already a deep interest. The star of the Hon. Louis Joseph Papineau was then in the ascendant. He was the leader, both in and out of the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada, of the French Canadians, who formed four-fifths of the population. Although M. Papineau was speaker of the house for some twenty years, his tongue was not tied; for everything was debated in committee of the whole, and he regularly took a leading part in the discussion. The country was mocked with the form of constitutional government, while it was denied the substance. It had a Legislative Assembly, elected by the people; but that body had no control over the executive officers by whom the government was administered. The hostile majority which it permanently presented to the government was powerless to effect any change in the administration. The Legislative Council, whose members were appointed by the crown upon recommendations presented by the governor-in-chief, was the prop of the irresponsible oligarchy. It constantly threw out bills passed by the representatives of the people, or so mutilated them, under the pretence of amendments, as to destroy their purport. The collision thus brought about between the two houses became chronic. The Legislative Assembly complained to the Imperial Government of the Legislative Council; and the latter replied by a counter accusation, in which the governor sometimes joined. The oligarchy which thus ruled Lower Canada in defiance of the wishes of the people, as expressed by their powerless representatives, succeeded in deceiving the Imperial Government into the belief that this mode of governing was necessary to the preservation of British supremacy. The Canada committee of the House of Commons, of which the present Earl of Derby was a member, after investigating the grievances complained of by 87,000 Lower Canada petitioners, hinted that all was not right. But no remedy came. M. Papineau, to tell the truth, had but a faint conception of the true remedy. He did not, like Mr. Baldwin, in Upper Canada, see that the whole difficulty was traceable to the irresponsibility of the executive. The famous ninety-two resolutions passed by the Lower Canada House of Assembly, in 1834, and which embody all the grievances, real and imaginary, under which the country was suffering, never allude to the real source of all the existing evils, except to object, in two lines, to \"the vicious composition and the irresponsibility of the Executive Council,\" the members of which, whether lawyers or not, were also judges of appeal. Papineau, who at first set out as an advocate of British as opposed to French ideas of government, became in time soured by long years of fruitless effort to secure a reformed administration,\nand was led or driven by degrees to prefer American institutions to British. At that time, the great men of the American revolution had not all passed away; and American democracy, being made respectable in their persons, fascinated many of the young men of Lower Canada. M. Papineau did not, however, often push this preference to such an extent as to make it offensively conspicuous. The chief remedy for the evils inflicted on the country by the oligarchy he believed lay in an extension of the democratic element\u2014in giving greater scope to the elective principle. This idea originated in the obstructive conduct of the crown-nominated Legislative Council. To make that body elective was deemed the alpha and omega of reform; the real difficulty being, in point of fact, in the existence of an irresponsible executive. Still, whatever the errors or the oversights of M. Papineau, he was the acknowledged champion of a proscribed race.\n\nIn 1832 the population of Lower Canada was about 500,000, of whom 425,000 were of French descent and spoke the French language, while the remaining 75,000 comprised the whole English population. Yet the latter monopolised 157 offices, while by the former only 47 were held, and these were generally of an inferior order, which often made the holders dependent on the race which monopolised nearly all the principal situations. Of the judges, only three were French, although, in the seigniories, the civil laws of France were in force, and with these English judges were necessarily but little acquainted. The practice once resorted to by James I. of interrogating the judges in private upon cases on which they would afterwards have to adjudicate, was frequently resorted to, and it was complained that a disposition was shown to screen criminals who had rendered themselves conspicuous in the service of the government. As late as 1843, only four French judges occupied seats on the bench of Lower Canada, and one of these, Judge Valli\u00e8res, had only been appointed second judge in Quebec by Lord Gosford. Before then, Quebec, Montreal, and Three Rivers districts had each but one French Canadian judge to administer French law\u2014Panet, Bedard and Rolland. An attempt was made to impose upon the French Canadians the English law of primogeniture, (which has since been abolished even in Upper Canada), dowry, and several other customs that were repugnant to the great majority of the population. Lord Gosford was probably, to a certain extent, duped by the pretence of the oligarchy that the preservation of British interests required the systematic exclusion of French Canadians from real legislative influence or executive position, and as if he expected to conciliate the proscribed race by the most transparent of expedients, he procured the appointment to the Legislative Council of a few persons who had been favorites of the people and leaders in the other house. But when they found that the number of those who had received such\nappointments was so small that they were rendered powerless by the superior number of the props of the oligarchy, they resolved to abstain from taking part in the proceedings of the chamber of which they were members. The judicial and legislative functions were united in the persons of some legislative councillors; aliens were, contrary to the constitutional act, appointed to that chamber; pluralists grew fat on public plunder; and partizan returning officers attempted but in vain, to force unwelcome representatives upon the people.\n\nIt was under this condition of things that M. Cartier first began to take an interest in politics. M. Papineau, with all his errors, was the champion of the oppressed majority, and as such he received the support of M. Cartier, up to a certain point.\n\nTo the exertions of Lord Durham is due the change of system which had produced such a numerous train of evils, culminating in insurrection both in Upper and Lower Canada. His report, as high commissioner for inquiring into the condition of the country, dealt the death-blow to the oligarchy. In 1841, seven years before M. Cartier entered Parliament, responsible government had been established. In 1848 he was first elected for the county of Verch\u00e8res, succeeding the Hon. Mr. Leslie, whom the crown had appointed member of the other chamber. M. Cartier continued to represent that constituency until the general election of 1861, when he contested Montreal with the leader of the rouge or Lower Canada opposition party, M. Dorion, who had hitherto always been returned for that constituency with tremendous majorities and defeated every candidate that could be brought against him; after a hard struggle the victory was declared on M. Cartier's side. This has been declared the greatest election triumph ever achieved in this country, giving as it were the death blow to the Lower Canadian oppositionists. At the election in 1857, he contested Montreal as well as his old constituency, and although he did not secure his own election for the city, his object in standing a double contest was generally considered to have been secured in the defeat of Mr. Holton.\n\nOn the 25th of January, 1856, M. Cartier was first appointed to a ministerial office; he became provincial-secretary in the MacNab-Tach\u00e9 ministry. On the 24th of May, 1856, he succeeded Mr. Drummond as attorney-general for Lower Canada, on the formation of the Tach\u00e9-Macdonald ministry. In November, 1857, he became leader of the Lower Canada section of the government, the Hon. J. A. Macdonald becoming premier, and the ministry, under its new phase, being known as the Macdonald-Cartier ministry. On the 6th August, 1858, a slight change in the wheel of fortune produced a transposition of these names, and we have since the Cartier-Macdonald administration.\n\nHaving given a faint picture of that state of the administration which induced M. Cartier to support M. Papineau till responsible\ngovernment was conceded, we must now give the reason which afterwards induced him to oppose the ancient chief. The re-union of Upper and Lower Canada was a measure effected in opposition to the will and the remonstrances of the latter; and M. Papineau, whose temper had become cynical by an opposition of twenty years, resolved to do his best to render the union insuperative. His countrymen were not prepared to sustain him in that resolve; and a new leader arising in the person of M. Louis Hypolite Lafontaine, who was prepared to work the union to the best advantage, M. Papineau, when he reappeared in the Legislative Assembly of United Canada, after eleven years of absence, the greater part of which had been spent in exile, literally stood alone. His eloquent denunciation\u2014and even in English he was the most eloquent speaker in the house\u2014elicited no response; and the most he could do on any occasion was to find a second for any resolution he might propose. It was the opposition of men like M. Cartier, who now appeared in Parliament for the first time, that assisted to reduce the ancient and once all-powerful leader of the French Canadians to this position. M. Cartier is, however, essentially a party man. He never once placed himself in opposition to his leader, though he found it necessary to change Papineau for Lafontaine. He was not a man who could ever be suspected of possible infidelity to party engagements; but he was not bound to follow M. Papineau, beyond the conspicuous failure in 1837, into new follies, the end of which the wisest could not have foreseen.\n\nAs a legislator, M. Cartier assisted to carry the bill for abolishing the seignorial tenures, that for making the Legislative Council elective, and that for secularising the clergy reserves, as well as all the other important measures of the governments with which he has been connected. Of several important measures he was the author, and to his exertions was owing their enactment by the legislature. To say nothing of the Victoria Bridge bill, which he carried when even the usually active and undaunted energy of Mr. Hincks seemed on the point of flagging, M. Cartier, in 1856, framed and carried a measure to provide for the establishment of three normal schools in Lower Canada; and a few months after, the Laval normal school in Quebec and the Jacques Cartier and McGill normal schools in Montreal were ready for the admission of pupils. In 1857, he introduced and carried a measure to provide for the codification of the procedure and civil laws of Lower Canada. In the same session he framed and carried a most important measure, the object of which was to break up the system of judicial centralisation in Lower Canada, which had produced so much inconvenience. The administration of justice in criminal cases, and in all civil matters where the amount involved was over fifty pounds, was confined to seven places\u2014Quebec, Montreal, Three Rivers, St. Francis, Aylmer, Sherbrooke, and Gasp\u00e9, in a country exceeding\nseven hundred or eight hundred miles in length. Thirteen new judicial districts were established, in which contracts for new gaols have been entered into. In the same session, two years after the feudal tenures commutation bill had been passed, M. Cartier introduced the French civil law into the townships of Lower Canada, its operation having previously been confined to the seigniories. In the session for 1860, he passed the act dividing the cities of Montreal, Quebec and Toronto into electoral divisions, thus completely doing away with the old inconvenient system, by which such bloody and painful results were always sure to take place. M. Cauchon also introduced the admirable municipal bill which the lower province now enjoys.\n\nM. Cartier, the present premier, is a man of unimpeachable integrity, who, every year of his official life, submits to a sacrifice of professional emolument which must make him a poor minister. An avaricious grasping after money he regards as fatal to the career of any public man. He is of an hospitable disposition. As a speaker, his enemies have sometimes accused him of prolixity, but it would be nearer the truth to say that he is an exhaustive speaker. There is nothing to be said on his side of a subject after he sits down. His enunciation of French in Parliament is, perhaps, the most distinct of any member of the house, and he has a perfect command of English. As a leader and a member of the government, he has been found to be one of the most honest and upright ministers which it has been our good fortune to possess; as a man to conciliate the confidence of a party, he is at the present time incomparably the strongest man in Lower Canada, having a large majority by the recent general election in the house.\n\nOn the occasion of the late ministry resigning in 1858, when defeated in attempting to carry out the Queen's decision in favor of Ottawa as the seat of government, Mr. Isaac Buchanan the member for Hamilton, paid a warm tribute of his respect and unimpaired confidence to the ex-premier, the Honorable John A. Macdonald, and to the Honorable G. E. Cartier, his chief associate in the government from Lower Canada. He finally (and evidently to the great satisfaction of the house), summed up his estimate of Mr. Cartier's character, as we may appropriately sum up ours in closing this sketch, in the magnificent lines of the ode of Horace:\n\n\"Justice et tenacem propositi virum\nNon civium arbor prava jubentium,\nNon vulpes instantis tyranni\nMente quaest solidae, neque Auster\nDux inquieti turbidus Adris,\nNeo fulminantis magna Jovis manus:\nSi fractus illabatur orbis,\nImpavidum ferient ruina.\"\n\nM. Cartier is married to a most amiable French Canadian lady, and is the father of several very interesting children.\nHON. J. CAUCHON,\n\nCOMMISSIONER OF PUBLIC WORKS.\n\nM. Cauchon was born, we believe, in the city of Quebec, St. Roch's suburb, about the year 1820, though his family, one of the oldest in the colony, was first settled at l'Ange Gardien, a parish on the north shore of the St. Lawrence, in the vicinity of Quebec. He received a good classical education in the Petit S\u00e9minaire de Qu\u00e9bec, after which he commenced the study of the law. He was, in due time admitted to the bar, but, we believe, never practised his profession. He felt, from his childhood, a strong inclination for political life and political discussions, and was hardly twenty years old when he began writing for newspapers. His first essays appeared in the Canadien, the oldest French Canadian newspaper, then under the able editorial management of M. Etienne Parent, but soon after (in 1842) he established, in co-partnership with his brother-in-law, Mr. Cot\u00e9, the Journal de Qu\u00e9bec, which is still in existence, and owes in great part its success to the talents and ability of the subject of this sketch.\n\nIn 1844, M. Cauchon was elected a member of the Legislative Assembly for the county of Montmorency, and although one of the youngest members of the house, took at once a conspicuous part in the debates. He at first expressed himself with difficulty, and for two or three sessions, he was far from being an agreeable speaker. However, he never lost an opportunity of speaking, and his perseverance gradually effected a wonderful improvement, for he is now one of the most fluent, effective and energetic speakers of the Canadian Parliament.\n\nWhen M. Cauchon entered political life, Lord Metcalfe was governor-general of Canada; our present system of responsible government was in its infancy and was not even considered as fully inaugurated. The Lafontaine-Baldwin ministry had resigned in 1843, on a most important question, and had been sustained by the Parliament; there had been a great excitement in the country, and for nine months Lord Metcalfe was unable to form a new cabinet. However, the general election of 1844 gave the governor a small majority, and enabled him to carry on the government, but the opposition party, led by Messrs. Lafontaine and Baldwin was strong, stronger than any opposition party has ever been since. M. Cauchon fought in its ranks, in Parliament and in his journal, with all the ardor of his age and the vehemence of his temper. It was during the period from 1843 to 1848 that our system of responsible government was fully established in this province.\nThe general elections of 1847 (the Parliament had been dissolved by the new governor-general, Lord Elgin) gave the reform party an overwhelming majority, and early in 1848, Messrs. Lafontaine and Baldwin were called to form a new ministry and manage the affairs of the country, which they did till 1851, when they both, from their own accord, retired into private life. M. Cauchon was a great admirer of M. Lafontaine, and cordially and vigorously supported him in the government as well as in the opposition.\n\nIn 1851, the Hon. Francis Hincks and A. N. Morin were called upon by Lord Elgin to form a new cabinet. M. Cauchon was offered the assistant-secretaryship of Lower Canada, with a seat in the house, but declined the offer, and after a correspondence with Mr. Hincks, proclaimed his want of confidence in the new ministry, especially in Mr. Malcolm Cameron and Dr. Rolph, two members of it, representing in the government the extreme or democratic party of Upper Canada, called clear grits. He, for a time, professed to be willing to submit or withdraw in case a majority of his colleagues should declare themselves against him\u2014but at the opening of the session of 1852, attempted to form a Lower Canadian conservative opposition party, of which he was the leader. In spite of all his endeavors, however, he never had many followers. Far from being discouraged at his want of success, he displayed more and more energy in his endeavors to overthrow the party then in power. The question of the North Shore Railway offered him a good opportunity of making political capital: he contended that the government were bound to give assistance for the construction of a railway line along the north shore of the St. Lawrence, the same as they had extended to the south shore Grand Trunk line; he advocated his scheme in very strong language, and created much excitement.\n\nIn 1854 he was re-elected a member for the county of Montmorency, and during the ensuing session, the Hincks-Morin administration resigned, and a coalition was formed between the Lower Canadian majority and the old conservative party of Upper Canada. This was the arrangement advocated by M. Cauchon during the two years he had been in the opposition. In January, 1855, he entered into the coalition government called the MacNab-Drummond administration, and was appointed commissioner of crown lands, an office which he held till the end of 1857, when being pressed by the old friends of the North Shore Railway, he tried to obtain from his colleagues some assistance for that line, but not being able to do so, left the ministry. Mr. Cauchon's administration of the crown lands was energetic, and marked by, among other things, the publication of a very interesting report, the most extensive published on the matters connected with that department, before or since, accompanied with a series of maps on a large scale, of the different parts of the province, which maps have proved to be of the greatest utility, and are a credit to the country.\nAfter leaving the ministry, M. Cauchon returned to the opposition. But the formation of the Brown-Dorion administration, in August, 1858, seemed to disgust him, and he from that time gradually became a supporter of the Macdonald-Cartier and Cartier-Macdonald governments. During the sessions of 1860 and 1861, he gave a frank and decided support to the Cartier-Macdonald administration; and is now commissioner of public works, and a member of it.\n\nAfter this brief sketch of M. Cauchon's career as a politician, let us say something of his qualities as a man. First, as to his merit as a public writer. M. Cauchon possesses a great power of concentration; whenever he takes up a question for discussion, all the faculties of his mind are called to his assistance. He pertinaciously studies his subject until thoroughly acquainted with all its details, and then his pen glides with decision and earnestness. His intellectual resources are most active when he is opposed and contradicted. Contradiction seems if possible to double his energy. He has, as phrenologists would speak, the bump of combativeness very largely developed. In his daily discussions with his contemporaries in the press he has made himself conspicuous, some will say for his power of argumentation, others will say for his power of abuse. He has a way of reasoning peculiar to himself. If any reproach is thrown upon him, he does not take time to answer, but at once attacks his antagonist with fury. He must always have the last word. He is always extremely bitter in attack or defence. His pen is indeed a powerful weapon. In his judgments on men or things, M. Cauchon very seldom speaks in terms of praise, on the contrary, he seems naturally inclined to depreciate rather than to admire. The defects and weak parts in others always strike him more than their good qualities and talents. Very few public men have ever found favor in his eyes. Privately however, he is charitable and generous, always ready to contribute from his own purse to the relief of distress, always most kind and hospitable.\n\nAs to Mr. Cauchon's talents and capabilities, no one will think of denying them. Besides being acknowledged as one of the most energetic Canadian writers, every one admits that, if he had chosen to practise at the bar, instead of being an editor, he would, after a few years of struggle have raised himself to the first rank in the legal profession. He would have been equally successful in the pursuit of science, if he had chosen that field of labor. The book which he published on natural philosophy, when scarce twenty years old, shew in him a serious and scientific turn of mind. His literary, historical and artistical ideas are superior to what is generally found in men given to ambitious pursuits and active political life.\n\nIn politics, Mr. Cauchon belongs to that modern school of practical politicians, who in all their acts and conduct, are aiming at\nsuccess rather than at the triumph of their personal opinions or principles; who think that circumstances alter cases. He certainly does not belong to that small but obdurate class of politicians who refuse to compromise or modify their views, when success is likely to be the result of a few concessions.\n\nFrom what has been said of Mr. Cauchon's characteristics, it may be inferred that he is not without enemies. But whatever may be said against him, a man who has worked his way through life, with so much courage amidst so many difficulties\u2014who, in spite of all sorts of animosities, caused principally by his vehement temper\u2014who in spite of all obstacles, has, with no other assistance than that of his own intelligence, energy, industry and perseverance, raised himself to one of the highest positions in the country, such an one cannot be called even by his most bitter opponent, an ordinary man.\n\nM. Cauchon is still young, not being much more than forty. With a little more indulgence for others, and less regard for his individuality, he may become exceedingly popular, now that the impetuosity of youth is being changed to the sober thought of manhood; the number of his friends is being largely increased, while that of his enemies is being in a corresponding degree diminished. Those who know him intimately speak in the highest terms of his warm heartedness. He is destined to play a very important part in the affairs of Canada.\n\n---\n\nHON. JOHN ROSS, M.L.C.,\n\nPresident of the Executive Council, &c.\n\nMr. Ross was born in the county of Antrim, Ireland, on the 10th of March, 1818, and at the tender age of three months embarked at Belfast, with his parents, for Quebec. Young Ross remained under the care of his uncle, at Brockville, until he was three years of age. His education was derived chiefly from the district school, under the superintendence of Mr. Elms, who had been an usher in the scholastic establishment of the celebrated Dr. Strachan, now Bishop of Toronto. As a juvenile, the young Ross was chiefly remarkable for the ease and expedition with which he dispatched his lessons, his hearty companionship with his schoolmates, and the stubborn pugnacity of his temper when any experiments at domineering were attempted over him. He became thus a favorite with both masters and scholars, and as \"the boy is father\nto the man,\" he shews the same instincts and the same qualities in his maturer growth. Feared, respected, and loved, he has become the favorite of all classes by the natural courtesy of his disposition, and the earnestness and sincerity with which he addresses himself to every question he is called upon to treat. But woe betide the man who seeks to trifle or equivocate with him.\n\nAt the age of sixteen, the subject of our memoir was admitted as a student-at-law, prosecuting his studies, firstly, with Mr. Buel, and afterwards with Mr. George Shorwood (the present receiver-general of the province), with whom he remained fifteen months. Upon attaining his majority, in 1839, Mr. Ross was called to the bar, and entering at once upon the business of life, soon became conspicuous as a practitioner in the courts, and an energetic supporter of the liberal school in politics. With his rapidly increasing professional occupations, his personal and political influence naturally extended throughout the county of Hastings, and as it became important to secure the constituency to the liberal side, Mr. Ross was chiefly instrumental in inducing the late Mr. Robert Baldwin to contest the county, which was then regarded as the stronghold of the Orange party. Mr. Murney was his opponent, and was backed by the whole power of the conservatives. The contest was animated and severe, terminating in the defeat of Mr. Murney by a narrow majority, and to the judgment and energy of Mr. Ross, and the weight of his personal character, was the victory chiefly due. The battle was the fight for ascendancy of the two great parties in the state. The conservatives succumbed, and have hardly ever regained their lost footing in this county.\n\nA more firm and lasting friendship between Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Ross dated from this contest and triumph, to be cemented at a later period by a matrimonial alliance between the two families.\n\nIn the interest of the political party to which he was attached, Mr. Ross established a newspaper, which soon acquired a large and influential circulation. He had gained the entire confidence of the leaders of his party, and in the autumn of 1848, when Mr. Sullivan was elevated to the bench, Mr. Ross's eminent services were deemed essential to his party, and he was summoned to the Legislative Council. He served throughout the session of 1849, in the upper chamber, gaining new laurels as one of the leaders of Parliament, but declined the acceptance of executive office, which was tendered to him, on account of his largely increased business at the bar, which he thought he could not then abandon. Not long after, he was made Queen's counsel, and in the autumn of 1851, when Mr. Hineks formed the government, he became solicitor-general. In 1852, Mr. Ross was sent to England to superintend the completion of the contracts for the construction of the Grand Trunk Railway, holding since then, the office of president of the concern. With the aid of Mr. Galt and others who were earnest in their\ndesire to promote to the utmost the interests of the country, so far as these were capable of expansion by the comparatively new science of comprehensive and rapid inter-communication, Mr. Ross took a prominent part in securing the construction of the Victoria Bridge, one of the wonders of the engineering art; and, to the honor of Canada, without a rival in the world. Returning to Canada in 1858, Mr. Ross received the appointment of attorney-general, Mr. Richards being elevated to the Common Pleas.\n\nHe continued to hold the office of attorney-general until the close of the Hincks administration, in 1854. He was then selected speaker of the Legislative Council on the formation, in September 1854, of the coalition government, headed by Sir Allan MacNab and Mr. Morin. Disappointment in some quarters found vent in speech, and it soon appeared that the new speaker was not to have an easy time of it. Where co-operation in promoting the business of the house was expected and was due, petty but vexatious obstructions were offered. This could not last long; forbearance is a very good thing, but has its limits, and those having been transcended in the case in question, the new speaker came down in his might upon the disturbers, and in one sitting convinced all cavillers that he was able to maintain the legitimate authority of his position against all comers. From this time forth opposition shunned the encounter of wit and power greater than itself, and the new speaker was allowed the full performance of his constitutional and important functions unmolested, and with the support of all parties. In April, 1856, Mr. Ross resigned his position in the coalition ministry, on the ground that the conditions of the coalition had not been carried out by Sir Allan MacNab and his followers, who, upon every test vote, went over to the opposition, thus leaving the reform section of the government supporters with their Lower Canada friends to carry the government through. On the 18th of April, 1856, Mr. Ross fully expounded his position, and explained the motives of his retirement in the public press.\n\nMr. Ross went out of the government alone, but his secession, and the published grounds upon which he had justified it, led to the retirement of Sir Allan MacNab a few days after, and Mr. Macdonald was entrusted with the formation of a new government. In the beginning of 1858, at the urgent solicitation of Mr. Macdonald, he became a member of his government, and was appointed receiver-general, in which office he continued to act until August, of that year, when he retired with his colleagues on the seat of government question. He resumed office a few days after, as president of the Executive Council, in M. Cartier's administration, an office which he still retains.\nHON. P. M. VANKOUGHNET, M.L.C., D.C.L.,\nCOMMISSIONER OF CROWN LANDS.\n\nOf the many eminent men that guard our destinies at the present day, Mr. Vankoughnet is considered by his own party and even by his bitterest political opponents, as one of the cleverest and most efficient; and as a politician, though young in that arena, as one of the very first water.\n\nHe is a German by descent, and his name is well known in the upper province as belonging to a highly respectable family. His grandfather was one of the United Empire Loyalists of 1782; his father, the Honorable P. Vankoughnet, was a member of the Assembly and of the Council of the Upper Canada Legislature for a lengthened period, although he has not taken a conspicuous part in politics since the union. The family came originally from Frankfort, and migrated to the British colonies. On the declaration of independence, they followed the fortunes of the British flag, threw up their occupations, and came over to Canada West. The subject of our notice is a member of a large family, and was born at Cornwall, C. W., on the 26th of January, 1823. He was educated under Dr. Urquhart of that town, and was originally destined for the clerical profession. Here, in Canada, the gentleman has no alternative or choice in selecting his particular vocation, it must either be the pulpit, the bar, or the counting-house, there is no other opening for him. Mr. Vankoughnet's parents ardently wished him to enter holy orders, fondly anticipating that in so doing, he would prove a shining light in the sacred calling, and raise himself to distinction. He himself, we believe, was not decidedly adverse to the choice, and perhaps, had he entered the profession, there is little doubt that with his energy and eminent abilities, he would have realized the bright anticipations of his friends. But some will think that he was not made for a divine; his nature and disposition could scarcely have brooked the silence and seclusion of the closet, or the church. He must be active, constantly working, up to his very ears in business, with plenty to do, and ready to do more. Perhaps we have not judged his character with strict accuracy, but at any rate we have come near the mark. Fate decreed that he should not be a clergyman. The able writer of the sketches in the Canadian News, speaking of this portion of his life, says that, \"It was listening to a speech from the late Mr. Justice Hageman that decided him to embrace the profession of the law.\" He entered the office of Mr. George Jarvis, of Cornwall, as a student-at-law, and afterwards removed to that of Messrs. Smith & Crooks, of Toronto, pursuing his studies diligently, and through his usual zeal and energy, his exertions\nwere crowned with success, and he passed the bar in February, 1844. A juncture at this period of the young practitioner's career, invariably arises, if he has not previously taken the questions involved fully into consideration. The question becomes, how is he to settle himself, with whom and where? Young Vankoughnot settled this very material question judiciously, and with advantage to himself. He commenced practice in the capital of Upper Canada, and after a few months, formed a coalition with two of the cleverest lawyers in Upper Canada, Mr. (now Hon.) Justice Burns, and Mr. (now Hon.) Oliver Mowat. From the first, it is said he was successful. He had previously been called to the bar, and established a good reputation for himself, and this, together with the advantageous partnership which he had formed, \"made\" him. After four years, he left the firm, and he and his younger brother, Matthew, formed one themselves. Six years after he had entered the legal arena, he was appointed Queen's counsel, and this too on his own merits and abilities, without any political or other influence, the appointment coming from a government to which he was opposed in politics. It was an honorable and spontaneous offering to the shrine of industry and genius, and says his biographer, \"reflects equal honor on him who bestowed, and on him who received the honor; proving, as it did, the impartiality of the giver and the merit of the receiver.\" At this time he stood at the head of his profession, in the upper province, and had reached the summit of fame and fortune. He had carved for himself a name and position in the legal annals of his country.\n\nBeing, in 1856, earnestly pressed by his old friend, Hon. John A. Macdonald, to join his government, he accepted office in the room of Sir Allan MacNab, who had resigned, as president of the Executive Council and minister of agriculture. He did not, however, possess a seat in either house of the legislature until the following November, when he was unanimously elected as the first member for the Legislative Council division of Rideau. In taking this step, he made a great personal pecuniary sacrifice; for he had, we believe, the largest practice in the western province, with a receipt, it is said, of at the very least three thousand five hundred pounds per annum. He had eighty briefs in his possession when he accepted office; all these he gave up for a position worth little else than the salary attached to it, of twelve hundred and fifty pounds.\n\nThe department over which he was placed, did not involve very arduous labor, or impose a severe task either on his time or patience. The bureau, before his accession to office, was not as well conducted as it might have been; this, however, was not owing to any lack of duty or unfitness for his post in the secretary, Mr. Hutton. Mr. Vankoughnot's predecessors had not taken suitable interest in the affairs of the bureau, and it was regarded as what is called a \"sinecure\" department. To remedy this, Mr. Vankoughnot did every-\nthing in his power to make the office really a department, with proper functions and duties. A thorough amelioration eventually ensued, which placed stability in the department, and tended to demonstrate the minister's fitness for his post. At the time that the weevil, hessian fly, and other insects were making such ravages, and destroying such large quantities of the crops, he promptly took action in the matter, issued an advertisement of five hundred dollars, we believe, for the best essay on the subject, so as to procure a check against their inroads. Hence came Professor Hind's admirable essay, which did good service, and gave the farmers an idea as to what they should do to prevent a recurrence of the evils that had arisen.\n\nOn the forming of the Cartier-Macdonald administration, Mr. Vankoughnet vacated the office of minister of agriculture for that of commissioner of crown lands, which he at present holds. Here a larger field was presented to his labors. This is one of the working departments of government, and as Mr. Vankoughnet is essentially one of the \"working men\" of the ministry, he was placed in it. When we mention that there are twelve different branches in it, and more than sixty clerks employed, it will afford some indication of the amount of public business that is transacted in the department. Notwithstanding the many improvements effected by M. Cauchon, the new commissioner made many changes for the better, and thoroughly improved several branches connected with his office. The system of selling townships en bloc was established by him; and also of selling lands at thirty cents per acre between the cash and credit system, whereby the opening up of some of our best colonization roads was effected. The so-called Indian department was likewise disposed of and added to the crown lands. Mr. Vankoughnet, since he entered office, has been the ministerial leader in the upper house, a post of some importance and of great hardship, since that body became an elective one. Many will coincide with us, when we say that hardly ever has a member of the government done so much work and so well, and it will add not a little to the name which Mr. Vankoughnet will carry with him whenever it pleases him to leave the government. He has lately been delegated to proceed to England, in conjunction with other official gentlemen from the lower province, to confer with the Imperial Government on the subject of the intercolonial railway.\n\nMr. Vankoughnet is a fluent and forcible speaker, and his manner of address is both pleasing and interesting. He has had many high stations offered to him; but, as we understand, would not accept them, being not yet tired of public life.\n\nHe married early in life for a man of his standing, and is the father of a young and interesting family. His wife was a daughter of Colonel Turner, of one of the regiments of the line. His sister is the accomplished musical composer who came before the public a short time ago, under the auspices of the Prince of Wales.\nHON. ALEXANDER T. GALT,\n\nMINISTER OF FINANCE.\n\nTo know something of the Gladstone or D'Israeli of Canada, the very youngest and ablest of modern finance ministers, must be an object of curiosity, not only in Canada but also in England. His scale of operations is not confined to this country, but extend to Europe, where the Canadian minister of finance has often in his capacity created great excitement, as well as considerable admiration, for his sterling business and political talents. The subject of this brief notice is a son of that celebrated author, John Galt, Esquire, whose name is connected with modern English literature as the talented writer of several well known biographies, novels, &c., which in their day created \"a sensation,\" and are still read, quoted and admired by all. He was the friend of Byron, the poet, and his historian, as he also was of many literary and artistic celebrities of his day. In this country, he is well known as the founder of the gigantic Canada Land Company; but a separate notice of this distinguished and estimable gentleman appears elsewhere in our pages.\n\nAlexander Tiloch Galt was born at Chelsea, London, on the 6th of September, 1817, and received his education in England. A late notice of him in the Illustrated London News, says, that he early evinced a taste for literature; and in his early days, when only fourteen years of age, contributed to Fraser's Magazine. But literature was not destined to be the pursuit of his after life. Circumstances drew him with his father and family to Canada, and at the early age of sixteen he entered the service of the British and American Land Company (in the Eastern Townships), as a junior clerk; and in this office he served until 1856. But he rapidly rose by his superior business talents and abilities from the station which he at first held, through successive offices, to the post of its commissioner, and subsequently resigned. There cannot be a doubt that his efforts raised the company to the high standard which it held at the time of his resignation, a statement which will be more apparent by the following passage, which we quote from the notice of his course, previously alluded to:\n\n\"During these twenty-two years, the company underwent various vicissitudes; and it was when its affairs were at the lowest ebb, that the London directors conferred upon Mr. Galt the full management of their estates in Canada. That the selection was a judicious one, is evident by the fact that between the period of his appointment in 1844, and that of his retirement, the position of\nthe company was changed from one of almost hopeless insolvency, to that of a valuable and remunerating undertaking.\"\n\nMr. Galt may justly claim a high place in our history, as having been among the first advocates for the establishment of railways. Indeed he was connected with almost the very first railway started in our vicinity, the Atlantic and St. Lawrence line. This runs from Portland to Montreal, and now forms a most important branch of the Grand Trunk, being the only route which we yet possess to gain the seaboard during the winter season. In conjunction with the Honorable John Young, the management of this line was placed in the hands of Mr. Galt, while its affairs were in a most embarrassed state, but together they overcame all obstacles, the line commenced running, and they finally effected its alliance with the Grand Trunk, since which time Mr. Galt's connection with it has ceased.\n\nHe is also entitled to praise for promoting the proposed federal union of the British North American provinces, and an intercolonial railway, two undertakings of momentous interest, not only to America and Americans generally, but also to Europe and all Europeans; a design, too, which sooner or later will be carried into effect. His exertions in these two particular cases have been something more than ordinary, and deserve the highest meed of praise from his country.\n\nOn reference to Cote's \"Political Appointments,\" we find that Mr. Galt first entered Parliament as member for the county of Sherbrooke, in April, 1849, but immediately after his election tendered his resignation. In March, 1853, on the appointment of Mr. Short to the bench, he was again elected, but this time for the town of Sherbrooke. Ever since that period, he has continued to represent this fine borough in Parliament, and has always, we believe, been unanimously returned. It was only at the last election, which took place this year, that any one could be found by the opposite party to oppose him, and then the unhappy candidate was doomed to undoubted defeat.\n\nMr. Galt's first entrance into the arena of politics was at a most critical period; at the time when the rebellion losses bill was under discussion, and when party feeling ran very high. It was, indeed, a time when the tug of war took place. Mr. Galt, although a quiet man, and of a most liberal cast, was strongly opposed to this measure, which had been got up by the ministry of the day for party purposes. He did not fail to record his strong abhorrence at this proposal to squander the people's money in paying those persons who had brought so much misery on the country. Partly from this cause, and partly from the removal of the seat of government to Upper Canada, he retired for a time from political life. However on his re-entr\u00e9e in 1853, he took an important and active part in the measures of the day, and has continued to do so ever since. He adhered to what may be termed the liberal opposition,\nuntil the general election of 1857, when he could no longer place sufficient confidence in the principles of that party, a conviction which was fully endorsed by his constituents when he presented himself for re-election.\n\nAlthough Mr. Galt's conduct in the house is extremely unassuming and mild, yet, through his high standing as a financier, and his knowledge in matters of trade and commerce, he has come to be regarded by the members of the Legislative Assembly as the highest authority upon any question connected with these subjects.\n\nWhen, in 1858, Mr. Macdonald's administration resigned office on account of the vote on the seat of government question, and Messrs. Brown and Dorion, who had been intrusted two days with the power to form, if they could, a working ministry, were compelled to resign, from the vote of want of confidence passed on them, his excellency the governor-general sent for Mr. Galt, as the only man in the house who was likely to form a government. Although he was fully capable of doing so, yet he declined the honor; and Mr. Cartier, the present premier, was called upon. On the formation of the present ministry of Messrs. Cartier and Macdonald, Mr. Galt accepted office as inspector-general, a title which was soon after changed to that of \"minister of finance.\" In this responsible and arduous office he succeeded Mr. Cayley, to whose continuance in office the whole country was opposed.\n\nThe policy of the government was greatly strengthened by the action of Mr. Galt towards the establishment of a sound and perfect system of finance, embracing the consolidation of the public debt, and the redemption of various liabilities, &c. On presenting himself to his constituents he was unanimously re-elected. In the course of his celebrated and lengthy address on that occasion, he thus honestly and candidly concludes his exposition of his future policy:\n\n\"Gentlemen,\u2014The views I now express on the subject of the policy of the present government are those you know I have always held. I have not joined the administration from personal motives, nor by a sacrifice of principle; but honestly and sincerely in the hope that my services may be of some small value to the country, in securing that which I have uniformly desired, the remedy of existing political evils; the extension of the power and influence of Canada; a sound commercial policy, both in trade and finance, with a reform of the various departments of the government, are the objects you and I alike seek, and which I know the present administration will do their utmost to secure.\"\n\nWhat followed is too well known to be repeated here. The tariff which he established was the main prop which upheld the credit of the country; and though at first bitter complaints arose from the opposition, and vituperation and obloquy were cast upon its originator, the good sense of the public overcame their previous opinions, and Mr. Galt completed his triumph as he watched the\nfavorable results of his endeavors. Mr. Galt proceeded to England to effect the consolidation of the public debt, and met with complete success. The consolidation and Canadian loan will ever remain a monument in the history of the country of his pre-eminent financial capacity. In the session of 1860, appeared his gigantic scheme for the bank of issue, which he soon after withdrew. Then came his proposal for establishing free ports at Gasp\u00e9 and Sault Ste. Marie, accounted by many one of the greatest boons, and most expedient, ever conferred on a country.\n\nDuring his short connection with the finance and customs departments, he has effected, in conjunction with its able officers, some of the greatest improvements; and has brought them to an admirable state of perfection. Indeed, a person can scarcely now recognise in those offices the system of his predecessors, so great has the change been for the better.\n\nBut to see the minister of finance to the greatest advantage, one should hear him speak; and a better opportunity cannot be presented than when he is about to unravel his annual budget. He is then in his natural element. Although a calm and steady speaker in general, yet, as he proceeds to unfold, one by one, his \"ideas\" on the standing of the country, and his \"intentions\" with reference to what he is about to do, and the policy of the government on certain points and matters, the glow of triumph which suffuses his features, and propels him rapidly along in his course, imparts such animation and fluency to his language, that it is quite a treat to hear him. Then it is when chairs are filled, galleries and seats crowded to suffocation, and the temperature of the house rises to an almost unsupportable degree. Breathless silence prevails; nothing is heard save the one voice of the \"honorable member.\" And when any one on the opposite side ventures to interpose a question of explanation, or to bring forward a notion of his own, then ensues such a castigation from the minister that the querist or opponent quivers beneath the retorts and banterings, not only of the ministerial, but of his own party. Finally, the minister having answered everybody, and satisfied all, not detracting one word from his original statement, closes his speech, and receives the \"hurrahs of the house.\"\n\nIn the late general election of 1861, he was again elected for Sherbrooke, although his opponent (Mr. Felton) had been canvassing the town and county for a length of time previous; and this reminds us of how much gratitude exists in the hearts of some people. Last year Mr. Galt was influential in getting redress done to a member of this same Mr. Felton's family; of course we all know it was just, yet, had not Mr. Galt interceeded, that justice might never have been done, and the elder Mr. Felton would probably have died in disgrace.\nHON. SIR HENRY SMITH.\n\nTo know something of the early life of the ex-speaker of the Commons of Canada\u2014of the manner in which he has fought his way onward to success and the high honors which he enjoys, and how he has brought his short official life to a successful issue, notwithstanding his late defeat\u2014must, we think, occupy a part in the minds of his fellow countrymen, and of the Canadian people in the midst of whom he lives.\n\nSir Henry Smith is a true born Englishman; and as the clever writer of the sketches of eminent Canadians in the Canadian News truly said:\n\n\"Mr. Smith has every claim to be called an Englishman; for he was born in the metropolis of the empire, on the day of England's tutelar saint, April 23, 1812. For an Englishman to have risen to the position of speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Canada is no small success, inasmuch as it indicates the possession of great individual energy. Of all the people who go to make up the mixed nationality of a province like Canada, there are none so little indebted for success to adventitious circumstances as the Englishman proper. He has none of that clannish nationality which carries the Scotchman to success, and to which the Irish, in spite of their division into Catholics and Protestants, are not a little indebted. He must stand or fall on his own merits; and if he rise at all, he must make his way against the sort of national conspiracy with which he will find himself confronted. In Upper Canada, the English population far outnumber the Scotch; but they have scarcely a tithe of the influence of that portion of the population which was born north of the Tweed. The Roman Catholic Irish band together for election purposes; the Orange Irish\u2014and the Canadians,\u2014although they cannot always be kept from dividing, constitute a formidable combination; and of the whole Scotch population, at least three-fourths will vote for a Scotchman, whatever his politics, if there be one among the candidates. The Englishman is thus an isolated being. He will not get a single vote on national considerations; and in this respect his opponents are sure to have the advantage over him. In this state of matters, the reader will easily conceive under what disadvantages Speaker Smith must have fought his way to his present position.\"\n\nSir Henry is a very young man to have risen to the position which he occupies at the present moment; he is still in the prime of manhood, and not a few of those who were accustomed to visit the House of Assembly during the Parliament, over which he had the honor\nto preside, will corroborate what we state. Every one will bear testimony to the admirable manner in which his portly form filled the chair\u2014his bearing and deportment being that of a young gentleman\u2014rather than the father of a family; though his voice, which is loud and ponderous, and in the days of yore, penetrated to the utmost recesses of the house, would evidently belie his age. One could not help recognizing in him an indescribable something that constitutes the gentleman and the possessor of influence and power. But it is not our vocation to descend to eulogium, bordering on flattery, except when the subject is absolutely deserving, and of so high and generous a nature that we can hardly find common words to express the sentiments that lie nearest our heart. From Sir Henry we have experienced the greatest kindness; wonder not then that we have devoted so much space in speaking of his many admirable qualities; yet we can assure our readers that it is not a tithe of what they really and honestly deserve.\n\nWhen he was hardly eight years of age, his family migrated to Canada; and he accompanied them. He received his education first at Montreal, in a private academy, under the superintendence of Dr. Workman, where he remained until his father and family removed to Kingston, Sir Henry's future home. Here he was placed at the royal grammar school, where he completed his studies. It was at this school where he first became acquainted with the Hon. John A. Macdonald, afterwards his colleague in office, now attorney-general, west. A friendship soon ripened between the two schoolmates, which continued unsevered ever since, until the late unfortunate difference between them on political matters. From information at hand, we learn that it was his family's intention, and his own, that he should become a Canadian merchant; but how often are our projects and plans dissolved and for our welfare! Mr. Hagerman, afterwards the celebrated judge, met with young Smith at his election contest for the county of Frontenac; the latter had taken a great interest in the cause of Mr. Hagerman, and worked hard and with his usual energy to secure his return. Mr. Hagerman was grateful, and evinced it in endeavoring to promote his interests and welfare. He advised Mr. Smith not to adopt the mercantile career, but to take to the profession of the law, and offered to take him into his office as a student, and to give him the benefit of his experience. Although young Smith and his friends had already made their determination as to what was to be his profession, yet so tempting and gratifying an offer could not be slighted. Mr. Smith accepted the proposal, and from that day his career was a settled thing. He became distinguished for his professional acquisitions; and afterwards, on the appointment of Mr. Hagerman to the bench went into the office of Mr. Fitzpatrick, and soon rose to rank and honors. In 1846 he passed the bar; in 1846, just ten years after,\nhe gained the high legal distinction of Queen's counsel. Soon after the union of the provinces, he entered Parliament for the fine county of Frontenac, he was strongly opposed in his candidacy, it is true, but proved triumphant, remaining so, until the general election contest of 1861, when he was defeated by Mr. Morton, of Kingston. At every previous election he had been returned to Parliament, sometimes with influential and wealthy opponents against him, and many times by acclamation.\n\nHis success in the house was great; it was equal to his success at the bar. The active part which he took in all debates in the former, his manner of delivery in speaking, and the influence which he wielded thereby, and by his conclusive arguments, awakened all to the conviction that his rising talents must sooner or later place him on the treasury benches, and they were not wrong. He entered the MacNab-Morin administration as solicitor-general, west, in 1854, and was doubly welcomed by the members of that ministry, for they saw in him a man of talents and of political energy, a man that could and would work, and would prove a strong supporter. And he did work hard too, as everybody is aware. He was \"a real worker and no shirker.\" Who could help being convulsed with laughter when they recollect the scenes in the house of those days\u2014he was ever ready to do battle\u2014his pointed wit and sarcasm was hurled at any one who dared to advance anything against the well being of the administration of which he was a member! To be brief, Mr. Smith continued solicitor-general, west, during successive administrations; among others that of his old schoolfellow, Mr. Macdonald, until the meeting of the new Parliament of 1858, when a speaker had to be elected, and the choice as one of the most experienced, and one of the most efficient members of the house, fell on himself. It has been frequently stated that the honors of the speakership never fell on better shoulders than on those of the honorable gentlemen of whom we are writing; and though the onerous duties appertaining to that office are very multifarious, yet Sir Henry surmounted them, and for smaller emoluments than what he received in his capacity as solicitor-general. As speaker he was appointed in 1859 to proceed to England to the court of St. James, and present the address from Parliament to the Queen, inviting her Majesty to visit Canada and inaugurate the Victoria Bridge. The successful issue of this mission has been so often referred to, and so generally and greatly appreciated, that it would be superfluous for us to refer to it again. Let it suffice to observe that Sir Henry displayed such wisdom and such judicious conduct that he won the admiration of all. He was just the man for such a post. The Queen herself, while she desired, through Sir Henry, to convey to her Canadian subjects her deep appreciation of their attachment to her person\u2014expressed\nregret that she could not leave England for such a distant part of the empire at that period\u2014Sir Henry persevered, however, until he obtained the promise of the home authorities to allow the Prince of Wales to visit Canada; hence the visit of His Royal Highness. It was thought that her Majesty would have graciously conferred upon Mr. Smith on that occasion some royal mark of her personal appreciation; but the honor was only delayed. At court Sir Henry, as our envoy, was exceedingly well received, as well as among the nobility of the United Kingdom. He travelled, on this occasion, on the continent.\n\nOn the memorable visit of the heir apparent of the British throne to Canada, Mr. Smith, on presenting the address of the Legislative Assembly, had the honor of knighthood conferred upon him by the prince, who was empowered by the Queen to do so in recognition of his services.\n\nThe officers of the House of Assembly, in grateful remembrance of the innumerable kindnesses which they had received from him during the time he had occupied the speaker's chair, immediately presented him with an address, congratulating him on the high honor which her Majesty had been pleased to confer upon him.\n\nThe Parliament having come to an end, Sir Henry is no longer speaker, nor is he indeed even a member of the house, having been defeated in the last general election. As to the political attitude which he assumed, and which led to this result, we have very little to say, except to express our deep regret at the estrangement which has taken place between two such warm, social and political friends as Mr. Macdonald and the subject of this sketch; how it came about we cannot say. That Sir Henry acted wrong we are free to admit, still every man has a perfect right to express his own opinion, and exercise his own judgment, even on a subject of life and death, how much more then on a mere political question. That he lacked tact and judgment in his course is evident, or how else would he have left the party with which he had been so long allied, with which his interests were identified, and which was still in the ascendant, to join that which is going down further and further every day, and is no longer respected, being without even Falstaff's number of men to constitute a troop or party; it was, indeed, a great mistake on his part but not without a precedent, for we witness every day, in the Imperial Parliament and other political coteries, the very same thing performed by men of long standing and high prestige; but there was no just reason why certain papers should indulge in such low, coarse and personal remarks on the gentleman in question and his family. This certainly is contemptible in the extreme, and deserves the greatest reprehension.\n\nThere is no doubt that Sir Henry Smith will again obtain a seat in Parliament, when, we hope, he will rectify this false step, and appear himself again.\nHon. Sidney Smith,\n\nPostmaster-General.\n\nThere are some persons who believe that statecraft consists of a perpetual series of deceptions\u2014that to promise, to wheedle, and befoul the supporters of a government comprises the whole art of statesmanship. To this class, Mr. Smith assuredly does not belong. In conducting the business of his department, and all public affairs confided to his care, his answers to all inquiries are yea, yea, and nay, nay. There is neither circumlocution, reticence, nor a holding out of false hopes in his replies. He has a ready habit of telling unpleasant truths, when the occasion demands it, and so far from losing by this in the estimation of his friends, it is found to be the best way of conciliating their esteem. He has preserved, and made more friends, even among those whom he has been obliged to disoblig\u00e9, by his prompt and straightforward manner of doing it, than many others who have pursued an opposite course, have made in the bestowal of favors. He has besides obtained what is even more valuable, the character of uniformly acting in an open, candid, and straightforward manner.\n\nMr. Smith, like the majority of his colleagues in the government, is a native of Canada, having first seen the light at Port Hope\u2014before the place was called by that name\u2014on the 16th of October, 1823. His grandfather, Elias Smith, was an United Empire Loyalist, who adhered to the British standard through the American revolutionary war, and afterwards emigrated to Canada. Mr. John David Smith, the father of the subject of this notice, was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada, from 1824 till 1827. Mr. James Smith, brother of Sidney Smith, twice represented Durham, and once Victoria, in the legislature of United Canada; and another, Mr. J. Shuter Smith, contested the east riding of Durham, at the last general election, and succeeded in obtaining his election, while the postmaster-general was defeated, for the adjoining constituency, by a narrow majority.\n\nThe education of the subject of this notice, commenced under Archdeacon Bethune, of Cobourg, was continued at the Home district grammar school, and ended under the care of the Rev. Dr. Jonathan Short, of Port Hope. Studying law in the office of Smith (his brother John Shuter) and Crooks, he was admitted to the bar in 1844. The same year he commenced practice in Cobourg, where he soon became solicitor to the Commercial Bank, and succeeded in establishing a lucrative business. His first law partner was his brother, J. Shuter Smith, the partnership continu-\ning until the latter was appointed master of the Court of Chancery, in 1850. Three years after, he took in as a new law partner Mr. John D. Armour. In 1853, Mr. Smith was elected municipal councillor for two places, the town of Cobourg and the township of Hamilton, in which the town is situated. The election of warden, or presiding officer of the county councils, sometimes takes shape of a political contest. Such was the case in 1853, when Mr. Smith was elected warden of the united counties of Northumberland and Durham, being reeve of the township of Hamilton. Before that period no reformer had ever been elected warden for these united counties. In 1854, Mr. Smith contested the west riding of Northumberland against D'Arcy E. Boulton, Esq., and was then first elected a member of the Legislative Assembly. This election was the first that occurred after Mr. Hincks's bill, reforming the representation in Parliament, came into effect. Mr. Smith was twice re-elected for this constituency. In these two latter elections he was opposed in the first by Mr. Asa A. Burnham, and in the second by a Mr. Grimshaw, and although the most strenuous efforts were made by the opposition, and the thunders of their press exerted against him to a greater extent than on any previous occasion, to cause his defeat, yet he was triumphantly returned, his opponent only polling a small number of votes.\n\nOn his first entry into Parliament, in 1854, Mr. Smith moved the address, in answer to the speech from the throne. He has supported all the liberal measures, such as the secularization of the clergy reserves, since he went into Parliament. In 1854, he was chairman of the so called corruption committee. Till 1856, he supported the coalition, of which Sir Allan MacNab was at the head; and then he went into opposition, being dissatisfied with the course pursued by Sir Allan in the leadership of the government, and when the latter had ceased to be able to discharge his duties on account of ill health. At the close of this session, Mr. Smith went to Germany for his health, and returned much improved. On the second of February, 1858, Mr. Smith was appointed postmaster-general, with a seat in the cabinet; which office he has held ever since, with the exception of a few days during the ministerial crisis, in the summer of 1858, when he was president of the council and minister of agriculture. In the session of 1859, he moved and carried an address to the Queen, praying her Majesty to recommend the Imperial Parliament to grant a subsidy to the Canadian line of the ocean steamers. To this address no favorable response has yet been given. In connexion with Atlantic mail arrangements, Mr. Smith has covered himself with laurels. He recently succeeded in forming arrangements with the United States, France, Prussia, and Belgium, for the conveyance of mail matters across the Atlantic in the Canadian steam vessels, and through Canada on the Grand Trunk Railway. In this he has done more for the\nbenefit of Canada than any of his predecessors in office. He has shewn himself the best postmaster-general we ever possessed, and that he has the proper administrative ability, and is one of the very best and most efficient members of the government. This is no fiction; every one in Canada can bear testimony to the truth of what we assert; the duty Mr. Smith undertook, in proceeding to Europe, was not as an interested party in the Canadian steamers, but as a responsible minister, determined, as far as possible, to make his own department self-sustaining. Succeeding to his present position with a heavy balance against him in the annual accounts with little prospect of improving receipts in the inland revenue, the postmaster-general determined to make the best of what appeared, in a measure, a hopeless task. By curtailing the cost of home contracts, a considerable saving was effected. But the crowning act of Mr. Smith's administration was the ocean postal service. To show what he had to contend against in his two separate missions to Europe, it is only necessary to allude, first, to the freezing sort of sympathy he received from Lord Elgin, as English postmaster-general. The second and most painful discouragement which Mr. Smith met was in the loss of two of the best of our steamers within a few months of each other; still our Canadian delegate was not to be daunted; he knew that Lord Elgin was not altogether omnipotent, and was far from being so considered in England. The mission was prosecuted with zeal and with determination such as we may safely say has no parallel. The details of his scheme of ocean service, Mr. Smith was enabled to present to Prussia, the Netherlands, and France, in a light which at once commanded approval. The revenue from the first Canadian ocean mail was fourteen shillings. After Mr. Smith's arrangement in 1859, the mail freight included some forty bags, and by the later arrangements upwards of one hundred bags was carried by a single steamer.\n\nThe practical result of this is, that while the ocean mail subsidy, in 1850, was nominally increased from \u00a350,000 a year to \u00a3104,000 there was no actual increase of expenditure involved. Mr. Smith's arrangements, in other words, brought for the first year of their operation upwards of $200,000 into the exchequer.\n\nIf to this we add, that the annual balance of \u00a340,000 which appeared against the post office department when Mr. Smith assumed the reins has disappeared, we have said enough, we trust, to show that there is fair room for congratulation in possessing such an able minister.\n\nThe postmaster-general of the United States in his last annual report, thus speaks of the last part of the arrangements thus effected by Mr. Smith:\n\n\"Additional articles to the United States and French postal convention of the 2nd of March, 1857, have been mutually agreed upon, establishing new exchanging offices, on the side of the United\nStates, at Portland, Detroit and Chicago respectively, and on the side of France, at Paris, and providing for an exchange of mails by the Canadian packets plying between Liverpool and Portland, or between Liverpool and Rivi\u00e8re du Loup; a copy of these articles accompanies this report. Additional articles to the postal convention with Prussia, of the same character, have also been agreed upon with the general post office at Berlin, establishing, on the part of the United States, new offices of exchange at Portland, Detroit and Chicago respectively, to exchange closed mails with Aachen (Aix-la-Chapelle), through England, by means of the Canadian line of mail packets, a copy of which is annexed to this report. These arrangements have greatly expedited the transmission of European correspondence to and from the western states, and give entire satisfaction to that portion of the country.\"\n\nIn the session for 1860, Mr. Smith brought forward a measure for increasing the subsidy to the Canadian line of steamers to \u00a3104,000, about double the previous amount\u2014the contract to run till 1867. The additional postage earned by the arrangements he had recently made, enabled him to do this without imposing any considerable burden upon the Canadian revenue; indeed, he had placed the department under his control in a self-sustaining position\u2014an assertion hardly to be credited, when we consider the extent of the country and the enormous debt we had been paying Great Britain for our ocean postal accommodation, and what benefits the country enjoys: not a village or country hamlet, on the steamboat routes and railway lines, but receives its daily mail; while others, more remote\u2014perhaps buried in the wilderness\u2014receive them once, twice, or three times a week. What a change in a few years.\n\nIn 1860, Mr. Smith settled that much-vexed question: the abolition of sabbath labor in the post offices in Upper Canada. His settlement of it has been received, both in Upper and Lower Canada, with satisfaction, which is the more surprising, when it is remembered that for nearly ten years previously every effort by Parliament to legislate upon the question proved abortive.\n\nThe Honorable Edmund Murney, member of the upper house, died a short time after the postmaster-general's defeat in Northumberland, which occasioned a vacancy for the large division of Trent. Mr. Smith, although comparatively a stranger in the division, immediately commenced his canvass through the counties of Peterborough, North Hastings and Lennox, composing the division, and after a severe struggle, in which he had arrayed against him, all the leading stars of the opposition, succeeded in defeating, by a large majority, Mr. Billa Flint, one of the most wealthy and influential men in the province. His election was deemed a great triumph by his party, and was hailed with delight; public dinners were given him, both at Peterborough and Napanee,\nthe former attended by the largest number of persons that ever met at a social gathering in the province, in a building erected specially for the occasion.\n\nWe have in another portion of this notice spoken of Mr. Smith's qualities as a public man. In private life, he is not much changed; freed from the official dignity of his profession (although always courteous and generous in that), he is the affable and accomplished Canadian gentleman, one whom we can call our own both in principle and practice, with an open and generous nature worthy of the warm-hearted people from whom he is descended; to him, one man stands in the same light as another, no matter what his coat, creed or party be. He is ardent in his attachments, and would support his party to the last, although this may be disavowed by some, on account of the course he took in leaving the reform ranks for the coalition; yet, he has given a satisfactory explanation of that, and, no one will dispute, a correct one, and has since proven what we assert. His model is his leader, whom he justly considers one of the greatest men the country has ever possessed; and in taking Mr. J. A. Macdonald as his model, we are sure no man can ever do wrong. Yet Mr. Smith does not remain in the government for his support, but rather for his great abilities and talents as a minister; and this was exemplified lately on his defeat, when dozens were running after the office but could not obtain it, for neither the government nor the country could afford to lose the services of one who has given such unquestionable evidence of administrative capacity.\n\nMr. Smith married a Miss Bennet, in 1854, and is the father of several children.\n\n---\n\nHON. MALCOLM CAMERON, M.L.C.\n\nThe biography of this gentleman would fill an interesting volume. The history of his career is one of the most remarkable, and we exceedingly regret that we are unable to devote more space to the record, but such as we are enabled to present from the materials at our disposal will, we believe, repay the perusal. He is the son of the late Mr. Angus Cameron, hospital sergeant of a Canadian regiment, a person so valuable in his position, that he never could get promoted, while many inferior men in the same regiment, at the commencement of the war of 1812, obtained commissions. Malcolm Cameron was born on the 25th of April, 1808, and on the\ndisbandment of his father's regiment, in 1816, went with his parents into the settlement at Perth, in the Ottawa district, where they for some time kept a house of entertainment; and so amiable and kind were the old couple, that they endeared themselves to all in the place, and are remembered with kindness by the old settlers to this day. At this place Malcolm remained until he was twelve years of age, when he went on to a farm and kept the ferry at the Mississippi river, ten miles back of the settlement, and there the future minister in 1820-1, became acquainted with several emigrants from Scotland, some of the old radicals of 1819, an entirely new class of minds from the gay, reckless soldiers, with whom he had hitherto been associated. What with talking and reading among these he, in a short time imbibed their extreme ideas and notions; and consequently, at an early period, he received the name of \"radical,\" which he has ever since consistently maintained.\n\nOn his father's death, in 1822, he was offered a situation in a store at Laprarie, whither he went in 1823; but he did not remain long. His master was cruel, harsh and tyrannizing; and, as the young radical would not stand abuse, or be domineered over, he on the 9th March, 1824, left his employment, and walked nine miles (having both his checks frozen on the way); and hired himself to Martins, in the Hay-market, Montreal, as a stable boy, so to honestly earn sufficient money to pay his stage fare to Upper Canada. His mother had removed into town, and there kept a boarding house. Young Malcolm went to the district school that winter, and studied assiduously, in order to become useful, and to make something of himself; and in the spring, had the satisfaction of receiving employment as a clerk in the brewery and distillery of the Honorable A. Graham, as the result of said learning. And here it is right we should remark that, although his parents had kept a tavern and sold liquor in great quantities, neither of them could be accused of being themselves drinkers, and so with Malcolm. His mother had always cautioned and guarded him against intoxicating drink, and ever zealously prevented him from obtaining any within her jurisdiction; and her success may be estimated, when we see in him at the present day one of the most fearless and stanch supporters and champions of the temperance cause. Hence, although employed in a place where he was subjected to every temptation that can be set before a mortal, he remained firm, and passed through the ordeal with safety, remaining in his employment four years, during which period he devoted much time to reading and studying. Almost the first money which he earned he sent to England, to purchase Hume, Smollet, and Doyd. He perused nearly every novel and romance in the place; and attributes to them any refinement in his character that he may possess. In 1828, he went into partnership with his brother-in-law, a connection, which from some difference that arose, did not last long. He went to Scotland,\nwhen in business (1833), purchased largely, and married his cousin, a Miss McGregor, of Glasgow. Three years after he was returned to Parliament for his native county, Lanark, in opposition to Sir F. B. Head's government; and took an active part in the affairs of this time, conducing as much as possible to the union of the provinces in 1840. He supported Lord Sydenham, and was a great favorite of that able nobleman. He was offered the office of inspector-general by him, but declined, and first came into office under Sir Charles Bagot as inspector of the revenue, and in that capacity effected much improvement in the custom houses of the day. Since then he has been commissioner of public works, minister of agriculture, president of the Executive Council, and postmaster-general. He has been twenty-six years in Parliament, having been elected ten times for different counties, Lanark, Kent, Lambton, and Huron. Nor was he ever defeated but once. In 1860, he was elected a member of the Legislative Council.* He is now fifty-three years of age, and is as active and energetic as ever. His services in the cause of temperance can hardly ever be sufficiently appreciated.\n\nG. W. WICKSTEED, Esq., Q.C.\n\nThis gentleman was born in England, and after a classical education partly at the the public schools of his native country, came to Canada in 1821, upon the invitation of his uncle, the late Mr. Justice Fletcher. He subsequently studied law, and was admitted to the bar of Lower Canada. In 1828, he became assistant law-clerk to the Legislative Assembly, an office he held until the suspension of the constitution, when he was appointed to a similar office in the Special Council. In 1841, at the beginning of the first session after the union, he was appointed, on motion of that venerable patriot, the late Honorable John Neilson, law clerk of the Legislative Assembly of united Canada, which highly responsible and important office he has held to the present day. In 1842, in conjunction with the Honorable Hugues Heney and Alexander Buchanan, Esquire, Q.C., he was appointed a commissioner for revising the statutes of Lower Canada up to the time of the union. Mr. Heney having died, the work was completed by himself and Mr. Buchanan; and the public statute law then in force, which had been scattered over a great number of volumes, from the time\n\n*Cote's \"Political Appointments.\"\nof the conquest up to 1841, was ascertained and collected into one moderate sized octavo volume, a work of great labor, responsibility and usefulness. No one has ever found fault with the manner in which the work was performed. In 1853, Mr. Wicksteed, in consideration of previous public services rendered in his official capacity, and more especially in relation to the then recent settlement of the questions arising out of the abolition of the feudal tenure in Lower Canada, was appointed by Lord Elgin to be a Queen's counsel. In 1856, he was named one of the commissioners for revising and consolidating the statutes of Lower Canada, and of those common to the whole province of Canada, a work which has now been completed and published. The joint commissioners having made a preliminary report and draft, the final printing and editing of the work was performed by the late Sir James Macaulay and Mr. Wicksteed, under the direction of the Governor-in-Council. This work has now been for a considerable time in the hands of the public, and has been found to be eminently useful, superseding as it does, in conjunction with the Upper Canada volume, for all practical purposes, all the previous statute law of the province. Mr. Wicksteed has virtually now hold the same office in the parliaments of Lower Canada and Canada for thirty-three years, and during that time, we believe all the acts have been revised and superintended by him, in passing through the Legislative Assembly; and a very large number of those of a general character, have been originally prepared by him. There is but one opinion of his fitness for, and of the ability and fidelity with which he has discharged his office; for the due performance of which it is unnecessary to say, that, apart from knowledge of the law as it exists, a familiar acquaintance with the principles of legislation and government, and a very considerable share of inventive power, general information, command of accurate language, and good scholarship, are indispensable.\n\n---\n\nHon. CHARLES ALLEYN,\n\nPROVINCIAL SECRETARY.\n\nThe subject of this notice, whose career in Canada has certainly been very successful, is the son of Commander Alleyn, R.N., a notice of whom appears in this work. He is the lineal representative of the celebrated Edward Alleyn, who, in his day, was considered the greatest actor on the London boards, and became the\nfounder of \"Dulwich college,\" or rather, as he himself called it, \"the College of God's Gift,\" in Surry. Edward Alleyn was himself the first master of it; he died in 1626, and was buried in the chapel of the college. He was one of the most celebrated characters of the day. The family of Alleyn can trace its lineal descent back through nearly three hundred years.\n\nCharles, the eldest son, the subject of this brief notice, was born at Myrus Wood, in the county of Cork, Ireland, in September, 1817. He pursued his studies at Fermoy school, founded by the late Dr. Hincks, father of Honorable Francis Hincks, the present successful colonial governor, and also at Clongowes college, in the county of Kildare, where he was generally successful, and was considered in some respects very clever.\n\nIn 1834, in conjunction with his family, he emigrated to Canada and settled at Quebec, which has ever since been their headquarters. He studied law under some of the most eminent of the legal profession in the lower province. In 1840 he was called to the bar, and practiced at it until his accession to the cabinet. He mingled in municipal politics to a considerable extent, and was elected, in 1854, to the mayoralty of Quebec, which might almost be considered as his native city, seeing that he has resided there from boyhood. In the same year he was returned to Parliament, in conjunction with the late Honorable Mr. Justice Chabot, the commissioner of public works, and the celebrated Dr. Blanchet, for the same ancient and time-honored city; and he has continued to be one of its representatives ever since.\n\nIn 1857, Mr. Alleyn was appointed Queen's counsel, and was called to the Executive Council as commissioner of public works, in the government of the Honorable John A. Macdonald. He was appointed to this office in preference to many aspirants, and without advantages which others possess to elevate themselves. Mr. Alleyn entered the government not merely for the purpose of \"filling a place,\" or as a political acquisition, (though he is so in one sense of the word) for he brought nothing with him but his own talents and abilities; and he will take nothing out whenever it pleases him to leave, save the reputation of being an honest, upright, hard working member of the government, who does not shrink from doing his duty both to the government, his constituents and himself.\n\nWhen M. Cartier formed his administration in the latter portion of the year 1858, Mr. Alleyn was transferred from the board of works to the provincial secretary's department, where he still remains.\n\nMr. Alleyn is a fair speaker, possessing the richness as well as the perspicuity and clearness of his countrymen, Sheridan, Burke, or Grattan; or, in our own land, of an Aylwin. He is, however, less forward in addressing the house than those profound orators,\nwho were wont to move the thunders of Parliament by the power of their eloquence and elocution.\n\nMr. Alleyn is a man of the strictest honor, and would not stoop to do a degrading act, as was nobly evinced on a late occasion. When the Quebec election committee declared against him, he immediately sent in his resignation to the governor-general (happily not accepted), preferring to go back to humble citizenship rather than remain a member of a government when he entertained doubts whether he had proper claims to be such.\n\nHe married, in 1849, Miss Aubert De Gaspe, daughter of P. Aubert De Gaspe, Esquire, surgeon of St. John Port Joli, C. E., by whom he has issue several children.\n\nLIEUT.-GENERAL SIR WM. EYRE, K.C.B.\n\nThis gallant soldier well known to most of our Canadian readers from his brief connection with this country from 1856 to 1858; firstly, as commander-in-chief of the forces; and secondly as administrator of the government in 1857, was the second son of the late Vice-Admiral Sir George Eyre, K.C.B., by the third daughter of Sir George Cooke, Baronet, of Wheatley, and was born at Hatfield, in the year 1805. He entered the army in 1823, and after serving in the 73rd Regiment in this province (during which time we believe he was an aide-de-camp to one of the lieutenant-governors of Upper Canada) he proceeded with that gallant corps to the Cape of Good Hope, and while there greatly distinguished himself in both the Caffre wars as lieutenant-colonel. In acknowledgment of his eminent services in the last and previous war, he was made a companion of the order of the Bath, promoted to the rank of colonel, and appointed an aide-de-camp to the Queen. On the military force being sent out to the east in the Crimean war, he was appointed to a brigade of the third division of the army, which he ultimately commanded, with the local and temporary rank of lieutenant-general. He was present at the battles of the Alma, and Inkerman, commanded the troops in the trenches during the latter battle, and remained in the Crimea until after the fall of Sebastopol, for which he received a medal and clasps. For these services he was in 1855, created a knight commander of the order of the Bath, was made a commander of the Legion of Honor, a knight of the imperial order of the Medjidie of the second class, and was\namong the general officers of the army who received the Sardinian war medal. After his return home in June, 1856, he was selected by the commander-in-chief to command the troops in Canada, and whilst here, on Sir Edmund W. Head obtaining leave of absence to proceed to Europe, administered our government. All will readily testify to the great abilities which he displayed in these capacities, and to his general gentlemanlike conduct, affability and courteousness of manners to all who had the pleasure of coming in contact with him during his short connection with Canada. Ill health, which shewed its symptoms in a most alarming character, compelled him to resign his command, and to relinquish a post, the duties of which gave him so much pleasure to fulfil. He returned to England, but change of climate was of no avail, his disease rapidly gained upon him, and his death took place during the year 1859, causing a deep and general regret. He was one of the field officers in the receipt of rewards for distinguished and meritorious services. He married, in 1841, Miss Bridgeman Simpson, third daughter of the late Honorable John Bridgeman Simpson, by whom we believe he left no issue.\n\n---\n\nRIGHT REV. FRANCIS FULFORD, D.D.,\n\nMETROPOLITAN BISHOP OF CANADA.\n\nThis distinguished and learned prelate, so justly celebrated for his goodness and piety of heart, holds the high position of head of the Anglican Church in Canada. Dr. Fulford is the second son of the late Baldwin Fulford, Esquire, of Great Fulford, Devon, by the eldest daughter of the late William Adams, Esq., M.P., of Bowden, near Totness. The family is descended from William de Fulford, who held Fulford, temp., Richard I. The right reverend prelate was born at Sidmouth, 1803, and married in 1830, the eldest daughter of Andrew Berkeley Drummond, Esquire, of Cadlands, Hants, grand-daughter of the second Earl of Egmont. He was educated at Tiverton grammar school, and subsequently entered Exeter college, Oxford, where he graduated B.A. in 1824, and was elected a fellow, in June, 1825; he received the degree of D.D. in 1850; was rector of Trowbridge, Wilts, from 1832 to 1842; rector of Croydon, Cambridgeshire, from 1842 to 1845; was minister of Curzon chapel, in the parish of St. George's, Hanover\nsquare, London, from 1845 till his consecration in 1850; he was also chaplain to the Duchess of Gloucester; and has published sermons, and a work on \"The Progress of the Reformation.\"\n\nIn 1859 he was appointed by royal letters patent \"metropolitan bishop of this province,\" and as such, is at the head of the church in Canada. His lordship is regarded as a bright ornament of the church, and an eloquent preacher. His language is elegant and his reasoning logical, without any affectation or pedantry. Since he has been connected with this country, he has done much to promote the advancement and peace of the church, is popular with all denominations, and has endeared himself to all with whom he has come in contact. His services towards science and art have been extremely valuable, and are held in high estimation; so much so indeed that he has been elected on several occasions to high offices in some of our best institutions.\n\nHON. JOHN ROSE, M.P.P.\n\nThis gentleman is a Scotchman by birth, having been born in Aberdeenshire, in the year 1820, and consequently is now in his forty-first year, a comparatively early age for a man to attain the high political standing which he enjoys. He completed his studies at King's college, Aberdeen; and, at an early age, in conjunction with his father and family, emigrated to Canada; but wealth and distinction are not attained in Canada without industry and assiduity, and young Rose was not an exception to this rule; he labored manfully in those days, and being possessed of great energy he surmounted the obstacles which impeded his path in a new country. It is said that in his younger days he performed the useful duties of a tutor, and we know that he was lately commissioner of public works; a circumstance sufficient to demonstrate his energy, and abilities. He resided for a short time in the Eastern Townships, and then went to Montreal to study law; he was called to the bar of Lower Canada (Montreal district) in 1842, and possessing as he does, excellent natural abilities, and being a good speaker and debater, with a good delivery and a tall commanding figure, he impresses upon his hearers the full importance of the subject which he discusses; that he soon succeeded in his profession and eventually acquired the largest practice at the bar in the mercantile capital of Canada is an admitted fact. He became\nsolicitor for the Hudson's Bay Company and several other companies and institutions; he was made a Queen's counsel in 1847, and did a good deal of the government work in the courts. Always taking a part on the loyal side in public affairs, Mr. Rose soon became a politician, and was often desired to enter Parliament, but to such alluring offers he long continued to turn a deaf ear, though assured of office in some of the governments of the day; but it was not till the general election of 1857 that he could be induced to run for any constituency; this was on his appointment to the solicitor-generalship in the Macdonald-Cartier administration. In conjunction with Messrs. Cartier, (the leader of the Lower Canada section of the government,) and Starnes, a wealthy and influential citizen of Montreal, he contested the honor of representing that city against Messrs. Dorion, Holton and McGee, who ran on the opposition ticket. Of the ministerialists, Mr. Rose was the only successful candidate, the others were elected for other constituencies. Mr. Rose continued as solicitor-general, east, passing through the nominal appointment of receiver-general on 6th August, until December, 1858, when, on the resignation of M. Sicotte, he accepted the more responsible office of commissioner of public works; this position he held until the general election of 1861, when, \"for certain private reasons,\" he tendered his resignation to the administration, and after being again returned for Montreal, left for a tour in Europe. During the time he held the commissionership of public works he effected many improvements in that department; and it was very truly said that no one had ever performed the work of that arduous department with greater satisfaction, notwithstanding that more was done for Montreal and that vicinity than for any other place; nor did any chief commissioner ever act with more integrity and honor than he. The value of his services and the superiority of his character were more especially evident during the visit of H. R. H. the Prince of Wales. He took upon himself the main arrangements of the tour, and elicited the grateful commendations of the royal party, and the united praises of the British, American and Canadian press.\n\nMr. Woods, the Times special correspondent, speaks of him in the following terms, which we think but right to reproduce:\u2014\n\n\"To the Honorable John Rose, the chief commissioner of public works in Canada, was intrusted the task of organizing, arranging and perfecting every single detail connected with the progress. This scarcely sounds very much, but when the reader recollects that the royal party, with their suite and attendants, with guards of honor, police and couriers, averaged from 250 to 300 persons, that either by rail, by horses, steamers, carriages or canoes, they travelled on the average more than 100 miles a day through a new and often a wild country; that every single stage was kept to the very hour, and that even the most trifling contre-temps did not occur\non the whole route; this result, considering that all the mat\u00e9riel for the royal guest and household, such as plate, linen and glass, had to be forwarded always in advance from day to day that it was always ready, even at the most remote points, and that throughout not one single article was lost or mislaid\u2014speaks well for Mr. Rose's arrangements.\n\n\"With the untiring exertions of his staff, every member of which Mr. Rose superintended and looked after himself each morning and each night, and aided by the kindness and ready help of General Bruce, the whole tour through Canada had been made. Where has there ever been one more enthusiastic, even more triumphant, or better organized in all its branches from stationing carriages in back woods to relays of canoes up rapids, from relays of horses to the banks of lakes, and from the banks of lakes to railways, and so on to towns? At every single town, village or shanty-station, His Royal Highness had been enabled to arrive with as much punctuality as if he had not travelled some 5000 miles to keep his appointment, and with as little apparent hurry and confusion as if he had only one such appointment and not twenty to keep each day. The more one saw of the country and of the difficulties of travelling through it by the late royal route, the more astonishing did it appear that Mr. Rose, even with all his able staff, should have managed so well, and been able to keep the royal word as strictly with little wayside villages as with the largest cities which gave his Royal Highness so grand and so hearty a reception; even the obstinate inhospitality of the Kingston men made no alteration, and the royal programme through Upper and Lower Canada was kept almost to the very minute.\"\n\n\"There was great shaking of hands as his Royal Highness, the Duke of Newcastle, and all the suite took a kindly leave of Mr. Rose, whose arduous labors terminated with the last state visit to the last Canadian city. It was with a feeling of deep regret that the royal party bade adieu to one who had so ably and so successfully ministered to the comfort of their tour throughout.\"\n\n---\n\nHON. J. PATTON, LL.D., M.L.C.\n\nHonorable James Patton is a Canadian by birth, and was born at Prescott, C. W., on the 10th June, 1824. He is the fourth and youngest son of the late Andrew Patton, Esq., major H. M. 45th Regiment, and formerly of St. Andrew's, Fifeshire.\nMajor Patton served under the Duke of Wellington throughout the greater part of the Peninsular war. The eldest son is the Reverend Dr. Patton, rector of Cornwall, C. W., and rural dean. At an early age he attended Upper Canada college, and passed through the prescribed courses in that institution. In 1840 he entered upon the study of the law, under the Honorable J. Hillyard Cameron, Q.C. In 1843, at the opening of King's college, (now the university of Toronto), Mr. Patton was enrolled as a matriculant, and pursued his university studies, at the same time discharging the arduous duties of a senior clerk in an office which ranked among the first in the province. In June, 1845, he was admitted an attorney, and in Michaelmas term, of the same year, he was called to the bar. In 1847, he took the degree of LL.B. On being admitted an attorney, Mr. Patton commenced the practice of his profession in Barrie, the county town of Simcoe.\n\nThe passage of the rebellion losses bill, in 1849, first drew Mr. Patton into public life, and from that period he has taken a prominent part in the political contests in Simcoe. In 1852, there being no conservative journal in the county, Mr. Patton started the Barrie Herald, and for more than two years held the editorial reins. In 1852, he published the Canadian Constables Assistant, a useful pamphlet, founded upon a very able charge by Judge Gowan to the grand jury of Simcoe. In 1855, in connection with other legal gentlemen, among whom was Mr. Hewitt Bernard, now chief clerk of the crown law department, he commenced the publication of the Upper Canada Law Journal, a work highly prized by the profession, and which is now ably edited by Messrs. W. D. Ardagh, R. A. Harrison, and others.\n\nMr. Patton, though repeatedly urged to become a candidate for parliamentary honors in Simcoe and Grey, invariably declined, but in 1856, when the Legislative Council became an elective body, he was brought forward for the Saugeen division, (counties of Bruce, Grey, and North Simcoe), and after a severe contest with Messrs. Beatty and McMurrich, was elected. His success was the more marked from the fact that he was barely over the required age, (thirty,) and from having had arrayed against him the powerful influence of the Leader and Globe newspapers.\n\nIn 1856, on the formation of the Toronto University Association, he was elected president, and the following year he was appointed a member of the senate. He has always evinced a warm interest in university and educational matters, and in Parliament he has introduced several measures for the improvement of the law and for elevating the status of the legal profession. In 1858, he was the mover of the resolution, which was seconded by Sir E. P. Tach\u00e9, and carried in the Council, by sixteen to eight, condemning the Brown-Dorion administration. Though a conservative, throughout his parliamentary career he has pursued an independent course.\nIn 1858, Mr. Patton took the degree of LL.D. in the university of Toronto, and in the same year was elected a bencher of the Law Society. In 1860, he was chosen by the senate to fill the important office of vice-chancellor. In 1861, he was named chairman of the commission to enquire into the expenditure and financial affairs of University college and Toronto university, John Paton, Esquire, of Kingston, and Dr. Beatty, of Cobourg, respectively representing the universities of Queen's college and Victoria college, being the associate commissioners.\n\nREV. J. McCaul, D.D.\n\nPRESIDENT OF UNIVERSITY COLLEGE, TORONTO.\n\nForemost amongst the learned and distinguished professors who adorn our Canadian colleges stands Dr. McCaul, a profound scholar, orator and wit, urbane and kind as he is learned.\n\nDr. McCaul was born in the capital of Ireland, and is still, we believe, under fifty years of age. His career has been remarkably brilliant as a scholar. He early entered Trinity college, in his native city, and speedily obtained the highest honors that could be conferred upon him\u2014prizes, scholarships, gold medals and degrees; he served for a length of time as classical tutor and examiner, and his pupils invariably were successful in obtaining the honors to which they aspired. In November, 1838, he was appointed by the late archbishop of Canterbury, principal of the Upper Canada college, and entered upon the duties of the office in January, 1839. In 1842, he became vice-president of King's college, and professor of classics, logic, rhetoric and belles-lettres. In 1849, he was appointed president of the university of Toronto, under the new statute, altering the constitution of King's college, and in 1853 he was elected president of University college, Toronto, and was appointed vice-chancellor of the university of Toronto; offices which he still continues to hold and in which he is exceedingly popular, not only with the senate and students, but with all who have ever had the pleasure of coming in contact with him, or of hearing him in his annual lectures at the literary institutions, or when he speaks on public occasions in the capital of the western province.\n\nDr. McCaul is also a literary celebrity, having at different times contributed valuable matters to the literature of both continents.\nAmong other treatises he is author of disquisitions on the Greek tragic metres, the Horatian metres; Scansion of the Hecuba and Medea of Euripides, lectures on Homer and Virgil, editor of the satires and epistles of Horace, of Longinus, and of selections from Lucian, and the first book of Thucydides; he was editor of a Canadian monthly, the Maple Leaf, and the writer of a very clever article in the Canadian Journal, on Latin inscriptions, which excited considerable interest in Europe; he is also composer of some anthems and other pieces of vocal music. He married in 1838, Emily, second daughter of the late Honorable Mr. Justice Jones.\n\nDANIEL WILSON, LL.D.,\n\nPROFESSOR OF HISTORY AND ENGLISH LITERATURE IN THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO.\n\nProfessor Wilson was born in the capital of North Britain, we believe, about the year 1816, being the second son of Archibald Wilson, Esquire, of that city, and brother to the celebrated Professor Wilson, well-known in the annals of literature as \"Christopher North.\" The subject of this notice was, therefore, a member of that interesting family so graphically described by his sister in the memoir of her elder brother, published in the course of last year.\n\nProfessor Daniel Wilson pursued his studies in Edinburgh, along with his brother, and distinguished himself as a zealous and industrious student; indeed the respectable position and honor to which he obtained could only have been the result of much personal exertion and eminent talents. These, combined with the characteristic energy of his family, Dr. Wilson has displayed on several occasions since his connection with the university of Toronto; and we are assured by some of his townsmen, that he possessed all such qualities in an eminent degree in his younger days, and was regarded as a scholar, who would one day occupy a high position in the literary and scientific world. This anticipation he has fully realized. He has added much to the literature of his country; and his gifted and impressive mind has accomplished much in science and the arts. Dr. Wilson's first work appeared in 1847; it was the celebrated \"Memorials of Edinburgh in the Olden Time,\" illustrated from his own drawings. This was very favorably received; and the reviews of it, in some\nof the highest authorities of the press, were written in the highest terms of praise. His next publication was \"Oliver Cromwell and the Protectorate,\" equally commendable and equally well received. In 1851, appeared the best work which he has written, and which will remain a monument of his genius as well as his impartiality as a writer, his diligence and industry as a historian and antiquarian, and is destined to keep his name before the world long after he has passed away, and might otherwise have been forgotten; we allude to \"The Archaeology and Prehistoric Annals of Scotland,\" illustrated with two hundred engravings by the author. This work exhibits great knowledge of the subject, which could only have been gained by long and patient investigation; and it is written \"in an enlarged and liberal spirit.\" It will continue to be consulted in future ages.\n\nThe professor had been for some years previous to the publication of the last work, secretary to the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, of which he was also a fellow; when in 1853, he received his present appointment to the chair of history and English literature in the university of Toronto. This position he is undoubtedly pre-eminently fitted for, and fills it with much advantage to the leading educational institution in the province. He had not been a year in occupation of this professorship, when he was offered the principalship of McGill college, Montreal; but, although the salary was larger, he declined the honor, in his zeal to remain and promote the interests of the Toronto university, the present high status of which is owing, in a great measure, to Professor Wilson, and to the ardor which he has successfully displayed on every occasion to protect and advance the rights of that institution.\n\nThe death of the distinguished French philosopher, M. Arago, in 1853, created a vacancy in the rank of honorary member of the Society of Antiquities of Scotland, the members of which were limited to twenty, and included such men as M. Guizot, M. Jean Baptiste Biot, Sir H. C. Rawlinson, Bunsen, Lepsius, &c.; he had the distinguished honor conferred upon him of being elected to the vacant place; and this occurred subsequently to his removal to Canada.\n\nHe edited the Canadian Journal of the Canadian Institute of Toronto, for four years, with marked ability,\u2014an honorary and gratuitous labor, but Dr. Wilson's exertions were not allowed to pass by without the marked testimony of the institute, to the great talent with which he had conducted the Journal. This mark of esteem and gratitude appropriately consisted of a handsome silver service, which the professor with much gratification accepted. In 1860, he was elected president of the institute, and was re-elected in 1860. The able manner, in which he filled the chair, and presided over the deliberations of that learned body, will long be remembered, and justly appreciated by its numerous members.\nTHOMAS S. HUNT, Esq., F.R.S.\n\nThomas Sterry Hunt, chemist, mineralogist and geologist, born in Norwich, Connecticut, on the 5th September, 1826. Although a native of the United States, Mr. Hunt has become a naturalized British subject. His early education was obtained at the academy and grammar school of his native town. He studied for a while with a view to the medical profession, but was subsequently induced to devote himself to chemistry, and accordingly, in 1845, became a private student with Professor B. Silliman, jr., in Yale college, where he was also subsequently chemical assistant to Professor Silliman, senior. After two years' study in the Yale laboratory he was offered, by the late Professor James F. W. Johnston, the post of chemical assistant in his newly established school of agricultural chemistry in Edinburgh; but he declined this overture in order to accept the post of chemist and mineralogist to the geological commission for the survey of Canada, still in progress, under Sir W. E. Logan. He had previously been named to the same post in the geological survey of Vermont, then in progress, which he declined. His labors in the Canadian survey have contributed greatly to advance our knowledge both of the scientific and economical geology of the country.\n\nHis earlier studies were especially directed to organic chemistry, then assuming shape from the labors of Liebig, Dumas, Laurent and Gerhardt. It was as the reviewer, interpreter and critic of these chemists that Mr. Hunt first became known. Boldly attacking the views of the rival schools of Glisson and Montpellier, he developed from the germs contained in some of the papers of Laurent a system which may be said to be essentially his own. In this system he deduces all chemical compounds, organic and inorganic, from simple types, which are represented by one or more atoms of water of hydrogen. These bold views he maintained, at first single-handed, in a series of papers which appeared in successive volumes of the American Journal of Science from 1848 to 1851, but they were at length accepted by Williamson and Brodie in England, by Wurts in Paris, and at last by Gerhardt himself. This happy conception of Mr. Hunt will rank in the history of the science with the compound radical theory of Liebig, and the law of homologous series of Gerhardt. Its author has now the satisfaction of seeing it generally received, although it is often erroneously attributed to the chemists last named, who were however led by Mr. Hunt by two or three years, and who historically are his followers.\n\nMr. Hunt's philosophical views in chemistry and physics have\nplainly been influenced by the study of Kant, and still more of Hegel and Stallo. This may be seen in his essays on solution, chemical changes and atomic volumes, which appeared first in the American Journal of Science, but were re-published in England and Germany. In these he attacks the long established atomic hypothesis and all its consequences, and asserts that chemical union is interpretation, or rather identification. His researches upon the atomic volumes of liquids and solids were a remarkable anticipation of those of Dumas, while by his views on the polymerism of mineral species he has opened a new and as yet unexplored field for mineralogy.\n\nThese philosophical studies have however only been incidental to Mr. Hunt's more serious labors of research in chemical mineralogy and chemical geology. These researches, still in progress, on the sedimentary rocks of Canada and its mineral waters, have already contributed essentially towards obtaining more just views of chemical geology, and a more rational theory of rock metamorphism, while serving to elucidate the rocks of Canada, in aid of the researches of Sir W. E. Logan in the stratigraphical geology of this country. Thus the analysis and chemical researches of Mr. Hunt have demonstrated that the wide-spread alteration and crystalization of the sedimentary rocks, constituting what is known as normal metamorphism, have been produced by the intervention of alkaline waters, and his conclusions were speedily confirmed by the recent experiments of Daubr\u00e9e. In some of his recent papers Mr. Hunt has discussed the theory of igneous rocks and of volcanic phenomena from a new point of view, and has in a forcible manner revived the almost forgotten views of Herschel and Keferstein, who placed the seat and source of all these in the sedimentary deposits of the earth's crust. He undertakes to show that the chemical reactions established in these sediments by the ascending heat of the earth's nucleus will explain all volcanic and plutonic phenomena. He has further discussed the chemical condition of a cooling globe, such as the primal earth is assumed to have been, and essays to show how the present chemical conditions of the sea, the atmosphere and the solid rocks, have been produced by the slow operation of natural causes. In his lately published researches on the formation of gypsums and magnesian rocks (American Journal of Science, 2, 28) he has by the discovery of new and important reactions of the salts of lime and magnesia been able to resolve in a rational way, the knotty problem of the formation of these rocks, and refute the ordinary hypothesis of their origin. His memoirs of the serpentines or ophiolites, and on euphotide and saussurite, among others in chemical lithology, are noticeable for laborious and successful research.\n\nBesides the contributions of Mr. Hunt to the American Journal of Science, and to the London Philosophical Magazine, the Royal\nSociety, the French Academy of Sciences, &c., we may notice his share in the reports of the geological survey of Canada for the last ten years. He is also the author of a summary of organic chemistry, forming a part of Professor Silliman's \"First principles of Chemistry.\" Mr. Hunt was one of the English members of the international jury at the great exhibition at Paris in 1855, where he attracted attention by his contributions to the Geological Society of France and the French Academy. At that time he was decorated by Napoleon III. with the cross of the Legion of Honor. In addition to his duties as a member of the geological commission of Canada, Mr. Hunt is professor of chemistry to the faculty of arts in the Laval university of Quebec, where he lectures in the French language. In 1854 he received the honorary degree of A.M. from Harvard college, and in 1857 that of doctor of science from the Laval university. He is a member of various learned bodies, and in 1859 was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of London, of the Geological Society of France, the Imperial Geological Institute of Vienna, and the Imperial Leopold Academy of Germany. A complete list of Mr. Hunt's scientific memoirs would occupy more space than our limits permit. In the second series of the American Journal of Science alone, he has published seventy-one papers since 1846.\n\n---\n\n**Dr. James Douglas, M.R.C.S.**\n\nPerhaps of all the gentlemen of his calling, Dr. Douglas stands at the head of his profession in this province. His great knowledge of medicine and surgery, his perfect acquaintance with human character and his distinguished and extensive erudition, combined with his experience as a traveller, have justly raised him to the high position which he enjoys. Our work would be imperfect indeed, without a notice of such an individual; and surely, if other countries may boast of their great men in law, science, literature, and medicine, why should not we be allowed to record the names of those who have risen to eminence on their own merits, in this enterprising community?\n\nDr. James Douglas is the son of the Rev. George Douglas, Wesleyan minister, and Mary Mellis, his wife; he was born at Brechin, in Scotland, on the 20th May, 1800. He received his early education in Aberdeen and Dumfries.\n\nIn his thirteenth year, he was indentured to Dr. Thomas Law, a surgeon in extensive practice in Cumberland. Dr. Law was a\nnephew of the late Lord Ellenborough, and being a gentleman of education and taste, possessed the confidence and esteem of the many noble families, who then resided in the Lake district. During the two last years of his apprenticeship, young Douglas had extensive opportunities of practice among the population, which was sparsely distributed over the Falls in the South of Cumberland. Those long and frequently dark and roadless rides inured him to much hardships and fatigue, and this peculiar practice gave him habits of trust and self-reliance, which often stood him in good stead in after life; and doubtlessly tended to modify his character.\n\nAt the termination of his apprenticeship, he passed a very creditable and satisfactory examination, and was appointed, though only eighteen, surgeon to the Trafalgar, then proceeding on a whaling expedition to Greenland. During the voyage he devoted himself to the study of the fauna of these high northern latitudes, for which the seas and coasts of Iceland, Jan Mayen, and Spitzbergen, afforded abundant materials. The voyage was extremely prosperous and profitable; the highest latitude reached was $81^\\circ 56' \\text{N.}$, only $8^\\circ 4'$ from the pole.\n\nThe ensuing two winters were passed in Edinburgh, where, as a pupil of the late celebrated Mr. Liston, he assisted at several of his most important surgical operations, and, under his instructions, acquired a great deal of his knowledge of anatomy and operative surgery. In April, 1820, he was admitted a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh; and, on the 20th May following, was admitted a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of London.\n\nImmediately afterwards, he sailed for India, as surgeon of one of the honorable East India Company's ships. A heavy gale in the Bay of Biscay, which swept off all the live stock, and a detention of five weeks in crossing the equator, were followed by the appearance of sea scurvy on board, and obliged the vessel to run into Ascension, for the purpose of obtaining a supply of turtle. As Napoleon was then a resident on the neighboring island of St. Helena, Ascension was occupied by a company of marines, placed there to prevent its occupation by any other power.\n\nHe remained in India until 1822, residing chiefly at the Dum Dum artillery station. On his return to England, he was appointed by the directors' assistant-surgeon to the Indian army; but not relishing the service, he accepted the medical charge of the expedition to the Mosquito territory, under the celebrated Sir Gregor McGregor. The melancholy and fatal termination of this ill-advised and worse managed adventure caused at the time much excitement in England. Dr. Douglas was one of the few survivors. He was removed from the coast by a sloop of war, sent for the purpose, from Balise. After much suffering he reached Havana, and thence took passage to Boston.\nDuring a short residence in New York, he was appointed lecturer on anatomy to the Western Medical college. At the termination of the second course he removed to Quebec, where he arrived in March, 1826. In that city, during twenty-five years, he devoted himself assiduously to the practice of his profession, in which he attained the highest reputation as a surgeon and physician. Ill health compelled him to spend the winter of 1851-2 in the south of Europe; and, on his return, he entirely relinquished practice, retiring from the city to his country seat at (Glenalda,) where he now resides.\n\nIn 1845, along with his two friends, Drs. Morrin and Fr\u00e9mont, he founded and established the lunatic asylum at Beauport, near Quebec, an institution which has been eminently successful, being conducted on a system entirely new for this country. The management of this establishment, which now contains four hundred and fifty patients, occupies much of Dr. Douglas's time; and is beyond doubt, the best conducted institution of the kind in the province. An enthusiastic traveller, independently of several visits to the south of Italy, Dr. Douglas's interest in antiquities has induced him to spend four winters in Egypt, and to visit Palestine. From these countries he has brought home a small but very interesting collection of curiosities and specimens.\n\nTHOMAS C. KEEFER, Esq., C.E.\n\nThomas Coltrin Keefer, the celebrated Canadian engineer, is the eighth son of the late George Keefer, Esq., of Thorold, in the Niagara peninsula, and was born there on the 4th November, 1821, and is consequently now in his fortieth year. The father, who died in 1858, and of whom a memoir has been prepared by the Reverend T. B. Fuller, rector and rural dean of Thorold, was born in Sussex county, in New Jersey,\u2014then a British province\u2014in 1773, and came into Canada with other loyalists and children of loyalists, in 1790. He was the son of George Kieffer, a French \u00e9migr\u00e9 of German extraction, who was born near Strasbourg, in 1789; emigrated about 1765, after the seven years' war, to America, and established himself at a place called Paulinskil, near Newton, in Sussex county, New Jersey. A brother who accompanied him went to Harrisburg in Pennsylvania; his descendants about Lancaster in that state retain the original spelling of the name. The\nname of Kieffer is a common one in and around Strasbourg. Jean Daniel Kieffer, who was born in Strasbourg in 1765, and died in Paris, in 1813, was \"Chevalier de la L\u00e9gion d'honneur, ancien premier secr\u00e9taire interpr\u00e8te du Roi, pour les langues orientales, professeur au coll\u00e8ge de France et \u00e0 l'\u00c9cole des \u00c9l\u00e8ves interpr\u00e8te, l'un des vice-pr\u00e9sidents de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 asiatique de Paris, membre du consistoire de l'\u00e9glise \u00e9vang\u00e9lique de la confession d'Augsbourg, agent principal de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Biblique de Londres en France, et membre de plusieurs soci\u00e9t\u00e9s scientifiques et philanthropiques fran\u00e7aises et \u00e9trang\u00e8res.\" This celebrated French orientalist was the translator of the first complete edition of the Bible into Turkish, and was, with M. Ruffin, \"the Nestor-of the East,\" imprisoned in 1798, for three years in the castle of the Seven Tewers, Constantinople.\n\nAs Huguenots the Kieffers had probably followed many of their countrymen who had previously taken refuge in America; for emigration to this continent, from an interior point like Strasbourg, was not, one hundred years ago, the simple matter it now is. M. Kieffer married in 1767, and in 1776, with the Ryerses, Swayzes and many others of German blood, espoused the cause of the house of Hanover, volunteered into the Rangers, and served under Sir William Howe in New York, where he was carried off by army fever, and was buried on Staten Island. His property, consisting of two farms, a distillery and a female slave, was confiscated by Congress, but this was not carried into effect until his son, George, had attained the age of eighteen, and had made a journey into Canada to look out the home which was offered here by the British government to all its adherents. Returning in 1792, George Keefer, (who wrote his name according to the pronunciation) brought his mother into Canada on horseback by an Indian trail through an unbroken forest, from the Susquehanna to Lake Erie. The site of Buffalo was then vacant, and two temporary huts for fishermen were the only human habitations there. For nearly seventy-years Mr. Keefer lived at Thorold, on the Welland canal, of which work he was the first president, and the constant supporter of its distinguished author, the Honorable W. H. Merritt. Deprived of his patrimony, he nevertheless by a long life of industry, temperance and strict integrity, acquired a considerable estate, and brought up a large family, taking especial care to afford them all the advantages which the progress of education in Canada from time to time afforded.\n\nThe mother of the subject of this notice was the second wife of George Keefer, having been the widow of John Emery, the son of a United Empire loyalist of English descent, and himself one of the Canadian volunteers, who died at Niagara of army fever, in 1813. She was the sister of Edward McBride, a prominent Freemason, who represented Niagara in the provincial Parliament, and whose name figured in the case of the abduction of Morgan. They were\nchildren of one of the Irish volunteers who came to Canada in 1776, under General Carlton, after having first married in Tralee, Mary Bradshaw, who claimed descent from Col. Bradshaw (brother of the regicide), who went to Ireland with Cromwell's army. The Bradshaws claim descent from the famous bishop of Winchester, William of Wykeham, for the education of all whose descendants provision is made in Winchester college. Mary Bradshaw's mother was a Healy, a connection of the Springs, in that part of Ireland. The Bradshaws were Protestant,\u2014the Healys Roman Catholic.\n\nMr. Thomas C. Keefer was educated at Upper Canada college, Toronto, where, between the years 1833 and 1838, he passed from the third form under the late Dr. Phillips to the seventh, under Dr. Harris. In 1838 he commenced the profession which for some time before leaving college he had chosen, at Lockport, on the Erie canal, where extensive works were then in progress. In 1840 he returned to Canada, and was employed by the Welland Canal Company, under the late J. S. Macanlay, colonel in Royal Engineers, then engineer-in-chief. In the following year the Canadas were united, and this canal becoming a provincial work, its enlargement was commenced. Mr. Keefer, then only in his twentieth year, was appointed to the charge of the enlargement of the feeder, and continued the only engineer in charge until the appointment of Mr. Power as engineer-in-chief, in 1842, and the commencement of the new locks. He remained a division engineer of all south of the Welland river until 1845, when he was appointed to the charge of the Ottawa works, and thus in his twenty-fourth year, ceased to be an assistant engineer. At the close of 1848 he was dismissed from the government service with a flattering letter, ostensibly on the score of retrenchment, but in reality because he had, as engineer in charge, successfully opposed proposed expenditures in which some members of Parliament, having influence with the administration, were interested. In 1849 he wrote the \"Philosophy of Railroads,\" a pamphlet which was reprinted by several railway companies, and republished in many of the newspapers, and contributed more than any other to aid the railway agitation which secured the completion of the Great Western, the Toronto Northern, Port Hope, Cobourg, Ottawa, and Grand Trunk Railways. It was also a text book for the press of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, in advocating their railway policy.\n\nIn the same year, his Excellency the Earl of Elgin, governor-general, offered a premium for the best \"Essay on the influence of the Canals of Canada upon her Agriculture.\" For this Mr. Keefer was the successful competitor, and the announcement, in 1850, immediately after the success of his \"Philosophy of Railroads,\" at once gave him the position of an authority on railway and com-\nmercial subjects. In his prize essay he foreshadowed that political differences might divert the trade of the north-west from the Mississippi to the St. Lawrence. He opposed agricultural protection as unnecessary, and general protection as unwise, but advocated incidental protection to certain manufactures suited to the country, and asserted that reciprocity would be granted. He predicted that the St. Lawrence by its adaptation for steam power would yet distance its rivals, and was the first to call attention to the importance of the route through the straits of Belleisle, as saving several hundred miles in the European voyage. He showed that with steamers, lights, buoys and beacons, the Gulf of St. Lawrence would be safer than the Gulf of Mexico, the English or Irish channels. He advocated the free navigation of the St. Lawrence and shewed the relief it would afford to the lake craft in winter and in seasons of depression, which view has been since proved correct by the fact that twenty thousand tons of lake shipping went out on the ocean in 1858 and 1859. He also pointed out that New England would for the future be a better market for Canadian breadstuffs than old England. Since this essay was published other prize essays have been written on Canada, and extensively distributed in connection with the Paris Exhibition in 1855, and many valuable publications have likewise drawn attention to this province, in late years, all of which have had the \"Canals of Canada\" of Mr. Keefer before their writers, while he wrote under every disadvantage, except that of treading new ground. His essay has however been described by the leading press of Canada as a masterly one, exhausting the subjects on which it treats. The government policy with reference to the St. Lawrence in the last ten years has been in accordance with the principles laid down in it, and his views with respect to a manufacturing policy have been adopted.\n\nIn 1850 he was again called into the government service by the Honorable W. H. Merritt, (who was then chief commissioner of public works), and was sent to survey the rapids of the St. Lawrence with a view to their improvement, and also to explore the country between the head waters of the river St. John in New Brunswick and the St. Lawrence, opposite the Saguenay, for the purpose of opening up an intercolonial communication by canal or railway. In 1851 he resigned permanently his connection with the government service, and was appointed chief engineer of the Toronto and Kingston section of the Grand Trunk Railway, which, as laid down by Mr. Keefer in his \"Philosophy of Railways,\" was restricted to a line from Montreal uniting with the Great Western at Hamilton. In the same year he was appointed to the survey of the Montreal and Kingston section of the Grand Trunk Railway, and also of the bridge over the St. Lawrence at Montreal, thus having the whole line and bridge in his hands. In 1852 the English contractors assumed the position of the Canadian companies,\nand appointed their own engineer to the charge of the railway and bridge, and Mr. Keefer, unwilling to take a subordinate post under the contractors' engineer, went into general practice. In connection with the Trunk railway it may be mentioned that he advocated the gauge of New York and New England for the Canadian line, so that cars laden in Canada could go without transhipment, in bond or otherwise, into New York and Boston, the only produce markets in the United States within our reach, and return in like manner with imports, to their place of destination. Portland had however foreseen that, without a peculiar gauge, traffic would branch off at the Connecticut river and other points to Boston, and had bound the Sherbrooke road to her conditions. These in turn were imposed upon the whole province, as the provincial gauge, by the Sherbrooke road. Mr. Keefer has since its commencement in 1853 disapproved of the policy of the Grand Trunk Company, in the location, construction and management of the railway, although, as one of the early promoters, he has always been favorable to the enterprise itself.\n\nIn reference to the bill then before the legislature, Mr. Keefer, in 1852, recorded his protest in one of the leading provincial journals, in the following prophetic language:\n\n\"It is the control of the road during construction and after completion, by a company of non-resident speculators, that should be resisted. There are a thousand questions of local importance to every town, village and township on the line, which must arise during its construction, which such persons cannot appreciate and will not accede to; and when completed, upon the liberal and enlightened management of its commencement will depend its future success, and that of the interests along the route. This cannot and will not be appreciated by parties in temporary possession, whose policy it will be to make that possession so irksome that the country will be compelled to purchase them out. Thus after paying the highest price for a road constructed in defiance of local wishes, it will be thrown back on our hands, having been managed by 'reference to the board at home,' damaged in reputation, and not improbably, worn out in track and gear, by the cupidity or indifference of temporary non-resident tenants.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\n\"Mr. Jackson merely asks power from the Canadian legislature to puff the stock of our main line to double the amount necessary for the construction of the road, and when he shall have disposed of \u00a310,000 per mile in stock, by quoting the confirmation of this 'chisel' by the Canadian legislature and government, (who in England, will be supposed to be the best judges of what the road will cost and what it will pay), he will disappear from the scene and leave 'the widows and clergymen,' the Sidney Smiths, and all the small shareholders in Britain to divide the dividends between...\"\nthemselves and the government guarantee mortgage. The position which Canada will then occupy in the public opinion of Great Britain will be similar to that of the repudiating state of Pennsylvania, whose drab-coated citizens Sidney Smith has immortalized.\"\n\nReferring to the Toronto and Guelph road, Mr. Keefer foreshadowed the result, as follows:\n\n\"But where will all this end? Public notoriety brings the rumor of another gigantic 'chisel.' It is well known that the directors of the Toronto and Guelph road have received over one hundred bids for their line, but have as yet accepted none, and the reason assigned is that they are angling with 'Jackson, Hincks & Co.,' to be tacked on to the trunk line. The Great Western will then be thrown overboard as a 'Yankee concern,' and the Canadian main trunk will be pushed through Guelph and Sarnia, and the government guarantee be extended over the whole line.\n\n\"If the doctrine be true that every man has his price, we confess that with such a railway-facilities bill of fare there is scarcely anything which reckless and unprincipled plotting cannot do. We tremble for the name and fame of Canada when we reflect with what hot haste this Jackson business has been spurred on.\"\n\nAfter describing the political position of the question, Mr. Keefer thus concludes:\n\n\"Lastly, Mr. Hincks is committed to himself. The power and patronage arising out of the expenditure of such a vast sum of money is worth all the political trump cards which ever have been or can be started, and wielding that power through a project which extends throughout the entire length and breadth of the land, he can defy the whole army of politicians\u2014who can only oppose principle to interest, agitation to a consideration.\n\n\"The public character of Canada is to be prostituted in the London stock market, and used as an engine to extract their means from distant and confiding men and women. Messrs. Jackson & Co., are allowed, first, to make a contract with themselves, by which they will make the future shareholders pay double the value of the road; secondly, they are enabled to purchase the support necessary to secure the bill by being allowed to assign sub-contracts without competition, &c.\"\n\nIn addition to his professional engagements during the busy period which marked the commencement of the railway era in Canada, he was on the part of Canada prominently concerned, from 1849 until its passage in 1854, with the reciprocity treaty, and spent some time in Boston and New York with the United States consul-general, the Canadian department of whose report bears evidence of Mr. Keefer's labors. Although many names have figured prominently in the final stages of this measure,\nsome are those of men who were at first sceptical of its practicability, who ridiculed the proposition, but who like other fortunates have reaped where they have not sown. There exists the best authority for stating that Mr. Keefer contributed at least as much as any other person acting on the part of Canada towards the successful issue of this important measure.\n\nDuring the period which has elapsed since 1852, Mr. Keefer has filled the positions of engineer of the Montreal Water Works, Montreal Harbor, Stanstead, Shefford and Chambly Railway, Hamilton Water Works, Port Dover Railway, besides having been as consulting engineer, or arbitrator, connected at some time with most of the railways and public works in the country. Nor has his practice been confined to Canada. Twice he has been called into the adjoining province of New Brunswick; and he has declined an offer from Major-General Fremont to go to California, with a munificent salary, on a professional engagement in connection with the Mariposa mines. Besides his professional reports, some of his lectures have been published; in one of which, that upon \"the Ottawa,\" the only detailed description yet given of the mode of conducting the lumber trade, is to be found. During the recent visit of the Prince of Wales, his royal highness inaugurated the Hamilton Water Works, on which occasion Mr. Keefer, as the engineer, was presented.\n\nHis connection with the Victoria Bridge has, since the erection of the tablet bearing the inscription, been the subject of much discussion by the Canadian press; his friends contending that by the omission of his name, great injustice has been done not only to him, but to Canadian engineering. His claims have been made the subject of pamphlets, both in this country and in England, and have been brought forward in the Legislative Council here; and thus far, judgment in his favor appears to have gone by default. The directors of the company here disclaimed all responsibility with regard to the inscription or the omission of Mr. Keefer's name, and appear disinclined to interfere in a professional controversy; so much so, that at the inauguration they did not in their address allude to any of the engineers whose names have been associated with the bridge. Mr. Keefer's claims appear to be as follows:\u2014Two eminent American engineers had previously located the bridge across Nun's Island, and one of them had declared his belief that any attempt to place it where it now stands would endanger it; the other, by his subsequent location, practically assented to this. One of these engineers proposed to provide for the navigation by means of a draw bridge, which the other declared to be impracticable, and therefore proposed to stop the navigation altogether. Both chose the widest portion of the river, and adopted a minimum of obstruction in piers and abutments in order to give the greatest freedom to the ice and water, and thereby\navert its destructive action. Mr. Keefer, on the contrary, demonstrated that the present site is the best, because the narrower, and that it ought to be still more diminished in width, by encroaching upon the shoals on either shore; and by thus concentrating the current prevent the ice from grounding in front and between the piers. He therefore planned the solid approaches which have been adopted, and provided for the navigation by elevating the central span, and ascending to it by an ordinary railway grade from either shore. This plan was as simple as that by which the egg was made to stand on end, but with the low banks on both sides it did not suggest itself to his American predecessors. Mr. Keefer also established the proper spaces between the piers, (which have been followed almost exactly), and he demonstrated the necessity for a solid tubular bridge, and the inapplicability of the suspension principle to this site. It has therefore been claimed by his friends that \"all which is peculiar, all which distinguishes this bridge from any other, is derived from him;\" while several Canadian and American writers on the bridge give him a foremost position in relation to it.\n\nIn concluding this short notice we may say, with a late writer on the subject\u2014\"Judging the comparative merits of the surviving engineers, few will dispute that in putting the English engineers' names on the bridge portals, and in leaving the Canadian's off, a great injustice was done; and we believe that Mr. Keefer's name will be engraved on the heart of every sensible man who understands anything of the subject.\"\n\nMr. Keefer married, in 1848, Elizabeth, youngest daughter of the late Honorable Thomas McKay, of Rideau Hall, near Ottawa, and is now a resident of Toronto.\n\nMr. Keefer is a younger brother of Samuel Keefer, Esq., deputy commissioner of public works and inspector of railways, and formerly engineer to the board of works; a gentleman of great professional attainments and much goodness of heart. Through his appointment, he is professionally connected with many of the leading public works in the province.\n\nF. X. GARNEAU, Esq.\n\nThe name of this gentleman, as a historian, stands pre-eminent in our republic of letters; he is at once our Macaulay, Hume, Guizot and Thiers; and we may conscientiously say that he has written the best history of Canada ever printed. This rank his\nhistory holds, not only for the great information which it contains, but for the purity and perspicuity of the language which he employs to pourtray his opinions of the men and things in general connected with Canada; in fact, we have no history of Canada equal to Garneau's. Smith wrote only up to a certain period, and Roger the same. Christie and McMullen's histories can only be regarded as compilations, and the late history of the Abb\u00e9 Ferland, to speak strictly, concerns more the affairs of the Romish Church than that of the province.\n\nM. Garneau has been put to enormous expense and anxiety to get out his history, (of which three editions and one translation have appeared); he had to travel far and near to obtain information, and we owe a deep obligation to him for bringing forward such information as, perhaps, but for his indefatigable energy, would have remained in oblivion; the anxiety which he felt and the intense attention which he bestowed in procuring his history nearly ruined what had previously been not a very strong constitution; and to judge of his age, he certainly looks much more enfeebled and aged than he really is. As for his personal history, he is a native of Quebec, having been born there, and having received his education at the Quebec seminary, an institution intrusted with the instruction of nearly all the influential French Canadians of the district from which have emanated some of the brightest ornaments of our French population. From his youth, M. Garneau has always been of a studious disposition, and much given to collecting intelligence of occurrences and facts relative to the history of Canada. When a young man he studied law and passed for the bar, and he was employed in the Legislative Assembly for a short time as a clerk, and eventually became, what he is now, the city clerk of Quebec. M. Garneau is a member of the Council of Public Instruction, of Lower Canada, and an honorary member of the Literary and Historical Society of Quebec, and of the Historical Societies of Montreal, Michigan, Chicago, &c. He has also been several years president of the Institut Canadien, of Quebec.\n\nCHARLES LINDSAY, Esq.\n\nMr. Lindsay, the celebrated, and (we may say without exaggeration) the first political writer in Canada at the present day, was born in Lincolnshire, England, in the beginning of the year 1820. He came to Canada as late as 1842, in search of some occupation or em-\nployment as a writer, but for some time, he was unsuccessful in his endeavors, having only obtained the editorship of a small country paper in Canada West. By degrees, however, as his talents became known from his writings, people began to regard him with less reserve, and in 1846, when Mr. Hincks started The Examiner as his organ, in the capital of the western province, Mr. Lindsay was entrusted with the sub-editorship of that journal, although practically he was, as an eminent functionary has it, \"the editor-in-chief.\" In that capacity he remained for six years, when, in 1852, he was solicited by the proprietor of the Toronto Leader to become its editor. The proposal was accepted, and he has remained with that journal ever since, raising it by his talented writings from a small second rate paper, to be the most influential and widely circulated political and family paper in the province.\n\nMr. Lindsay is also an author of no mean repute; having at different times published small but well written and valuable books on the following subjects, \"Clergy Reserves,\" \"The Maine Liquor Law,\" and \"The Prairies of the Western States.\" The latter by order of the government, was published to defend Canada against the attacks of Mr. James Caird, M.P., in his work on America. Mr. Lindsay has also contributed largely to many valuable publications in this and the old world, and is, we understand, also preparing a work on the lower provinces, as well as a life of his late father-in-law, William Lyon McKenzie, Esquire.\n\nIt is unnecessary to speak of the style of Mr. Lindsay's writings; for, assuredly, all political parties in Canada will acknowledge the fact that he writes as a scholar and a gentleman. His services have been exceedingly beneficial to his party; so much so, that, after the keen contest in the late elections, in which he worked earnestly, he was attacked by a dangerous illness, the result of hard desk work and late hours, and from that, we believe, he is only now recovering. Indeed, we may say with confidence that in him, the present ministry are possessed of the most powerful ally which they could possibly have retained in the western province. To Mr. Lindsay must be attributed a great portion of the recent victory, which they have achieved in Canada West. This is no flattery, for we speak the truth, which cannot fail to be apparent to all unprejudiced persons.\nDANIEL MORRISON, Esq:\n\nIf we award to Mr. Lindsay one of the highest places as a Canadian writer and journalist, we are bound in justice to the above able and talented gentleman to place him side by side with his celebrated confr\u00e8re.\n\nMr. Morrison's name is well known in Canada, not only from his long connection with our press, as one of its most vigorous writers, but also for his known character as a gentleman of the most kindly and amiable feelings.\n\nHe is the son of the Reverend Mr. Morrison, of Inverness, in Scotland. An early resident (for his years) in Canada, he at first engaged in agricultural pursuits; and for some time he cultivated a farm in the county of Wentworth, C. W. He subsequently, in conjunction with Mr. S. T. Jones, edited the Dundas Warder; and during his short connection with that paper, he raised it from the comparatively obscure position which it held on his first joining it, to one of the first journals in the western section of the province; and achieved a reputation for himself as being one of the most spirited and vigorous writers in Canada. His talents and abilities were held in such high repute during his brief connection with the Warder, that he shortly afterwards became editor of the Toronto Leader, the principal journal in Canada; and his writings displayed such ability and energy, that he was spoken of as the best journalist in this country. Leaving the Leader he became editor of the Colonist, which, in conjunction with Mr. Sheppard, he had purchased from Mr. Samuel Thompson, and he continued in that office until 1859, when he was appointed by the government as one of the provincial arbitrators, an office attached to the public works department. This office he continued to hold until 1860, when his official business having brought him to Quebec, he was offered by Mr. Foote the editorship of the Morning Chronicle of that city. This offer he accepted, and resigned his post in the government service. Subsequently, in the spring of 1861, he proceeded to London, C. W., to take charge of the Prototype; and is now employed on the staff of the Tribune, in New York.\n\nThe style of writing in which he more particularly excels, is sarcasm, and in this, it is said, few writers can approach him. We think we but speak the general opinion of all those who are acquainted with the affairs of the press of this country, when we state that Mr. Morrison occupies one of the highest places in it.\n\nMr. Morrison married in 1858, the celebrated and accomplished young Canadian actress, Miss Charlotte Nickinson, by whom (we believe) he has two children.\nGEORGE SHEPPARD, Esq.\n\nAnother name well known, as connected with our Canadian press, is that of Mr. Sheppard. This gentleman, previous to his connection with this country, was a writer and political lecturer in England. Having come to America, he conceived the idea of founding an English colony in the western state of Illinois, close to Iowa. This he accomplished, bringing a large number of English people there under his guidance. Too unselfish, however, to profit by his position, Mr. Sheppard did not receive the best treatment at the hands of those whom he had placed in the most prosperous position; and being disappointed, he proceeded to Washington, where he was employed by the Federal Government to write for, and (if we mistake not), edit the National Intelligencer, the organ of the administration of the day.\n\nHow he first became connected with Canada we are not aware; but he distinguished himself as a writer for the Globe and for the Leader, and afterwards, in 1858, for the Colonist, which he owned, in conjunction with Mr. Morrison. Soon after the Colonist went into opposition, Mr. Sheppard became one of the editors of the Globe, and continued as such until the celebrated Toronto Convention of 1859, in the proceedings of which he took a prominent part, and shewed himself to be an eloquent speaker, as he is one of the best of writers.\n\nSubsequently, he proceeded to Washington; and during his residence there, contributed those much admired letters to the Leader, which appeared during 1860, written in his usual vigorous style, describing the outbreak of hostilities, and other matters in connection with the American civil war. He returned to Canada a short time since, and is now editing the Leader during Mr Lindsay's absence.\n\nPROF. J. W. DAWSON, M.A., F.R.G.S.\n\nPRINCIPAL OF MCGILL COLLEGE.\n\nThe name of this distinguished and justly celebrated savant is not unknown to most of our readers. His labors in the cause of science, history and education are calculated to give him a high place among Canadian literati.\nMr. Dawson is a native of Pictou, Nova Scotia, where he was born of a good Scottish family, in October, 1820. After completing a course of study in classics, mathematics, physics, mental science, chemistry, &c., in Pictou academy, taking lessons in drawing and taxidermy, and spending some time in collecting specimens in natural history, he matriculated in the university of Edinburgh, and attended more especially the lectures of Professor Jameson, throughout the session of 1840-41, on mineralogy and geology. On his return to Nova Scotia, in 1841, he travelled with Sir C. Lyell, and, under his direction, he explored and described in the \"Proceedings of the Geological Society of London,\" several points of interest regarding the geology of that province. After having lectured on botany and geology in the academy of Pictou, and in the Dalhousie college, and having published several educational works, Mr. Dawson was appointed, in 1850, superintendent of education for Nova Scotia. In 1853, he resigned his office, and was appointed one of the directors of the new normal school. Shortly after, great complaints having been made against King's college, Fredericton, New Brunswick, a commission was appointed to enquire into the condition of the institution. Dr. Ryerson and Mr. Dawson were among the commissioners. The latter was appointed principal of the McGill college, in 1855, and had subsequently conferred on him the honorary degree of doctor of laws, by the same university, in addition to that of master of arts of the university of Edinburgh, which he already possessed.\n\nDr. Dawson is, moreover, a fellow of the Royal Geological Society of London, and a member of the Natural History Society of Montreal, and of the Canadian Institute, Toronto, corresponding member of the Academy of Natural Science, of Philadelphia, fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Science, and honorary member of the Botanical Society of Canada. He has contributed several papers to the British and American associations for the promotion of the sciences. Besides the numerous essays published in the transactions of scientific bodies, or in pamphlet form, he has published the following works:\u2014 \"Handbook of the Geography and Natural History of Nova Scotia,\" pp. 96, and map, (1848); \"Hints to the Farmers of Nova Scotia,\" pp. 148, (1853); and \"Acadian Geology,\" pp. 800, (1855); and \"Archaic,\" (1859).\n\nHis administration of the educational affairs of McGill college has been thus far marked with great success in the following particulars: in the complete organization of the faculty of arts, which was previously in a very depressed condition, in the organising of the McGill normal school, in conjunction with the educational department of Canada East, and in the prompt restoration of the high school and college buildings, in the replacing of their libraries and in the restoration of their collections of natural history, after the disastrous fire of 1856. The new library of the faculty\nof arts already contains eighteen hundred well selected volumes; and there is also a fair beginning of a collection of philosophical apparatus. The new museum contains a general collection in zoology; a general collection in geology and paleontology; the Holmes' collection of two thousand Canadian and foreign minerals; the Holmes herbarium, containing specimens of nearly all the plants indigenous to Lower Canada; the Logan collection of four hundred and fifty characteristic Canadian fossils; and the Couper collection of two thousand four hundred Canadian insects.\n\nR. A. HARRISON, Esq., B.C.L.\n\nThe next name in our category is that of the rising barrister and successful law author, Robert Alexander Harrison, the only law writer of eminence of which Canada can really boast.\n\nMr. Harrison was born in the City of Montreal, C. H., on the 3rd August, 1833. His parents are both from the north of Ireland, and in the same year that he was born, migrated to Canada; they afterwards removed to the upper province, and for some time lived in the township of Markham, north of York, now Toronto, and subsequently became residents of the latter city, where Mr. Harrison's life from childhood has been spent.\n\nMr. Harrison is an \"Upper Canada college boy,\" having been educated at that institution, which has turned out many youths who have shed lustre on the name of the college. Young Harrison was most successful in his studies, and yearly carried off a great number of prizes. He left college in 1849, to embrace the profession of the law; he was then sixteen years of age, and during the same year was articled as a clerk in the law office of Messrs. Robinson & Allan, a practising law firm of Toronto. During the time spent in their office he made rapid progress in the study of the profession, and was looked upon as a \"rising young man.\" When about eighteen years of age, and two years a student, he commenced the compilation of the first law work he ever wrote; it was a digest of all cases determined in the Queen's Bench and practice courts for Upper Canada, from 1823 to 1851, inclusive. He was about a year in writing the book, and nearly as long in passing it through the press. Being a young law student and unknown to the profession, the work was published under the supervision of James Lukin Robinson, Esquire, who was then the\nauthorized reporter of the Queen's Bench. The work was published in the joint names of \"Robinson & Harrison.\" It was most successful, and received the approval of the profession. It brought Mr. Harrison's name widely and favorably before the legal profession. This was the only legal work he wrote during the time he was a law student. During the years of his study he was a prominent member, both of the Toronto Literary and Debating Society, and of the Osgoode Club of Toronto. For a long period he was president of the Literary Society, though in years junior to many of its members. Of the Osgoode Club, while Hon. Mr. Justice Burns was president, he was one of its vice-presidents, and a most active member.\n\nIn 1853, Mr. Harrison became a law student in the office of Messrs. Crawford & Hagerty, then the leading law firm of Upper Canada. In 1854, he joined the crown law department for Upper Canada, as chief clerk, or deputy to the attorney-general. Although then only a law student, his selection was made by Hon. John Ross, on account of the favorable opinions given of Mr. Harrison by many leading men of the profession. Though the government, of which Mr. Ross was a member, was defeated during the time that Mr. Harrison was on his way to Quebec, yet the Hon. John A. Macdonald, who, in the meantime, had taken Mr. Ross's place, confirmed the appointment. Prior to his departure for Quebec, Mr. Harrison received addresses from the literary and other associations with which he was connected, all bearing the most fervent expressions for his welfare.\n\nIn 1855, on the removal of the government to Toronto, Mr. Harrison was called to the bar \"with honors\". He was the first so called under new rules then just in operation, and was warmly congratulated by the late Mr. Baldwin, then treasurer of the Law Society, and shortly afterwards had conferred upon him the degree of B.C.L., by the university of Trinity college. About this time he was a constant contributor to the Daily Colonist, then one of the leading papers of Toronto; his articles were often reproduced by the country press with much effect. Becoming too much involved in politics, to the neglect of his profession, he, in the same year, 1855, cut short his connection with the political press. This year he commenced his work on the Common Law Procedure act. The undertaking, although a great one, was accomplished in twelve months. It was received with even greater favor than his first attempt, and the press loudly commended it. The London legal press placed him in the front rank of those who had written upon the subject about which he had treated.\n\nThe Jurist of London, England, said of it, \"This work is almost as useful to the English as the Canadian lawyer, and is not only the most recent, but by far the most complete edition which we have seen of these acts of parliament.\"\nThe Solicitor's Journal said, \"It is but justice to say that no pains have been spared to make the notes as full and practicable as possible, and that the annotator appears thoroughly to understand his text, and to be remarkably well up in the laws of the mother country. His remarks show that he has thought much more upon the subject than many of our own authors.\"\n\nWe might continue our quotations innumerable both from the English and Canadian press, but let it suffice for us to say that the work was everywhere received with the greatest approbation.\n\nHis next work, which appeared in 1857, was, \"The Statutes of Practical Utility in the Civil Administration of Justice in Upper Canada, from the First Act Passed in Upper Canada to the Common Law Procedure Acts of 1856.\" This was intended as a companion to his former work, and fully answered its purpose.\n\nIn July, of the same year, he became joint editor of the \"Upper Canada Law Journal,\" in which capacity he still acts. It was previously published at Barrie, and not much in favor with the profession, but when Mr. Harrison became connected with it, the \"Law Journal\" was brought to Toronto, and from that time has steadily progressed; it is now much read and valued, not only by the profession, but a great number of the people of Upper Canada. The leading articles which appear in its pages, and which are attributed to Mr. Harrison, are regarded with much favor, and well received by the English and provincial press.\n\nDuring 1857, he also brought out \"A Manual of Costs in County Courts,\" containing besides the tariff of costs some general points of practice; and shortly afterwards, in the same year, wrote \"A Sketch of the Growth and Present Importance of the Legal Profession in Upper Canada,\" which concluded his literary labors of a legal character for that year.\n\nIn 1858, he produced two other law works, one being the \"Rules, Orders and Regulations as to Practice and Pleading in the Courts of Queen's Bench and Common Pleas in Upper Canada, with Notes Explanatory and Practical,\" the other a corresponding work in regard to the County Courts of Upper Canada; these were both well received, and fully bore out the reputation he had gained for accuracy, industry and ability.\n\nIn 1859, appeared his last and most popular legal work, \"The Municipal Manual of Upper Canada,\" which had a tremendous sale, and was greatly extolled. In speaking of Mr. Harrison, one newspaper said, \"Canada may justly feel proud of this one of her sons, educated entirely at her educational institutions, and a member of the Upper Canadian bar; and it is to be hoped, if the talents of youthful Canadians are to be properly appreciated, the time is near at hand when Mr. Harrison will be called on by some constituency to represent them in Parliament, thus benefitting the community and honoring him and themselves by the choice. There\nhis clearness of head would soon be felt in pruning acts of Parliament of the absurd verbosity and ridiculous excrescences with which they are but too frequently encumbered, and thus render them plain and intelligible to the general public. To the legal profession, both in Canada and in England, Mr. Harrison is known as being remarkably well versed in the laws of both countries,\" &c.\n\nWith reference to this suggestion, Mr. Harrison, although repeatedly solicited to allow himself to be put in nomination for a place in Parliament, has hitherto (wisely so far as his private interests are concerned) steadfastly refused that honor.\n\nIn 1859 he retired from the crown law department, bearing with him the sincere and heartfelt good wishes of all he had come in contact with. He also received letters from his superiors, couched in the most affectionate and flattering language. Mr. Harrison commenced practice in partnership with a gentleman of much ability in the profession in Toronto, and, at present, enjoys a flourishing practice. He has been retained as counsel for the crown in nearly every important case which has arisen of late. His first appearance in that character was at the celebrated prosecution of McHenry alias Townsend, the murderer; he next appeared in the conduct of the Norfolk shrievality case, when people ridiculed the government for retaining so young a man to prosecute. Though opposed by one of the most eminent counsel of the province, he was entirely successful, and by his success set at rest the fears of those who looked only to his youth and not his great industry and ability. In the \"State Trials\" when the Parliamentary opposition endeavored in courts of law to break down the government, he, with eminent counsel, was on the defensive, and as usual successful. In the famous Habeas Corpus case of John Anderson, the negro, he gained his ease before the Queen's Bench, but happily for Anderson, on technical points, the force of which he at once conceded, lost it before the Common Pleas.\n\nMr. Harrison's practice is large and must be lucrative; though often employed in important criminal cases, as well for prosecution as defence, his time is chiefly occupied in holding briefs in civil cases. While the former spreads his name to fame, the latter fills his pockets: he is now so actively engaged in the practice of his profession that no time is afforded him for literary pursuits of any magnitude. Unlike many rising lawyers, whom we could name, he avoids politics; he goes upon the principle that his first duty is to himself and his next to his country. We hope, however, that the time will come when the land of Mr. Harrison's birth will receive in her highest councils the benefit of his talents and experience. Mr. Harrison is an able and effective speaker; his style is clear and forcible; he invariably gains and always retains the attention of his audience. At times he is humor-\nous, never prosy; he accommodates his style to the humour and capacity of his audience; he knows when to begin and when to stop. Though still a very young man, he is indeed an able advocate. Though often pitted against his seniors of the bar, his success is proverbial. In disposition he is warm and generous; he possesses a portly and commanding figure; his height is above the average of men; his bearing, although marked and decided, is withal extremely easy; and his career so far has been a bright one. What he has gained has not been earned without labor; his industry, fortunately for him, is as great as his talent; he is never idle; his energy is intense; his reputation for uprightness of conduct fully equals his reputation for talent. From what is already known of him, the brightest anticipations are formed as to his future. Without doubt he will mount to an extremely exalted position.\n\nHe married in June, 1859, Miss Anna Muckle, the accomplished daughter of the late John McClure Muckle, at one time an extensive merchant in Quebec. On this occasion he took the opportunity of making a tour through Europe, visiting places of learning and historical interest.\n\nH. Y. HIND, Esq., M.A., F.R.G.S.,\nProfessor of Chemistry and Geology in the University of Trinity College, Toronto.\n\nHENRY YOULE HIND, the distinguished subject of this notice, was born in the town of Nottingham, England, June, 1823. Until the age of fourteen, he was the private pupil of the Reverend W. Butler, head-master of the Nottinghamshire grammar school, together with his cousin, Mr. J. R. Hind, the eminent London astronomer, and now superintendent of the Nautical Almanac. Leaving Nottingham, he was sent to the royal commercial school at Leipzig, where he remained for two years, acquiring a knowledge of German, French, chemistry, natural philosophy, and other subjects taught in the school. Upon returning home he studied for a few years, again with the Reverend W. Butler, and then went to the university of Cambridge, entering as a student at Queen's college. Here he remained one year; but, on account of straightened circumstances, was compelled to relinquish the idea of taking\nhis degree at Cambridge. In 1845, he went to France, for several months, with a view to perfect himself in French; it appears, however, that so much travelling in early life ensured a distaste for sedentary pursuits, for, in 1846, we find him starting for America, and spending a year or more in wandering through Mexico and the wild parts of the southern states. Apparently tired of this kind of life; and, perhaps, in want of friends, he came to Canada in 1847, and at once began to look out for permanent employment. After a few months experience in teaching one of the common schools of the country, he became a successful candidate for the post of mathematical master, and lecturer in chemistry and natural philosophy, at the provincial normal school for Upper Canada, then about to be established. He remained at this institution for about five years, when he was appointed professor of chemistry and geology in the university of Trinity college, Toronto, the chair he still occupies. In 1857, he received the appointment of geologist to the Red River exploring expedition; and, in 1858, the charge of the exploration of the country between Red River and the Saskatchewan, was confided to him by the Canadian government. His reports on these expeditions are well known to the public of Canada and England, having been printed in this country by order of the Legislative Assembly; and in England laid before both houses of parliament by command of the government and reprinted there with additional maps, constructed under Mr. Hind's supervision, by Arrowsmith, the Queen's hydrographer.\n\nIn 1860, Mr. Hind was elected a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, and superintended personally, the publication of his \"Narrative of the Canadian Expeditions in the North West,\" a highly illustrated work in two volumes, brought out by Longmans & Co., of London. This work has been very favorably reviewed by the English press, and comprehends a view of British America from lake Superior to the Pacific. After his return from England in 1860, Mr. Hind made preparations for the exploration of a portion of the Labrador peninsula, with a view to collect materials for a description of the eastern part of British America. He has recently returned from this exploration; and it is expected that his new book will appear in 1862, in the same style of illustration as the narrative of the Canadian expedition of 1857 and 1858.\n\nAmong the earliest of Mr. Hind's efforts, in print, was a pamphlet on the climate of Western Canada. This was soon followed by \"Eight Lectures on Agricultural Chemistry.\" During the years 1852-3-4-5, he edited the \"Canadian Journal,\" devoted to science and art. In 1854, he was the successful competitor for the prize of one hundred pounds, offered by the corporation of Toronto, for the best means of preserving the harbor of that city. In 1857, he wrote the prize essay on \"The insect and diseases injurious to the wheat crops.\" Among minor literary pieces attributed\nto Mr. Hind's pen are the articles in Maclear & Co's Canadian Almanac, on the \"Future of Western Canada,\" \"The Great North West,\" \"Our Railway Policy,\" as also the first issue of the government emigration pamphlet, which has been translated into several European languages, and scattered broadcast over northern Europe, and at the commencement of the present year Mr. Hind undertook the management of the \"Journal of the Board of Arts and Manufactures\" for Upper Canada, a monthly publication.\n\nMr. Hind is assuredly one of the first literary and scientific men in Canada; and his services have been very advantageous to the country. Those who enjoy his personal acquaintance, speak of him in no common terms. He is a thorough English gentleman in all things; courteous in his manners\u2014kind and considerate in his dealings. The province has been much benefitted by possessing in him a master mind, and a practical scientific scholar.\n\nREV. R. J. MACGEORGE.\n\nVery few who had the pleasure of knowing this accomplished and highly gifted gentleman, during his sojourn in Canada, will easily forget him. He is a man, \"take him all in all,\" who was exceedingly popular with all classes of the community in Upper Canada; he is endeared to their memory by many virtues. The attainments which he displayed and the writings which he published whilst in this country, exposing the popular follies, absurdities, and abuses of the time in good natured satire and ridicule, will cause his name to be long remembered. We are sure, therefore, that old \"Solomon,\" (the sobriquet, under which Mr. Macgeorge was known in Canada West) will be acknowledged as worthy of a place among Canadian celebrities.\n\nHe was born in the vicinity of Glasgow, in the year 1811; and he is consequently now fifty years of age. He is descended from an old family long settled in Galloway; they are of Irish origin, and a branch of the clan McYoris, which, in the time of Henry II., was one of the great families of Ireland; his father was the late Andrew Macgeorge, Esq., a well known and much respected solicitor of Glasgow.\n\nBeing destined for the Church of England, the subject of this notice passed through the usual curriculum of the university of Glasgow,\nand completed his studies at the university of Edinburgh. But ill health prevented him from at once taking holy orders; he was advised to travel, and accordingly went to the East Indies, and after spending some months in Bombay, he visited the Gulf of Persia, &c., and on his return he published a very interesting account of his pilgrimage in the *Scottish Literary Gazette*, then edited by Mr. Andrew Crichton, a well known religious author. Mr. Macgeorge also contributed for some time to *Fraser's Magazine*, the *Scottish Monthly Magazine* and various other periodicals. He was admitted to holy orders in 1839, by the Right Reverend Michael Russell, bishop of Glasgow and Galloway, and a distinguished Scottish author. He officiated for some time as assistant minister to the Reverend Robert Montgomery, and was also incumbent of Christ church, Glasgow. In 1841, he came to Canada, and was soon appointed to the incumbency of Trinity church, Streetsville, near Toronto, a post which he held until his return to the mother country. During the time of his occupancy of this sacred charge, he did much good for the township of Toronto and neighborhood. Church of England ministers in those days and places were \"few and far between,\" and consequently the settlement would not very often have had the benefit of a clergyman had it not been for the kindness and generosity of Mr. Macgeorge, who gave frequent services in addition to his regular Streetsville duty, at Milton, Norval, Brampton, Hurontario Church, Sydenham, Dundas Street, Port Credit, Etobicoke and Edmonton; and as we are speaking on a subject which has reference to the church in Canada, we may as well state that the poor clergymen, more especially those in the country, receive very bad treatment at the hands of those who have the paying of them. Not unfrequently, one of these poor men, with a mind fit to adorn any sphere in life, has to drudge and work like a beast of burden for a mere pittance, while he is supposed, besides, to keep a horse to carry his wearied frame from one parish or township to another. It is the old story and we suppose will always be; those who do not do the work receive the pay, and those that do, &c. We know not how Mr. Macgeorge fared with regard to being remunerated for his services; certain it is, however, that whatever he received he well earned.\n\nMany will remember the *Review* of Streetsville, while it remained under the control of Mr. Macgeorge. We really believe that at that period it was one of the most popular weekly journals in the province; its articles were genuinely original, well written, and most admirably adapted to ridicule the ruling absurdities which abounded at that time.\n\nMr. Macgeorge also edited, for several years, the *Church newspaper*, the organ of the Episcopal Church in Canada, also that well known and excellent publication, the *Anglo-American Magazine*, to which he contributed the *Chronicles of Deepdally*, the *Purser's*\nCabin,\" and the larger portion of the \"Editor's Shanty;\" he also wrote literary articles for the Globe and Leader newspapers of Toronto, and in 1858 he published his celebrated \"Tales, Lyrics and Sketches,\" which were received by much approbation, as also were several songs written by him which have been set to music. During his sojourn there he was appointed grand chaplain to the Orange Association of British North America.\n\nIt was with deep regret that the people around Toronto and of Upper Canada generally heard of his departure, on account of the ill health of his wife, for Scotland, in 1858. He, at present, resides at Oban in Argyleshire, being incumbent of the Episcopal Church in that town, one of the most beautiful spots in the Highlands of Scotland, and much frequented during the summer months by visitors from all parts of the world.\n\nMr. Macgeorge is one of nature's own children; he is a man above the ordinary height; his looks quite silvery, his form erect, inclined towards corpulency, complexion fresh, and features handsome and well formed, with a clear sparkling blue eye, flashing with intelligence and full of wit. Mr. Macgeorge is a gentleman of true genius, and though his pen seems at times to rush, in spite of the hand that wields it and the soul that moves it into the ludicrous, yet a more sober and pure-minded man than Mr. Macgeorge, we venture to say is not to be found in Canada. Though a consistent, honest churchman, as some would think, a high churchman, yet a more amiable Christian and large-minded man we have seldom met; his heart and soul are far too big for a bigot; he is, moreover, a decidedly pious man.\n\nHUGH ALLAN, Esq.\n\nThe subject of this sketch was born at Saltcoats, in the county of Ayr, Scotland, on the 29th September, 1810; and is consequently now in the fifty-first year of his age. He is the second son of the late Captain Alexander Allan, who was long and favorably known as a highly popular and successful shipmaster, trading between the Clyde and Montreal. During the thirty years he was engaged in that business, the different ships he commanded were much sought after by passengers; and many persons still living throughout the province retain to this day pleasant reminiscences of the voyages which they made across the Atlantic under his watchful care.\nBrought up almost on the verge of the ocean, and his father and two of his brothers being seafaring men, Hugh, at an early age, manifested a strong attachment to all kinds of nautical craft, and attained a considerable degree of knowledge in matters connected with them. Constantly in and about boats and ships, living almost on the water, and in the company of sailors, it was to be expected that his predilections would run in that way; and his subsequent career has been, doubtless to a large extent, influenced by his early associations.\n\nIn the year 1824, his family removed their residence to Greenock; and, in the following spring (1825) Hugh, being then fourteen years of age, was entered as a clerk, with the highly respectable firm of Allan, Kerr & Co., then an extensive and influential shipping agency house in Greenock. There he acquired some knowledge of the management of ships, and the method of keeping their accounts, and developed a strong liking for that kind of business. After he had been there about a year, his father, who was a far-seeing man, and had ulterior views for him, proposed that he should go out to Canada; and, this being in accordance with his own wishes, he at once agreed to the proposal. He sailed from Greenock, for Montreal, on the 12th April, 1826, in the brig Favorite, of which his father was then commander, and his eldest brother second officer. After an agreeable passage, diversified by the usual incidents of fogs, icebergs, and occasional strong breezes of wind, incidents always regarded as important, on first crossing the sea, the Favorite arrived at Quebec on the 15th May. She was towed from thence, by the steamboat Hercules, then the only towboat on the river; and after various delays, reached the foot of the current St. Mary. There was a strong breeze of wind down the river, and the steamer was unable to take the ship up the current. A hawser was therefore passed ashore, and attached to about a dozen pairs of oxen, (then kept for the purpose,) by whose assistance the Hercules and the Favorite surmounted the current; and the subject of this sketch landed at Montreal, for the first time, on Sunday morning, the 21st May, 1826. At that time there were no wharves built, and the vessels lay as near to the shelving beach as they could conveniently get, using long gangways, rigged on spars, as a means of communication with the shore.\n\nAfter looking about him for a few days, he obtained a situation as clerk, with the firm of William Kerr & Co., then engaged in the dry goods trade in St. Paul Street. There he remained a little more than three years, and obtained some acquaintance with goods, besides a general knowledge of mercantile business and book-keeping. The winters were chiefly spent in the country, north of Montreal, in the neighborhood of Ste. Rose and Ste. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, where he acquired a knowledge of the French language, and during\nthese years, all his spare time was occupied in improving himself in various branches of learning and knowledge. Having determined to revisit his native land for a short period, and being desirous of seeing something of the country and continent, before he left it, he obtained leave from his employers; and, on the 19th August, 1830, he left Montreal for New York. There he remained some days, and this being before the period of railroads, he returned to Albany by steamer, and proceeded in a canal boat up the Erie canal as far as Rochester, whence he went by stage-coach to Buffalo, and thence to the falls of Niagara. After remaining some days at the falls, he went round by Hamilton, then containing only a very few houses, to Toronto, whence he proceeded to Kingston by land. From Kingston he came by steamer to Prescott, and as the steamers did not then run the rapids, he came from that place to Montreal by stage-coach. He arrived at Montreal, on the 25th October, and left again on the 31st, to join his father's ship at Quebec, then ready for sea. He reached Quebec next day, but a constant succession of strong contrary winds detained the ship in Quebec, till the 21st November, on which day the Favorite sailed, in company with a large fleet of ships, which had been detained by the same cause. His father and two of his brothers were also on board the Favorite, and many of their friends remonstrated against so many of one family sailing in the same vessel, deeply laden with wheat, at so late a period of the year. However, after a boisterous and somewhat perilous voyage, they arrived safely at Greenock, on the 28th December, 1830.\n\nHugh remained quietly with his family, from that time till about the 1st March, when, being desirous of seeing something of his native country, before he returned to Canada, he set out for Liverpool, on his way to visit London, for the first time. From Liverpool he went by railway (then not long opened) to Manchester, and thence to London, by mail-coach. He remained a short time in London and returned to Scotland by the east coast, and visited Edinburgh, also for the first time.\n\nHe sailed again for Canada, on the 1st April, 1831, in the ship Canada, then on her first voyage; and after an agreeable passage, arrived in Montreal on the 1st May, the season having been unusually early.* Immediately on his arrival he received very tempting proposals to join his former employers; but having resolved to give his attention to the shipping trade, as being more suited to his taste, and in which he could be of use to other members of his family, as they might be to him, he declined the offers. Soon afterwards he obtained a situation in the house of James Millar & Co., then engaged in building and sailing ships, and as commission merchants. This was congenial employment\n\n*In that year the brigs Sophia and Chertot, regular traders, made each three voyages between Glasgow and Quebec and Montreal.\nfor him, and he devoted his whole energies to the business. He remained a clerk there till the end of the year 1835, when some changes taking place in the establishment, he was admitted a partner with Mr. Millar and Mr. Edmonstone, who had been long connected with the house. The firm then was Millar, Edmonstone & Co. The death of Mr. Millar, in 1838, caused another change, and on the 1st May, 1839, Mr. Edmonstone and Mr. Allan commenced a new partnership. That connection still exists, though other changes have taken place in the partnership since then.*\n\nIn 1839, on one of the frequent voyages which he then made to England, Mr. Allan, in company with the late Honorable Joseph Masson, Mr. G. B. Symes of Quebec, and others, embarked at New York, on the 14th December, on board of the steamship Liverpool, bound for Liverpool. This was in the early days of transatlantic steam navigation, and previous to the establishment of the Cunard line. A succession of heavy gales and contrary winds so retarded their progress, that on the 28th of the month, they were little more than half across the ocean, and still there was no appearance of any change in the weather. The chief-engineer reported on that day, that he had not coal enough left to carry the ship to Liverpool; and the steward signified that the provisions would scarcely hold out, if the passage was protracted, as it seemed likely to be. After consulting with the passengers, the Captain (Engledue) determined to run for Fayal, one of the islands of the Azores, where it was understood, a depot of coal had been provided to meet such a contingency as the present. The steamer reached Fayal on the night of the 31st December, just as the last coal was thrown on the fires. Her arrival (a steamer being then new to them) created a lively sensation on the island. The passengers, fourteen only in number, landed next day, and were most hospitably treated by the inhabitants. The Portuguese governor, the American consul, (the late Mr. Dabney) and the British consul, were particularly attentive, and a grand ball was got up for the occasion. This was followed by an entertainment on board the steamer to all the principal inhabitants; and during the four days she remained at the island, there was a constant interchange of civilities. The contrast between a stormy ocean, and the smiling orange groves and flower gardens, to most of which the passengers had free access, was indeed great; and they enjoyed it accordingly.\n\nOn the last day of their stay, Mr. Allan and Mr. Symes hired guides, and started at daylight to walk to the top of the highest mountain on the island. It is named the Caldeira, and (as the word signifies) is an extinct volcano. After a fatiguing journey,\n\n*During the two rebellions in 1837 and 1838, Mr. Allan served as a volunteer, and attained to the rank of captain in the service.\nthey reached the summit, which is about seven thousand feet above the sea; and were rewarded for their toil, by the glorious prospect around them, embracing some half-dozen of the islands with the magnificent peak of Pico, about nine thousand feet high, sending its top into the clouds seemingly quite near. It was late at night when they got back to the town, and they were glad to get on board the steamer, to rest their wearied limbs. Next morning they started for England; and, after a pleasant run of eight days, reached Liverpool. There they learned that they were supposed to be lost, as the steamer had never been heard of since she sailed from New York, thirty days before.\n\nMr. Allan returned to Montreal in the spring of 1840; and the firm continued the business of shipbuilding, Mr. E. D. Merritt being then practical overseer of that branch. In the year 1841, they were employed by the then governor-general, the late Lord Sydenham, to build a steam frigate, which bore his name. They also built in that year, a small screw steamer for the government, called the Union, being one of the earliest attempts at that description of vessel in the province. Next year, besides two sailing ships, they built a tow boat for the river, called the Alliance, and several barges to lighten ships up and down the river. The Alliance was one of the best and most powerful tugboats that has ever been on the St. Lawrence.\n\nThey soon after discontinued shipbuilding; and for some years contented themselves with the management of their ships, and such other business as was entrusted to them; till about the year 1851, when the successful establishment of screw steamers on the Atlantic elicited proposals for a line to the river St. Lawrence. Mr. Allan took up the matter with much interest, and entered into correspondence with various parties on the subject, which resulted in his making an offer to a leading member of the government, then in office in this province, to establish such a line. The government, however, preferred giving the contract to parties in Great Britain; because, no doubt, they were supposed to be better able to carry it out. It was consequently given to Messrs. McKeon, McLarty & Co., of Glasgow. After a trial of about a year and a half, these parties failed to give satisfaction; and the government again threw the contract open to competition.\n\nMr. Allan once more took up the matter warmly; and through the influence of the Honorable John Ross, the Honorable G. E. Cartier, the Honorable L. T. Drummond, and others, a contract was given to him. He had already, with his brothers and business connections, built the steamships Canadian and Indian, which were then profitably employed in the service of the home government in the Black Sea, during the Crimean war; and he proceeded at once to England, and contracted for two others, the North American and Anglo-Saxon. With these four steamships the line\nwas commenced in the spring of the year 1856. The service was fortnightly to and from the St. Lawrence, during open navigation, and monthly to and from Portland, during winter. The performances of the steamers were exceedingly satisfactory; and, though not at first attended with much profit, the line was successfully conducted.\n\nIn the year 1857, the public began to ask for more frequent communication, and soon after, the question was taken up by the government. It was ultimately determined that the service should be increased to a weekly steamer from each side during the whole year; and, after some negociation, the government arranged with Mr. Allan for the establishment of the increased service. He lost no time in proceeding to England, and contracted for the building of four additional steamers of enlarged size, and on the 1st May, 1859, the weekly service was commenced, and has ever since been continued.\n\nIn addition to the mail contract line of steamers sailing from Liverpool, Mr. Allan with his brothers and connections, has also established a line from Glasgow; and the additional facilities, thus given, will no doubt still further be increased. Besides the lines of steamships to Liverpool and Glasgow, now ten in number, Mr. Allan and his friends own a large fleet of sailing ships; and it is creditable to the province, that, even in Britain, there are not very many persons or firms more largely engaged in shipping, than that here referred to.\n\nThere are few public enterprises of any kind in this province, in which Mr. Allan has not been engaged, either as a director or a shareholder. He has shewn himself to be one of our most enterprising and public spirited men, and a credit and honor to the country in which his conceptions have been chiefly carried out. Mr. Allan was married, on the 13th September, 1844, to Matilda, second daughter of John Smith, Esquire, of Montreal, and by her he has eight surviving children.\n\nCHAS. SMALLWOOD, Esq., M.D., LL.D.\n\nDoctor Smallwood has entitled himself to rank among the most eminently scientific men which this province possesses. During the short time he has resided in Canada, he has contributed much to advance the branch of science to which he has\nchiefly devoted so much of his valuable professional time and private means.\n\nHe is an Englishman, having been born in the town of Birmingham, in the year 1812; where he pursued his studies, graduated at University college, and (we believe) obtained his medical degree. He came to Canada in the year 1853; and in 1854, he settled at St. Martin, Isle Jesus, C.E., where he acquired a large practice as a medical practitioner, and soon after established his meteorological and electrical observatory, a description of which is given in the Smithsonian Reports.\n\nHe discovered the effects of atmospheric electricity on the formation of the snow crystal, and instituted extensive investigations on ozone in connection with light, electricity and the effects of germination of seeds, on its development and effects in disease.\n\nIn 1858, Dr. Smallwood received the honorary degree of LL.D., from the McGill college, and was appointed professor of meteorology in that university. In 1860, he obtained through the liberality of the Canadian government, a small grant for the purchase of magnetic instruments, which were duly received, and observations were commenced on the 3rd of August, 1861.\n\nDr. Smallwood has contributed largely to the various scientific periodicals, not only in this country, but also in the United States and in Europe. He is likewise the author of \"Contributions to Canadian Meteorology.\" The object of the whole of these observations have always been directed to practical utility, with reference to medical science, and to the health of mankind. They have been written during the brief intervals which he could snatch from a very active and laborious professional life, and therefore are the more valuable and interesting.\n\nDr. Smallwood is also one of the governors of the college of physicians and surgeons of Lower Canada, honorary member of the British Meteorological Society, of the Montreal Natural History Society, of the Literary and Historical Society of Quebec, member of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 M\u00e9t\u00e9orologique de France, of the National Institute of the United States, corresponding member of the Academy of Natural Science of Philadelphia, of the Observatoire Physique Central of St. Petersburg, and of the Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Sciences des Lettres des Beaux Arts of Belgium.\nJ. C. TACHE, Esq., M.D.\n\nThe name of Tach\u00e9 is well known in Canada, and anything in the way of eulogizing it would be superfluous.\n\nMr. Tach\u00e9, the subject of this brief sketch, may be considered as one of the cleverest men that the province has produced. He was born at Kamouraska (one of the lower parishes) in 1821; and, when quite a youth, entered the Quebec seminary, where he was educated. He subsequently studied medicine, passed the necessary examination, and received the large but arduous practice of the Marine Hospital, Quebec, as a recognition of his skill. But, from what we can learn, young Tach\u00e9 was of too active a temperament to settle down to the life of a hospital dissector, without regard to personal advancement or emolument. He aspired to higher things; and, in 1844, left the field of his labors for that of the stormy sea of politics; he settled at a place nearer his native home, Rimouski, where, after continuing for some time in practice, he was unanimously returned to Parliament in 1847, and again by acclamation in 1851. Shortly after, in 1853, he was made a member of the Board of Agriculture for Lower Canada. After the passing of the act to increase the representation of the province in Parliament, Dr. Tach\u00e9 was asked by the counties of Temiscouata and Rimouski to become their representative. He selected his old county, where he was residing, and accordingly was again elected, after a contest, for the third time, in 1854.\n\nWhen the universal exhibition was held at Paris in 1855, Dr. Tach\u00e9 was deputed to proceed to that city as one of our commissioners. The object in sending him, and the success with which his exertions were crowned, are things too well known to require any comment at our hands. His able report, published at Paris during his sojourn there, and in Canada on his return, by order of the legislature, will give all information to any persons desirous of becoming acquainted with the success of the Canadian portion of the exhibition, and the prominent manner in which Canadian produce and manufactures were brought before the French people, who so fully appreciated his merits, that he was created a knight of the Legion of Honor by the emperor of the French.\n\nIn the year 1857, he resigned his seat in Parliament, where he had taken an active part in all the leading questions of the day, to accept the editorship of Le Courrier du Canada, then just started, and managed this new journal with marked ability, until he was appointed to the office of one of the prison inspectors in 1859.\nDr. Tach\u00e9, in 1860, was appointed to the chair of physiology at the Laval university. He is the author of different pamphlets and books, amongst others:\u2014\u201cLe peuple et ses besoins,\u201d \u201cL\u2019hermite Bonsens,\u201d \u201cRapport sur l\u2019agriculture du Bas-Canada,\u201d \u201cRapport sur le pilotage dans le bas Saint Laurent,\u201d \u201cM\u00e9moire sur les am\u00e9liorations dans le bas du fleuve,\u201d \u201cEsquise sur le Canada,\u201d \u201cLe Canada et l\u2019exposition universelle,\u201d \u201cDes provinces de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique du Nord et une union f\u00e9d\u00e9rale,\u201d \u201cNotice sur l\u2019universit\u00e9 Laval,\u201d \u201cRapport pr\u00e9liminaire des inspecteurs des asiles L. C.\u201d \u201cTrois l\u00e9gendes de mon pays.\u201d\n\nRIGHT HON. VISCOUNT BURY, M.P.\n\nLord Viscount Bury is the only son of the Earl of Albemarle, and was born in London, in 1832. In his youth he was an officer in the Scots Fusileer Guards, and served in India as aide-de-camp to Lord Frederic Fitzclarence; he returned to England on sick leave, and not caring to remain longer in the military profession, left the army in 1854, and devoted himself to political life. At one time he was private secretary to Lord John Russell, when premier. In December, 1854, he first came to Canada, having been appointed civil secretary and superintendent of Indian affairs, a post which he held for a few years; and he devoted himself to studying the Indian life and character, and did much in his official capacity to forward their condition; the chiefs and the Indians themselves thereby became much attached to him, and he was made chief of three Indian tribes. During the short time he remained in this country he took a great interest in its history and affairs, and made himself thoroughly acquainted with its wants; he saw much of the country and therefore became well informed with regard to its geographical bearings and its vast and valuable resources. He was first returned to the Imperial Parliament at the general election of 1857, for the borough of Norwich, after one of the sharpest contests ever witnessed in England. In Parliament he was very successful; he took up the question of legalizing \u201cmarriage with the sister of a deceased wife,\u201d and was mainly instrumental in its successful passage through the House of Commons by a large majority, although it had been unsuccessfully argued for twenty years before that assembly. Afterwards, in conjunction with Mr. Roebuck, he brought the important question of the Hudson\u2019s Bay Territory before the House of Commons so successfully as to elicit the very highest encomiums of Mr. Gladstone, Lord John Russell,\nSir E. B. Lytton, and in fact of almost the entire house. The British press, in reviewing that session of Parliament, unanimously expressed their opinion that Lord Bury was undoubtedly the most able new member returned to the house at the general election. He is also identified as the originator of the Canadian peerage scheme. In 1858, he came to America a second time for the purpose of pushing forward the interests of the Galway Steamship Company, and of establishing the terms upon which the intercolonial railway could be carried out. On this occasion he received a series of ovations in the form of public dinners, &c., throughout the country. Had he succeeded in enlisting the sympathies of Canadians in favor of the former scheme, he would have obtained the establishment of a weekly line of steamers from Ireland to Canada. In June, 1859, he was appointed to the responsible office of treasurer to the Queen's household, which he still continues to occupy. On his appointment thereto he was defeated in his election for Norwich, but, a short time afterwards, he was returned for Wick. He is a thorough and hard-working practical man; he never tackles a subject which he does not completely master. His prospects at home from his birth, position, abilities, and energy are most promising; and the day, perhaps, is not far distant when he will be entrusted with some high office commensurate with his great talents. In a speech delivered in Parliament by Lord Bury, on the Hudson's Bay question, he paid the highest compliment ever paid to Americans on the floor of the House of Commons, in relation to their school system and the general diffusion of knowledge among their youth. He married in 1855, Sophia Mary, second daughter of the Honorable Colonel Sir Allan N. MacNab, Bart, of Dundurn Castle, Hamilton, C. W., and for some time premier in the government of Canada.\n\n---\n\nHon. LOUIS S. MORIN,\n\nSolicitor-General East.\n\nMr. Morin was born at Lavaltrie, in the county of Berthier, on the north shore of the St. Lawrence, on the 21st of January, 1832. He entered L'Assomption college in 1842, where he followed the ordinary course of education in that institution until July, 1849; he commenced the study of the law in 1850, in the\noffice of Messrs. Cherrier, Dorion & Dorion, of Montreal; also followed a course of lectures under the late Hon. D. B. Viger, and on the 7th of February, 1853, was admitted to the bar, and highly complimented for his creditable examination by the late T. Peltier, Esquire, battonier of the bar of the Montreal district. The deceased gentleman, it is said, used these words in conclusion on addressing M. Morin: \"I hope, with the talents which providence has bestowed upon you, you will not fail to do honor to your country.\" M. Morin early took an interest in politics, and at the general election of 1854, he was solicited to run for the county of L'Assomption, but was defeated. A vacancy having occurred during the same Parliament for the county of Terrebonne, adjoining L'Assomption, Mr. Morin presented himself, and was returned by acclamation, but scarcely was his election concluded when Parliament was dissolved; this happened in 1857. When the next general election took place, M. Morin again became a candidate for the same constituency, and was again unanimously elected. When the new Parliament met in February, 1858, a high honor awaited M. Morin in his being selected from the whole batch of newly returned members to move the reply to the speech from the throne. During that session and the succeeding, he took an active part in all the proceedings of the house, and being an excellent speaker and possessed of rare talents for a young member, he exercised considerable influence in the Assembly. Previously to this he was connected with the La Patrie newspaper, the first French journal started on the daily principle in Canada, and edited by some of the cleverest writers among the Franco Canadian portion of the community.\n\nIn January, 1860, M. Morin was appointed to the vacant solicitor-generalship for Lower Canada, with a seat in the cabinet. The political world was somewhat surprised to hear of this appointment; M. Morin being in the opinion of many too young for an executive councillor and Queen's counsel, so that members of the other party raised various objections, all of which were either satisfactorily answered or successfully overcome. The honorable gentleman has proved that, notwithstanding his age, he was none the less fitting and capable of sustaining the duties of his appointment. When we add that he is as brave as he is talented, we have said sufficient. In the recent general election he was defeated in Terrebonne, but returned for Laval by a large majority.\nHon. Sir ETIENNE P. TACH\u00c9, M.L.C.,\nAIDE-DE-CAMP TO THE QUEEN.\n\nThe next important personage, whose career we have to chronicle, is Sir E. P. Tach\u00e9; it has been one of remarkable brilliancy, well earned and dearly bought by long years of toil, assiduous and patient attention to the duties of the several important offices he has held in the service of his country.\n\nEtienne Paschal Tach\u00e9 was born at St. Thomas, C.E., in the year 1795, and is descended from an ancient French family, the members of which, from time to time, have distinguished themselves both under French and English sway. Having received the usual education given by the French gentry of Lower Canada to their children, he does not appear to have had any distinct or settled purpose as to what was to be his avocation in life. The war of 1812 breaking out, these surmises, if surmises they may be called, were dismissed; and young Tach\u00e9 entered the incorporated militia of Lower Canada, as an ensign in the 5th battalion, and along with others, went boldly to the frontier to defend his country against aggression. He was subsequently during the war promoted to a lieutenancy in the Canadian Chasseurs, and with them served against the enemy in several engagements, which reflected great credit and honor on that corps.\n\nAt the termination of the war, Sir Etienne studied medicine, and practised in that profession with great success, until 1841, when he was delegated by his fellow-citizens to represent them in Parliament. His rise henceforward was exceedingly rapid. Scarcely had he been in the Assembly six years, when he was appointed, being a military man, to the important office of deputy-adjudant-general, which he held until March, 1848, when he entered the ministry of Sir L. H. Lafontaine and Baldwin, as commissioner of public works, in which office he continued until the retirement of the Honorable L. M. Viger, in December, 1849, from the receiver-generalship, when he was elevated to that office, which he left only to become speaker of the Legislative Council, on the 21st April, 1856, (having previously been made a member of that body) and at the same time his excellency the governor-general (Sir Edmund W. Head), thought proper, as a mark of confidence, and as a reward for long service to place Sir Etienne at the head of the administration of the province. This was on the retirement of Sir Allan MacNab from that capacity. Colonel Tache's administration was a consistent one, and composed of some of the best men of the\nprovince. For instance, Mr. J. A. Macdonald was attorney-general, west, a post he continues to occupy. Mr. Cartier was attorney-general, east, having been raised from the provincial secretaryship. Mr. R. Spence was postmaster-general. Mr. Cauchon, commissioner of crown lands, a post he filled with the greatest advantage; to the province and last though not least, Mr. Vankoughnet was brought in and made president of the council, and minister of agriculture. Against these gentlemen not a shadow of a doubt as to their honesty and fitness for the posts they occupied so ably could be raised by the opposition party, although parties vainly strove to do so. We may give the gallant colonel the greatest praise for the admirable manner in which he conducted the affairs of the country during the short time he was at the helm of the ship of state. It was at this time that Mr. John A. Macdonald took his place in the Assembly as the leader of his party, a post he is eminently fitted for. Sir Etienne himself conducted the government business in the upper house, and gave the greatest satisfaction. As to the manner in which the financial arrangements of the government were carried out, we cannot be so explicit as we are on other particulars; but at any rate it was not the fault of the head of the administration, for he always paid a rigid regard to economy, and endeavored to conduct the affairs of the province with as little expense as possible. For instance, when in June, 1857, M. Cauchon resigned his seat in the cabinet as commissioner of crown lands, Sir Etienne would not put a useless expense on the country, by calling in one of his friends and placing him in the vacant place. Not having many duties to perform as the speaker of the upper house, except during the session of Parliament, he himself took M. Cauchon's place, and performed the duties of the two offices for the one salary, although he could, had he wished, have obtained both. These onerous duties the gallant knight sustained until the month of November following, when it pleased his excellency the governor-general to allow him to resign his high offices, and retire from public life, after as he said in the house, \"a long and lengthened period in the service of my country, I wish to retire to the bosom of my family from the cares attendant on public life.\" In November, 1858, as a recognition of his distinguished services to his country, it pleased her Majesty the Queen to confer the honor of knighthood upon him by her own hands.\u2014Sir Etienne being on this occasion invited to Windsor castle; and in July, 1860, he was appointed, jointly with Sir A. N. MacNab, to the honorary rank of colonel in the British army, and aide-de-camp to her Majesty the Queen, and as such, formed a portion of the suite of his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, on his late tour through Canada.\n\nAs a Canadian, few have attained the honors he has had conferred upon him, and certainly none are more justly entitled to them.\nJOHN RAE, Esq., M.D., M.R.G.S.\n\nThis distinguished man, being necessarily much connected with Canadian interests, we append a slight sketch of his remarkable life, and the high services which he rendered the country. We regret that we cannot devote more space to so interesting and eminent a subject.\n\nDoctor Rae was born in the Orkneys; and after studying at Edinburgh, took a surgeon's diploma there, and entered the service of the Hudson's Bay Company as a surgeon, in 1833. He spent ten years at or near Moose Factory, where he acquired all information concerning the country within his reach, the manner of living, travelling, habits, &c. He even entered into the most minute details, \"in fact accomplishments (as he himself says) which are in most cases considered rather disadvantageous than otherwise to the possessor, but which, under the circumstances in which I was subsequently placed, were of very great value to me and to those under my command.\"\n\nHe travelled to a great extent over the country, and from an estimate made of his several journeys, it appears that the number of miles on land and water amounted to 18,255 miles. His first hard journey was when he had to travel on snow-shoes from Red River to Sault Ste. Marie, in the winter of 1844-45, a distance of nearly twelve hundred miles, occupying two months' time, for the purpose of receiving instructions in astronomy and other useful arts. Subsequently, he visited the Arctic sea, in the years 1846-47, being absent about fifteen months, having passed the winter in a stone house at Repulse Bay, without fuel of any description. In this expedition he traced about 655 statute miles of new land and coast, forming the shores of Committee Bay. In 1848, he accompanied Sir John Richardson in a search for Sir John Franklin's party, along the coast from the McKenzie river to the Coppermine, wintered at Fort Confidence, and in 1849 descended the Coppermine.\n\nDuring the winter of 1849-50, he was entrusted with the charge of the McKenzie river district; and in 1850 was appointed by the Hudson's Bay Company, at the desire of the government, to take charge of an expedition in search of Sir John Franklin. His only instructions were, that he was to select any route he pleased, or thought most advantageous. He chose the route by Great Bear Lake and the Coppermine. Of the results of this expedition, most persons interested in such matters are without doubt well aware: A journey on snow and ice over 1,080 statute miles; a boat voyage\ngoing and returning, along the Arctic coast, of 1,390 statute miles; the tracing and laying down correctly six hundred and thirty miles of previously unexplored coast, along the southern shores of Victoria and Wollaston lands; and the finding of two pieces of wood, in all probability parts of one of Sir John Franklin's vessels. The time occupied, exclusive of five day's detention by bad weather, &c., was 89 days, which gave an average distance per day of 27\u00bd statute miles. This was the most quickly performed of any Arctic journey on record. Dr. Rae visited England in 1851-52, travelling on snow-shoes from Athabasca to St. Paul's, a distance of 1,780 statute miles.\n\nIn 1858, he again proceeded to Repulse Bay, for the purpose of completing the survey of coast on the west side of Boothia; and he passed the winters of 1853-'54 in snow-huts at Repulse Bay. During this expedition, he discovered a new river, which falls into Chesterfield inlet; and two hundred and seventy miles of previously unexplored land and coast line were added to the charts.\n\nIt was during the succeeding spring that he most highly distinguished himself, and brought his name with \u00e9clat before the world, as the first discoverer of the fate of Sir John Franklin's party. He had travelled eleven hundred miles, including a preliminary journey, when he made this valuable discovery, for which he received the government reward of \u00a310,000 sterling, and was well received by the Queen and government at home.\n\nDr. Rae makes an explanation in a pamphlet published in London, relative to his conduct in not at once proceeding westward, when he received the information from the Esquimaux that a party of whites had starved some years before in that direction. The information which he received, on his outward journey was not sufficiently clear to enable him to fix upon the exact spot where it was stated the men had starved; and to have travelled westward without that knowledge, when the land was covered a foot and a half with snow, would have been sheer madness. On his return to Repulse Bay in May, he learned from the natives the information he wanted; but then it was too late that season, for in the months of June and July, it is all but impossible to travel across that country, owing in a great measure to the melting of the snows whereby the lowlands are completely flooded, and every little stream is converted into a torrent; so that there is no crossing, not even with Halley's admirable little boats. Dr. Rae wisely forebore running the risk of crossing; and indeed, had he proceeded any way, it would have been but time thrown away, so he returned to give all the information he had gained, and to stay further expeditions.\n\nThe many voyages and journeys which Dr. Rae made, were invariably accompanied by hardships and privations of an alarming\ncharacter. On these occasions his wonderful firmness of character would sustain his men, and enable them to endure fresh dangers, disappointments and severe privations, while his extensive knowledge would come in opportunely to ensure the success of his undertakings, in which he never failed.\n\nFor his meritorious and distinguished services, there was awarded to him in 1852, the founder's gold medal of the Royal Geographical Society of London; and an honorary diploma of M.D. was granted to him by McGill college, Montreal; and he was also elected an honorary member of the Natural History Society of the same city, as well as of several high and learned bodies in London.\n\nHe is now on an expedition to visit Red River; the Saskatchewan and the Rocky Mountains. Our earnest desire is that he may add fresh laurels and honors to those which he has already won, and so worthily wears.\n\n---\n\nMR. CHARLES SANGSTER,\n\nTHE POET.\n\nIn the present age, when almost every person who claims to have received an ordinary education, attempts to write poetry, anything like real poetry is duly appreciated. We in Canada are unfortunate enough not to have had many persons entitled to the distinction of being marked as poets, though possessing every facility that a grand and romantic scenic country presents, capable of exciting the proper inspiration and spirit of poetry. One might imagine under such circumstances there would have been more successful aspirants for the honor. As our object is simply and purely biographical, we will refrain from passing any additional remarks on our readers, merely stating that the gentleman whose name heads this notice stands in the first rank of our Canadian poets.\n\nCharles Sangster, a name until recently unknown, is a British Canadian. His family came from the lower provinces; he himself was born in Canada, at the Navy-Yard, Kingston, on the 16th July, 1822. His education was meagre, so much so, indeed, that had he not studied zealously when he reached man's estate, we could not probably now have included his name among our Canadian celebrities. His was a hard struggle; left fatherless, the youngest of a large family, with a widowed mother to support, he strove, for a length of time, to push himself forward. But all to\nlittle purpose; instead of receiving encouragement he only met with repulse. He was but fifteen years of age when he first got employment in the laboratory at Fort Henry, where he helped to make the cartridges with which Captain Sandom of the royal navy battered the old windmill at Prescott; after this he obtained an appointment as messenger in the Ordnance office, where he remained for ten years, receiving the pay of a laborer, doing the duty of a clerk, and without any possible chance of promotion. This is too frequently the case in public departments; the favored ones, who have interest at court, come in for all the promotion. At length, seeing how futile it was to pass away the best years of his life in so hopeless a position, Mr. Sangster gave up his situation in the summer of 1849, and went to Amherstburg, where he was offered the editorship of the Courier of that town, and he continued to conduct that journal until the death of its publisher, towards the end of that year. He then returned to Kingston, and has been ever since connected with the press of that city. Our readers will perceive that his career has not been remarkably brilliant, at least not so much so as his talents and endowments might warrant us to expect. He has, for a length of time, contributed poetic effusions to the Canadian press; and has, besides numerous other poems, brought out two books of great promise, \"The St. Lawrence and the Saguenay\" and \"Hesperus and other Poems.\" So well were these received that the press both of America and Europe passed rich encomiums on them and their gifted author; indeed some critic went so far as to say that he could rank with the celebrated poets of the old world. Let us hope that Mr. Sangster's talents will meet with their reward. Mr. Sangster may justly be regarded as our national bard, and Canadians may feel proud in possessing such a man, who writes not for lucre, but for love of his country, possessing a deep regard for everything essentially British, and is evidently inspired with kindly and commendable feelings. Some passages in his poems are beautiful and lofty, rich and grand in expression, honorable alike to his head and heart.\n\nHaving in view the object of benefitting his fellow man, and raising him from a state of stupor to a just appreciation of the beauties of nature, he may rest satisfied with the consideration that such a life, devoted to such pursuits, is not altogether thrown away, or unfitly employed. The following song, composed since the commencement of the American war, may be presented as a fair specimen of Mr. Sangster's lyrical powers and loyal sentiments:\nSONG FOR CANADA.\n\nSons of the race whose sires\nAroused the martial flame\nThat filled with smiles\nThe triune isles,\nThrough all their heights of fame!\nWith hearts as brave as theirs,\nWith hopes as strong and high,\nWe'll ne'er disgrace\nThe honored race\nWhose deeds can never die.\n\nLet but the rash intruder dare\nTo touch our darling strand:\nThe martial fires\nThat thrilled our sires\nWould flame throughout the land.\n\nOur lakes are deep and wide,\nOur fields and forests broad;\nWith cheerful air\nWe'll speed the share,\nAnd break the fruitful sod;\nTill blest with rural peace,\nProud of our rustic toil,\nOn hill and plain\nTrue kings we'll reign,\nThe victors of the soil.\nBut let the rash intruder dare, &c.\n\nHealth smiles with rosy face\nAmid our sunny dales,\nAnd torrents strong\nFling hymn and song\nThrough all the mossy vales;\nOur sons are living men,\nOur daughters fond and fair;\nA thousand isles,\nWhere Plenty smiles,\nMake glad the brow of Care.\nBut let the rash intruder dare, &c.\n\nAnd if in future years\nOne wretch should turn and fly,\nLet weeping Fame\nBlot out his name\nFrom Freedom's hallowed sky;\nOr should our sons o'er prove\nA coward, traitor race,\u2014\nJust heaven! frown\nIn thunder down,\nT' avenge the foul disgrace!\nBut let the rash intruder dare\nTo touch our darling strand:\nThe martial fires\nThat thrilled our sires\nWould light him from the land.\nThe London (England) National Magazine says of Mr. Sangster, and \"The St. Lawrence and the Saguenay\": \"Well may the Canadians be proud of such contribution to their native literature; well may they be forward to recognize his lively imagination, his descriptive powers, his ardent love for the beautiful and the good, his never failing charity, his reverence of the god-like, his adoration of the true, his bold, masterly style, and the fullness of his imagery. In some sort, and according to his degree, Mr. Sangster, may be regarded as the Wordsworth of Canada. The passionate sentiment hovers over every object, and forms, indeed, the atmosphere in which it lives\u2014all breathes of it, languishes with it, dies of it, 'like a rose in aromatic pain.'\" The late Thomas Macqueen, in an article on \"The Poets of Canada,\" after speaking of Alexander McLaughlin, says: \"Charles Sangster is a poet of a different order. He has adopted far loftier models, and struck the lyre on a much higher key. His whole soul seems steeped in love and poesy, and finds utterance in expression, generally eloquent, bold and musical. He is thoroughly sentimental, teeming with ideas of the sublime and beautiful, and his poetry bears evident marks of enthusiastic poetical conception. Mr. Sangster is a poet of no mean order, and his volume is by far the most respectable contribution of poetry that has yet been made to the infant literature of Canada.\" The Rev. J. Macgeorge, the renowned \"Solomon\" of the Streetsville Review, writes: \"Among the very few bards which Canada has yet produced, Mr. Sangster occupies the very first rank, and he will occupy a prominent position in the literary annals of the province.\"\n\nMrs. Susanna Moodie is equally flattering in her commendations, and says: \"If a native of Canada, she may well be proud of her bard, who has sung in such lofty strains the natural beauties of his native land.\" And the press of the country, with but one solitary exception, has accorded him a position second to none in Canada, in the critical department of literature in which he has embarked. The Ottawa Times remarks: \"These poems are written in a bold masterly style, are full of imagery, displaying ability of no ordinary kind. Mr. Sangster is a poet, in the true sense of the term, and leads his readers in burning language of inspiration from Nature up to Nature's God.\"\n\nThe Kingston Commercial Advertiser says: \"He who wrote 'A Poet's Love' has a poet's pinions, and can soar to the loftiest peaks of Parnassus. Mr. Sangster possesses poetical talent in a high degree; we find that he is schooled in that grand lesson\u2014love and reverence for that which is beneath us; love and reverence for that which is around us; love and reverence for that which is above us. And this love and this reverence permeates every thought in his poetry. In the wild and tumultuous heavings of the great heart social, he hears only the ancestral voices prophesying a clearer day-dawn\u2014little though he writes on\nmen and manners. This reverence of the god-like, this love of the beautiful, this adoration of the true, commend his first breathings in the world of authorship to every right-thinker.\u201d We might go on and quote page after page of notices equally as favorable as these. The leading poem in Mr. Sangster\u2019s first volume has recently been entirely re-written, and when the public again have an opportunity of perusing it in its more perfect form, it will be seen that the legendary and the historical have not been forgotten. Here is a portion of the description of the grand Rapids of the Lachine:\n\n\u201cWith whirl sublime, and with what maelstrom force,\nThe awful waters strike our plunging bark!\nThe rage defiant, and the thund\u2019ring hoarse,\nThese bring no terror to our little ark,\nThat sweeps securely to its distant mark.\nSee how the tortured deep heap surge on surge!\nWhat howling billows sweep the waters dark!\nStunning the ear with their stentorian dirge,\nThat loudens as they strike the rocks\u2019 resisting verge.\n\nTo what shall we compare thee? thing of dread!\nA nameless Terror?\u2014How much more art thou!\nThe awful Champion, Autocrat and head,\nThe mighty wrestler, to whom all must bow\nAlong the watery pass. O, stern of brow,\nAs Lucifer amid his cowering crew!\nHow like a scourge, a mad Attila, now\nHe charges with his Hun-like retinue,\nThe flying Lombard waves to vanquish and subdue.\n\nThe danger is so great we know it not;\nAnd yet we dare to thread the narrow way,\nCutting a passage through the Gordian knot\nOf reefs and breakers, as the vast array\nHere bursts in dazzling showers of diamond spray,\nHere bids defiance to all human skill,\nLifting up bold Titania busts of gray,\nAs if to awe the mind or shake the will,\nPursuing us like Fates adown the tumbling hill.\n\nO, awful Shape! that haunts the wild abyss,\nThat hold\u2019st thy Reign of Terror evermore,\nWhat grave offence, what unforgiven schism\nConsigned thee hence from Hell\u2019s remotest shore?\nWhy troublest thou the waters with thy roar?\nNo angel footstep thine, of rest or peace,\nBut some lost soul\u2019s, for whom no open door\nLeadeth to where thy spirit tells shall cease,\nWith no commissioned arm stretched forth for thy release!\n\nThe waves of two vast streams fall down to thee,\nAnd worship at thy feet. The pilgrim bands\nIn untold legions rush to bend the knee,\nAll victims to the Dragon, that demands\nIts multitudes, as countless as the sands,\nAnd ope\u2019s its jaws for more. So Error keeps\nHigh jubilee through all earth\u2019s blessed lands,\nAbove which evermore sweet Pity weeps,\nTo see the blinded fools embracing death by heaps.\u201d\nAnd we have passed the terrible Lachine:\nHave felt a fearless tremor nerve the soul,\nAs the huge waves uproared their crests of green,\nHolding our feathery bark in their control,\nAs a strong eagle holds an oriole.\nThe brain grows dizzy, with the whirr and hiss\nOf the fast-overflowing billows, as they roll,\nLike struggling demons, to the vexed abyss,\nLashing the tortured crags with wild, demoniac bliss.\"\n\nIn noticing Mr. Sangster, we cannot confine ourselves to a mere biographical sketch; as our national poet, he deserves more, and we freely accord it to him. Coming to his new volume, \"Hesperus and other Poems, and Lyrics,\" we might again quote whole pages of commendation. So far as the European reviews have come to hand, they are as flattering as could possibly be expected. The London Athen\u00e6um, which is down on everything American, and who could naturally expect very little excellence to come out of Canada, or any other of the colonial Nazareths, has a favorable critique, and does not, according to its usual custom, demolish the volume for mere recreation. The London Saturday Analyst and Leader says: \"Western Canada boasts of a new poet who has delighted to sing of the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay, and who, in the spirit of Wordsworth, has communed with the genius of the lofty hills and mighty waters in the presence in which he has lived, and derived from them an intelligence which has blended with his own, reconciling his heart and mind, or rather identifying them with the character of the scene.\" And now, with his credentials accumulated and ratified, he comes forth again, attired in his singing robes, and calls on the world admiringly to listen. His new volume is one of exceeding beauty. It is almost entirely lyrical. In 'Hesperus, a Legend of the Stars,' he soars bravely; but he is not always intelligible. Nor does he appear to conceive it possible to be. Perhaps there is too much of subtle word-weaving in these initial poems: their spirit, however, cannot be too highly commended. There is a charming Tennysonian lyric, entitled, 'Marilene,' whose bridal is celebrated with appropriate sweetness. A cantata, 'The Happy Harvesters,' supplies some capital rustic songs and ballads. We have then a true Canadian chant on 'The Falls of Chaudi\u00e8re,' Ottawa. The lyrics welcoming the Prince of Wales are right hearty compositions. The poems, however, to which we would attract most attention, are those forming a series under the title of 'Into the Silent Land.' They are, indeed, tenderly pathetic.\"\n\nThe following is from the Glasgow Commonwealth: \"In his volume there is an undoubted facility, while there is a great variety of versification. There is much sincere appreciation of the beauties of poetical phraseology, best descriptive of mountains, forests, lakes, rivers, moonlight nights, and starry skies, and the fanciful influence...\"\nwhich the picturesque holds over the mind, to which a kind of character, even charm of freshness, is given by the introduction occasionally of Canadian names of scenes and localities. There is also some fair thinking, and that amount of dreamy speculation on the life to come, and the things pertaining thereto, for which we have all a relish, and which goes so far to the making a book of modern poetry readable. Indeed, it could scarcely be a book of modern poetry without this ingredient, while a commendable spirit of religion, moreover, pervades the whole. Besides such poets as Coventry Patmore and Charles Mackay, he may claim a place without any presumption. There are several lyrics quite up to the mark of any of the doctor's. In proof of this compliment, we may quote the worthy 'Song for Canada,' the spirited song of 'The Snows,' and the light-hearted, happy song, entitled 'Clara and I,' which has attraction and felicitous buoyancy. As specimens of the author's decided success, the highly-thoughted, and truly original poem called 'The Mystery,' and the devotional lay, very beautiful, named 'My Prayer,' may be particularized. 'England's Hope and England's Heir,' also quite redeems a twaddling class of ballatrics, remarkable for little else, with but few rare exceptions, save fulsome adulation and false prediction.\"\n\nThe New York Albion speaks of having predicted Mr. Sangster's certain success, in a review of his first volume, and continues: \"He is fairly entitled to a place upon Parnassus Hill. He seems to live and breathe mainly in a spiritual atmosphere, yet it would be injustice to suppose that Mr. Sangster affects to be above, or even to keep himself aloof from, his fellow men. By no means, love as we poor mortals know it, is his frequent theme. The domestic affections prompt him oft. In rural life he revels. His patriotism glows, from contact with local associations and specific events. He can look upon the Apocalypse with unshrinking gaze; but, he has an eye for the daisy under his foot. 'Colin' is full of sound stuff and exalted philosophy, while as a mere lyrical composition, it strikes us as fine in the extreme. The wail for the dead is a significant sermon for the living. To the faithful few, we commend this comparatively unknown lyrist, and shall be glad indeed if what we have said and quoted, should aid in giving him his proper rank.\" In fine, the Albion's notice abounds with graceful compliments, only a tithe of the most striking of which we can afford to quote.\n\nIn Canada, very few notices of this volume have appeared, and the majority of these are mere notices. The Kingston News says: \"The easy grace and exquisite finish of some of his lyrics, would be creditable to the genius of Moore. Worthy of a high place in the esteem of every Anglo-Canadian, is the 'Death of Wolfe.' The poem written on the occasion of the inauguration of the new monument to Brock, is excellent. More than his first\nwork, 'Hesperus,' commends itself to the people. It is more fully the work of a Canadian. Our scenery is viewed and described with true homely feeling; our history when alluded to, sways his lyre with the same breeze that stirs the maple leaf, and though national enough to love the country which has stamped its dialect on his name, he does not carry us from Couchiching to Loch Lomond, or from the Laurentian Hills to the Conemara mountains. Much of excellence as there is in the songs of other poets in this country, we know of none so well worthy of being enshrined in the heart of any man who loves his home on our soil, as those of the volume before us.\" The Montreal Transcript says: \"We have one worthy of the name of poet amongst us. His genius is not so prolific as that of the author of 'Saul,' and 'Count Filippo'; but, his taste is far more refined.\" A recent notice in a western paper (the Woodstock Times) is complimentary in the extreme. The following are extracts: \"While the 'St. Lawrence and the Saguenay,' was replete with the out-gushing effusions of no ordinary mind, 'Hesperus' is overflowing with gems of higher worth. No one, we think, in perusing either of these works\u2014especially the latter\u2014will deny that Mr. Sangster possesses the varied requisites of the true poet. There is a softness, a delicacy, a rich hue of thought, and withal a purity of sentiment pervading these poems, which at once and forever redeem them from a species of literature far too potent in our midst. The eye of precocious wantonness, and the heart of prurient lasciviousness, so pandered to by the venal writers of the age, find nothing to regale them on these pages. But to all who admire poetry, as she weaves her chaplet of love, to deck the brow of the true and the pure, we promise a rare gratification in this book. Mr. Sangster, himself a most ethereal being, has refined, sublimated and crystalized, by the force of his genius, the objects of his poetic admiration. And the sunshine and shade\u2014the song, and sadness\u2014the bitterness and the bliss of human life, find each their fitting delineation, their just expression. Mr. Sangster is no misanthrope, he loves his brother man with a real brotherly and genuine heartiness; and seeks, as far as in him lies, to minister to his dignity, and to regain for him his birthright. Who 'Colin' was, whose memory Mr. Sangster has enshrined in amber, we know not, but from what is here said of him, we conclude he was an heir of the blood royal of bravery; whose deeds, but for the poet, might have perished in the grave of the hero, now to survive, at least, a fraction of duration.\n\n\"The poet enters the abodes of death and bereavement\u2014\"where Hope like a lamb lies slain\"\u2014with the air of a messenger of peace\u2014sets an iris in the darkest cloud, and leaves sparkling on the coffin lid the assurance that\u2014\n\n\"Sorrow ne'er filled a chalice\nThat joy did not wait to drain.\"\n\"All we have to add is, that we hope the day is not far distant, when such men as Sangster, McColl, McCarrol, and the famed author of 'Saul,' a drama, will take their proper and legitimate stand before the public of Canada. It certainly speaks and augurs badly for the future of this country, that its sons of talent and genius must be tried at the bar of British criticism, before their voices can even be heard at home. Let Canada wipe this stigma from her literature, and award due encouragement to her high-souled sons, who daily toil for daily bread, and trim their 'midnight lamps' to brighten and to bless her homes.\"\n\nWe believe that the above review is from the pen of the Rev. Wm. Stephenson, a gentleman of rare ability as an orator, and whose copiousness of language, fancy, fire, and grace of expression, united to pleasing manners, and a restless master-spirit of research, will yet place him in the foreground of Canadian oratory. It is not only well, but noble, to see men of his stamp coming to the rescue of our Canadian poets. We conclude this notice of Mr. Sangster with his ode on\n\nBROCK.\n\nOctober 13th, 1859.*\n\nOne voice, one people, one in heart\nAnd soul, and feeling and desire!\nRe-light the smouldering martial fire,\nSound the mute trumpets strike the lyre,\nThe hero deed can not expire,\nThe dead still play their part.\n\nRise high the monumental stone!\nA nation's fealty is theirs,\nAnd we are the rejoicing heirs,\nThe honored sons of sire whose cares\nWe take upon us unawares,\nAs freely as our own.\n\nWe boast not of the victory,\nBut render homage, deep and just,\nTo his\u2014to their\u2014immortal dust,\nWho proved so worthy of their trust\nNo lofty pile nor sculptured bust\nCan herald their degree.\n\nNo tongue need blazon forth their fame\u2014\nThe cheers that stir the sacred hill\nAre but mere promptings of the will\nThat conquered then, that conquers still;\nAnd generations yet shall thrill\nAt Brock's remembered name.\n\n*The day of the inauguration of the new monument on Queenston Heights.\nAND PERSONS CONNECTED WITH CANADA.\n\nSome souls are the Hesperides\nHeaven sends to guard the golden age,\nIlluming the historic page\nWith records of their pilgrimage;\nTrue Martyr, Hero, Poet, Sage:\nAnd he was one of these.\n\nEach in his lofty sphere sublime\nSit crowned above the common throng,\nWrestling with some Pythonic wrong,\nIn prayer, in thunder, thought, or song;\nBriareus-limbed, they sweep along,\nThe Typhons of the time.\n\nELKANAH BILLINGS, Esq., F.R.G.S.\n\nMr. Billings, one of the most talented paleontologists that Canada possesses, whose name has for some years been associated with the geological survey of Canada, is an Ottawaite, having been born in the Township of Gloucester, on the Ottawa, on the 5th of May, 1820. His father's family came originally from Wales, and settled in the New England states. His father was born in Massachusetts during the war of the revolution, shortly after which his grandfather came to Canada, and settled near Brockville.\n\nMr. Billings pursued his studies partly at Ottawa city (then Bytown) and partly at Potsdam, in the state of New York. He entered the Law Society of Upper Canada as a student-at-law in Trinity term, 1840; and studied, at different offices, in both Ottawa city and Toronto. At the latter place he completed his probationary studies, and was called to the bar in 1845. He practiced in Ottawa city and the adjoining county of Renfrew until June, 1856, when he was appointed paleontologist of the geological survey of Canada. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Geological Society of London in February, 1858.\n\nWhile residing at Ottawa city Mr. Billings made a large and valuable collection of the fossils which abound in the rocks of the neighborhood. By studying these, he made himself well acquainted with the paleontology of the silurian rocks of Canada. His first papers were published in the Ottawa Citizen newspaper, and in the Canadian Journal of Toronto; the latter the organ of the Canadian Institute, and a most valuable publication. In February, 1856, Mr. Billings published the first number of the Canadian Naturalist, a periodical devoted to scientific objects, which proved extremely successful. The first volume was edited by Mr. Billings.\nalone; and his writings reflected the highest credit on his scientific standing. These were much read, and most favorably reviewed in all the leading publications. He was also the sole proprietor for the first year, when he made it over to Messrs. B. Dawson & Son, of Montreal, by whom it is now published. Mr. Billings is, however, still one of the editors. He has also contributed to *Silliman's Journal*, and largely to the publications of the geological survey of Canada, though many of his writings do not appear under his name. His most important memoirs are the third and fourth decades of the geological survey of Canada; nearly all the new genera and species of fossils described in these two publications were discovered by him. Numerous and most valuable contributions have also been made by him to the *Canadian Naturalist*, since it has been published by Messrs. Dawson, of Montreal, under the auspices of the Natural History Society of that city.\n\n---\n\n**Mr. Evan McColl,**  \n**The Bard.**\n\nEvan McColl has now been for ten years a resident of Canada, and can fairly be claimed as one of the celebrities of the country. He was born at Kenmore, Loch-Fyne-Side, Scotland, on the 21st of September, 1808, and is there widely known as the \"Clarsair-nam-beann,\" or \"the Mountain Minstrel.\" A prominent place has been assigned him in MacKenzie's *Beauties of Gaelic Poetry, and Lives of the Highland Bards,* published at Glasgow in 1841. Mr. McColl, though born and brought up in humble circumstances, is paternally descended from a very ancient family, the McColls of Glasdrum, Glenororan, a family which, for many years, gave chiefs to his clan, a small but heroic branch of the great Clann D\u00f2nvill. Like many others of the irritable race, he seems to have inherited the poetic faculty, and that peculiar temperament incident thereto, from his mother, who was of the clan Cameron, and for whose memory he cherishes the most tender filial feelings and remembrances. She is represented as being somewhat of an improvisatrice, and her leaning in this direction, coupled with the frequent exercise of her gift, doubtless gave a bent and tone to the boy-mind, which time, an ardent soul, and carefully directed thought, have fully developed, if not perfected, in the man. The sketch to which allusion has been made, says:\n\"And Persons Connected with Canada.\"\n\n\"His father seems to have been alive to the blessings of education; for, as the village school afforded little or nothing worthy of that name, he, about the time that our bard had reached his teens, hired a tutor for his family, at an amount of remuneration which his slender means could scarcely warrant. The tutor's stay was short, yet sufficiently long to accomplish one good purpose\u2014that of not only enabling Evan properly to read and understand English, but, also, of awakening in him a taste for English literature. A circumstance occurred about this time, which tended materially to encourage our author's poetical leanings. His father, while transacting business one day in a distant part of his native parish, fell in with a Paisley weaver, who, in consequence of the depression of trade, had made an excursion to the Highlands with a lot of old books for sale. McColl bought the entire lot, and returned home, groaning under his literary burden, which Evan received with transports of delight. Among other valuable works, he was thus put in possession of the 'Spectator,' 'Burns' Poems,' and the 'British Essayists.' He read them with avidity, and a new world opened on his view; his thoughts now began to expand, and his natural love of song, received an impetus which no external obstacle could resist.\n\n\"Contemporaneous with this literary impulse, was the artillery of a neighboring Chloe, whose eyes had done sad havoc among the mental fortifications of our bard: he composed his first song in her praise, and, although he had scarcely passed the term of boyhood, it is a very respectable effort, and was well received by his co-parishioners. The circumstances in which his father was placed, rendered it necessary for him to engage in the active operations of farming and fishing, and he was thus employed for several years. In the year of 1837, he threw off the mask of anonymity, and appeared as a contributor to the Gaelic Magazine, then published in Glasgow. His contributions excited considerable interest, and a general wish was expressed to have them published in a separate form, by all Highlanders, with the exception of his own immediate neighbors, who could not conceive how a young man, with whom they had been acquainted from his birth, should rise superior to themselves in intellectual stature, and public estimation. They, of course, discovered that our youthful bard was possessed of a fearful amount of temerity, and, the public, at the same time, saw that they were miserably blockaded in their own mental timidity. If native talent is not to be encouraged by fostering it under the grateful shade of generous friendship, it ought, at least, to have the common justice of being allowed to work a way for itself, unlogged by a solitary fetter\u2014unchilled by the damping breath of unmerited contempt or discouragement. The high-souled inhabitants of Inveraray, failed to extinguish the flame of McColl's lamp; and now, as they are probably not much better engaged, we recom-\nmend them to 'see themselves as others see them' in our author's retallative poem, 'Stochd a Chopair,' in which they are strongly mirrored, and the base metal of which they are made, powerfully delineated. Mr. McColl imitates no poet; he has found enough in nature to instruct him\u2014he moves majestically in a hitherto untraversed path; and, if we are not continually enraptured with him, we never tire\u2014never think long in his company. But we are reminded, that praises bestowed on a living author, subject us to the imputation of flattery:\u2014long may it be ere Evan McColl is the subject of any posthumous meed of landation from us. Here follow samples of his Gaelic poems. Of these the Glasgow Constitutional says: \"Mr. McColl's Gaelic pieces are chiefly amorous, and emanate from a heart imbued with the finest feelings of humanity. His 'Ode to Loch-duich' is inimitable. Rich in the most splendid imagery of nature, represented to our admiring gaze, through the burning vista of poetic genius, we sit on the author's lips, float with him on its glassy surface, or dive into its transparent bosom. As a Celtic bard, Mr. McColl is second to none; and we trust that a young man, who has commenced his career so auspiciously, will yet be an honor to his country, and to the republic of letters. We do not envy the taste of that man (says Dr. Norman McLeod) who will sit an hour on the mountain side, without the bewitching company of 'Clarsach nam Beann.' The title of this volume is 'Clarsach nam Beann; or, poems and songs in Gaelic.'\"\n\nHis next publication was \"The Mountain Minstrel; or, poems and songs in English.\" Of this latter, the highest authorities in Britain speak in terms of praise. Dr. McLeod, the editor of \"Good Words,\" says: \"Evan McColl's poetry is the product of a mind impressed with the beauty and the grandeur of the lovely scenes in which his infancy has been nursed. We have no hesitation in saying, that this work is that of a man possessed of much poetic genius. Wild, indeed, and sometimes rough, are his rhymes and epithets; yet there are thoughts so new and so striking\u2014images and comparisons so beautiful and original\u2014feelings so warm and fresh, that stamp this Highland peasant as no ordinary man. His volume well deserves a niche among the curiosities of modern literature.\"\n\nNotices equally favorable might be adduced from the Athen\u00e6um, the Westminster Review, and other English periodicals; but, instead of these, we prefer quoting the opinion of the author of \"Festus,\" and \"The Angel World,\" which is not only more flattering, but necessarily much more just, than the opinion of a mere critic, the composition of whose mentality is frequently as devoid of poesy or poetic feeling, or impulse, as the close of a sullen day is destitute of fiery splendor or sun-set associations:\u2014\"There is a freshness, a keenness, a heartiness in many of these productions of the\nMountain Minstrel which seem to breathe naturally of the hungry air, the dark, bleak, rugged bluffs among which they were composed, alternating occasionally with a clear, bewitching, and spiritual quiet, as of the gloaming deepening over the glens and woods. Several of these melodies, towards the close of this volume, are full of simple and tender feeling, and not unworthy to take their place by the side of those of Lowland minstrels of universal fame. All honor to Mr. Bailey's candor! all honor to the excellence of his head and heart!\n\nWhen, in 1831, his father, with the rest of his family, emigrated to Canada, the bard could not be persuaded to leave the beloved land of his birth, where he remained until 1837, when, having been appointed to a clerkship in the customs at Liverpool, he bade farewell to, and exchanged his native hills for a sphere of life, anything but congenial to a man of his temperament, tastes and feelings.\n\nIn the year 1850, in consequence of an impaired state of health, he obtained six months leave of absence for the purpose of visiting his friends in Canada, and for the improvement of his over-worked constitution. Shortly after he crossed the Atlantic, having met the Honorable Malcolm Cameron, then a minister of the crown, he was, by that gentleman, invited to transfer his services to the provincial customs, and, was soon thereafter, appointed to a situation at the port of Kingston, where he still remains. It would be well, if those in power were to bestow their patronage more frequently in this way, and not, as is often the case, on mere political partizans and time-servers. The men who write the songs of a country are not less honored by posterity than they who make its laws; but the literary man needs leisure which, alas! Evan McColl, as well as others of this class, have not got, and can scarcely dare to hope for.\n\nMr. McColl's sphere is evidently that of song. As a song writer he excells. He is at present, and has been for some years, the Bard of the St. Andrew's Society, Kingston, and his annual contribution on the anniversary of the saint, is looked for with much anxiety. His \"Bonnet, Kilt and Feather,\" and his \"Lake of the Thousand Isles,\" are particularly good. So is his \"Robin,\" written for the people's centennial celebration of the favorite Scottish poet's birthday in Kingston. One of the corps editorial,* in noticing this latter song, observed: \"Its melodious and flowing beauty of expression then commanded general admiration; its pervading characteristic\u2014that of being in Burns's own style,\u2014and the subject being throughout in especial relation to the Scottish bard, made it peculiarly appropriate as a birthday ode, and as a specimen\n\n*Mr. James Neilh, editor of the Daily News, Kingston, whose name will appear with honor in some future edition of \"Canadian Celebrities.\"\nof that class of poetry, it must be held in high estimation. What, for instance, could be better or more poetically expressed, than the stanza descriptive of the poetry of Burns?\u2014\n\nHis burning lays devoid of art,\nAre they not written on each heart?\nTo warm mirth, or tears to start,\nNo mortal names Robin!\nNow gently flow his thoughts along;\nNow, like a rushing river strong,\nA very catacomb of song,\nResistless is our Robin!\n\n\"Or what more expressive of the bacchanalian and amatory propensities of the hero 'Robin,' than the stanza?\u2014\n\nThe graceless bard loved mountain dew\u2014\nIt was his Halicon, I trow;\n'He dearly loved the lasses,' too,\u2014\nA mighty crime in Robin!\n'A body coming through the rye,'\nUnkissed he never could pass by;\nNor can I blame him much; for why?\u2014\nThe lasses all loved Robin!\n\n\"Another quotation ere we close. The simple beauty of the language of the following lines is such that their omission would be inexcusable, and the idea embodied is perfectly consistent with the teachings of sound philosophy and healthy morality:\u2014\n\n'Hold, honest Labor, up thy head,\nAnd point with pride to Robin dead;\nThe halo round thy path he shed,\nImmortal is as Robin.'\n\n\"We consider that in 'Robin,' Mr. McColl has achieved his greatest success, and, as an artistic production, it deserves to be placed on a level with Lady Nairn's celebrated impersonation of Burns, so touching and pathetic, 'The Land o' the Leal!'\n\nAnd he is right when he says that, \"Mr. McColl's song is by far the best Canadian poem called forth by the recent demonstration to the memory of Burns.\" More, its authorship would be a credit to any poet, and we feel no little pride that such a meritorious composition should have emanated from a resident of Kingston.\n\nMr. McColl is now somewhat past the middle of life, but bids fair to weather the storm of existence for many years to come. In private life, he is all, both by precept and example, that could be desired. He has an intense love for all that is really good and beautiful and true, and a manly scorn for all that is false, time-serving, or hypocritical; there is no narrow-mindedness, no bigotry in his soul. Kind and generous to a fault, he is more than esteemed, and that deservedly, by all who properly know him. In the domestic circle, all the warmth of the man's heart\u2014the full flow\nof genuine feeling and affection\u2014is ever uppermost. He is a thoroughly earnest man, in whose daily walks and conversation, as well as in his actions, Longfellow's \"Psalm of Life\" is acted out in verity. In his friendship, he is sincere; in his dislikes, equally so. He is thoroughly Scottish in his leanings; his national love burns with intensity. In poetry, he is not merely zealous, but enthusiastic, and he carries his natural force of character into all he says and does. Consequently, he is not simply a wooer, but a worshipper of the Muse. Long may he live, the \"Bard of Loch-Fyne,\" to prostrate his entire heart and soul in the Temple of the Nine.\n\nCOLONEL BARON DE ROTTENBURG, C.B.\n\nOur work would be imperfect were we not to include in it a notice, however brief from the materials at our disposal, of the above estimable officer, who has done much to bring his native Canada under the favorable notice of Europe. This he has achieved, principally through the admirable manner in which he has executed the high charge placed in his hands, as lieutenant-colonel of the \"100th or Prince of Wales Royal Canadian Regiment,\" in which responsible trust he has succeeded in making that fine body of men the admiration of the British army.\n\nColonel de Rottenburg is a son of the late General Baron de Rottenburg, at one time administrator of the government of Upper Canada, and a military officer of considerable distinction. The family came originally from Germany, and the title is hereditary. The subject of this sketch entered the army as a cornet, on the 7th April, 1825; and in July, 1832, was promoted to the rank of captain, a fact which augurs much for his character for diligence, attention and skill. Unfortunately, as it is generally thought, he has seen but little of active service. He was in the rifle battalion which proceeded to Spain under Sir De Lacy Evans, but was compelled to retire from it on account of ill health. He served in Upper Canada during the rebellion, and on that occasion plainly shewed the metal of which he is composed, being appointed to what military men call a \"particular service;\" he acquitted himself so well as to receive in consequence the brevet rank of major. He served in the 46th Foot, and was nominated by the late Earl Cathcart to succeed Colonel (now Major-General) Young as assistant-adjudant-general in Canada. On the 1st July, 1855,\nhe was appointed adjutant-general of the militia of this province, which office he held until the 30th of June, 1858, when he was appointed by his excellency the governor-general to the lieutenant-colonelcy of the 100th Regiment\u2014an appointment as Sir J. B. Robinson, our respected chief-justice, truly said, was \"the most happy that the province afforded.\" Respecting his management of his arduous appointment we can only say that it was most admirable, and he brought our militia by his judiciousness to a state of efficiency which we may safely assert has been hardly ever equalled.\n\nOn his departure from amongst us to assume his command of the 100th Regiment, a grand banquet was given him in the Rossin House, Toronto, and a magnificent and costly sword was presented to him by the militia of Canada.\n\nOn this occasion, Sir Edmund Head, the then governor-general, thus expressed himself:\n\n\"Gentlemen, I must, in the first place, thank you most sincerely for the manner in which my health has been drunk. I beg to express my gratitude on that account; and having done this, it is my next duty to refer to what Colonel Thomson has been pleased to say in reference to my exertions for the success of the militia of Canada. I have done what I could for that arm of the service, but the little I have been able to accomplish has resulted mainly from the untiring efforts of that gentleman in whose honor we have met here to-night. (Applause.) I have a better right to speak in praise of his merits than any other person in this room, because I have seen his conduct, not in reference to one corps or one part of the country only, but in reference to all. I assure you that he has devoted the whole of his time and energy to the benefit of the public service, and that he has given the utmost attention to every case that has come before him. I believe from my heart that he has done all with the greatest impartiality, his sole object being to promote her Majesty's service and the public good. (Applause.) I would desire to enter a little more into particulars; and I speak in all sincerity when I say that, never in the course of the time that he and I have worked together with reference to the militia of Canada, has he allowed himself to be influenced by a single feeling of party or political prejudice. (Applause.) I can conscientiously say I do not believe, on any occasion, party considerations were allowed to interfere with what he thought to be the good of the service and the merits of this or that officer, be he who he may, or be his political party whatever it may. (Hear, hear.) I think it is a duty I owe to him to give him this credit, especially as he has been located in a country where, unfortunately, we are not altogether free from party feeling or violence. It often happens that persons in my position get credit for many things both good and evil which we do not per-\nform; but I claim credit on this occasion for one thing, and that is disinterestedness. When Baron de Rottenburg told me that he was again anxious to enter her Majesty's active service, my first feeling was one of deep regret, and when I learnt that his purpose was fixed, I felt bound to make a representation of his good qualities and merits to those in authority elsewhere. I am happy, for his sake, that those representations had a good result; but I am sorry for your sake and I am sorry for my own. (Applause.) He has, without doubt, worked the militia force well, and he has produced results of which I think he has great reason to be proud.\" Colonel de Rottenburg left Canada to the regret and with the well-wishes of all parties. This year, he has retired from the army with the rank of colonel; and we believe, he is expected to return to Canada. Besides being a thorough military man, he enjoys the reputation of being an astronomer of considerable experience.\n\nLIEUT.-COLONEL DUNN, V.C.\n\nColonel A. R. Dunn is a Canadian by birth, and is the second son of the late Hon. John Henry Dunn, who for more than twenty years held the high and responsible office of receiver-general in this country, and stood deservedly high in general estimation for political consistency, and the excellence of his character in public or private life.\n\nColonel Dunn has received a military education, and what is better, has seen service, having gone through the Crimean campaign. He was a lieutenant of horse in the 11th, Lord Cardigan's Hussars, and rode in the celebrated charge of the Light Brigade at Balaklava, when six hundred men had the hardihood to attack a battery of thirty pieces of ordnance in point blank position, cutting their way through a dense body of five thousand Russian cavalry; returning through the same mass and sabreing the gunners, and finally running the gauntlet through an infantry fire on both flanks, from twenty thousand muskets. The impetuosity of this advance, made it an isolated movement, for it was impossible to bring up the supports in time to enable the gallant little band to bring into the British lines the heavy guns they had ridden into and over. The enemy were in the ratio of thirty to one of their British assailants, and nothing but the unexampled effrontery and suddenness of the attack, and return to position, saved this handful of heroes from\nbeing hemmed in by numbers, and cut to pieces, or compelled to surrender at discretion. It is recorded that the affair occupied only twenty-five minutes; but in that brief space, out of six hundred men, twenty-six mounted officers, two hundred and seventy-six hussars, and as many as four hundred horses fell to rise no more.\n\nColonel Dunn's share in this transaction was worthy of his lineage and country. He not only overthrew all with whom he came into direct conflict, but left the ranks more than once, to rescue troopers whom he saw engaged singly against numbers, and to whom he brought the succor of his restless sword arm. It is thus the tale is written of him; and when her Majesty was advised to institute a new military order, for the distinction of cases of individual valor in action with the enemy, and a demand was made for the most distinguished men for personal gallantry in the terrible Balaklava charge, Colonel Alex. Dunn's was the name, which by the common accord of officers and men was returned. The Victoria Cross was publicly delivered to him in Hyde Park, by the hand of the Queen herself. To have had the mint mark of true valor thus stamped upon his name\u2014to have been declared the bravest of the brave of that astonishing little band of heroes, is no mere praise.\n\nHaving retired from the 11th, he came to Toronto after the war, and in June, 1858, in conjunction with the Baron de Rottenburg (who was selected as lieutenant-colonel), had the honor, as a native Canadian, to be elected by his excellency the governor-general, for the majority of the 100th, or Prince of Wales Royal Canadian Regiment of Foot. On this occasion, he was the recipient from his old school fellows and friends of a handsome demonstration in his honor. He has of course since remained with his regiment, which is stationed at Gibraltar. He was lately promoted to the lieutenant-colonelcy, in consequence of the retirement of Baron de Rottenburg.\n\n---\n\n**MAJOR WELLS,**  \n**1st (Royal) Regiment of Foot.**\n\nMajor Wells is a Torontonian by birth, and a son of the late Hon. Mr. Wells, of Canada West; he is also an \"Upper Canada collegian.\" Having adopted the military profession, he rose to the rank of major, won principally by his daring and intrepid gallantry in the Crimean campaign. He was present at the battles\nof Alma, Balaklava, Inkerman, and Sebastopol, for which he has the medal and clasp. He also received from the Emperor of the French the distinguishing mark of the grand cross of the Legion of Honor, and belongs to the fifth class of the Medjidie. He likewise received the rank of brevet-major; and on his return to his native city, in 1856, his fellow-citizens turned out en masse to receive him. The city, in recognition of his services, and proud at his being a fellow-countryman, presented him with a valuable sword. His school-fellows and others, gave him and Lieutenant (now Lieutenant-Colonel) Dunn a grand entertainment in the Rossin House. His commissions date as follows:\u2014 ensign, 12th October, 1841; lieutenant, 2nd August, 1844; captain, 6th November, 1854; major, 2nd November, 1855.\n\nHIS LORDSHIP THE BISHOP OF HURON.\n\nThe Right Reverend J. Cronyn, first bishop of Huron, was born in the city of Kilkenny, Ireland, in the year 1802, and is consequently in the fifty-ninth year of his age. At an early period he evinced a strong inclination for the church, and entered at Trinity college, Dublin, when he was only fifteen. He soon distinguished himself above the majority of his fellows, and graduated in 1821 as A. B.; subsequently he obtained the degree of A. M., which he took in the year 1824, and the same year won the regius professor's prize at the divinity examination, (see Dublin University Calendar.) In the year 1825 he was ordained deacon by the bishop of Raphoe, and proceeded to England where he officiated as curate for some months in the diocese of Chester, leading the same hard and harassed, though contented life of most of the English curates; his was a hard and difficult road through life; yet he accomplished it, and triumphed over the obstacles and impediments cast in his way. Mr. Cronyn returned to Ireland after a few months' sojourn in England, and in the year 1826, was ordained priest by the late archbishop of Tuam, when he served as curate under his lordship in the county of Longford, for six years; at the expiration of which time (1832) he came to Canada, and was immediately appointed to the London district, in which capacity he served for twenty-five years. The amount of good work done by this pious and zealous prelate during that time can hardly be estimated; so energetic, earnest and philanthropic was he in his\nendeavors to do good to his fellow creatures. Happily his service met with a high reward, for in 1857, on a portion of the western province being constituted into the bishopric of Huron, his lordship was unanimously elected to that high, dignified, and important post; and in October following he was consecrated bishop at Lambeth palace, by his grace the archbishop of Canterbury, assisted by the right reverends the bishops of Winchester, Nova Scotia and Sierra Leone. In the performance of his high and sacred duties he has always given the greatest satisfaction to all parties connected with the church in the district under his control. He has taken an active part in all the leading questions appertaining to it, and is justly regarded in the province as one of the ablest divines we possess.\n\nR. STEPHENSON, Esq., C.E., M.P., D.C.L., F.R.S.\n\nIt cannot be out of place to insert a notice of this eminent and distinguished engineer. Although not a Canadian or a resident of Canada for any length of time, yet his connection with one of the greatest undertakings of the age, the Victoria Bridge, of which the whole empire may well be proud, fully entitles his name to appear in these pages.\n\nRobert Stephenson was born at Wellington, Northumberland, England, November 16, 1803; he was sent to school at Long Bolton, and in 1814, placed with Mr. Bruce at Newcastle. He soon showed a taste for mechanics, and became a member of the Newcastle Literary and Philosophical Institution, from the library of which he took books to study over with his father at home on Saturday afternoons. The Rev. William Taylor, one of the secretaries of this institution, aided him. In 1818, he was apprenticed to Nicholas Wood, as a coal-viewer, and made himself acquainted with the machinery of coal-mining. In 1820, his father became able to send him to Edinburgh university for a single session. Here he attended the lectures of Dr. Hope on chemistry, Sir John Leslie on natural philosophy, and Prof. Jamieson on geology and mineralogy. He gained a mathematical prize, learned how to learn, and returned home in 1821. In 1822 he was apprenticed to his father in his locomotive factory, but his health failing, in 1824 he went to South America to examine gold and silver mines. He was recalled thence by his father, and reached home in December, 1827. He now took an active part in the discussion of\nthe use of locomotives on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, and aided his father in the construction of the successful engine, although he gives the credit of the tubular boiler to his father and Mr. Henry Booth. He was next employed on a branch of that railway. Before it was completed he surveyed and undertook the construction of the Leicester and Swannington Railway, and on the completion of that work he surveyed the line of the London and Birmingham Railway, was appointed its engineer, and removed to London. He built it in the four years from 1834 to 1838. He devoted much time to improvements in the locomotive engine, and after 1838, was engaged on many lines of railway. But he was most remarkable for the vastness of some of his projects, such as the high level bridge over the Tyne at Newcastle, the viaduct over the Tweed Valley at Berwick, and the Britannia tubular bridge over the Menai Strait, a conception the novelty of which was even more striking than its magnitude. This was opened in 1850. He was also consulted as to the Belgian lines of railway, as to a line in Norway between Christiana and Lake Miosen, for which he received the grand cross of the order of St. Olaf, and as to the railway between Florence and Leghorn. He visited Switzerland for the same purpose. He visited this country, and selected the spot where the Victoria Bridge now stands. He was also the designer of that noble structure, although the chief merit must perhaps be awarded to Mr. Keefer. It is not long since he completed the 140 miles of railway between Cairo and Alexandria, with two tubular bridges. Previous to his death he was constructing an immense bridge across the Nile, to replace the steam ferry. Besides these labors he was a member of Parliament for Whitby, in Yorkshire, from 1847, to the time of his death. In 1855, he paid off a debt of $15,000 for the Newcastle Literary and Philosophical Society. He aided Piazzi Smyth in his investigations at Teneriffe. He was an honorary but active member of the London Sanitary and Sewerage Commissions, a fellow of the Royal Society, a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers since 1830, of which institution he was member of council during the years 1845 to 1847, and president during the years 1856 and 1857.\n\nHe received a great gold medal of honor from the French Exposition d'Industrie of 1855, and is said to have declined an offer of knighthood in Great Britain. He was also the author of a work \"On the Locomotive Steam Engine,\" and another \"On the Atmospheric Railway System,\" published in quarto by Weale, London. His death occurred at that city on the 12th October, 1859; and occasioned a general gloom and regret on the part of the whole British people. For in him the nation lost one of its brightest ornaments, a genius difficult to replace and not easily to be forgotten.\nHis funeral was one of the grandest ever witnessed in the United Kingdom; thousands and thousands flocked to pay their last humble marks of respect and esteem to the memory of the great man, as his body was lowered into its final resting place, in Westminster Abbey. When the beautiful service was brought to a conclusion, and Handel's Funeral Anthem was sung.\u2014\"His body is buried in peace, but his memory liveth for ever;\"\u2014a most powerful effect was produced on all present.\n\nHe died in his fifty-second year, and none regretted more his early death than the people of Canada.\n\nDuring the recent visit to Canada of the heir apparent to the British throne, when his royal highness was pleased to inaugurate the stupendous monument to Stephenson's skill, he thus feelingly alluded to the deceased gentleman:\n\n\"I regret that the great man whose name is now double enrolled in that page of my country's history, in which its worthies are inscribed, has not lived to see this day. I regret that ill-health prevents the presence of another, who labored with him to plan and execute this vast design; but to them and to the eminent firm and those employed by them in carrying out the works, no less than to your countrymen, whose energetic exertions first gave birth to the scheme of this bridge, are the thanks of the great community of North America due.\"\n\nJAMES HODGES, Esq.\n\nThe antecedents of Mr. Hodges constitute him another striking illustration of \"self help.\" To his own indomitable perseverance alone, coupled with the strictest integrity of character and honorable conduct, does he owe his present high position in the engineering world\u2014a position which did not fail to attract the notice of his future king, on the occasion of the laying of the last stone of the Victoria Bridge, by his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, on the 25th of August, 1860. Of the many claimants that have sprung up, both in Britain and in Canada, for the honor of being the originator, or designer of the Victoria Bridge, it is not our intention to speak; but we are at the present time about to introduce a name in connection with this stupendous structure, which well deserves the record we here give it. From the hour in which the first cofferdam was laid, until the last rivet was driven, which\ncompleted the Victoria Bridge as it now stands, the presiding genius was Mr. Hodges, as the engineer of the contractors, Messrs. Peto, Brassey, and Betts.\n\nMr. Hodges was born on the 6th April, 1814, in Queenborough, in the county of Kent, where he was educated at the grammar school of that town. After going through the scholastic duties of a grammar-school of that day, he was removed, in order to receive a government appointment which some of his Parliamentary friends had promised, but which promise was never redeemed. After waiting until his patience was exhausted, he apprenticed himself, at the age of seventeen, to a builder, residing at Brompton near Chatham. Having served four years in this trade, he commenced his railway practice under Mr. John Rowland, the agent of Macintosh, the contractor of the Greenwich Railway, his first essay in railway work being the centring for the arches. After this he went to Shard, and, at the age of twenty-two, had charge of the building of the union houses of that place. These finished, his next work was at the Shakspeare tunnel, Dover, which he superintended at first as the agent of the contractor, Mr. Rowland; but, on his death, Mr. Hodges assumed the charge of the work in concert with the resident engineer of the South-Eastern Railway; and it is not a little remarkable, that every ounce of gunpowder used in the large blasts was deposited in its place by his own hands. During the progress of this work he attracted the attention of the late Sir Wm. Cubitt, then engineer-in-chief of the South-Eastern Railway, to whom Mr. Hodges has frequently stated he is more indebted for his subsequent rise and progress in his profession, than to any other man. The pupil in this case is a worthy disciple of a very worthy master.\n\nIt was at this time that a curious resolve was made by young Hodges, and it was this, that, if spared, he would work until the age of thirty-five, for whatever amount of remuneration others might think his labor worth, but, after that time, he should name the price at which his services were to be obtained. And to this end he steadily kept on progressing, so that by the time this period of his life was reached\u2014having superintended the driving of the Abbott's Cliff, Seaham, and Archcliff Fort tunnels, and the erection of the Shakspeare viaduct, along with the blasting of the Roundown Cliff, and several other works in that neighborhood, as well as the erection of swing bridges at Norwich, Needham, and Somerleyton, as the agent of Sir Morton Peto, Bart., with whom, about this time, he became acquainted\u2014his resolve was no castle in the air on his part, but a firm determination to work up by hard industry and integrity to the point which he himself had chosen, and which he attained within the time he had himself specified. A handsome testimonial from Sir William Cubitt, at the termination of their business relations as to his worth, gave him a fresh\nstart as it were in his upward tendency, and the next appointment he filled, was that of resident engineer, under Mr. G. P. Bidder, on the Norfolk Railway. The trammels of daily routine, and on so limited a scale, were not in consonance with his feelings, and, retiring from that position, we next find him as the engineer of the Lowestoft harbor; after which, in connection with Mr. James Peto, the brother of Sir Morton Peto, he contracted for and built fifty miles of the Great Northern Railway, on behalf of his principals, Messrs. Peto and Betts.\n\nAfter so many years of active life, under which his health suffered to some considerable extent, Mr. Hodges, determined on retiring into private life, and, with that view, purchased a small estate, near Bagsbot, Surrey, where he at present resides; but no sooner had he completed his arrangements, in 1853, for enjoying his otium cum dignitate, than the organisation of the Grand Trunk Railway Company, with its Victoria Bridge across the St. Lawrence, afforded him, as the agent of the contractors who had undertaken the work, the opportunity of handing his name down to posterity, associated with an undertaking which will last through all time. Such an opportunity was not to be lost sight of by the active and genial temperament of such a man, and it was at once embraced. The good he has done in the field of his labors, between that time and the present day, may be summed up in the words of the metropolitan bishop of Canada, who spoke them on the occasion of the workmen in the employ of Messrs. Peto and Betts erecting a stone\u2014a granite boulder, weighing thirty tons, taken from the bed of the river\u2014to preserve from desecration the remains of six thousand emigrants, which were found in digging the foundations of some of the Grand Trunk Railway works. The right reverend gentleman said: \"He was there because he wished to pay the tribute of his personal respect to Mr. Hodges, to testify his high sense of that gentleman's integrity, and of the Christian principle with which he had always acted towards all employed under him. He had provided for their spiritual and educational supervision; and his otherwise high moral principles, his Christian philanthropy, and his munificent liberality to the charities of their city, would remain on perpetual record.\"\nDr. George Lawson,\n\nQueen's College, Kingston.\n\nGeorge Lawson was born in the year 1827 at Maryton, a beautiful village on the banks of the Tay, not many miles from Fisk. The family, soon after his birth, removed to Dundee, but most of his childhood summers were spent with a relative in a secluded cottage on the Newton Hill, not far from Kilmany. There ample opportunities were afforded for the observation of the wild plants and animals of the neighborhood, and his solitary rambles on the hill sides were no doubt instrumental in laying the foundation of that love of nature which seemed in after life to grow up with him as a deeply rooted instinct rather than as an acquirement. During these summer visits to the Newton Hill, although he was not then more than six or seven years of age, his industry speedily filled the cottage with natural products of all kinds from the neighboring woods and fields; and tiny gardens, cut out of the turf on the hill sides, were made the receptacles of wild orchids and other flowers from the neighboring valleys.\n\nAfter a suitable education, Mr. Lawson was apprenticed to a solicitor in Dundee, with the view of following the legal profession; but his private readings were not confined to \"Erskine's Institutes\" and \"Blackstone's Commentaries.\" The discovery in the Watt Institution Library of such works as \"Loudon's Magazine of Natural History\" and \"Fleming's Philosophy of Zoology,\" opened up a more congenial line of thought, and led him to pursue natural history as a science. His excursions in the neighborhood resulted in the addition of many new plants to the district. His first excursion, in 1843, was to the Sidlaw Hills, where he gathered, along with many other plants, &c., *Archemillae alpina*, which had not previously been discovered on the Sidlaw range. For some time his natural history studies were pursued alone, and were greatly prompted by the excellent selection of natural history books which lay unused in the Watt Institution Library of Dundee. He soon made the acquaintance of Mr. William Gardiner, the poet-botanist of that town, and enjoyed one or two excursions with him, chiefly for the collection of mosses and lichens. While pursuing his own researches Mr. Lawson adopted various means to enlist others, in the pursuit of which he found so much gratification. One of these was the establishment of a monthly manuscript periodical, called the \"Dundee Natural History Magazine,\" which was circulated gratuitously to all who would permit their names to\nbe added to the list of local naturalists. This humble publication continued in existence for eighteen months, and afforded some beneficial results\u2014one of the most gratifying of which was the ultimate establishment of a natural history society, consisting of a large number of working members, and which may be familiar to many by name (who now learn its origin for the first time), as the Dundee Naturalists' Association. Mr. Lawson also acted as secretary to several literary societies. It may be mentioned that many of the papers which appeared originally in the \"Manuscript Magazine\" were in after years published in the \"Phytologist,\" and other scientific journals. Having removed to Edinburgh, he was in the spring of 1849 elected to the office of assistant-secretary and curator to the Botanical Society, and at the same time to a similar office in the Caledonian Horticultural Society. He was also elected a fellow, and subsequently assistant-secretary of the Royal Physical Society. His position in these societies brought him in contact with scientific men, and afforded many advantages for improvement in addition to those of the university. In 1850 Mr. Lawson published a small volume on water-lillies, containing a full description, with drawings of Victoria regia, which had flowered in England, and was therefore exciting much attention. In 1854 he took an active interest in the establishment of the Scottish Arboricultural Society, and was appointed assistant-secretary. In that capacity he edited the society's transactions up to 1858. In the autumn of 1856 he was elected by the Royal Society to the office of assistant librarian, and the catalogue of the society's library was completed and printed under his care. While in Edinburgh, Mr. Lawson's great aim had been to qualify himself as a teacher of science. The classes which he attended in the university, &c., and his private studies, must have been selected with this view. In 1852, he gave a course of lectures on botany, in connection with Mr. Hope's abstinence movement; and during the two subsequent years, conducted public classes of a similar kind in Edinburgh, which were very largely attended. In 1855, he commenced a class for practical histology, under Professor Balfour's superintendence, in connection with the botanical class of the university; and it is worthy of remark that the three gentlemen who obtained gold medals at the graduation in 1858 were all students under Mr. Lawson. In 1857, on the unexpected death of Professor Fleming, a committee of Church college was appointed to make arrangements for conducting the class during the winter session. They selected Mr. Lawson to conduct the botanical part of the course, and the zoological part was conducted by Mr. A. Murray, W. S. In 1857 the university of Glasgow conferred on him the degree of doctor of philosophy. Mr. Lawson's writings are very voluminous, but almost entirely anonymous. With the exception of a few papers published in the Botanical Society's\ntransactions, most of his writings have appeared in literary journals and reviews, such as Chambers's Journal, Chambers's Information for the People, The Eclectic Review, Saturday Magazine, Hogg's Instructor, The Scottish Review, The Scottish National Journal, The Paladium, The British Journal, Titan, The Leisure Hour, The Illustrated London News, Illustrated Times; also, North British Agriculturist, Scottish Gardener, Scottish Florist, Gardeners' Chronicle, The Gardeners' Companion, The Phytologist Annals of Natural History, Scottish Agricultural Journal, &c. Many papers on sanitary and general subjects have appeared in the Commonwealth and other newspapers. In addition to all these, about 150 closely printed folios anonymously in Bailey's Monthly Circular. In 1858 he was elected professor of chemistry and natural history in Queen's college, Kingston, O.W. In all the situations which Dr. Lawson has filled, he has acquitted himself in such a manner as to secure unqualified approbation. He is enthusiastically fond of natural science in all its departments, and he has devoted special attention to botany. His kind and obliging manners, his modest Christian deportment, his indefatigable zeal, his laborious and painstaking exertions, and his thorough scientific knowledge, have deservedly placed him in an eminent position in the Scottish metropolis and in Canada, and have secured for him a large circle of friends.\n\nCHEVALIER FALARDEAU\n\nIs a Canadian artist of some eminence. He was born at Quebec, where he received his education; and, at an early age, (about 1844) he made his way to Italy, to study; and, after innumerable hardships, he accomplished the object of his journey, and settled at Florence, where he has become famous as a painter. It is mentioned in Bibaud that he made a present of a picture to the Grand Duke, for which Don Carlos of Spain offered him a great price. In return, he was created a chevalier. It is certain, however, that he possesses the title. Nearly all Canadians travelling abroad visit him. In 1857, Honorable Henry Black, of Quebec, paid his studio a visit, the particulars of which, we extract from a Quebec paper:\n\n\"I. In the first hall the visitor sees a pretty numerous collection of the portraits of the first masters, such as Leonardo de Vinci, Raphael, Andr\u00e9, del Sarte, Guido, Rubens, Vandyke, Titian, Paul Veron\u00e8se, Sir Joshua Reynolds, &c., &c. These are esteemed excellent copies, and are executed with great care and zeal.\"\n\"II. In the second hall are several small paintings of the Flemish and Dutch school, admired for their finish, their expression, and a certain inexpressible touch peculiar to the style of the several original artists.\n\n\"III. & IV. In the third and fourth halls are some splendid pictures of the different Italian schools, amid which the school of Florence shines conspicuous. We have not space to particularize at length the copy of Raphael's Madonna, of Guido's Christ on the cross, Francheschini's Death of St. Joseph, the Judith, after Leonardo de Vinci, and several landscapes after Salvator Rosa, and Claude Loraine, all remarkable for their great fidelity and execution.\n\n\"V. & VI. In the two remaining galleries there are several admirable paintings of the old masters, such as the Martyrdom of St. Bartholomew by Spagnoletto, an Apollo and Marsyas by Cortoni, a landscape by Poussen, the Baptism of Jesus by Baroccio, several pictures of fruits and flowers by Loper, &c., &c.\n\n\"These six galleries or halls are elegantly furnished in the style of the fifteenth century. The furniture is of rare quality, beautifully carved, and derived in descent from some of the principal Etruscan families, the Medici, the Strozzi, &c., and even from the time of the Florentine republic. Every room is unique and complete; and Signor Falardeau (as we must call him) has refused to part with the mere furniture for more than one thousand pounds sterling, without taking into account the Venetian crystal lustres, the candelabra and similar additional ornaments, hangings of gold and silver work, damasks, bronzes, coins, medals, vases and dishes. Everything is arranged in neat and tasteful order; and his studio, while it reflects credit on the classical apprehension of the artist, excites the admiration of visitors from all parts of the civilized world.\"\n\nLIEUT. J. H. BRADSHAW, H.M. 52nd REGT.\n\nThis young and gallant officer, the eldest son of J. F. Bradshaw, Esquire, for many years the manager of the Quebec branch of the Bank of Upper Canada, was born at Hillsborough, in the county Down, Ireland, on the 21st of August, 1834, and came to Canada with his parents in the spring of 1839, when not quite five years old. From his earliest days, the leading traits of his disposition manifested themselves very plainly. Extreme kindness to all the members of his family, gentleness to every one, with a degree of dauntless courage and fortitude not often perceptible in so young\na child. At two years of age he used to be an object of wonder to the villagers, on account of his delight in climbing, or for his bold attempts at riding; indeed, he had all his life a great love for horses, never showing any fear of the most spirited or vicious; as a boy he was a graceful and fearless rider, and never desired better amusement than driving on the snow roads of his adopted country. He was educated in Quebec, principally at home, though for a short time he attended the school of the Revd. C. L. Haensel; he had a very retentive memory and learned without any trouble; as also a peculiar aptness for languages, acquiring Latin and French with the greatest ease, frequently expressing a wish to learn German, but it being thought that he would spend his life in Quebec, other languages were not thought necessary for him. Before he was fifteen he entered a merchant's office, and continued there and in the bank of Upper Canada until the breaking out of the war in the Crimea, when it seemed as if an entire new nature had taken possession of him. He continually spoke of his desire to be a soldier, read all the accounts from the seat of war with the greatest avidity, and used to watch most anxiously for the letters of his brother-in-law, who was with the army before Sebastopol. This was the more remarkable, as although his younger brother had always wished to enter the army, he had not until then expressed his desire upon the subject. So strong, however, did the wish become that he frequently said, he would rather be a private soldier than not join the army at all. His father seeing it was not merely a boyish fancy, applied to the Horse Guards, and in January, 1856, he was gazetted in the 52nd light infantry, then serving in India, which was what he had particularly wished for. He joined the depot of regiment at Chatham, early in May, and soon became a favorite with his brother officers, on account of his cheerful and obliging temper. He obtained a fortnight's leave of absence early in June, and went over to Belfast to make himself acquainted with his relations, whom he had only known when quite a child. Here he became a great favorite, his warmth of affection making him feel, as he himself expressed it, as if he had found a second home. One of his uncles, in writing about him to his parents, says:\u2014\n\n\"His aunt and I feel towards him as if he were our son, and the girls love him as a brother; he is a noble fellow, and you have great reason to be proud of him.\" In writing of this visit, his affectionate nature shews itself again. He writes:\u2014\"I like all my cousins much, and they are all spoiling me, but my great friend is little Annic,\" (an orphan cousin who was being educated along with his uncle's daughters), \"I suppose it is because she is away from her home as well as myself, and so we can understand each others feelings; besides, she has suffered so much, I like to make her laugh.\" In the same letter, finished at Chatham, he says: \"I thought I would get used to partings, having had so many lately, but I was\nnearly as much knocked up by this one as when I left you all at home, but I think a good cry does a man good sometimes.\" While in Belfast, he received intelligence of being, with three others of the 52nd, ordered to India immediately, which he considered very fortunate, wishing that his younger brother, now in H. M. 9th Foot, might soon get his commission and be as fortunate as he had been. He sailed on the 5th of July, and before arriving in India he had obtained his lieutenantcy on the 11th July, 1856. There were many young officers on board, and they had a very pleasant voyage. A regular newspaper was established on board, to the comic articles of which he was the chief contributor; they had also theatricals which were a source of great amusement, and here again the success was mainly owing to his lively humor. He arrived at Calcutta in the end of October, and on the 4th of December left by steamer for Allahabad, from whence the detachment was to march to Sealkote, where the regiment was then stationed. He enjoyed the journey much; the new scenes, and manners and customs of the natives were most graphically described in his letters; in which, though regretting the loss of his family circle, he always expresses himself perfectly happy in the society of his brother officers, and more and more pleased with his profession. Shortly after his arrival at Sealkote, he was attacked with (supposed) inflammation of the hip-joint, and was for five months confined to his bungalow, almost to his bed. Blisters, leeches, &c., failed to give him any relief, and in May, 1857, after describing minutely the frightful scenes which were then taking place in India, he says:\u2014\"And while all this excitement and chance of fun is going on, here am I, stuck in the house for the last six weeks, (without getting outside my compound once), with inflammation of and about the hip, which makes me dead lame, to say nothing of the pain. I have had on five large blisters and twelve leeches, which are equal to another, making an average of a blister a week, just giving the one time to heal, before clapping on another; but all with the same efficiency, as I am still as lame as an old horse, and have to sit or lie whole days in one position, and when I can move with any ease after the blister is off, I have to hobble about with a great stick, like an old man. I suppose as soon as they get tired of blistering, I may expect the same treatment as the old horse\u2014fancy being fired like a horse for lameness! and really, I don't know of anything else for it. It sometimes brings on a regular fit of the blues, and then I think I will never get well, and the worst of it is, I cannot in any way account for it.\" What trial he felt it to be laid up at such a time, may be judged by the following extracts from his letters:\u2014\n\n\"The regiment is now ordered to Lahore, everything has to be got ready for a new march, and now, in the middle of the hot weather, the heat will be something awful in the tents, and I fear the mortality will be very great. The thermometer is 90\u00b0 in the house,\nAND PERSONS CONNECTED WITH CANADA.\n\nwith all the doors kept shut, green curtains on, and the punkas going, so what will it be in the tents. I was nearly ready to cry when the order came, and I found I was to remain behind with the rest of the sick here; the women and children are to go on to Lahore, and so here I am as well as ever I was, but stuck hard and fast with a game leg. I did not give up the idea of going with the regiment without trying to go; I first tried the doctor to let me go as I was, but he put his veto on that at once, saying the colonel would not allow it, unless I was fit for duty. The next morning I went over to Stopford, the adjutant, who lives at the next bungalow, to ask him to speak to the doctor for me, but he could not interfere, so there was no help. The morning the regiment marched, my bearer came and began pinching my leg to awaken me, and when I got fairly roused, there was the colonel standing beside my bed. He sat down, and staid fully half an hour with me, and asked all about me; so I proposed to him that I might go with the regiment on the chance of my getting better, but when he asked what the doctor said, I was obliged to tell him that he had told me I might get worse and perhaps be a cripple for life; and then he said: 'my poor boy, you must not run any risk of that sort, but I will go and see the doctor about it,' so in about half an hour I had a note from Ingham, ordering me to Simla, to try what good the hill weather might do me; so now I must part from the regiment and I feel more wretched than I can tell.\" But though his young heart was nearly broken at remaining inactive, while his companions were allowed to avenge their country's wrongs, yet the subjoined short note* written to a\n\n*18th of June, 1857.\n\n\"My dear Miss Gore:\u2014Though I never dreamed of becoming a correspondent of yours, yet I must write to thank you for the trouble you have taken to write me the little note enclosed in one of my mother's letters, as well as for your good wishes and prayer for my eternal welfare, and which I hope will not have been ineffectually offered for me, and you would greatly misjudge me if you were to imagine I could be offended at your kind advice, or be displeased at anything you might say to me, were it ever so much like preaching, and I should consider myself an ungrateful being indeed, were I not to be thankful to any one who manifested a similar interest in my affairs. I was very sorry to hear you had suffered so much latterly, but I know a verse which says, 'Whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth,' and I know you have too much faith in Him to think it could be other than for your good, as it was His will it should be so. I have been an invalid myself for nearly the last four months, but all I have suffered has been nothing to what has fallen to your lot for years past, and often when sitting outside of an evening all alone, while the others were away at mess, I have thought of your patient resignation, and felt almost ashamed of myself for not bearing my trials more patiently; but it is hard to be pleased with being shut up in the house, being left behind the regiment when there was a chance of seeing active service, and not be able to take any share in it; but I will not trouble you with an account, as it were, of my grievances, for they might have been far worse than they are, and I should have no right to complain. I suppose you have heard ere this, of the mutiny of the native troops and of the atrocities they have committed at Delhi, Meerut and elsewhere.\n\n\"And now I must again thank you for all your kindness to me, ever since I can recollect you, and remain yours very truly,\n\nJ. Hill Bradshaw.\"\nfriend who had kindly written to him on religious subjects, shews that his Heavenly Father's rod was received in a truly humble spirit, and we trust in God's own time worked for him \"a far more exceeding and abundant weight of glory.\"\n\nBefore this letter reached Quebec, the youthful writer and his aged friend had both entered into that land \"where there is no more pain.\" But the Almighty Friend to whom many and fervent prayers had been addressed in his behalf, had unexpected mercy in store for him.\n\nAt the end of June, he started for Lahore en route to Simla, in charge of some soldiers who were there to join their respective regiments, being obliged, on account of his lameness, to travel in a palanquin.\n\nHe awoke one night (that being the time for travelling) and found the bearers had put down the palanquin and were sitting or lying about; the soldiers were not to be seen; he was alone with twelve bearers who had several times in the preceding days shown symptoms of insubordination. He called to them (for he had acquired great proficiency in the language of the country), to proceed; they refused. Forgetting in the excitement of the moment his lameness, he jumped from the palanquin, ordered the men to lift it and continue on their journey. Awed by his determination, they obeyed, and he followed, driving them before him with the flat of his sword, until in three or four hours he overtook the men. His lameness was gone, and with spirits rejoicing in his restored health, he marched into Lahore at the head of his men, and immediately reported himself to the commanding officer as fit for active service. He remained about a fortnight in Lahore, and then being attached to the 81st Foot until he could regain his regiment, he set out for the great object of his wishes, Delhi. His first engagement with the natives was at Bars river, under General Nicholson.\n\nIn his usual lively style, and yet with a grateful sense of the Divine protection, he writes:\u2014\"Thank God, mother, I have had my first brush with the enemy, and escaped unhurt.\" We had two days, or rather nights, forced marches, to enable us to cut off a body of the natives before they joined the main body; we left upwards of two hundred men under trees as we went on, but not one officer was obliged to fall out. When we first came in sight of the enemy, I felt a curious tingling sensation all over, and a ringing in my ears and a feeling of reluctance to take the life of a fellow-creature, but in a few moments I perceived a great black fellow taking deliberate aim at my head; as one of us must go, I thought I would give him the preference, and my revolver made him leave his horse at any rate, and after that, till the 'shindy' was over, I neither heard or knew anything. I gave Trench one of my pistols, and we made the niggers clear the road in famous\nstyle. It was rather a strange sensation at first, to hear the balls whizz past my head, but I thought it good fun before all was over.\u201d\n\nIn a subsequent letter, he writes:\u2014\u201cA curious thing happened to me yesterday; you recollect that a few days after I left Sealkote, the rebels took possession of it, destroying and taking all they could lay their hands on; although I then lost almost everything I was possessed of, still I ought to be very thankful they did not find me there. But yesterday we came up with a small party of rebels who marched off in double quick time, leaving their baggage behind them. Riding as fast as my horse could go after them, I passed a camel, heavily laden; seeing a boot protruding from a parcel, I snatched at it without thinking, and to my surprise found it to be one of the dress boots made for me by Viger, before I left Quebec, which the thieves had taken out of my bungalow in Sealkote. I sent my servant to try and hunt up the other, but though he succeeded in bringing another of my own, by the same maker, yet I am not much the better shod, as unfortunately they are both for the same foot.\u201d\n\nHe arrived before Delhi, and rejoined his own regiment in August, and his letters from there will be read with interest, as they not only give many particulars of that eventful time, but shew his cool courage and contempt of danger. On the 27th, he writes:\u2014\u201cWe arrived here about fifteen days ago, and found everything remarkably quiet, nothing but picket duty and no end of that. When we arrived at Umballah, I found myself on treasure guard, though I had fancied we would have left it all there, but instead of that, we got ten thousand pounds more, so I was stuck in the guard room all day. We halted for a day three marches from this, and though more than thirty miles from Delhi, we could hear the booming of the guns quite plainly. We got into camp at last, with our own and the 60th band playing us in. About twelve o\u2019clock we went up to see the various batteries, which rejoice in such names as the \u2018Metcalfe Battery\u2019 and \u2018Picket,\u2019 the \u2018Flagstaff Battery,\u2019 the \u2018Mosque,\u2019 the \u2018Hindoo,\u2019 the \u2018Crow\u2019s Nest,\u2019 the \u2018Subsee Mundee,\u2019 and several others, at all of which pickets are posted. We are in the second brigade here, composed of our old friends the 60th, ourselves, a regiment of Goorkhas, (a race of men who come from the hills, very short, very strong, very ugly, and fight like fiends), and a Sikh regiment. The Goorkhas are considered the most plucky and best fighters here, and are very fierce in their hatred of \u2018Pandy,\u2019 alias Jack Sepoy. The 60th got the credit of being the best regiment here before we came, and the Goorkhas asked to be brigaded with them, as they were the only regiment who knew how to skirmish properly, but they have not seen us at it yet. The second day we were here, we took our share of picket duty, and then, two days after, I was sent up to relieve\nthe picket at the Crow's Nest. I fancied I would not like picket duty on account of the balls, round shot and shell continually flying about, but before I had been two minutes in the Crow's Nest, I did not mind the whistling of the bullets at all, and then Pandy always fires so high that if any one is hit it is quite by mistake. The niggers have plenty of corn in front of the Crow's Nest where they can pepper away at us without being seen; and sometimes the bullets come flying over the breast-work of the Crow's Nest by volleys, and if they took even a very bad aim, they ought to hit some of us, as the breast-work is only up to my waist; but somehow or other, they don't. Then we have capital chances for practising with the Enfield rifle at long ranges; I have managed to tumble over two fellows, though I did not kill them; I did not run any risk as I sat down quietly on a stone in the battery, with my rifle resting on the breast-work, and caught my men while running across a gap in our wall. I had one or two close shaves up in the Crow's Nest, one ball passed across my chest and struck a point of rock just in a line with me, another came in through the door of the tent, and I felt the wind of it as it passed by my face while I was lying in bed in the tent. I was on duty at the Mosque picket a few days ago, and at night it was such beautiful moonlight, it reminded me so much of moonlight nights in winter at home, that I sat upon the edge of the roof for a couple of hours before going to bed, quietly thinking to myself of the best of mothers that ever a son was blest with. There were six of us at the Mosque picket together, and we all had our beds in one little room. I had the head of my bed just at a hole where a corner of the building had been carried away by a round shot, and so I had plenty of fresh air. I slept like a trooper as I always do, and a very jolly time we had of it.\" On Sunday, 13th September, he writes:\u2014\"Our breaching batteries played 'old harry' with the walls last night, and there are two jolly breaches this morning, and the niggers seem in a great funk and are not bothering us with musketry to-day. We storm the place at dawn to-morrow morning; we go in with our Colonel Campbell as our brigadier, so I expect we will go ahead rather, and he is not the man to hesitate, and I expect we will have great fun. I have taken your advice, and this morning burned all my old letters, so that in case of accidents they will not fall into any one's hands. And now, may God bless and protect you all.\"\n\nEight hours after the writing of this last letter, the heart so warmly rejoicing for the prospect of victory was still and cold in death, but \"victory was won.\" He was twenty-three years and three weeks old, and the bleeding hearts of those he so fondly loved, can truly say:\u2014\n\n\"We know no living one,\nWe would give for our sleeping son.\"\nThe subjoined extracts from letters from Colonel Campbell and some of his brother officers, will shew the character he had won in the regiment.*\n\nThe medal and clasp for the capture of Delhi has been received by his friends, accompanied by the usual letter from the secretary of state for war, which will long be retained in memorial of his gallant conduct and early but glorious death.\n\n* Colonel Campbell writes:\u2014\u201cI am most happy to give you all the information in my power regarding the glorious though sad death of your son; for it is, indeed, sad to be cut off so young. He had behaved most gallantly, and in taking the Water Bastion, shortly after our entry at the Cashmere Gate, he was very conspicuous. I directed a company to go in and clear it, there was only one small entry, sufficient to admit two men at a time. He was with the company, and they forced their entrance in a most intrepid manner. Your son had a personal encounter with a Sepoy inside the bastion, and he cut off his head with his sword at one blow. The scene of his death, which was very instantaneous, was in a narrow street. In the centre of the street which was about fourteen or sixteen feet wide, a gun had been planted, and in taking this gun he was shot dead on the spot. I saw him immediately and there was not a sign of life, so that he could have suffered no pain whatever. I can assure you, he is much regretted by his brother officers one and all. I saw sufficient of his conduct on that eventful day to pronounce him a fearless and intrepid officer.\u201d\n\nAn officer of the regiment witnessed his interment in the grave-yard of the cantonment; all the thirteen officers were buried at the same time. As soon as affairs are in a more settled state, a tablet will be erected to his memory by his brother officers.\u201d\n\nLieutenant Stopford, adjutant, writes:\u2014\u201cJullundur, 12th November, 1857. My dear Madam.\u2014Long ere this reaches you, you will doubtless have become acquainted with the death of your poor son, James Hill Bradshaw, who was killed in action at Delhi, on the 14th of September; but probably, you will not have received any account of the circumstances attending his death, and which I feel it my painful duty to put you in possession of. I will not dwell upon the loss that the regiment has sustained by the death of so gallant and so young an officer, a loss which is so deeply felt by all of us; but I will merely state the circumstances under which he met with his death, and which are as follows. He had escaped the assault unhurt, and was pressing on with the regiment to occupy the post appointed to it, when it was ascertained that a light field gun was in position pointing down a street up which we had to pass; to gain our point it became necessary to capture that gun, and it was in this important undertaking that your son lost his life. He was shot through the body by a musket ball when bravely leading on his men, and had he not fallen, he would have been first at the gun; he fell at my feet and expired almost immediately, the only words he uttered were, \u201cMy God, I am hit.\u201d His gallant behaviour elicited the warmest expressions of admiration from all who witnessed his conduct, and it will be a consolation to you and all his relations, to know that he whom you have lost, fell when leading on his men in a most gallant and soldier-like manner. I don\u2019t say this merely from a desire to offer you consolation on this very distressing occurrence, but I simply relate what came under my notice, and I in common with many others, know and feel it to be true. Under such circumstances as these, it is unnecessary for me to add more on behalf of his merits, unless it be to assure you how deeply we deplore the loss of so brave and promising an officer from among us. He was buried in the cemetery at Delhi, and we intend to erect a monument to his memory. I beg to offer you, on the part of myself and brother officers, our sincere sympathies with you.\u201d\n\nA young Canadian, then in India, in writing to his father in Quebec, says:\u2014\n\n\u201cAmong other places I sought out the spot where poor Bradshaw fell. He was shot through the heart and fell dead while leading on his men to take a gun. Just before this charge, he had cut off a Sepoy\u2019s head with his regulation sword at one\nCAPTAIN J. A. POPE, 67TH REGT.\n\nFew natives of Canada have served England in more varied climes, or during more eventful periods than the subject of the present notice. His services were not merely confined to the faithful discharge of his own peculiar duties, but on all occasions he was found cheerfully rendering assistance in departments with the business of which he made it a point to become acquainted during unoccupied hours. Possessed of great judgment and the faculty of intense application, he was favorably noticed at an early age, and thus paved his own advancement to rank in a branch which, till his appointment, had been conferred only upon military men.\n\nCaptain Pope, the subject of this memoir, was a member of the same family to which the present worthy mayor of Quebec, and Mr. Richard Pope, advocate, belong. He was born at Niagara, Upper Canada, on the 30th November, 1821. He was early initiated into the management of military hospitals, and at the age of fifteen became secretary to Dr. Gillkrest, the principal medical officer at Gibraltar. He accompanied his parents to Jamaica, in 1838, where he at once obtained the appointment of medical clerk, which he held until 1854. He married in 1842, Ann, daughter of James Evans, Esquire, of Orange Grove. In 1850, the cholera committed fearful ravages in the island, and the services then performed by Mr. Pope were brought under the notice of the authorities by the following letter addressed by the general commanding, to the secretary at war:\n\n\"KINGSTON, JAMAICA, 9th December, 1850.\n\n\"SIR,\u2014In submitting the enclosed letter from Dr. Maclean, the principal medical officer on this station, I do most earnestly solicit\n\nclean sweep. It is the only case of the kind on record during the siege. He was very much liked by every body who knew him.\"\n\nH. Gogarty, assistant surgeon, writes from Jullundur, March 10th, 1858:\n\n\"The last I saw of your son was on the morning of the assault. After our regiment had fallen in, in camp, there was a delay of nearly an hour, waiting for the engineers, I believe; during this time your son was sitting in the road along with me and one or two others. He was in excellent spirits, talking of the delay, the regiments that were passing us, and other commonplace topics. After the bugle sounded the advance, I did not see him any more, as my place was in the rear. I first heard of him from one of our wounded men, whose wounds I was dressing; he informed me of the sad event, and to use his own words, 'Oh, there is poor Mr. Bradshaw, sir, killed; a braver and a better officer never lived, he was leading us on when we were charging a gun and was shot dead.' I did not know until then, what a favorite he was among the men. We intend putting a tablet in Meerut church to his memory.\"\nyour attention to the statement therein contained relative to Mr. Pope, a gentleman whose valuable services (in a position you would hardly suppose could be made available in the way they have been) were brought under my notice, during the last two years, in a most favorable point of view.\n\n\"But his merits have been more eminently conspicuous during the many and great difficulties experienced (and which have been detailed by another hand) by the visitation of the most awful malady, the cholera, in the island, and which I am bound to declare entitle him to all the support in my power to afford.\n\n\"I do most sincerely hope you will be pleased to give your patient attention to this representation, as nothing but a sense of the eminent and extraordinary services performed by this talented individual, could possibly induce me to address you in a strain of praise, unusual perhaps in military communications.\n\n\"It has seldom fallen to my lot, to have had an opportunity of witnessing more talent, zeal and ability displayed by any one person, and I beg to add I know none more likely to make to his country a grateful return for any patronage or favor, you in your good judgment might think meet to bestow upon one so truly worthy of it.\n\n\"I have, &c.,\n\n\"T. Bunbury,\n\n\"The Right Honorable the Secretary at War.\"\n\n\"Major-General.\"\n\nThis recommendation was most favorably noticed by Mr. Fox Maule, who, in answer, expressed the sense of the Lords of the Treasury \"of the merits and valuable services of Mr. Pope, particularly during the prevalence of the cholera,\" and notwithstanding the regulation respecting pay, a substantial increase was forthwith allowed him, as a \"special grant,\" being \"without precedent.\"\n\nUpon the commencement of hostilities against Russia, Mr. Pope was gazetted paymaster to the 47th Regiment, which he accompanied to Varna and the Crimea, where he served till the reduction of Sebastopol, and the evacuation of the Peninsula. He was present at Alma and the sortie of the 26th October, 1854. On the morning of the battle of Inkerman he had a very narrow escape. The 47th were in the vicinity of the famous \"Sandbag Battery,\" and he had just issued from his tent, when a shell entered and exploded, shivering the saddle which had served for his pillow. This gallant corps played a distinguished part in that bloody encounter. The regiment also took an active part in the successful affair of the Quarries on the 7th June, 1855, simultaneously with the French attack, and capture of the Mamelon. The Quarries were obstinately held for a while by the Russians, and in one of\ntheir attacks, an instance of individual prowess occurred which obtained for the performer of it the rare honor of being mentioned in Lord Raglan's despatch. Lance-Corporal Quinn of the 47th, was Captain Pope's clerk, and obtained permission to take part in the action, and the enemy having wavered a little before the sharp fire from the British muskets, Corporal Quinn darted out of the works, towards a Russian officer and four men, who had advanced somewhat in front of the main body of the enemy. With the butt end of his musket he brained one of the soldiers, bayoneted a second, and the other two precipitately fled. Quinn then collared the officer, and administering a gentle stimulant with the point of his bayonet to accelerate his advance, dragged him a prisoner into the works. For this gallant exploit the corporal was promoted to an ensigncy in his regiment. The 47th left the Crimea in 1856, Captain Pope having in the meantime received the Crimean medal with the clasps, for Alma, Inkerman and Sebastopol. After being stationed for some months in Malta and Gibraltar, the regiment returned to England. In September, 1858, Captain Pope being desirous of more active service, exchanged into the 67th, then under orders for India, where he served until the mutiny was suppressed. He then accompanied his regiment to China on the breaking out of the war, and remained till ill-health compelled him to return to England in 1860. Never possessing a strong constitution, his health was undermined by frequent exposure and continued service in the call of duty. He still hoped to regain sufficient strength to return to China, and had arrived in London, to make preparations for his departure, when he fell ill, and died almost suddenly, on the 12th October, 1860. He had previously received the rank of captain, under the provisions of the royal warrant. He was an officer of much promise, and few have been so sincerely regretted as he by the companions of his campaigns.\n\nHis elder brother, Captain James Pope, late of the 3rd Buffs, entered the army when quite young, and served in Gibraltar, Malta, Jamaica, and Canada, and was stationed at lake Temiscouata during the boundary dispute in 1842. In 1854, he was appointed staff adjutant at Chatham, which office he filled until his promotion to a Captaincy on the staff. Shortly afterwards he accepted the adjutancy of the 2nd Royal Surrey Militia, an appointment which he still retains. He has written two works on military subjects which are highly spoken of, and is considered one of the best drills in the British army. He is not a native of this country.\nLIEUTENANT JOLY.\n\nEdmond de Lotbini\u00e8re Joly, born at Lotbini\u00e8re, in Lower Canada, the 16th November, 1832, a scion of the noble house of Lotbini\u00e8re, one of the oldest in the colony, having been in possession of the seignory bearing the same name for the last two hundred years.\n\nEdmond Joly attended the seminary of Quebec for some years, and finally went over to Paris, where he finished his studies. In 1850, he entered her Majesty's service as ensign in the 32nd, and spent the succeeding five years in India with his regiment. India being then in a perfectly tranquil state, he had no opportunities of distinguishing himself beyond what a few trifling skirmishes on the frontiers might afford. We will here give only one instance of his adventurous disposition, and a marked originality which always characterized him. While attached to a division of the army, marching across the Punjab, the encampment was one evening formed at the foot of a high monument, pointed out by tradition as the tomb erected by Alexander the Great over the remains of his famous horse, Bucephalus. The monument had only one aperture on its summit. At break of day Edmond Joly resolved to explore the interior; providing himself with a rope and torch he succeeded in scaling the pile, and having reached the opening, which had the appearance of a huge well, he let himself down the gloomy recess. A long search followed, but he failed in discovering any interesting relic; regaining the summit with empty hands, but covered with the dust of centuries, he appeared to the wondering army, standing as it were on a pedestal like a titular genius of the spot; to relieve him from this somewhat awkward position his colonel, the celebrated Markham, forwarded him with some despatches; carrying them over the plains he came suddenly, while at full gallop, upon one of the deep ravines or gullies, so numerous in this country; it was too late to draw back, so putting spurs to his horse he gallantly took the desperate leap, it proved however too much; the rider rolled on the opposite top and the horse at the bottom, and both horse and rider rolled to the bottom of the gulley; the fall was fatal to the poor animal, while Edmond Joly fortunately escaped with a few bruises. Having delivered his despatches, he procured the assistance of a dozen stout Sepoys, and drawing the remains of poor \"Nejib\" to the apex of the monument, he consigned them by torchlight to the depths below, where, no doubt, they will be found by some future explorer, and pass for the bones of Bucephalus.\nIn 1855, Lieutenant Joly was sent home on a two years' leave of absence, to restore his system, debilitated by a five years' residence in India. Returning by way of Egypt, he no sooner arrived at Malta, than a strong desire to serve his country in the Crimea, brought him to the walls of Sebastopol; here he served as a volunteer for several months, first attached to the 3rd Buffs, and subsequently to the 87th Connaught Rangers, until prostrated by a severe dysentery, he was conveyed to England in a transport freighted with the wounded and sick; he finally returned to Canada in ill health, but the bracing air of his native home, and an active life, soon restored him to health.\n\nIn the autumn of 1856, he embarked at Quebec for England, obtained a year's extension of absence, and spent the following winter in Paris. His polished address and courtly bearing brought him into high notice at the court of the emperor of the French; this was all the more flattering as a young lieutenant could not have expected this distinction.\n\nIn the spring of 1857, he again left for India, this time, however, with feelings of repugnance for which he could scarcely account. The enervating climate of the country and the unavoidable indolence resulting from it, perhaps also a fatal presentment of coming death, made his voyage a most tedious one.\n\nOn leaving England the rebellion had not broken out, and as time was no object, he made the voyage by way of the Cape. On his arrival in Calcutta, in July, 1857, he heard the first news from the pilot who boarded the vessel of the Sepoy rebellion, and the heartless massacre of almost all the women and children of the 32nd, his own regiment, at Cawnpore, and the desperate situation of his brother officers shut up in Lucknow. From that moment his sole thought was to effect their rescue. Finding that he would have to wait too long for the next detachment that might leave Calcutta, he resolved to start alone, and hazard capture at the hands of the insurgents whose bands scourred the country in every direction, in order to join General Havelock, then in full march for Lucknow.\n\nRegardless of the advice and warnings of all who knew him, and among them Lord Elgin, then at Calcutta, he set out alone, and escaping a myriad perils, reached Sir Henry Havelock at Cawnpore, 700 miles from Calcutta, just as he was leaving for Lucknow. His last letter to his father is dated from the camp before that place; he wrote: \"I hear from this the booming of the guns from the defenders of Lucknow; I will soon see my brave regiment, and that day will be the most glorious one of my life, perhaps it will be the last,\" then with his usual indifference \"I will soon be in Lucknow.\"\n\nOn the 26th of September, he fell, struck down by a bullet in the midst of the fearful struggle Havelock was sustaining, with his handful of heroes, while cutting a passage through the streets of\nthe city to the residency, still held by the remains of the 32nd; he was carried by his men to the residency, and a few days after had the consolation of dying in the arms of his friends whom he had come to rescue.\n\nThe commanding officer of the 32nd wrote a short time after to his father: \"He died expressing satisfaction at having arrived in time to rescue his comrades.\" The officers of the 79th Regiment loudly testified their admiration of his bravery while forcing a passage through the streets of Lucknow.\n\nThe glorious end of Edmond Joly's career shows what energy, courage and devotion he was possessed of, and what might have been expected from him by his country and his friends, had he not been cut off at the early age of twenty-four.\n\n---\n\nLIEUT. CHARLES McKAY.\n\nCharles McKay was the youngest but one of four sons who survived their father, the late Honorable Thomas McKay, M.L.C., of Ottawa, and was born in Montreal, 21st April, 1836, and educated at the high school of that city, and also in Edinburgh, Scotland, where he was at his studies when the Crimean war created so much military ardor amongst the youth of Britain. As a boy, he was remarkable for his steadiness, self-control and self-reliance, and a judgment beyond his years. Possessed of great personal strength and a fearless disposition, he was slow to anger; amiable and gentle in his deportment, and though not wanting in means or opportunity for indulgence, was temperate in all things.\n\nAt his urgent request, while at school in Edinburgh, a commission was obtained for him in a line regiment, and on May 10, 1855, he was gazetted to the 97th Regiment, then one of the strongest in the Crimea, the depot of which was at Preston, where he joined. So rapid was promotion in consequence of death vacancies, that on 21st December of the same year, he became lieutenant, without purchase, and embarked for Malta, where reinforcements were located to acclimatize them for the Crimea. In 1856, he sailed for Balaklava, where he arrived on the 11th March, after the fall of Sebastopol and the cessation of hostilities. On his return from the Crimea, he paid a visit to his family in Canada, which was abruptly terminated by the breaking out of the Sepoy rebellion, in 1857. He sailed with his regiment from Spithead, 5th August, 1857,\narrived at Calcutta in November, and was sent up, in December, to Benares, where his regiment formed part of General Frank's division, in the march to Lucknow. At Benares he was laid up with fever, on his arrival on the 16th December, and did not come off the sick list until the 2nd January. On the 4th, the regiment marched to Babudpoor. During this period his diary shows hard work\u2014up at four every morning, and sometimes on his feet till midnight; frequently going the whole day without food, and sleeping where only soldiers have to sleep. On the 8th, they were joined by two Ghurka regiments at Manccahoo. On the 22nd, they came up with the rebels at Secundia. Coming in from outlying pickets, on the morning of the 23rd January, young McKay was marched with the column to attack the Sepoys who were strongly fortified in the midst of a thick jungle. He writes, \"while the guns were blazing away, the 97th and two Ghurka regiments made a flank march, and sent out three or four companies, mine amongst the number, and blazed away at them, we killed about five hundred, and had only four or five wounded; our fellows bayoneted them right and left, and gave no quarter; we took three guns, and burnt all the villages in the vicinity.\" On the 19th of February, they drove the rebels out of Chaundra. On the 4th March, after a desperate fight at Moorshegunge, in which one of his brother officers (Smyth) was killed, General Frank's division marched to join Sir Colin Campbell's army before Lucknow, and on the 6th, the 97th were in the trenches, where McKay writes, they were \"pounding and being pounded at,\" for twenty-four hours at a stretch. On the 10th, he was again \"trotted off to the trenches,\" where, once or twice, while looking over the parapet, he narrowly escaped losing his head. \"At about two p.m. on the afternoon of the above day,\" he writes, \"the 42nd and 93rd Highlanders stormed and took the Martiniere. As soon as the Sepoys saw our Highlanders advancing across the open plain towards them, they began to make for the town in great style. While in the act of bolting, we favored them with an unlimited amount of shot and shell, which falling among a crowd of them, would knock scores of the brutes over. On the 11th, three companies, mine amongst the number, were marched toward the Ghurkas on the left, and here we had no end of skirmishing for two days; we drove the fellows into the town, the bullets dropping thick amongst us, but fortunately wounding very few. On the evening of the 13th, we moved over to the Secundrabagh, and the 97th killed upwards of eighteen hundred Sepoys in this building. The place is full of human bodies, and here we had to sleep for the night. At eleven a.m. next morning, received orders to advance on the Kysabagh, which was chock full of Sepoys; we trotted along at a pretty good rate, and when going up the different streets they peppered us in great style. On each side of the road, as we advanced, nothing but\ndead 'niggers' were to be seen, for the live ones kept pretty well under cover, and potted at us through loopholes, every house in the place being thoroughly loopholed. On our arrival inside the palace, then commenced the game, for we had to fight the brutes through each room as we went along. In the act of doing so, our Colonel Ingram was shot through the head. Just fancy fighting through rooms far superior to any in England, and the tables therein covered with gold and silver ornaments. Had hard fighting all that night and next morning\u2014found my Colt's revolver useful\u2014tumbled over two swell looking Sepoys with it\u2014kept on fighting till the 16th, when they all made their exit. I never slept out of my clothes from the 10th to the 20th, and for six nights at a time had not so much as one wink of sleep; we certainly had hard work for the number of days we were at it.\"\n\nIn announcing his death to his relations his brother officer says of Lieutenant McKay, \"He was mentioned in the despatches by our colonel for his conduct at the capture of Lucknow, which was beyond praise.\"\n\nHe remained in garrison at Lucknow until January, 1859, when he was ordered to Banda, in Oude, a march of fourteen or fifteen days from Lucknow, where he was attacked immediately on his arrival by small pox, and carried off after three days' illness, on the 13th February, 1859, in the twenty-third year of his age.\n\nIn communicating the sad intelligence to his elder brother, his most intimate friend and associate in the regiment, writes:\u2014\"I am sure it will be a great comfort to your mother to know that he was a good Christian, an upright and moral man, a brave, gallant and devoted soldier, and did his duty manfully to his Queen and country, through many a hard day's work. A nobler disposition and a better, kinder or truer friend could not be met with. I miss him fearfully, and I cannot even now feel reconciled to His decree 'who doeth all things for the best.'\" \"It is needless for me to add,\" he says in another letter, \"the great regret we all feel at his loss; with myself it is irreparable, as I can never expect to see his like again on earth. But it will gratify you all to know that a more gallant officer the Queen never had.\" About a year after receipt of the intelligence of his death, the following letter which explains itself, was received:\n\n{ \"No. 16537.\n\"12.\n\"(Lr. 115).\n\n\"WAR OFFICE, London, August, 1860.\n\n\"Madam,\u2014I am directed by the secretary of state for war, to transmit to you herewith, a medal which has been granted for Lieutenant C. McKay's services as an officer of the 97th Regiment of Foot, to be retained in commemoration of his gallant conduct in the campaign in India.\"\n\"You are requested to acknowledge the receipt of the medal upon the form herewith enclosed.\n\n\"I am, madam, your obedient servant,\n\n\"B Hawes.\"\n\n\"Mrs. A. McKay,\nRideau Hall, Ottawa, Canada, America.\"\n\n\"Hoc miserande puer!\nManibus date lilis plenis;\nPurpureos ut spargam flores, et fungas inani munere!\"\n\nMAJOR FORSYTH.\n\nMajor Gerrard J. Forsyth is a native of Montreal. He entered the military service at an early age, and rose to the rank of captain, at the age of twenty-six, without the aid of those influences that help others on. He has served through the eastern campaign of 1854-55, including the battles of Balaklava and Inkerman, siege of Sebastopol, capture of the Quarries, attack on the Redan on the 18th June, (with the storming column), and on the 8th of September, also at Kinbourn, for which he has received the medal and clasp, the Sardinian medal, and has been decorated with the Legion of Honor by the Emperor of the French. He retired with the rank of major, on the 26th of December, 1856. His career has testified to the valor and patriotism of the Canadians, and been a source of honor both to himself and his country.\n\nCAPTAIN STUART.\n\nCaptain Edward Andrew Stuart is a son of the late Chief-Justice Sir James Stuart, and was born on the 20th November, 1832. He entered the army on the 21st May, 1852, as an ensign in the 1st Royal Regiment of Foot, and was promoted to a lieutenancy on the 11th August, 1854. He served at the siege of Sebastopol from 22nd of April until he was severely wounded on the 7th June, 1855, for which he received the medal and clasp, and the fifth class of the Medjidie, and was promoted to the rank of captain.\nCAPTAIN ROBERTSON.\n\nCaptain George Robertson is a son of the late well known Dr. Robertson of Montreal. He joined the army as late as 17th of June, 1851, and in December, 1859, had been promoted to a captaincy. He served with the 12th Regiment, in the Caffre war of 1851-53, for which he received the medal, and was with the 95th Regiment at the siege and fall of Sebastopol, from 26th January, 1855, for which he received the medal and clasp, and was honored with the fifth class of the Medjidie. He also served in 1858, at the siege and capture of Kotah (medal.) The Gazette of his native city, in speaking of his former services, said \"our citizens will join with us in expressing our hearty congratulation on the honors bestowed upon him, which we cannot doubt have been well earned,\" and of him and other Canadians \"the whole country will rejoice at these honors won by Canadians.\"\n\nHIS LORDSHIP THE BISHOP OF ONTARIO.\n\nAs we have endeavored, to the best of our opportunities, to give notices of the four other English bishops of the province, we will not make the list imperfect by excluding from it one of the distinguished divines who had the good fortune to be elected to the bishopric of Ontario, a short time since, and which was founded but a short time previous to the election.\n\nThe Right Reverend John Travers Lewis, LL.D., is a native of Ireland, having been born in Cork about the year 1826; he is, therefore, thirty-five years of age, and is a comparatively young man to have attained to the high and holy office which he now holds. This fact goes a certain length to demonstrate the superiority of his talents; and when we state that he has not long resided in the province, we think we shall have proved that the appointment must be highly gratifying to his lordship, and also to his friends.\n\nHis lordship is a son of the late Reverend John Lewis, M.A., formerly of St. Anne's, Shandon, Cork, Ireland. He was educated\nat Trinity college, Dublin, where he graduated as senior moderator in ethics and logic; and held the distinguished position of gold medalist, having obtained classical and mathematical honors in his undergraduate course, and obtained the degree of LL.D. He was ordained deacon in the chapel of Christ's college, Cambridge, by the Lord Bishop of Chester, in 1848; was consecrated priest by the Lord Bishop of Down, and appointed to the curacy of Newtown Butler, in the county of Fermanagh. Shortly afterwards, having vacated this living, he came to Canada, and for four years officiated in the parish of Hawkesbury, Canada West, having been appointed thereto by the Lord Bishop of Toronto. At the expiration of that time he was placed in the rectory of Brockville, where he faithfully discharged his duties for seven years; and was then elected by the synod, convened at Kingston, in the summer of 1861, to the new bishopric of Ontario.\n\nTHOMAS G. RIDOUT, Esq.\n\nThe father of the subject of this notice, Thomas Ridout, came to this country in the year 1780, shortly after the American revolution. The incidents connected with his life\u2014how he was taken prisoner by the Indians, when passing down the Ohio river; how he escaped to Detroit, and finally to Canada, are full of interest, and we may return to the subject at a future time. Having arrived safely in Lower Canada, he became connected with one of the government departments. On the 10th October, 1792, Thomas G. Ridout, was born near Sorel; so that had he survived till October, 1861, he would have been sixty-nine years of age. In 1796, when the seat of the Upper Canada government\u2014with which Mr. Ridout would seem at that time to have been connected\u2014was removed to Niagara, the family went with it. Subsequently Mr. Thomas Ridout was appointed registrar of York, and more lately surveyor-general of Upper Canada. When the government was removed to Toronto, some years afterwards, the family came with it. \"Muddy Little York\" was then but an Indian settlement consisting of a few wigwams, and the young Ridouts' playmates on the spot where Toronto now stands, were the children of the red men of that day. Mr. Thomas G. Ridout's first business connections were with the commissariat, in which he acted as deputy assistant-commissary general. He was then nineteen years of age.\nHaving resigned this position, he was appointed cashier of the Bank of Upper Canada, which was then \"located\" in a small building, now used as a shoemaker's shop, and which stands on the corner of King and Frederick streets, opposite the Canada Company's office. In 1825, the bank was removed to the building on the corner of Duke and George streets, where it remained until lately\u2014all which time, except during the last few months of his life, Mr. Ridout acted as cashier. He died in September, 1861. He left behind him a widow and twelve children, ten of whom reside in this country, and two are officers in the army\u2014one in the 100th, now stationed at Gibraltar, and the other in the 80th, stationed in India. By marriage the family is connected with the Baldwins, the Sullivans, and the Boultons in Canada, and the Bramleys in the mother country. In private life Mr. Ridout was much esteemed. Upright in character, and exemplary in his dealings, he made for himself a large circle of friends, who deeply lamented his death. It is rather a singular coincidence that the bank and Mr. Ridout, may be said to have passed away from the old building together. Mr. Ridout died on the day that the bank was opened in the new house in Toronto.\n\nPAUL KANE, Esq.\n\nThe name of this celebrated painter, traveller and writer must awaken in the hearts of all Canadians a profound feeling of esteem and admiration, not only from the fact of his being a fellow countryman, but for the admirable manner in which he has overcome the various obstacles which he has encountered in life. The enviable position and reputation which he has earned without any friend to assist him, redounds much to his credit, and bespeaks our highest admiration. Born in Toronto, he early evinced a strong inclination for the profession which he has adopted. While at school, when other boys were playing or were amusing themselves, Paul was devoting all his attention to improving himself in drawing. For a long time, although his youthful productions were really meritorious, yet they were not so complete as they would have been, had he had the advantage of proper instruction and models to go by. Hardships beset his path, but at length, he felt emboldened to lay some of his drawings before Mr. Drury, the then drawing master of the Upper Canada college. This gentleman must have possessed a good heart and the power of\ndoing good, for perceiving at once that young Kane, if he received the necessary instructions, would eventually become a great genius in the art of painting, he forthwith enrolled him as one of his pupils, and from that day Kane's fortunes were fixed. In 1836, on the completion of his studies, or on mastering all that Mr. Drury could undertake to impart to him, Mr. Kane visited the United States, and lived in many places. For some time he endured great hardships, and fell into many scrapes, consequent on his pecuniary distress. On one occasion, on board a steamboat, he had to take the skipper's portrait to pay for his fare; nevertheless, he managed to live, exercising his profession and acquiring still more knowledge of the art. In 1840, by dint of great industry and untiring zeal, he had amassed a sum sufficient to carry him to the old world, there to complete his studies in the celebrated academies of Rome, Genoa, Naples, Florence, Venice, and Bologna. All these places he visited, and in each, studied for a time; living in humble lodgings and content with humble fare; doing his utmost to learn as much as possible. He went through the whole course of his studies with unflagging industry and perseverance, and travelled over a great portion of the continent of Europe, without one friend to help him, his only resource being in his own talents. He triumphed over everything with his extraordinary good fortune and indomitable zeal, and finally returned safe to his native city, in the spring of the year 1845, after nearly nine years' absence.\n\nAfter some necessary repose from his great labors, Mr. Kane had now to think how he should turn his acquirements to account, and at length formed the patriotic determination to enter the great north-west territory, bordering on Canada, and to delineate the habits, customs and physical peculiarities of the aborigines of his native land, and of the wild scenery of the far north. In this determination he was eminently successful, having twice entered the Hudson's Bay territory and travelled nearly everywhere over that vast country, thousands of miles were accomplished by land and the great rivers, with nothing to propel him and his comrades on the latter but the wooden paddle, and on the former the Indian snow-shoe. We could not do justice to the subject were we to attempt to describe the peregrinations of Mr. Kane; his able and excellent work will furnish all that; suffice it to say, that he travelled the whole extent of the continent, and effected the purpose for which he set out; namely, to give a true and accurate panorama of pictures of real Indian life. He again returned to Toronto, on the 9th of December, 1848, and brought with him one of the largest collections of aboriginal curiosities ever made on the continent, together with nearly four hundred sketches, illustrative of the manners, customs and physical peculiarities of about sixty different tribes of Indians. From these he commenced painting a series of elaborate and magnificent oil pictures, which are the\ndelight and boast of all those who have had the good fortune to possess or see them. In fact, by these pictures, Mr. Kane has established a world-wide reputation as a portrait and scenic artist; and may any day compete with the artists of the old world. He is, however, well known by his book, which he published in 1859, \"Wanderings of an Artist,\" &c., Longman & Co., London. This work created a considerable sensation, and was dedicated to the Honorable W. B. Allan, of Toronto, that gentleman having, it is understood, after Mr. Kane's return from the north-west, greatly befriended and patronized him.\n\nCOLONEL BALDWIN.\n\nColonel Baldwin, long a resident of Canada West, was born at Clohina, in the county of Cork, Ireland, the residence of his father, James Baldwin, Esquire. He was a brother of the late Dr. Baldwin, an eminent physician of Cork, which city he represented in the Imperial Parliament. He was also a first cousin of the late celebrated Daniel O'Connell, and a nephew of the gallant General Count O'Connell, of the French service. Colonel Baldwin was one of the Peninsula heroes, whose career is now a matter of history. He first entered the service of his country in the navy at the early age of fourteen years. He was obliged by ill health to leave that service, but desirous of a military career, he entered the army at sixteen, in the 87th Regiment, from which he exchanged into the 83rd, and afterwards into the 50th, in which regiment he obtained his company, after passing his examination with honors at the military college of Farnham. While with these regiments in the Peninsula, he was present at the battles of Talavera, Busaco, Fuentes D'Onor, Badajoz, Salamanca, Vittoria, Neiva, Nevelle, Orthes, and Toulouse, for all which he possessed a medal and ten clasps. At Talavera he was wounded in the head; at Badajoz, leading the stormers, he was twice thrown from the scaling ladders, and at Fuentes D'Onor he received a ball through the arm, for which wounds he obtained a pension. Colonel Baldwin was a good classical scholar, and in a conversation amongst officers, in which General Picton took part, the general used a classical quotation which Colonel, (then Lieutenant) Baldwin answered in the same language. This so gratified the general that he appointed him on his staff, and ever afterwards entertained the\nmost friendly feelings for him. He served in the 50th Regiment, when he acted as brigade-major, in Jamaica, and in other parts of the West Indies; but to his active disposition the mere routine of garrison duty became irksome, and he retired on half-pay. On visiting his native country he was induced by Colonel Cotter, then recruiting for the Brazilian service, to raise a regiment, which he did at Cork, and entered into the service of the emperor of Brazil. This service, however, from the mismanagement of the government, and the ill-treatment of his men, disgusted him; and the government ordering the regiment to the interior as settlers, he resisted at the request of the men, and finally obtained their discharge and shipment home. The Brazilian government tendered him pay for his services, which, under the circumstances, he refused.\n\nAbout 1828, he came to Canada, and after some time spent near the then town of York, he went to Peterborough, where he held property, and is remembered with the highest respect and esteem. He afterwards removed to the Gore of Toronto, then a wilderness, where he continued to reside until a short time before his death.\n\nIn the troubles of 1837 and 1838, Colonel Baldwin again made his services available to his country, and raised a regiment of militia, for the defence of the frontier. As a civilian he was a magistrate, and in that capacity earned the respect of his neighbors. He was fearless, honorable and impartial, and never during the long continuance of the high trust, to his death, did he condescend to receive fees, being in all the actions of his public life sans peur et sans reproche. He was a politician of the moderate reform party, and made many sacrifices for it. He was a strong supporter of his namesake, the late Honorable Robert Baldwin, between whose family and that of the colonel, there is some remote connection. Like many others, the colonel was overlooked when his party came into power; and too proud to ask as a favor what the party should have been proud to have the opportunity to offer, he remained in private life, and like Cincinnatus of old, tilled his farm for a living.\n\nHis decease took place at Toronto, on the 14th December, 1861. Colonel Baldwin left a family of seven children. His only son is an officer of the 100th Regiment, whose praise as one of the three officers distinguished as \"judges of distilce\" in that regiment, came as a ray of sunshine through the cloud, illuminating his death bed and reviving in him the love of that profession in which he gloried, and connected with which were the reminiscences of his youth and early manhood. By his death the country lost a gallant soldier; society an upright magistrate; his friends a generous, kind, hospitable gentleman, and his connections the dearest and most attractive of relatives in every place. He died a Roman Catholic, and received from that church all the imposing ceremonies in its power to bestow, as a mark of the high respect\nand esteem in which he was held; and we do not believe we assume too much in saying, that he was equally respected by every denomination of the citizens of this province acquainted with his character.\n\nS. ZIMMERMAN, Esq.\n\nOur next notice is of the above celebrated man who was unfortunately killed at the Desjardins canal accident on the Great Western Railway, in 1856. Mr. Zimmerman, at the time of his death, was in the very prime and vigour of manhood\u2014had but just commenced his career in public improvement\u2014was upon the first step in a new and extended sphere of improvement for the benefit of the public. Regarding this man as in every sense worthy of public regard, we have ascertained some facts in his personal history which will not be uninteresting to the general reader. He was born in Huntingdon county, Penn., in the year 1815, and spent his early years in that state. In 1842, he removed to Canada, having no capital but his own energy and farsightedness. He said afterwards to some persons who enquired of him respecting his commencement upon the line of enterprise which he followed so successfully, that his only effects, when he arrived in Canada, were a grey horse and buggy. It might be supposed, as he himself added, that he possessed no more capital than he required for his immediate use. He was then but twenty-seven years of age. He settled at Thorold, Canada West, and his first undertaking was the construction of four locks and an aqueduct on the Welland canal, which involved something like $100,000. Subsequently, he built, under contract, 120 miles of the Great Western Railway, the contract price for which was about $600,000. The building of the first suspension bridge at Niagara Falls, and of the great railroad bridge at the same place, engaged his attention and commanded his resources. He built the Cobourg & Peterborough, the Port Hope and Lindsay, and the Erie and Ontario Railways in Canada. Mr. Zimmerman originated, and completed the preliminary arrangement for building the Great Southern Railway, a new road to the west, nearly parallel with the Great Western, to the south of that line, and on a shorter and better route. This work was to cost some ten millions of dollars. It is doubted whether any man possesses the energy and capacity to successfully assume a work which Providence prevented him from carrying forward.\nNot long before his unfortunate death he had purchased a large property at Clifton, Niagara Falls, and in the vicinity of the suspension bridge, including the fine hotel known as the \"Clifton House,\" and his excellent taste and liberal ideas were illustrated in improving this fine estate, and adorning it artistically. Fifty-two acres on the cliff, directly opposite the American Falls, are enclosed with an iron fence and privet hedge. The topography of these grounds is diversified and picturesque. That part nearest the river is level, and this is laid out in gravelled walks, with shrubbery, forest trees and fountains. One fountain was constructed at a cost of $15,000. These groves and shaded promenades are lighted during the summer evenings with gas. The proprietor's residence stands on a bluff some sixty feet high, midway of the ample grounds. In the summer it is nearly hidden by the foliage of the surrounding trees. This dwelling is an unpretending mansion, but had always been the scene of generous hospitality, while occupied by its princely owner. He had perfected the most extended and elaborate plans for the establishment near the same spot of an elegant mansion-house, with the proper accessories and surroundings. The foundations of a building of Cleveland sandstone and Canadian brick, to cost $175,000, were laid in 1855, and the work was to be prosecuted immediately. His lodges, of which there are four, the conservatory, and tenements for his servants, are models of taste. His stables cost $48,000. From the terraces on the grounds and the portico of his dwelling, a splendid view of the American Falls is obtained. The Clifton House is near by\u2014one of the most complete and popular hotels that any watering place can boast. This was owned by Mr. Zimmerman, and was worth over $300,000. At Elgin, on the western side of the river, at the suspension bridge, he formerly owned a large property, which his own liberal expenditure and judicious enterprise had rendered very valuable. This was sold in 1855 to his friends, Messrs. Pierson and Benedict, for $200,000. At Toronto, he owned property valued at $400,000. At Hamilton, an estate worth $100,000. He was owner of the steamer Zimmerman, on lake Ontario, and half owner of the Peerless, (which was recently lost in the great naval expedition to Beaufort,)\u2014his interest in both amounting probably to $100,000. Some 18,000 acres of land, in different parts of Canada, belonged to him. He estimated his property to be worth three millions of dollars.\n\nMr. Zimmerman was twice married. His first wife was Miss Woodruff, the only daughter of a worthy and influential gentleman at St. Davids, near Niagara Falls. This lady bore him two sons, who are still living. She died in November, 1854. On the 16th December, 1857, he was married to a Miss Dunn, of Three Rivers, Canada East. Mr. Zimmerman was a man of limited education, but he was endowed with sterling mental gifts.\nMAJOR PATTINSON,\n\nGovernor of Heligoland.\n\nMajor Richard Pattinson is a son of R. P. Pattinson, Esquire, of Sandwich, C.W., and a military officer of some standing. Born, we believe, in the province, he studied at the universities of Glasgow and Cambridge. He served fifteen years in India, and was adjutant-general of the cavalry at Alliwale; was present at the battle of Mahagepore in 1848; went through the campaign of Suttledge; had a horse shot under him at the battle of Budderwall, and was present at Sobraon. He has received three medals. He returned to Canada in 1850; but had to depart shortly after for the Crimea, and passed through the whole of the eastern campaign. In 1857, he was appointed governor of Heligoland.\n\nLockyer says of him: \"Few officers of his standing have had the good fortune to have seen so much hard fighting with such brilliant results.\"\n\nSIR W. F. WILLIAMS, Bart., K.C.B., D.C.L.,\n\nCommander-in-Chief of the Forces in Canada.\n\nSir William Fenwick Williams deserves to have his name placed in this work, not only on account of the public positions which he has held in this province with so much honor and integrity to us and himself, but also because of his being a colonist, having first seen the light at Halifax, in the adjoining province of Nova Scotia. Our sister dependency can thus lay claim to having given birth to one of the most talented and distinguished soldiers of the present day.\n\nFour or five years ago in the world's history Sir William Fenwick Williams, of Kars, was unknown to the world at large. Like the gallant Havelock, he suddenly rose into fame, and his name in a few days became a \"household word\" in the homes of Englishmen.\n\nHe is the only surviving son of the late Thomas Williams, Esq., commissary-general and barrack-master at Halifax, in Nova\nScotia, who died in 1807, by his wife Maria, daughter of Captain Thomas Walker. He is one of a family consisting in all of five daughters and two sons; and his elder brother, Lieutenant Thomas Gregory Townsend Williams, of the Royal Artillery, served under the Duke of Wellington in the Peninsula and in France, and died after the combat at New Orleans, in 1814. He was born in Nova Scotia in December, 1800, and at an early age was placed in the Royal Academy at Woolwich, through the interest of the late Duke of Kent. In 1825, having passed through the regular course of study with credit, he was gazetted to a second lieutenancy in the Royal Artillery, and obtained his promotion to the rank of first lieutenant in 1827, and to that of captain in 1840.\n\nFrom a speech delivered by Earl Granville in the House of Lords in May, 1856, in proposing the grant of a pension of \u00a31,000 to the subject of this memoir, we gather that Lieutenant Williams, whilst still very young, was sent out on special service to act as an engineer in Ceylon, where he remained during nine years of active and constant employment. He subsequently spent some time in Turkey, previous to 1843, when we find him promoted to the rank of brevet-major for his military services, and commissioned by the Earl of Aberdeen, then secretary of state for foreign affairs, to act on behalf of England in concert with our ambassador at Constantinople and the British minister at Ispahan, in settling the disputed limits of the Persian and Turkish territories in Asia\u2014a task which made large demands on his judgment and diplomatic ability, and was ultimately accomplished by him in such a way as to obtain the commendation of his superiors, and to mark him out as a proper person for further employment of a similar kind. We have heard that out of the nine years during which the settlement of the Turkish frontier engaged his attention, he spent no less than four years under a canvas tent, and suffered severely in health and person from the feverish character of the climate and the frequent attacks of robbers.\n\nUpon the establishment of a friendly understanding between the Court of St. James and the Ottoman Porte, the late Sir Hussey Vivian, who at that time was master-general of the ordnance, selected Major Williams for the post of instructor in artillery practice to the Turkish army; and we are only repeating the opinion publicly expressed by Earl Granville when we state that, under his training, the Mussulmen rapidly improved in that branch of military education.\n\nIn May, 1847, we find Major Williams taking a prominent part in the conferences at Erzeroum, which resulted in the well-known treaty signed there between England and the plenipotentiaries of Turkey and Persia. For his services on this occasion, which involved many delicate and difficult points, he was promoted to the brevet rank of lieutenant-colonel.\nThis rank he held at the time when the Russian war broke out, and when his eastern experience pointed him out as one of those officers whose talents and energies could be turned to good account. Lord Clarendon, who at that date held the seals of the foreign office, at once selected Colonel Williams as the fittest man for the post of her Majesty's commissioner at head quarters with the Turkish forces, with the rank of a brigadier-general. His appointment was dated in July, 1854: early in the following September he reached Erzeroum, and before the close of the month proceeded onward to Kars\u2014a city whose name he was destined to render famous through all time in the annals of English military exploits.\n\nTo use the emphatic and impressive term of Lord Granville, certain \"painful events\" arose in the course of the year; during which General Williams held the command of Kars, on which severe comments were passed by the daily papers and society at large. These \"painful events,\" however, upon being thoroughly sifted, resolved themselves into one notorious fact, that although the gallant general had repeatedly sent official information to Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, our ambassador at Constantinople, that the force at his disposal was too weak to be able to hold permanent possession of the place, his excellency, from private pique or personal jealousy, chose to turn a deaf ear to his requests for further supplies of men and money, and refused to send assistance until it was too late to be of any avail. But we are anticipating events.\n\nWith the assistance of Colonel Teesdale, Colonel Atwell Lake (known to the Russians as the English Todtleben), and General Kmety, General Williams was enabled to render the petty fortification of Kars almost impregnable. On September 29th, 1855, after the town had been invested for four months by Mouravieff, General Williams resolved to give his besiegers battle, and, after a sanguinary conflict of eight hours' duration, defeated a much larger force than his own, on the heights which rise above Kars. This victory at once raised General Williams into note as the \"hero of Kars;\" he was almost immediately afterwards gazetted a knight co'nnander of the Bath; whilst the Sultan honored him with the rank of mushir, or full general, in the Turkish service.\n\nStill, however, with the scanty force at his disposal, General Williams was unable to force Mouravieff to raise the siege, as he hoped to have been able to do had he been properly seconded by the haughty ambassador at Constantinople. It will be enough to state here that the siege was pressed on more closely than ever; and as week after week no reinforcements arrived, and the garrison army (for so we ought, perhaps, to call it), began to die from hunger. At length, on the 14th November, the gallant defenders of Kars were forced to capitulate and surrender their swords to General Mouravieff as prisoners of war, Lord Stratford thus\nrobbing the dearly bought victory of all its fruits, and the British\narms of everything but the prestige of bravery and valor which\nthey had gained upon the heights above Kars. In the words of a\ncontemporary, \"hunger and an Armenian winter amply seconded\nthe jealousy and haughty indifference of the British ambassador.\"\n\nTogether with his comrades and colleagues\u2014Colonels Lake,\nTeesdale, and Thompson\u2014General Williams was taken as a prisoner\nto Moscow, and afterwards to St. Petersburgh, where they were\nall treated honorably and respectfully, as was their due. Peace\nwas concluded early in the following year between England and\nRussia; and it was not without cause suspected that Kars was\nvoluntarily and deliberately sacrificed by Lord Stratford de Redcliffe\nin order to compensate Russia for the loss of Sebastopol. The\nwhole matter was freely canvassed in Parliament at the time; but\nthe ministry contrived to throw dust in the eyes of the people.\nLord Stratford de Redcliffe was visited with no official censure or\nrebuke; and the nation at large was forced to conclude that whole\narmies and their generals are but blind chessmen or draughtsmen\nin the hands of their rulers, who play a fearful game of hazard,\nfor the conduct of which they are responsible to none.\n\nEarly in the following month of May (1856) General Williams\nand his friends landed once more upon the shores of England. On\nthe 10th of that month a royal message was sent to both houses of\nParliament recommending the House of Commons to enable her\nMajesty to make provision for securing to Sir W. F. Williams a\npension of \u00a31,000 a-year for the term of his natural life, in\nacknowledgment of his services, which we have already specified\nin detail. In addition to this tangible reward, General Williams\nwas placed as a major-general on the fixed establishment, and\ngazetted to a baronetcy, as Sir William Fenwick Williams of Kars.\nIn the following July he was appointed commander of Woolwich\ngarrison, and returned M.P. for the Borough of Calne, positions\nwhich he vacated in 1858, to accept that of commander-in-chief\nof the forces in British North America, thus returning to his\nnative country in one of the highest positions his sovereign could\nappoint him to. From October 12, 1860, to January 22, 1861, he\nadministered the government of Canada during the absence of the\ngovernor general (Sir E. W. Head), and during the short time he\nheld that high appointment, he performed the arduous duties with\na zeal and activity which many governors would do well to imitate.\nThe bestowal of a baronetcy on the gallant general may be con-\nsidered a greater compliment from the fact that, with the exception\nof the titles conferred on Admiral Lyons and General Sir John\nBurgoyne, it is the only hereditary dignity which was given in\nconsequence of the Russian war, though between thirty and forty\nindividuals reaped the less substantial prizes of the order of the\nBath.\nIn speaking of General Williams, it was remarked by Lord Grenville that most of the conditions of a first-rate general were found in him. \"A well known ancient historian,\" said the noble lord, \"lays down that a general must not only be a good engineer, a good geographer, a good manager of persons, well acquainted with human nature, and something of a statesman, but must also exhibit in himself a power of descending with ease into little things, and to become, if necessary, his own commissary and his own clerk. These conditions were found in an eminent degree in Sir W. F. Williams; and indeed there is only one point in which he has not shown the highest qualities of a general, and that is in not having as yet had an opportunity afforded him of showing his powers of manoeuvring a large force upon the field,\" which we might add he may perhaps have before he vacates his command in this country, and prove himself to be \"the competent general,\" which we Canadians and the people of England believe him to be, notwithstanding the late attacks made upon him in a London journal.\n\nGeneral Williams is a thorough English gentleman; he has proved himself such in his every action in this country, and, in fact, in his every action throughout life. We can hardly say more, except that here in Canada he is universally esteemed, and held by all classes in the highest respect. This feeling was evinced in a great measure during the recent visit of the heir apparent, when in many places the general was as much an object of the people's enthusiasm as our future king. On his first visit to America, in 1858, he was the recipient of innumerable demonstrations and dinners by the public bodies in all the cities and towns in British America.\n\nHe has also been rewarded by the Sultan of Turkey with the order of the Medjidie of the first class, and has been presented with the freedom of the city of London, accompanied by the gift of a splendid sword. He was also created an honorary D.C.L. of Oxford, at the annual commemoration in 1856.\n\nJ. T. MACKENZIE, Esq., M.D., M.R.C.\n\nA native of Canada, having been born we believe in Toronto, C.W. He commenced the study of medicine in July, 1852, with the late Dr. John King, and after attending Toronto college, where he carried off many valuable prizes, and took the degree of\nM.B., he went to England, and entered at Guy's Hospital, London, where he passed and received the diploma of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. Soon after he was placed in medical charge of a detachment of her Majesty's troops on the voyage to India. Immediately on the troops being landed in India, he was placed in medical charge of the Hon. East India Co.'s invalids bound for England. He received the highest encomiums for both services, and was allowed to present himself for the commission of surgeon in the company's service. At the East India House, in July, 1858, after six days examination of thirty-nine candidates, his name was placed No. 2 on the first class, No. 1 being one of the teachers in Guy's Hospital, so that Mr. MacKenzie took precedence of thirty-seven of the picked men of Edinburgh, Dublin and London. He got his commission and (an unusual favor) his choice of Presidency, and a present of a free overland passage to India, equal to \u00a3105 sterling. Dr. MacKenzie had no patronage, but his own abilities, and is the first medical student from Canada who has ever competed for the commission of the H.E.I.C.\n\n---\n\n**Mrs. Moodie.**\n\nSusanna Moodie was born on the 6th of December, 1803. She is the sixth daughter of the late Thomas Strickland, Esquire, of Beydon Hall, Suffolk, England. This family is, indeed, a most talented one; out of six daughters five are more or less celebrated as writers for the press. Elizabeth, the eldest, has written for and still conducts, several well known magazines in London, (G.B.) although her name never appears to the public. Agnes, who is the best known, principally through her many and masterly historical works and novels. Jane Margaret, who bears a reputation for her religious works, although in her earlier days she wrote tales and poetical pieces to suit the times. She lately published a history of Rome*; then comes Mrs. Traill, of whom we speak elsewhere, and last but not least, Mrs. Moodie, the subject of this notice. Another member of this family is Colonel Strickland, of Peterborough, C.W., who has resided in the province since his boyhood, and obtained his rank through serving in our militia during the rebellion.\n\nMrs. Moodie lost her father at the early age of thirteen, by whom she was educated. Mr. Strickland had been a man of some\n\n\"*Rome, Regal and Republican,\"\nwealth, and spent most of his leisure time in educating his numerous daughters, though he was not spared to witness the fruits of his care; he met with some great pecuniary losses by the bankruptcy of a friend for whom he had endorsed very heavily. The shock of this loss was the immediate cause of his death; he being in delicate health at the time.\n\nThe family, though still possessed of a large property, were obliged to live a good deal in seclusion. Susanna commenced to write very early, we believe, when between fifteen and sixteen. Her early productions were poems and tales for children. For many years she wrote for annuals and various periodicals, sometimes under her own signature, but more frequently under a feigned one.\n\nIn 1829-30, she published a book of poems entitled, \"Enthusiasm and other poems\". The same year, visiting London, she met Mr. Moodie, a lieutenant in the 21st Fusiliers, then upon half-pay, to whom she was married on the 4th of April, 1831.\n\nMr. Moodie (John Wedderbar Dunbar), is the fourth son of the late Major Moodie of Melssetter, in the Island of Hoy, one of the Orkneys. They left England the following year, immediately after the publication of Mr. Moodie's book upon South Africa, where he had been ten years previous to his visit to and marriage in England. Upon their arrival in Canada they went up to Cobourg, C.W., where they remained a few months, and then bought a farm in the township of Hamilton, eight miles from Cobourg. They remained there about a year, when they were persuaded to go to the back woods, ten miles north of Peterborough, then a perfect wilderness. It was, however, supposed that the river Trent would be soon made navigable for steamers, which would have soon made the then village of Peterborough a city. This idea has never been carried out. They remained in the township of Toronto more than eight years. Having spent all available means in purchasing wild lands, &c., which was represented to them to be the best way of investing money, and not being fitted by birth or education for such a laborious life, they were very soon reduced to great poverty. In this they were not alone, as almost all their neighbors, gentlemen and ladies by birth, were suffering the same hardships. Mrs. Moodie describes this better in her \"Roughing it in the Bush,\" than we could do; a work she published many years afterwards, in the hope of deterring people of gentle birth and education from settling so far from civilized life. Upon the rebellion breaking out in 1837, Mr. Moodie left for Toronto; Mrs. Moodie was left with four little children, the eldest only five years of age and the youngest only a few months; they consequently suffered many hardships. An old Irish servant being their great assistant in keeping the family in food and wood. They lost many of their crops the following summer for the want of men to harvest it. In 1839, Mr. Moodie being stationed at Belleville, as paymaster to that division of the militia,\nunder command of Colonel de Rottenburg, he obtained the situation of sheriff of the county of Hastings, when that county was separated from the midland district, which office he still retains.\n\nIn 1850, Mrs. Moodie published in England, \"Roughing it in the Bush\"; most of which had been published before in the \"Literary Garland,\" (a periodical published in Montreal by Mr. John Lovell), and had been written at the very time she was undergoing the scenes she so feelingly describes.\n\nThis work, being so very successful in England, induced Mrs. Moodie to publish \"Life in the Clearings,\" \"Flora Lindsay,\" and several other books of a fictitious character.\n\nMrs. Moodie has had seven children; one died an infant in 1840, and another fine boy of five years of age was drowned in the river Moira, which flows through Belleville; the latter was a great blow to both parents, as they were devoted to their children. Of the remaining five, the two eldest daughters have been for some years married and settled in Toronto; the three younger sons are all unmarried, and with them in Belleville.\n\n---\n\n**Mrs. Catherine P. Traill.**\n\nThis distinguished Canadian authoress, a member of the celebrated Strickland family, and a sister of Mrs. Moodie, of Belleville, C.W., was born about the year 1805, and was the first of the six sisters who began to write, and display the high genius which has since been exhibited by them, as authoresses. At sixteen years of age, she wrote a series of juvenile books, which were bought by Harris, of St. Paul's Churchyard, and appeared without her name. So remunerative did these books prove, and so engaging was the employment, that she wrote for many years for Darton, and other juvenile publishing houses, with great success. In 1832, Miss Strickland married Lieutenant Traill, of the Scotch Fusiliers, a friend and brother officer of her sister's (Mrs. Moodie) husband. Soon after, they migrated to Canada, and lived in the neighborhood of Rice Lake. Here she wrote her \"Backwoods of Canada,\" published by Charles Knight, of London, in his \"Library of Useful and Entertaining Knowledge,\" a work which was eminently successful. It is a charming book and presents a truthful picture of the subject delineated, as well as of the hardships of an early settler's life. Encouraged by the success of this, she afterwards\nbrought out \"The Canadian Crusoes,\" which was also very popular. Previously to this, Mrs. Traill contributed largely to Chambers's Journal, Sharpe's London Magazine, and other periodicals. In 1854 appeared her \"Ramblings in the Canadian Forest,\" and a few years later, her \"Female Emigrants' Guide,\" a useful work, which, from mis-management, was not as successful as her previous works. It has recently been brought out in a new form, by Stanford, of London, and is very popular. She is now preparing a new work on the \"Forest trees and wild flowers of Western Canada,\" which is spoken of very highly by some of her friends, who have seen the MS. Mrs. Traill is now a widow. She has a large family, and lives at Lakefield, township of North Douro. We hear that some of her friends are exerting themselves to secure her a pension for her great services to Canada. We are confident none more deserves one than this lady, who, by her works, has done more towards inducing people of condition and capital to settle in Canada, than any other writer on this country. She is fully entitled to an ample recompense, and, indeed, should long since have received the fruits of her industrious life.\n\nMISS MURRAY\n\nIs a true Canadian literary celebrity, standing at the head of the list of our female writers.\n\nWishing to obtain some information respecting her career, we wrote to a reverend gentleman, who, we had understood, was a friend of the lady's; and his reply appears to be so truthful, and to embody the information sought for in so satisfactory a manner, that we cannot refrain from producing the original:\n\n\"Miss Murray, to whom you refer in your letter to me, is a person of real genius, and would make her mark (as the saying is) in the world, had she ambition enough to make her very careful of fame. But she, really, is too great to care for notoriety, or to wish to be admired by the masses. Her father was a British officer, and served with distinction in Canada, during the war of 1812. He is still alive, and resides with his family on Wolfe Island, opposite Kingston. A work of Miss Murray's has lately been purchased by a large publishing house in London, England, and will, I believe, shortly appear. She is a poetess of a high order, if I am at all capable of judging, a good romance writer, and one of...\"\nthe most discriminating of critics and essay writers, taking bold, large, original views on almost every subject of human thought, and capable of shewing, with vivid distinctness and clearness of unmixed outlines, the idiosyncrasies of each writer, so that they may stand out in their individualities in bold relief. Her own peculiarity, however, is power, and she revels especially therefore in the concrete. She only needs an introduction to the literary world to take her place amongst the great heroines of mind, and I hope to live to see her enrolled in the list of the worthies, who have ornamented and elevated life; for I do wish to see every soul with the genuine ring occupying the place which of right is theirs; the true and the good and the noble and the able in their true positions, and the unreal and the sham in their places too. If we are, we are; and if we are not, it is vain for us to essay the impossible. We must fall into our true place in the ranks of the world sooner or later, for the canker of time will finally eat out whatever is not gold. I tell you, sir, that she is amongst the genuine gold productions of great mother nature, and will yet have (if only she can be made to covet it highly) the stamp of current sterling stamped upon her by the judgment of mankind, if my opinion be worth much.\"\n\nMRS. LEPROHON.\n\nWe feel much satisfaction in being enabled to give a notice of one of the few native born Canadian ladies who have devoted themselves to the advancement of our native literature.\n\nMrs. Leprohon, better known to the public and most of our Canadian readers by her maiden name of Miss Rosanna Elenor Mullins, the accomplished and talented authoress, was born at Montreal, and received her education in that city.\n\nAt the early age of fourteen, she evinced a strong inclination for writing; and from that time became a steady contributor, both of prose and verse, to the celebrated Literary Garland, published by John Lovell, of Montreal. Under the initials of \"R. E. M.\", she became speedily known; and her pieces were invariably admired and received the encomiums of all. Every one was surprised to see in one so young, talents of so high an order, capable of producing compositions of such grace and beauty. Among the many tales contributed by her to the Garland, none were so well received or so popular as \"Ida Beresford,\" (since translated and published\nin French), \"Florence Fitz Hardinge;\" and \"Eva Huntingdon,\" tales of fiction and pathos of so high a character, that they may, without exaggeration, be ranked among those of the same class, by the best English or American contributors to the periodical press. She afterwards became enrolled on the staff of some of the American journals and magazines.\n\nIn 1860, Mrs. Leprohon became connected with the Family Herald by the same publisher, and whilst engaged on that paper, wrote her celebrated tale of the \"Manor House of De Villerai;\" wherein she made it her object to describe faithfully the manners and customs of the peasantry or habitants, as they are called, of Lower Canada. It was also written to illustrate that period of our history embracing the cession of Canada to England. In all that she purposed, the authoress was eminently successful, and so popular was this work, that it was translated into French, and published in book form. This work has, according to general opinion, been considered as the very best written on Canada, and adds another laurel to Mrs. Leprohon's well earned fame. In the same year she translated into English the words of the cantata of Mr. Sempe, written to commemorate the visit of the Prince of Wales, sung before his royal highness, whilst in Montreal, by the Oratorio Society of that city.\n\nMrs. Leprohon is also a very superior musical artiste and linguist, endowed with great general abilities and accomplishments. She married, in 1851, Dr. Leprohon, a French Canadian gentleman of Montreal, by whom she has a young and interesting family.\n\nREV. J. A. ALLEN.\n\nMr. Allen is a Canadian poet and writer, residing at Kingston, Canada West. In 1854 he published his celebrated poem, \"Day Dreams,\" which was received with great approbation. He is the author of a Greek Lexicon, and undoubtedly a gentleman of education as his works fully show. He is perhaps, even more a philosopher than a poet, of a deep enquiring mind and a very Coleridge in conversation. He will never write anything as good as his \"talks;\" and there is that in him, which might, and without doubt will enrich our dramatic literature.\n\n\"Day Dreams,\" is a speculative and philosophical poem, and as such is not to be comprehended in a hasty and careless glance. It\nshows a high and rich intellect, without which imagination is never worth much; the true poetic spirit and power of expression are to be found there. It is not a poem of mere fancy or sentiment; it appeals to the highest faculties of our nature, and by them it must be judged. It is addressed to free speculative minds imbued with a sense of the wonderful and beautiful in nature; and that sense pervades every line of the poem. An intense perception of the unity of life and power in all existence, a deep feeling of the grandeur and might of the boundless infinite, which encompasses us, and into which the pioneers of science advance farther every year, and a firm faith in the final triumph of the beautiful, the good and the true, prevail throughout. The poet also evidently holds the conviction that we live not under capricious and arbitrary conditions, but under general and invariable laws which operate on us, as a part of God's universe. Those who admire rich fancy and imagery woven round the grandest thoughts which the soul can conceive, should read the poem and judge for themselves. That philosophical poems are not as popular as those which are composed to excite emotion, is not to be denied; for one, who reads \"Ulysses,\" or \"The Two voices;\" there are a thousand who read \"The Miller's Daughter;\" but to those, who deny to poetry an intellectual dominion, and believe that it has no affinity with science, we might only quote the words of one of the greatest teachers of the age: \"Poetry will more and more be understood as nothing but higher knowledge, and the only genuine romance for grown persons, reality.\" The author recognizes a progressive revelation of that God, who is the \"central mind\" of the universe from age to age, has a profound conviction of the work of truth and rectitude, and a deep faith of the lofty destinies of the human soul. And now, when the philosophy of Auguste Comte, which ignores the spiritual element altogether, is rapidly spreading, a poem which shows us that \"the noblest ministry of nature is to stand as the apparition of God,\" ought to be properly appreciated by all who have faith in the Divine in nature and in the soul of man.\n\nMr. Allen married the daughter of the Baron de Longueuil, but we are not aware whether he has any family by this distinguished lady.\nABBE J. B. A. FERLAND.\n\nM. Ferland's reputation rests upon his literary productions, although he is at the same time a distinguished ornament of the Roman Catholic Church in Canada. Although his productions have not been very numerous, they are held in great estimation, on account of the circumstances under which they were written, chiefly amid the performance of his arduous professional services. The abb\u00e9 is a profound scholar, and has labored strenuously in his favorite studies. He is therefore well acquainted with the subjects on which he treats in his several publications, more especially with everything connected with the history of Canada. He is descended from the family of Freland, formerly of Poitou, in Vend\u00e9e, France, in the 17th century; a member of which emigrated to this country and settled on the Island of Orleans, near Quebec. Here the name was changed to its present style; and the father of the historian was married to a daughter of M. Lebrun De Duplessis, one of the four advocates who remained in Quebec after the conquest. M. Ferland was born at Montreal on the 25th of December, 1805.\n\nIn 1813, his mother went to reside at Kingston with her son, and there he pursued his early studies. In 1816, he entered the college of Nicolet, where he remained until 1823, when he was admitted to holy orders; served for one year as under secretary to Monseigneur Plessis, and afterwards became professor of arts, rhetoric, and philosophy, at Nicolet. In 1828, he was admitted to the priesthood; was vicar, and served at Rivi\u00e8re du Loup, and St. Roch, Quebec; and acted as first chaplain of the marine hospital, during the cholera of 1834. He was appointed curate of St. Isidore; and, in the first of the same year, was appointed curate of St. Foy, as also at Ste. Anne de Beaupr\u00e9, in 1837.\n\nIn 1841, he was appointed superintendent of students at Nicolet, and became superior of that institution in 1847. A year later, he was called upon to reside at the archiepiscopal palace, Quebec.\n\nIn 1856, he proceeded to France, for the purpose of gathering materials for an early history of Canada. In this expedition, he was eminently successful; and, on his return, published \"Observations on an History of Canada by l'Abb\u00e9 Brasseur;\" and subsequently, \"Notes on the Registers of Notre Dame de Quebec;\" \"A Voyage to Labrador;\" lately the first volume of \"Courses of History of Canada, from 1584 to 1683;\" and \"A Journal of a Voyage to the coast of Gasp\u00e9,\" with other narratives. M. Ferland is a gentleman of much goodness of heart and amiability of manners, and is much esteemed in Lower Canada.\nE. VAN CORTLANDT, M.D., F.R.C.S.\n\nThis gentleman is well known in scientific and other circles as a mineralogist, geologist, botanist and physician of considerable repute in the province, and as one who has done much to advance the interests of the Ottawa country, in the capital of which he has resided for many years.\n\nDr. Van Cortlandt was born in Newfoundland, in the year 1805; he is the son of a retired military officer and a devoted loyalist, who was connected with some noble English families; his sister married Sir E. Buller, and her grandson is the present Lord Elphinstone. Dr. Van Cortlandt received his education at the celebrated school of the late Rev. D. Wilkie, LL.D., Quebec, and, at the early age of fourteen, left to study medicine under the late Dr. Hacket, with whom he remained until he proceeded to England, in 1825. In 1827, he passed his examination at the Royal College of Surgeons in London, having received, on the occasion, some very flattering encomiums from the celebrated Abernethy and Sir A. Carlisle, for the creditable manner in which he passed through the vigorous ordeal. In 1829, Dr. Van Cortlandt was chosen librarian to the Royal Medical and Chirurgic Society of London, having ten or twelve English competitors, in preference to all of whom he was chosen, probably in a great measure on account of the remarkably flattering notice of his examination at the Apothecaries Hall; here he had been desired to retire, after being examined only thirteen minutes, with these emphatic words: \"You may go, sir, for if you continue any longer here you will puzzle us.\" Three years afterwards he came to Canada, and settled at Ottawa city (then Bytown), according to the advice of Dr. Skey, a community in which he still lives, and which greatly benefits by his presence. He has been appointed physician and afterwards consulting physician to the Ottawa General Hospital, and consulting physician to the Protestant Hospital, coroner to the city, physician to the jail, and president of the Horticultural Society and Mechanics' Institute.\n\nEvery one must admit that he has been one of the most active and ardent promoters of the prosperity of Ottawa; and that district is not a little indebted to him for the numerous measures which he has originated and carried out in the furtherance of its interests. He is the chief promoter of exhibitions of Ottawa productions; he was the first to point out the locality of the stone with which the parliamentary buildings are being erected, to this he drew the attention of the Earl of Elgin, a circumstance which tended perhaps more than anything else to give to Ottawa favorable publicity. He has, at great expense, had constructed the\nbest private archaeological and geological museum in Canada, an object of great attraction to all who visit Ottawa; and he even, we believe, intends to reconstruct the edifice on a still grander scale. Dr. Van Cortlandt is the author of a pamphlet on Ottawa productions which has received great attention, and been very favorably noticed; and also of another pamphlet, published by order of the City Council of Ottawa, on the building stones of the Ottawa, a publication which has done much towards drawing public attention towards the resources of that rich and beautiful country.\n\nF. C. CAPREOL, Esq.\n\nThe name of this gentleman, connected, as it is with the organization and carrying out of the first railroad constructed in Upper Canada, certainly deserves a place in our pages.\n\nMr. Capreol is the second son of Thomas Capreol, Esquire, of Bishop Stafford, Hertfordshire, England. His pedigree, on the father's side, is derived from the ancient and ennobled foreign family of the de Capreols; and on his mother's side equally illustrious, for she was niece to the late Sir Richard Chase, and a relative of the Marquis of Salisbury. Mr. Capreol first came to Canada in 1828, to assist in arranging the affairs of the old north-west fur company, and having fulfilled his part of the business, returned to England in 1830. Three years afterwards, he again came to Canada, and shortly after his arrival at New York, married a Miss Skyring, a lady who had been a fellow passenger with him across the Atlantic. He proceeded to Toronto, and determined to settle there, having purchased a large quantity of lands on the Credit. The result of this purchase was a long and tedious law-suit, in which he was, however, successful. For some time he followed mercantile pursuits, but these he gave up on his becoming connected with the Northern Railway. It is a well known fact that to Mr. Capreol the Northern Railway owes its existence, it was he who projected it, and promoted the design, almost nearly unaided, and at his own expense forwarded the preliminary arrangements. No one can fully estimate the benefit which this gentleman conferred on Toronto, and the country north of it. Not only was the city in daily requirement of this line, but it was an absolute necessity to its well-being and that of the vicinity. When all other men and means had failed to obtain a charter, Mr. Capreol stepped forward and successfully overcome all difficulties, got an act passed in the legislature\nand when the same act was reserved for the royal assent at home, he proceeded to England, and in the short space of seven weeks, returned to Canada, having successfully accomplished the object of his voyage to England. The recompense which he received is too fresh in the minds of the public to be recapitulated here; let it suffice to remark that, after he had been appointed to the office of manager of the railway, and been recognized by the directors as the originator of the scheme and the \"father of the undertaking,\" these directors, to their shame and dishonor be it said, dismissed him from his office the day previous to the first sod having been turned, after he had served their purpose and benefitted them to the utmost extent. Such was their gratitude, and like that awarded to the late lamented Earl of Dundonald, it was as infamous as it had been unmerited. Great exertions were made to reinstate him; the citizens of Toronto petitioned the directors, as also did the board of trade of that city, but all to no purpose. Mr. Capreol had incurred the malice of one of these directors, and to this low and petty annoyance alone could his dismissal be ascribed. But possessing the confidence and good will of the people, Mr. Capreol little cared for the attempts made on his good name. Beyond receiving the bonds of the company for eleven thousand pounds, awarded for the expenses he had incurred in getting the concern afloat, and which had actually amounted to more than was awarded by one thousand three hundred and fifty pounds, he never obtained a dollar from the company. He subsequently proceeded to Europe and travelled on the continent, and whilst in London, had the gratification of accepting a present of a handsome service of plate, consisting of seventeen pieces, presented to him on behalf of the citizens of Toronto, as a mark of their confidence, esteem and gratitude for the services which he had rendered to their city. He returned a short time since, and is now residing in Toronto.\n\nMr. Capreol's name is also associated with a noble piece of gallantry, which reflects not a little credit on his public spirit. The circumstances may with propriety be given on this occasion:\u2014In the month of July, 1843, a gentleman of the name of Kinnear, residing at Richmond Hill, near Toronto, a much esteemed citizen, together with his housekeeper, was brutally and barbarously murdered during the night, by two of the servants, who, after the horrid deed, escaped to the United States. The city authorities did not take any decided action in the matter, and Mr. Capreol, hearing of the whereabouts of the murderers, chartered, at a considerable sacrifice of time and money, a steamboat, and accompanied by the high bailiff, proceeded to Lewiston, where he succeeded in capturing the fugitives, and brought them to Toronto. They were tried, found guilty, and suffered the extreme penalty of the law. Yet, strange to say, Mr. Capreol was suffered to pay the whole expenses.\nDuring last session, he was before the legislature again, and succeeded in getting a bill passed to enable him to sell his lands by lottery, and to erect a large cotton manufactory in the midst of the lots. The bill was reserved for the Queen's assent, which was received a short time since. Let us hope he will, on this occasion, be more successful in a pecuniary point of view.\n\nALEXANDER MURRAY, Esq.\n\nMr. Murray, the able assistant of Sir W. E. Logan in the Canadian geological survey, is the second son of the late Arthony Murray, Esquire, of Dollerie and Creiff, in the county of Perth, Scotland. He was born on the 2nd of June, 1811. The family estate, of which his elder brother is the present possessor, though not large, and never entailed, has descended uninterruptedly from father to son, since the commencement of the sixteenth century. On his father's side his family came direct from the old house of Tallibardine; on his mother's, from the old princes of Orkney, and the St. Clairs of Roslyn, on the one hand; while on the other, they inherit the blood of the Grahams of Fintry (his mother's mother being a Graham of Fintry); one cadet of which family was the great and gallant John Graham of Claverhouse, Viscount Dundee.\n\nMr. Murray's career has been strange and eventful. His early youth was spent in the royal navy; and he was educated for that service at the Royal Naval college, Portsmouth. From the early part of 1825, to the year 1829, he served chiefly in the Mediterranean, and was present at the action of Navarino (20th October, 1827) as an unpassed midshipman, on board her Majesty's sloop, Philomel, commanded by Lord Ingestre, now the Earl of Shrewsbury and Talbot. In 1829, while in England, he passed his examination for navigation, at the college; and, at Malta, in 1830, he passed for seamanship, qualifying for promotion, which he never got. After this time, he served partly in the West Indies, and partly on the home station, and finally, again in the Mediterranean, until 1835, when still perceiving no hopes of promotion, he left the service altogether, and went to England. Two years after while at home, in Scotland, he married Fanny Cooper Judkins, sister of a well known commander on one of the Cunard royal mail steamships; and, shortly afterwards, emigrated to Canada, where he had previously bought land, intending permanently to\nsettle in the country. This he probably might have done, had not a series of family misfortunes compelled him to return to England in 1841. He had scarcely been established in Canada, before the rebellion broke out, during the continuance of which he served as a volunteer in various capacities; at one time attaching himself to the naval brigade, at Chippawa, under Commander (now Captain) Drew, R.N.\n\nWhile in London, in 1842, Mr. Murray became acquainted with Mr. (now Sir W. E.) Logan, who kindly gave him an introduction to Sir Henry de la Beche, at that time director of the British geological survey, the result of which introduction has shaped his career through life ever since. During the summer and autumn of that year, he worked as an amateur with one or two of the geological parties under that gentleman's direction, and was pretty constantly engaged with the staff, at the museum of practical geology. In the winter of 1842-3, when the survey of this province was finally determined on by the Canadian government, and Sir William Logan was appointed director of it, that gentleman was pleased to apply for Mr. Murray's appointment as his assistant, on the grounds of certain recommendations given to him by Sir H. de la Beche; and this application being granted, Mr. Murray was duly appointed, and has served in that capacity ever since, with credit and ability.\n\nIn connection with the geological examination of the country, it was found necessary in many parts to make extensive topographical surveys, and to this subject a great portion of Mr. Murray's time and attention has been directed in the wild regions of the Gasp\u00e9 peninsula, in the first instance; and afterwards, in the unexplored parts between lake Huron and the Ottawa river, including lake Nipissing, and the country around it. Latterly he has been trying to work out the stratigraphical arrangement of a newly discovered system of rocks, now known as the Huronian series; and, we believe, he was the first to demonstrate their unconformable relations with the formations of the lower Silurian age.\n\nIt is said that Mr. Murray's career would present an ample field to a novelist, owing to the many adventures in which he has figured, and his many escapes from drowning. Twice when he was in the navy, while endeavoring to rescue two persons who had fallen overboard, one of whom he did save. Afterwards he escaped as nearly as possible, being carried over Niagara Falls; he was also on board the Clyde steamship when wrecked in the gulf; and lastly, he had an escape off the island of Campment d'Ours, lake Huron, so lately as August, 1861.*\n\n*There is something romantic touching his last escape. Mr. Murray, with three others, was out in an open boat, which was upset in a heavy squall; and, being a good distance from shore, and unable to place the boat again on her bottom, all on board would, no doubt, have been carried away by the current and lost,\nMR. ALEXANDER McLACHLAN.\n\nAlexander McLachlan is another of our few Canadian poets of any note or repute. He is the son of a Scotch mechanic, and was born in the village of Johnston, Renfrewshire, in the year 1820. Though he enjoyed but few of the advantages of education, then common to Scotland, he was, from his boyhood, a voracious reader, and those who have listened to the lectures delivered by him in different parts of Canada, and elsewhere, are convinced of his profound and accurate acquaintance with the principal British authors. In his youth, he was a tailor and a chartist leader; but, like many others, after visiting the neighboring republic, he became completely cured of his youthful folly. He first came to Canada in 1840, and spent the greater portion of his time, since his arrival in Canada, in the \"bush,\" or backwoods, until the muse brought him before the public as a successful author and writer of poetry, and as a lecturer. He has published three volumes of poetry, and delivered lectures on poetry and kindred subjects in most of the principal towns of Canada, and in the state of New York. From a sketch of him contained in a Guelph paper, published some time ago, we make an extract, highly eulogistic of his merits and talents:\n\n\"Mr. McLachlan's powers have been comparatively slow in developing themselves. His is indeed still a young mind. We confess that we like minds of this rather than those of a meteoric character; for, not unfrequently, the sudden splendor of the latter, like that of the meteor, is transient, and too often passes away without leaving any lasting impress. When nature designs to accomplish anything great and permanent, she generally works silently and gradually; there is nothing startling and spasmodic in her efforts. How quietly she drops the little acorn into the lap of mother earth, and how slowly she rears the giant oak, which stands proudly rooted for centuries. Considerations of this nature lead us to believe, that, as yet, we have had but a partial manifestation of our poet's powers. Fine and rare as are many of his thoughts, we predict that they are only first fruits of a richer harvest. Still, we are fearless in asserting, that there are contained in the present volume* some pieces of a character to place its author in no mean rank among the acknowledged poets of the nineteenth\n\nhad their position not been perceived by a young girl on shore, Margaret Walker, the daughter of the only settler there, who, like another Grace Darling, resolutely and bravely entered a boat, pulled to their rescue, and saved their lives. This heroic girl surely deserves a medal from the Humane Society.\n\n*The Emigrant and other Poems.\u2014Toronto: Rollo & Adam, 1861.\ncentury; appreciation may come slowly, but sooner or later, come it must and will; for where genius has implanted his seal, we have proof that the gods have issued a message that needs must find access to the heart. And when we prophesy, that there are among these poems some which will attain an immortality that but few of the author's warmest friends and most ardent admirers little dream, we undoubtedly rely upon the future for a verification of our prediction.\"\n\nAs to his ability as a lecturer, the following notice from the pen of Professor George, of Queen's college, Kingston, speaks for itself:\n\n\"Those who had the opportunity of listening to the lecture of Mr. McLachlan, on Wednesday evening, in the city hall, will not soon forget the high intellectual enjoyment they experienced. The subject chosen (i.e., \"great men\") by the lecturer, is indeed a high one, and if handled by an ordinary man, would not only prove a failure, but could hardly be other than a miserable caricature. But Mr. McLachlan is not an ordinary man\u2014hence his audience saw no arrogance in the choice of his high subject, just because there was no failure in the execution. It was, indeed, treated throughout with the wisdom, knowledge, and taste of a master mind. No outline of the lecture could do any justice to it, as it plainly belongs to that class of intellectual performances, which must be looked at as a whole, if the mind would realise the force of the reasoning, and appreciate fully the beauties of the most appropriate illustrations. The strain of the lecturer's thinking is marked as might be inferred from his high poetic genius by much originality. Some of the thoughts are exceeding grand, while the general strain was admirable, just; and the practical reflections simple, pointed, and wholesome. The style and manner of the lecturer have a natural majesty, beautifully in keeping with the character of his theme. It is hardly too much praise to say, that had the great men of whom he spoke been present, they would have listened with no little satisfaction to the profound principles so clearly stated, and so ably illustrated.\"\n\nMr. McLachlan's chief aim in becoming an author and lecturer, is to be an exponent of the minds of the working men of Canada; in fact, to be to Canada, if possible, what Burns was to Scotland. His desire is to ameliorate the condition of the working classes. He has shewn the mental workings of the working man, for the purpose of getting all the rich, who obtain their living by means of head work instead of hand work, or without work of any kind, to see that the real distinction between the two classes consists less in intrinsic worth, than in fortuitous antecedents. He has endeavored to expose the sympathies, antipathies, and some of the powers of mind of the working men, so that the rich may be induced to treat their less fortunate fellow-creatures more honorably and charitably;\nin short, that they may see that the working man is a man, not differing but in fortune from themselves. His ambition is to stand shoulder to shoulder with Burns and Miller, as a pioneer in establishing the literature of the working classes.\n\nMR. J. McCARROLL.\n\nJames McCarroll, the talented subject of this notice, was born of a respectable family in the town of Lanesboro, in the county of Longford, Ireland, on the 3rd August, 1815. His father's side of the house was, in some way or other, connected with the Cardens of Templemore, who evinced much interest in McCarroll's family; for, on his father running away to enlist, Sir John Carden followed him with a view to providing for him more suitably, but, ere he had effected his generous purpose, the hand of the spoiler was on the brave old knight, he died.\n\nYoung McCarroll went early to school, studied earnestly and with success. He obtained a knowledge of the classics; and then his schoolboy life was over. His family came to Canada in 1831; and in the wild forests of Upper Canada took up their abode. Here he encountered all the vicissitudes of a settler of that period. His taste for letters, however, soon prompted him to seek a more genial atmosphere. He began to contribute scraps both of prose and verse to some of the provincial journals; and the manner, in which they were received, was so gratifying, that it may be said to have determined his after literary career.\n\nIn 1845, his whole energies were devoted to the press; and he has continued ever since to be connected with it, advancing steadily more and more in public favor, daily becoming more popular. He has been the unsuccessful proprietor of two journals, the editor of several, the literary critic of more than one daily, and the contributor to many. All that he ever wrote, has been received in a manner which must have been most gratifying to his feelings. His story, \"The New Guager,\" published in the Anglo-American Magazine of Toronto, \"The Adventures of a Night,\" and \"The New Life Boat,\" are too well known and have been two highly eulogized for us to endeavor to say more about them. Mr. McCarroll is best known as a poet. \"Madeline\" is spoken of highly, and when we add that his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, on his late visit paid our poet a very high compliment on the composi-\ntion of his ode to the Prince, we think we have said sufficient to justify the opinion that he ranks high among our sons of song. In connection with this subject, we may observe, that it is generally understood that we are shortly to have a volume of poems from his gifted pen; and we sincerely trust that the publication may prove as successful, as those that have preceded from the same source.\n\nIn connection with music, Mr. McCarroll figures as one of the very best flutists on the continent. This will be more readily understood, when we state that he can simultaneously bring out two distinct notes with one fingering, forming a perfect major third. In addition to this feat he can play the most ornate melodies with one hand. His second eldest daughter, Miss McCarroll, is also well known as a splendid pianist.\n\nMr. McCarroll resides at Toronto, and occupies the post of outdoor surveyor to the port of Toronto. He is very popular with the people of the city, and has lived with them in constant and close intercourse for many years.\n\nTHOMAS DEVINE, Esq., F.R.G.S.\n\nThis gentleman is the head of the Upper Canada surveyors' branch of the crown lands department, and may be considered at the summit of his profession. His sterling worth, his excellent abilities, and his services in developing the resources of Canada, are highly appreciated.\n\nMr. Devine is a native of the county of Westmeath, Ireland; he received his education at Fox's celebrated Engineers' Academy, where he early acquired a profound knowledge of the profession in which he at present shines. He subsequently studied under the corps of the Royal Engineers, and passed very creditable examinations, both while he was at the academy and among the engineers. His first employment was in the ordnance survey of Ireland, in which he continued until its completion. After this he migrated to Canada, to a larger and more important field for his labors;\u2014and, in 1846, was appointed to the crown lands department, in which he has continued ever since, rising by his talents and industry from a subordinate occupation, to the important post which he now holds as head of the Upper Canada surveyors, in which he succeeded Mr. Andrew Russell, now assistant-commissioner of crown lands.\nAs a topographer, Canada is much indebted to Mr. Devine for the very many beautiful, elaborate and useful maps, which from time to time he has brought out from the department, immediately under his supervision. We may mention more especially those that were issued during the time Mr. Cauchon and Mr. Vankoughnet were commissioners of crown lands. These plans were eulogized not only in the province, but in the United States and Europe.\n\nMr. Devine has done much to improve the branch under his control; the field-book, of which he is the author, and which is exclusively used in the Canadian and other surveys, is one of the best extant; and it has been highly commended by many influential persons capable of judging.\n\nAs a recognition of his talents and services in the cause of the geography of Canada, he was recently elected to the high and distinguished honor of a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society of London. He has also been elected a corresponding member of the Geographical Society of Berlin, and of the American Geographical and Statistical Society, honors which few Canadians have been fortunate to attain. These are in the present case well merited, and have been most judiciously bestowed.\n\nF. M. U. M. BIBAUD, Esq., LL. D.\n\nThe name of this French Canadian gentleman, associated with the native literature of the province, deserves as high a place in this work, as that of the generality of his confr\u00e8res.\n\nMr. Bibaud is a son of the celebrated Canadian writer of that name, and was born in Montreal, in November, 1824. He studied law and successfully passed the bar, and is now law professor in the Jesuit's college, Montreal. He is the author of different works relating to Canada, all of more or less merit, and among them may be enumerated \"Discours historique sur les races sauvages de l'Am\u00e9rique Septentrionale, s\u00e9rie d'articles dans les M\u00e9langes Religieux,\" 1846; \"Les Sagamos Illustres de l'Am\u00e9rique Septentrionale, pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 d'un Index de l'histoire fabuleuse de ce continent,\" 1848; \"Analyse critique du projet, s\u00e9rie d'articles dans la Minerve,\" 1850; \"Lecture de M. Parent sur le Progr\u00e8s et Revue critique de cet \u00e9crit\" 1852; \"Parall\u00e8le entre Napol\u00e9on et Wellington, \u00e0 l'occasion de la mort de ce dernier, s\u00e9rie d'articles dans le Moniteur...\"\nCanadien,\" 1852; \"Analyse critique du manuel, s\u00e9rie d'articles dans le Moniteur Canadien, avec la r\u00e9ponse de l'auteur et la r\u00e9plique du critique,\" 1852; \"Les lois de l'administration fran\u00e7aises pr\u00e9ventives des incendies, lecture par Bibaud, jeune, \u00e0 l'institut National, en pr\u00e9sence des membres de la municipalit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, \u00e0 l'occasion du dernier incendie, imprim\u00e9 dans la Minerve,\" 1852; \"Cat\u00e9chisme de l'histoire du Canada \u00e0 l'usage des \u00e9coles,\" 1853; \"Essai de Logique judiciaire, ouvrage que doit servir d'appr\u00e9ciation, et sur quelques points, d'antirrh\u00e9tique de la logique judiciaire, publi\u00e9e \u00e0 Paris en 1841 par M. Hortentius de St. Albain, juge au tribunal de la Seine, membre de la chambre des d\u00e9put\u00e9s, Chevalier de la l\u00e9gion d'Honneur, et de l'Etoile Polaire,\" 1853; \"Pr\u00e9cis de l'histoire de l'Europe durant la r\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise,\" 2 vols., 8vo., 1857; \"Dictionnaire historique des hommes illustres du Canada et de l'Am\u00e9rique, 1857; \"Tableau Historique des Progr\u00e8s Mat\u00e9riels et Intellectuels du Canada, 1858; \"Pantheon Canadien,\" Montreal, 1858. He has also contributed some able articles to several periodical publications, and will doubtless, with a proper cultivation of his talents, rise to some eminence as a Canadian author. His industry has been so great, that he heartily deserves it.\n\nM. EMILE DE FENOUILLET.\n\nThis gentleman, who died at Quebec, on the 30th June, 1859 was one of the most distinguished French writers in this country. M. de Fenouillet was born in France at Hy\u00e8res, in the department of Var; he went through a course of legal studies at Aix; after a short sojourn at Montpellier he removed to Paris, and while in that city was connected with the \u00c9poque; he subsequently accepted a professorship at the university of Bonn, and while there wrote a series of letters on Germany, published in L'Univers. In 1854, he left his native France for America, and arrived in Quebec towards the end of October. The two years following his arrival in this country were passed in fulfilling the arduous duties of editor-in-chief to the Journal de Qu\u00e9bec. Shortly afterwards he was appointed professor of history and literature to the Laval normal school. The rapid progress of his pupils were the proofs of his zeal, of his talent and of his energy; even when enfeebled by disease, he resolutely continued his lectures, though requested by the principal and the superintendent to recruit his wearied frame,\nand though an assistant had been named by the government to relieve him from his arduous task. His articles in the Journal de l'Instruction Publique, are well known and fully appreciated; he was one of the cleverest of its contributors.\n\nM. A. G. LAJOIE.\n\nA. Gerin Lajoie was born at Yamachiche, in the district of Three Rivers, in August, 1824, and was educated at Nicolet. After completing a regular classical course of studies, he went to Montreal to study law, and was, in 1848, admitted to the bar. During his clerkship he took a prominent part in the establishment of the Institut Canadien, a literary institution first established in Montreal, in 1844, and which has since spread throughout Lower Canada. He was several times elected president of this association, and was for some years editor of La Minerve, the oldest French newspaper published in Montreal, and wrote also, we believe, for some other periodicals. In 1852, M. Lajoie became connected with the French translator's office of the Legislative Assembly, which office he left in 1857, to be transferred to the parliamentary library, where he is chiefly entrusted with the management of the French part of that magnificent collection.\n\nWhen at college, M. Lajoie wrote a tragedy in three acts, in verse, entitled \"Le Jeune La Tour,\" which has been reprinted several times; he has also composed and published several pieces of poetry and some songs, and pamphlets, one of which entitled \"Cat\u00e9chisme politique,\" is a synopsis of our present provincial system of government, and has been considered very useful to students and to the public generally.\n\nM. REAL ANGERS.\n\nM. Real Angers was one of the most eloquent advocates of Lower Canada. He died in April, 1860, in his forty-seventh year. He had been admitted to the bar at an early age, and by his brilliant\nimagination and energetic mind soon attracted notice. His taste for literature was strong, but he had to yield to that necessity which had directed his course towards the sterner and somewhat thorny practice of the law. He left testimonials of his literary talent in the form of pleasing poetical essays, and of two short works in prose. His \"R\u00e9velations du Crime\" might have laid him open to the reproach of having attempted an imitation of the \"Mysteries of Paris,\" were it not well known that it was written long before that by Eug\u00e8ne Sue, and that the fearful descriptions it gives, unfortunately are realities. His other production is a treatise on stenography, written at the time he was engaged reporting parliamentary debates. To him, and to Mr. Aubin, are due perhaps the only able reports extant of the speeches delivered in the Lower Canada House of Assembly, during its three or four last sessions. Mr. Angers was, together with Mr. Loranger, entrusted by the government with the defence of the censitaires before the Seigniorial Court. In the fulfilment of this duty he showed much learning, and sound and eloquent argumentation. As one of the editors of the periodical in which are published the Lower Canada law reports, he likewise contributed highly to the fund of our jurisprudence. His health, through over-exertion, had become impaired, and great efforts were necessary to enable him, for some years, to attend to the duties of his profession. His death caused universal regret, although, under the circumstances, the sad event could not but have been anticipated.\n\n---\n\nM. THEOPHILE HAMEL.\n\nM. Theophile Hamel is well known as a Canadian artist of great eminence. Indeed, with the exception of Falardeau, Kane, Plamondon, or Thieckl\u00e9, we can hardly boast of having produced any artists who have distinguished themselves as painters.\n\nM. Hamel is a native of Quebec, \"that ancient and time honored city,\" which enjoys the reputation of having given birth to the majority of our \"celebrities.\" But he has studied in the Italian schools, and although still young (about 35), he has produced one of the largest and best series of portraits in oil painting on this continent. We allude to our \"National portrait gallery,\" composed of all the speakers of both houses of parliament before and since the union, and also a large number of our governors.\nThese have been greatly and most justly admired, not only for their excellent finish, but for their striking likeness to the individuals portrayed.\n\nM. Hamel has been most industrious and laborious throughout his career, and singularly fortunate in his pictures, so much so indeed, that the series of portraits, without including many other works of art which he has executed in a masterly manner, will hand down his name to posterity in Canada with the highest commendation.\n\nJOSEPH MORRIN, Esq., M.D.\n\nDr. Morrin was a native of Dumfriesshire in Scotland, but was brought by his parents to Canada at an early age. He received his school education under the late eminent Dr. Wilkie. His medical education, begun in Quebec, was completed in Edinburgh and London. When scarcely of age, he commenced to practise in Quebec, and gradually rose to the highest eminence in his profession, in some departments of which, he was probably unequalled by any of his confr\u00e8res in the province, and in all, gave proof of a sagacious understanding. He was indefatigable in his attention to the duties of his profession. Peculiarly kind and soothing at the sick bed of his patients, he never failed to gain their confidence in his assiduity and skill. As a tribute to his professional eminence, he was elected the first president of the medical board of the lower province. He shared with Drs. Douglas and Fremont the honor of establishing the asylum at Beauport, and conducting it on principles universally admitted to be beneficial to the patients, and economical to the public. Latterly, his long experience had rendered his opinion especially valuable, and he was called in, in every case of difficulty and importance. His retirement from practice, some years ago, was felt like that of his distinguished confr\u00e8re and friend, Dr. James Douglas, to be a public loss.\n\nWith all this constant and unwearied attention to the duties of his profession, Dr. Morrin was an active and efficient member of general society. He took an interest in all public matters. He was to be seen in every important meeting of the citizens, secular or religious. He was a magistrate and a city councillor, and, more than is usual, earnest and assiduous in the discharge of the duties of either office. He twice presided over the city of Quebec, as mayor, to the universal satisfaction of his constituents; and he was\nemployed by the corporation to plead with the Imperial Government in London, the claims of Quebec to be the capital of the province.\n\nA short time previous to his death (which occurred on the 29th of August, 1861,) he made a munificent donation for the erection of a Protestant college in Quebec, under the charge of the religious body to which he had always belonged, and we can only express our desire and hope, that Morrin college may prove a worthy monument to his memory, and be, as he intended it, of general use to successive generations of the citizens of Quebec.\n\nJ. S. HOGAN, Esq., M.P.P.\n\nJOHN SHERIDAN HOGAN was born about the year 1815, in the neighborhood of Dublin, where his father held a small landed estate, the refuge of a family ruined by that spirit of useless extravagance and inordinate hospitality so unhappily general among the sons of Erin. At a very early age, probably about eleven or twelve, young Hogan proceeded to Canada, under the guardianship of an uncle, who resided at Toronto. The home thus provided for him, being uncongenial to his taste, he made up his mind to work out, single handed, his way through the world; and accordingly, in the grey dawn of the morning, when others slept, he, moneyless and friendless, sallied forth with nothing but a small bundle which contained all his worldly possessions, to carve out a career for himself, armed only with that energy which rejoices at obstacles, and with that perseverance which succumbs not to disappointment. Ere long, he obtained employment in a printing office, we believe the Canadian Wesleyan, of Hamilton, as a newsboy, and subsequently, on account of his good behavior and exemplary conduct, became foreman, and was subsequently placed on the staff of writers. This was a rapid rise for one whose prospects, a few years before, had been so dim and so uncertain, yet he steadily continued to advance, until he entered the office of Sir A. N. MacNab, for the study of the law. He was also generously allowed a salary by that gentleman to support himself until he should have finally passed the bar, which, unfortunately, he never did. When Mr. Allan Macdonell became sheriff of the Gore district, he employed Mr. Hogan as his clerk and bookkeeper; and in 1840 or '41, he again gave himself to the study of the law, in the office of Mr. Tiffany, of Hamilton. It was also at this time that he made his\nAND PERSONS CONNECTED WITH CANADA.\n\nfirst essay as a writer; his attention having been called to the aspect of political affairs in Canada, he contributed some able articles on the subject to Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine, which attracted considerable attention at the time, and, indeed, established Mr. Hogan's reputation as one of the literati of Canada. Shortly afterwards happened that eventful episode in his career, his arrest at Lockport, in the United States, for being concerned in the burning of the steamer Caroline; but he was subsequently discharged and his claim for indemnity ignored by the Imperial Government. In 1856, he was awarded the first prize by the Paris Exhibition Committee, for his justly celebrated \"Essay on Canada,\" which was printed by order of the government, a work which may probably bring down his name to posterity. He at the same time formed a business connection with the proprietors of the Toronto Colonist, and became the editor-in-chief of that journal, a post which he filled to much advantage, his articles being generally admired by the public. As to the manner in which his connection with that journal ceased, on its turning its political principles, there is little occasion for comment on our part.\n\nAt the general election of 1857, he was elected to represent the county of Grey in Parliament; and at once took a determined stand in the house as a member of the reform party, and continued as such until the unfortunate period of his death, in December 1859, when his presence was missed by his friends and acquaintances in Toronto from amongst them. For eighteen months his disappearance remained shrouded in a most profound mystery, everything that could possibly be done to ascertain his whereabouts or his fate was tried, both by the government and his friends, but without success, until the month of March or April 1861, when information was received of a murder\u2014a foul, a wicked murder of which he had been made the victim, performed at night when Mr. Hogan was proceeding on his way to visit a friend in the eastern environs of Toronto. His body was found in the river Don, (which runs into the bay of Toronto), and was recognized\u2014the murderers were arrested and tried, but proving an alibi, were acquitted. Thus went unrequited the perpetrators of a deed which carried off one of the noblest minds which the country possessed, and who, if he had not been thus prematurely cut off, might have attained some distinction in his adopted country.\n\nHis friends and colleagues in the house subscribed a handsome sum in 1861, to erect a fitting monument over his remains.\nMR. EBENEZER CLEMO.\n\nA native of London, England, who came to Canada in 1858. He was, although young, a person of great genius and ability. On his arrival in this country, he was reduced to such necessity that he applied to Mr. Lovell for employment as a message boy; but Mr. Lovell, knowing his acquirements, engaged him to write a couple of books on Canadian life. Hence \"Simon Seek\" and \"The Canadian Homes\" which appeared in the same year, works not of the highest standard of literature certainly, but evincing much talent and giving a good insight into Canadian character and life. He was the inventor and discoverer of making paper pulp out of straw; and was engaged erecting machinery for the manufacture of such paper, at Morristown, New Jersey, where he died in 1860, at the early age of thirty years, deservedly regretted by all.\n\nWILLIAM EVANS, Esq.\n\nA celebrated Lower Canadian agriculturalist, who died in 1857. Speaking of him at the period of his demise, the Montreal Gazette said:\u2014\"It has been our fortune to meet few worthier or more patriotic men than he, few more diligent in the promotion to the uttermost of his ability, of the prosperity of this his adopted country. Enthusiastically devoted to agricultural pursuits, it has been his endeavor for many years past to raise the standard of agriculture in Lower Canada from the position to which it had sunk, to teach and to lead the way in a system by which the worn-out farms of the long settled districts might recover their fertility, and farming in the eastern province be made to rival in profitableness that of the west. Nor have his efforts been altogether in vain, we hope. He has spent over two score years, we believe, as an agriculturist in Canada. Long ago, he furnished agricultural contributions to the columns of this journal. Afterwards he became secretary of the Lower Canada Agricultural Society, and editor of the Agricultural Journal, published under the auspices of that society. Lately, having retired from the direction of that\njournal, he renewed his connection as a contributor with this paper, a connection only now dissolved by death. Elsewhere will be found his last communication, addressed to us a few days since, and crowded out of our columns until now, when the brain that conceived and the fingers which wrote it have alike ceased to have life or motion. How touching are its concluding sentences now, in which, promising to resume the review of Mr. Nesbitt's lecture, he says:\u2014\u2018I cannot now expect that I shall be spared many years to continue these labors, but while it may be the will of God to spare me, I shall persevere in the good cause of endeavoring to promote the improvement of agriculture in Canada.\u2019 Alas! even as he wrote, his vow was fulfilled; the span of life allotted him by his Maker was even then coming to an end.\n\n* * * * *\n\n\u201cWe are aware that during the early part of the autumn he suffered from an attack of paralysis, which he spoke of to us as a warning that he \u2018had not long to stay.\u2019 He was fitted and prepared, we believe, for the long, long journey he has taken. Full of years, enjoying the esteem of all who knew him, and surrounded by a large circle of tried friends, he has passed peacefully away: a man whom many loved while living, many will regret in his death: one who strove faithfully to do his duty in that state of life to which it has pleased God to call him.\u201d\n\nBARON DE ROTTERMUND.\n\nAn European geologist, who resided in Canada for some years previous to his death, which took place at Montreux, Lake of Geneva, in 1858. He was born in 1818, and for some years was employed by the crown lands department as inspector of mines. There may be in the remembrance of our readers the attacks he made in 1850, against our celebrated and learned geologist, Hunt; he also contested the theory of Sir William Logan, who contends that there are not coal mines in Lower Canada. The baron held that coal existed both at Quebec and in the district of Gasp\u00e9, having discovered particles of it at the former place. During a visit to Paris, he submitted these to several learned geologists of France, who confirmed his opinion that coal must exist where these had been taken from. Nevertheless, what has subsequently been discovered, confirms Sir William Logan\u2019s theory, and proves that Baron Rotter-\nmund's was an illusion. He wrote a report to the mayor and corporation of Quebec, on the nature of combustible minerals to be found in the city of Quebec. He married a daughter of the Honorable P. D. Debartzch; and was brother-in-law to the Honorable L. T. Drummond.\n\nRIGHT HON. VISCOUNT MONCK,\n\nGOVERNOR-GENERAL OF BRITISH NORTH AMERICA.\n\nCHARLES STANLEY MONCK, fourth viscount of that name, and our present governor-general, is descended from William Le Moyne,* who lived in 1668, and represents more immediately a junior branch of the house of Monck, Duke of Albemarle (now extinct). He was born at Templemore, county Tipperary, Ireland, in the year 1819, and is a son of the third viscount by the youngest daughter of the late John Wellington, Esquire, of Killoskehane in the same county, (she died 1843.) Educated at Trinity college, Dublin, he was called to the bar in Ireland in 1841. In 1849 he succeeded his father as the fourth viscount, and entered Parliament in July, 1852, as member for Portsmouth, previous to which however in May, 1848, he was an unsuccessful candidate for Wicklow.\n\n* Two Governors of Canada.\u2014\"The appointment of Baron Monck, to the administration of Canada, gives rise to a singular coincidence. Two men evidently of Norman origin, one might add, of the same name, will have been intrusted with the destinies of this country; the one under French dominion the other under British rule.\n\n\"Some two centuries back, Charles Le Moine (whose father, Charles Le Moine, came from Dieppe in Normandy,) afterwards Baron of Longueuil, was appointed King's Lieutenant in Canada; the French Crown erected in his favor near Montreal a barony 'as a reward,' history tells us 'for the service he rendered to the colony.' He was the eldest of eleven brothers, who all played a distinguished part in New France. D'Iberville won some important naval engagements in the gulf of the St. Lawrence and elsewhere. De Ste. Helene, after whom the island of Ste. Helene, near Montreal, a portion of the family estate was called, died at the siege of Quebec, fighting bravely against Phipps in 1690. DeBunville was the founder of New Orleans, and so on.\n\n\"After a lapse of two hundred years, we now receive amongst us, the descendant of Guillaume Le Moine,\u2020 a contemporary of William of Normandy, the conqueror of England. The name it is true, is amplified, but such transformations are too common in history to have the right to astonish us.\n\n\"Louis XIV. had for his representative in New France, Charles LeMoyne, Queen Victoria hands over the sceptre of British America to the descendant of\n\n\u2020 See Dodd's Peerage.\nIn February 1851, he was appointed a commissioner of charitable donations and bequests in Ireland. He was a lord of the treasury in the Palmerston administration from March, 1855, until he lost his seat for Portsmouth at the general election of 1857, when he ran for Dudley, in Worcestershire, but without success.\n\nIn October 1861, his lordship was appointed to succeed Sir E. W. Head as governor-general of British North America, and arrived at Quebec in the same month, but owing to the absence of the Court at Balmoral on his leaving England, his excellency's commission was not made out, and he was only sworn in as administrator. He was sworn in as governor-general on the 28th November. His commission as such bears date: Westminster, 2nd November, 1861, and that of vice-admiral, London, 7th November, 1861.\n\nHON. GEORGE BROWN.\n\nMr. Brown, the late leader of the Upper Canada radical reform party, and formely representative of the capital of Western Canada in the Legislative Assembly, is Scotch in origin, feeling, sentiment, and religion, being a member of the Free Church, and it will not be too much to say that he owed his late position, not only to his great abilities, but also to the depth and breadth and intensity of his nationality, as well as that of his countrymen in Canada.\n\nMr. Brown was born in 1821, in the city of Edinburgh, where his father was engaged in business, and held at one time a public\n\nGuillaume LeMoyne, who flourished about 1066, a year rendered memorable in British annals, by the appearance of a Norman duke at the head of his Normans, the future conquerors of the island.\n\n\"The most ancient titles in England, such as that of the Howards and others, retrace back to the conquest.\n\n\"Why is this important command conferred on the present nobleman? Are we Canadians to view it as a compliment our gracious sovereign intends to pay to her old Norman colony, in sending out for a viceroy, an illustrious scion of that stout Norman race, whose blood flows in the veins of England's proudest nobles? Is Lord Monck intended to be the trait d'union, the social link to connect the various provinces of British North America in a compact confederacy, capable of stemming back the wave of mob law and anarchy which threatens to surge over our borders? Who can unveil the impenetrable arcana of the future? Let us at least hope that the descendant of Guillaume LeMoyne, like his distinguished namesake, the Baron de Longueuil, will endear his name to the mother-country by the services he will render to the colony, which service will doubtless open to him the door to further preferment. Let us also indulge the hope that antagonism (founded on difference of race) to the metropolitan government will die out entirely from want of the necessary materials to keep it up, when the ruled and the rulers are identical in origin.\"\u2014Le Canadien.\noffice. At the age of thirteen, he left home, and we believe, became connected with some business pursuit in London. About twenty-one years ago, the family having suffered some reverse, emigrated to New York, where they engaged in business; and had also, if we mistake not, at the same time, a store in Albany. The business in which Mr. Brown's family engaged on coming to New York did not succeed to their satisfaction, and in December, 1842, four years after their arrival in the United States, Mr. Peter Brown, the father of the subject of our present memoir, a man of considerable general information, commenced the publication of a weekly newspaper in New York, called the British Chronicle. The character of this paper is indicated by the title. It was far more British than Galignani's Messenger, in Paris, and was to the United States what Le Nord is to Western Europe. It was more than an advocate of everything British in opposition to everything American, and it never ceased to criticise, in a severe spirit, the institutions and the manners of the people in whose commercial metropolis it was issued. Not being able to compete with the Albion, another English organ published at New York, and then owned and conducted by Dr. Bartlett, British consul at that port, its duration did not extend beyond eighteen months. While Mr. Peter Brown remained in New York; he published a reply to Lester's \"Shame and Glory of England,\" under the title of the \"Fame and Glory of England Vindicated.\"\n\nIn 1843, the family came from New York to Toronto, under certain offers held out to them by the Free Church party, who required an organ to represent their views at the critical period of the disruption which added another to the list of Presbyterian churches. In the same year a weekly paper called the Banner was started in Toronto, as an organ of the Free Church party; the elder Mr. Brown being editor, for which task he was well qualified, and his eldest son, George, being constituted the proprietor. But it was soon found that, as a political organ, the Banner could never obtain a general circulation, since it addressed itself mainly to one of the religious divisions into which Upper Canada was divided; and in 1844, the reform party wanting an organ that would be more directly under the control of its leaders than any paper which then existed, the Globe was projected. The first number appeared about the beginning of April. It was at first published weekly, then tri-weekly, and for some years has been a daily, in which form it is issued, and enjoys with the Leader the largest circulation of any newspaper in Canada. On the 28th of the preceding November, the resignation of the Lafontaine-Baldwin administration had taken place, and there being no other minister than that of one secretary, upon whom devolved the whole administration of the country, it may easily be understood, from the nature of the crisis, that party spirit ran high. At this time, although Mr. George Brown was not as\npractised a writer as subsequent experience has made him, and although Mr. Brown, senr., lay under the disadvantage incident to the want of acquaintance with the past history of the country, political parties, and individual politicians, the paper was, nevertheless, conducted with much vigor, and for four years it was deservedly looked upon as being, in a special manner, the great organ of the reform party of Upper Canada.\n\nIn 1848, the Lafontaine-Baldwin party found themselves again victorious after a general election; and in February of that year they were restored to power. The Globe now became the organ of the government, and as a general rule defended its policy till 1851.\n\nIn 1849, Mr. George Brown was appointed, in conjunction with two others, a commissioner to investigate certain alleged abuses in the Provincial Penitentiary. This commission sat several months, and ended in effecting considerable changes in the management of that institution.\n\nThere is reason to believe that Mr. Brown cherished the desire of one day becoming a member of the government long before he made an attempt to secure a seat in Parliament. In April, 1851, he stood, but was defeated, for Haldimand, (the representation of which had become vacant by the death of Mr. Thompson), in opposition to the late Mr. W. L. Mackenzie and Mr. Ronald McKinnon. The Papal aggression agitation was then at its height in England, and Mr. Brown energetically echoed the cry of resistance. Thereafter he declared he would only support a political policy based on broad Protestant principles. As a natural consequence of the expression of these views, his course as a journalist turned from being the defender of the government, the ruling element in which was French Canadian Catholic. He took a vigorous stand against everything Roman Catholic; from being an opponent of Orangemen and the Orange society, he became its advocate. In the session of 1859, he voted for a bill to incorporate the order, but since the formation of his ministry, he has not taken the same prominent part in politico-religious questions as in previous years.\n\nIn December, 1851, Mr. Brown was first elected to the Legislative Assembly for the county of Kent, and he took his seat at Quebec, in the following August. At that time his position was peculiar. He had broken with his party, denounced its leaders, and being in opposition, was obliged constantly to vote with the conservatives, in opposition to the party whom he had for several years represented and defended in the press. In the western peninsula of Canada the democratic element was sufficiently strong to create a relish for almost any amount of opposition to the government, no matter how the government was conducted nor of whom composed. The American element strengthened this feeling, of which Mr. Brown became the organ. His opposition was vigorous, though not always discriminating, and complaint was made of his\ntendency to assail personal character. This was particularly so after he had been elected for Lambton, in the summer of 1854. The charges which he made were investigated by committees of both branches of the legislature, and although the evidence which he brought forward was far from complete, there is no doubt but that their effect upon the elections of 1854 was considerable, and that they thus indirectly tended to bring about, if they did not actually effect, a change of administration.\n\nIn December, 1857, Mr. Brown achieved a great triumph by being returned for the city of Toronto, and the north riding of Oxford at the same time; and in the following July, on the resignation of Mr. Macdonald's administration, on the seat of government question, he was entrusted by the then governor-general with the formation of a new administration. He succeeded in bringing together into his government a dozen gentlemen, who had previously been opposed to one another on almost every leading question in the country, but his ministry, as our readers will remember, only lasted two days. He was again returned for the \"Queen City,\" after a keen contest, having been opposed by the Hon. J. H. Cameron, Q.C., the present member for Peel, and a leading conservative. This constituency he continued to represent until the general election of 1861, when he was defeated, and has now retired into private life. Previous to the last session of Parliament he was seized with a dangerous illness which confined him to his bed, and prevented him from taking part in public affairs and occupying his seat in Parliament; this, together with the unpopularity of his party, and the reaction which has taken place in the public mind in favor of the present administration, no doubt contributed in a great measure to his defeat, and to that of the leading members of his party.\n\nAs a journalist, Mr. Brown has at one time and another attacked with great severity, and with an equal amount of ability, almost every public man in the country. He has not, perhaps, been subject to an unusual number of actions for libel. In April, 1854, he was sued by Mr. John White, M.P.P. for Halton, who had been charged in the Globe with having \"sold his vote for money.\" Mr. Brown defended himself with great ability. The jury failed to agree, and there the matter was allowed to drop. In 1849, in an action for libel brought by Colonel Prince for some remarks upon the alleged mismanagement by the latter, as counsel for the defence, in a case of no great importance, damages were recovered, but only to the amount of thirty pounds. In April, 1857, Dr. Workman, superintendent of the Lunatic Asylum in Upper Canada, brought an action against Mr. Brown for having published some remarks reflecting upon his management of that institution. Here, as in the action brought by Mr. White, the jury failed to agree. The steward of the same institution also sued him for libel at the same\ntime, on account of the same publication; but he was unable to obtain a verdict.\n\nMr. Brown belongs to the class of men to whom journalism has been a means of personal political advancement. Mr. Hincks, as editor, first of the Examiner, in Toronto, and afterwards of the Pilot, in Montreal, had set the example, and in this respect both can quote as their models Guizot, Thiers, and several of the most eminent statesmen of France, who had similarly profited by their connection with the political press of Paris during the reign of Louis Philippe. Mr. Brown undoubtedly weakened his position as opposition leader for the Upper Canada section by taking office in 1858. The incongruous opinions of his ministers and their wide difference laid them peculiarly open to attack.\n\nAs a speaker, Mr. Brown possesses a robust, although not highly refined eloquence. He possesses unflagging energy, industry and perseverance, qualities which have frequently called forth the praise not only of his admirers, but also of his political opponents; as well as a species of uncontrolled enthusiasm, which sometimes, though not often, unconsciously betrays him into rudeness. His manner, when speaking, is chiefly remarkable for daring courage. He always seems as if he were throwing defiance on all around him. He is fully six feet in height, and he bears, in his outward demeanour and appearance, many of the characteristics which tend to make a prominent as well as an eminent man in Canada.\n\nHON. J. H. CAMERON, Q.C., D.C.L., M.P.P.\n\nThe Hon. John Hillyard Cameron was born at Beauneaire, Languedoc, France, April 14, 1817\u2014his father, the late Angus Cameron, Esq., paymaster of the Royal Canadian Rifles, being at that time in the 79th Highlanders. Mr. Cameron served with his regiment at Waterloo, and throughout the Peninsular campaign; and in 1825 he came to Canada: he continued to serve with that gallant corps, and afterwards in the R. C. Rifles, when they were raised, until his death, in 1845. When the 79th was stationed in Toronto, in 1831, the subject of this sketch, being then in his thirteenth year, was placed at the Upper Canada college. Upper Canada college was then, and for many years, the sole collegiate institution in Western Canada, (for it was not until 1843 that King's college, now the university of Toronto, was opened to the youth of this\nprovince); and the majority of the public men of the present day have at some period of their lives pursued their studies within its time-honored walls. At college, Mr. Cameron carried off some of the highest honors; and thus early gave promise of that brilliant career which has ranked him among his most distinguished alumni. After passing through college, Mr. Cameron entered upon the study of the law under the Hon. Henry John Boulton, and subsequently he served under the present Vice-Chancellor Spragge. While yet a student, he was called upon to bear arms, and during the troubles of 1837 and 1838 he served with the Queen's Rangers. He held the rank of captain in that corps, and for six months he was on the Niagara frontier, and at Navy Island.\n\nOn 7th August, 1838, Mr. Cameron was enrolled as an attorney, and in Michaelmas Term of the same year he was called to the bar. In 1838 he formed a partnership with J. Godfrey Spragge, Esq., (now vice-chancellor), and together they commanded a very large and lucrative business. Mr. Cameron's great abilities attracted attention, and he soon took a foremost place among the most distinguished Nisi Prius counsel. Nor was this an easily won position, when it is borne in mind that he had for his compeers Sullivan, Sherwood, H. J. Boulton, Hagerman, Draper, Blake, Hagarty, and other eminent advocates. In 1843 he was appointed reporter to the Court of Queen's Bench, and in 1844, he gave to the legal profession a digest (known as \"Cameron's Digest\") of all the decided cases of the Court in Banc. In 1845 he published a valuable work of Practice under the title of \"Cameron's Rules.\" Mr. Cameron retained the reportership until 1846, and it may be noted that from his time is dated the first regular record of the decisions of the judges. In 1846 he commenced the publication of the Reports which have since been taken up by Messrs. Lukin and Christopher Robinson, E. C. Jones, and Alexander Grant, respectively, reporters of the courts of Queen's Bench, Common Pleas, and Chancery. In 1846 Mr. Cameron was appointed a Queen's counsel and solicitor-general in Upper Canada, and was then elected a bencher of the Law Society. In 1860, on the death of Sir James Buchanan Macaulay, ex chief-justice of the Common Pleas, Mr. Cameron was elected treasurer of the Law Society.\n\nMr. Cameron's career as a politician must now be briefly noted. In July, 1846, he was invited to take part in Mr. Draper's administration, and was appointed a Queen's counsel and solicitor-general for Upper Canada, and soon after, on the resignation of Rolland Macdonald, Esquire, he was elected member for Cornwall by a large majority over his opponent, Mr. Mattice. In 1847, on the appointment of Mr. Draper, the then attorney-general for Upper Canada, to a seat on the bench, Mr. Cameron was offered the attorney-generalship, but declined to accept it, as he was desirous that the late Hon. Henry Sherwood should be appointed, believing\nthat his appointment would heal the division then existing in the conservative ranks. On Mr. Sherwood's acceptance, Mr. Cameron was offered a seat at the council-board, by Lord Elgin, personally, as a mark of special consideration. This was the first instance of a solicitor-general being thus honored. At the general election, in 1848, Mr. Cameron was again elected for Cornwall, and soon after, on the Sherwood administration being beaten on a vote of want of confidence, he resigned the solicitor-generalship. Mr. Cameron continued to represent Cornwall until the end of that Parliament, and did not offer himself for re-election in the new Parliament of 1851. In 1854, he was returned with John G. Bowes, Esquire, for the city of Toronto, which he represented until the end of 1857. On Parliament being dissolved, he did not offer for re-election, although solicited to do so; but in 1858, on the formation of the celebrated two day's Brown-Dorion ministry, he opposed the re-election of the Hon. George Brown for Toronto, and was defeated by a majority of something over 100 votes, out of upwards of 5,000 polled. He again offered himself at the general election of 1861, and is now the representative of the county of Peel.\n\nDuring the time he has been in Parliament, Mr. Cameron has originated numerous important measures, and there have been few members in our legislature who have left so enduring a memorial on the statute book. He introduced and carried through the legislature the address to the Queen to exempt from the English income tax colonial securities payable in England, the property of colonists, and was successful, while in England, in having the address approved of by the Imperial Government, and such securities have always since been exempted. Mr. Cameron first suggested the invitation to the Queen to visit Canada, and the feasibility of a postal arrangement between England and the United States, for the carriage of the American mails by Canadian packets.\n\nAs a strong conservative he opposed the introduction of the elective principle into the Legislative Council, and was one of a small minority who opposed that measure in all its stages. He was the chairman of the committee on the municipal corporation act, and suggested most of the various alterations and amendments which have since been adopted by the commissioners for revising the statutes. Mr. Cameron was one of the commissioners originally appointed for their revision, but he resigned, as his legislative duties interfered with the work; his appointment was, no doubt, made in consequence of his having been a commissioner in 1840, for revising the Statutes of Upper Canada, an honor conferred upon him when he had been only two years at the bar, and the appreciation of his labors by his brother commissioners is shewn in the preface to the revision, and by the executive of the day in the remuneration given to him for his work.\nIn 1856, Mr. Cameron brought forward the celebrated resolutions for the production of Mr. Justice Duval's charge in the Corrigan case, and the bold stand taken by him on that occasion called forth the sympathies of the entire Protestant population of the province.\n\nAs a firm adherent of the Church of England, Mr. Cameron has always been conspicuous in the advocacy of her rights. He opposed the secularization of the clergy reserves, and when that step was determined on, he was mainly instrumental in securing for her clergy the rights which were reserved to them. The zeal and ability which he then displayed in advocating their interests, and subsequently in the gratuitous management and investment of their commutation moneys, have claimed the lasting gratitude of the clergy. Though repeatedly tendered some substantial recognition of his services, he has declined to receive aught at their hands, save the expression of their heartfelt thanks; but on the contrary he has acted the part of a true churchman by founding a scholarship in Trinity college, for the benefit of the sons of the clergy seeking an university education. Mr. Cameron carried through Parliament the address to the Queen for the removal of the disabilities which prevented synodical action in the Church of England. He prepared and carried through its early stages, the Church Synod Bill, having introduced the petition to the lower house at the head of a procession of the bishop, clergy, and laity of the diocese of Toronto; and when the bill was reserved for the royal assent, he remained several months in England to obtain the Queen's sanction. He had the measure submitted to the opinion of the judicial committee of the Privy Council, and under their advice it was approved by her Majesty. Mr. Cameron rendered valuable aid in the establishment of Trinity college, and subsequently, in connection with J. H. Hagarty, Esquire (now Mr. Justice Hagarty), and the Hon. P. M. Vankoughnet, he was appointed to a professorship in the Faculty of Law in that institution. In 1854, he received the honorary degree of D.C.L.\n\nFor a period of eight years Mr. Cameron held a seat as alderman in the civic councils of Toronto, and endeavored to the best of his ability, to promote the interests of the city with which his prosperity was so closely identified. In 1845, he was first returned for St. Andrew's ward.\n\nIn 1859, he was chosen grand-master of the Orangemen of British North America, and he still retains the important position of head of the order. In 1860, during the visit of the Prince of Wales, Mr. Cameron bore a prominent part in the difficulties between the Duke of Newcastle and the Orange body, and by his influence and exertions contributed largely towards allaying the excitement which at one time threatened to bring the royal visit to an unhappy close.\nOGLE R. GOWAN, Esq.\n\nThis gentleman is a native of the county of Wexford, in Ireland, and son of the late Captain John Hunter Gowan, of Mount Nebo, one of the most distinguished magistrates of that county. Mr. O. R. Gowan edited a political newspaper, published in the city of Dublin, styled the Antidote, and was the author of several pamphlets on political subjects. While in that kingdom he was a leading member of the Grand Lodge of the Orange Institution. He emigrated with his family to this country about the year 1829, and settled at Escott Park, in the county of Leeds, for which shire he has stood several severely contested elections; he was four times elected to Parliament for that county, and was subsequently elected for both the counties of Leeds and Grenville; he also contested the representation of the city of Toronto and the county of Ontario, but was defeated in both by slender majorities. For many years in succession he was chosen warden of the united counties of Leeds and Grenville, and he has also been, for some years, an alderman of the city of Toronto; he is popularly known as \"the father and founder\" of Orangeism in America, and for twenty years filled the office of grand-master of that body. Foreseeing the dawn of the rebellion in 1837, he called a meeting at Brockville, at which he made a very remarkable speech to the people, predicting the unfortunate insurrection which soon after followed. At this meeting the germ was laid of the first Volunteer Association formed in the Province; the enrollment was called the Brockville Invincibles; it gave the impetus to those noble defenders of the soil, the Canadian Volunteers. Immediately after this movement he was appointed by his Excellency Sir F. B. Head, Bart., a captain in the 2nd Regiment of Leeds Militia, then commanded by the Hon. Charles Jones; he was subsequently promoted by his Excellency Lieutenant-General Lord Seaton, to a company in the Queen's Own Rifles, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel McMillan, and while serving in that capacity, was present at the capture of \"Hickory Island,\" near Kingston, in 1838. While serving in the Queen's Rifles he attracted the attention of his Excellency Major-General Sir George Arthur, then commanding the forces in Upper Canada, by whom, in the year 1838, he was appointed to the command of the ninth provisional battalion of embodied militia, as lieutenant-colonel. At the engagement fought between the British troops and the American invaders, at the \"Windmill,\" near Prescott, in November, 1838, Lieutenant-Colonel Gowan commanded the right wing, and was three times wounded; a rifle ball\npassed through his left leg; he was cut across the inner side of the knee by a buck shot, and received a bayonet stab in the hip. The British loss in this engagement was 8 officers and 62 rank and file; that of the Americans 72 and 167 prisoners. For his personal conduct upon that day, Lieutenant-Colonel Gowan was publicly thanked in the military \"general orders,\" dated the 19th of November, and by a \"general order\" dated the 4th of December, 1838, his regiment, the Ninth Provisional Battalion, was allowed, as a mark of special distinction and approbation, to be thereafter distinguished and known as the Queen's Royal Borderers. Mr. Gowan was subsequently appointed to the command of the 2nd Regiment of Leeds Militia, vice, the Honorable Charles Jones, deceased. In Parliament he was an ardent supporter of the administrations of Lords Seaton, Metcalfe and Cathcart, but was generally found in opposition to the governments of Sir F. B. Head, Sir George Arthur, Lord Sydenham and Lord Elgin. During the administration of Sir Edmund Walker Head, he acted with the independent party, but at all times expressed a warm personal attachment to the Hon. John A. Macdonald. In 1830, he wrote a long letter in favor of the preservation of harmony between the executive and representative branches of the government. This was the first public address by any leading politician in favor of what was called \"responsible government.\" It was subsequently reprinted by the Hon. Mr. Hincks, in pamphlet form, and largely distributed through the province. For the publication of this letter Mr. Gowan was removed from the office of agent for crown lands in the Johnstown district.\n\nUpon the death of the late Sir David Jones, Mr. Gowan was offered the lucrative appointment of registrar of the county of Leeds, but as the offer was accompanied by the request that he should resign the office of grand-master of the Orangemen, he declined to accept the post tendered; he was subsequently appointed supervisor of tolls upon the public works west of Lachine, but was removed for opposing the election of the then attorney-general, Mr. Richards. At a later period he was selected, with the late Dr. Morgan Hamilton, a commissioner, to decide the land claims in the counties of Huron and Bruce. When Parliament was dissolved he resigned his commissionership, to enable him to stand as a candidate for the representation of North Ontario; he first stood for Parliament in 1830, and was defeated. At the next general election, four years afterwards, he was more successful. His parliamentary career closed in 1861, being then the \"father of the house.\" It is generally understood that he would have been elected to the present Parliament had he desired to continue in a legislative capacity; but he preferred retiring and accepting the office of post office inspector of the money order department for Upper Canada, which post he at present fills. So far as regards\nColonel Gowan's parliamentary career and character, we cannot, perhaps, do better than copy the following extract from a keen and talented little work, published at Toronto in 1840, and entitled, \"Sketches of the 13th Parliament in Upper Canada.\" The writer is understood to be Walter Cavendish Crawford, Esquire:\n\n\"This gentleman (Mr. Gowan,) has for eight or nine years occupied a prominent position in the politics of the country, not only as the head of a powerful body, but in consequence of a talent he possesses of engaging the minds of popular assemblies and leading them with him. As a speaker he is fluent and energetic, very often powerful in his appeals to feeling, and evidently speaks more for the audience than the house; his sarcasm is bitter, and possessing great evenness of temper, you seldom see him ruffled at any remarks which may be made. He is an active, well made man, rather low, with a prepossessing face and easy insinuating manners; very mild in his address, and with talents, which, if rightly applied, would soon raise him to an eminent situation.\"\n\nThis is the character of Mr. Gowan, as drawn by a pen understood not to be over friendly to that gentleman.\n\nFINIS.\n[ADVERTISEMENT.]\n\nNATIONAL UNTHRIFT;\n\nOR,\n\nThe Cup of British Prosperity\n\nAS IT UNFORTUNATELY IS.\n\n\"Actum est de Republica\"\u2014\"The Empire in Danger.\"\nNATIONAL ECONOMY;\nOR,\nThe Cup of British Prosperity\nAS IT OUGHT TO BE:\n\n\"Res Secund\u00e6\"\u2014\"The Empire out of Danger.\"\nDESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATIONS.\n\nThe first illustration shows the cup of Britain's prosperity to be a Tantalus' cup and the same thing is equally true of the United States and Canada, except so far as this is modified by their more patriotic Tariffs. Put into it, what you will, our prosperity cannot possibly rise above a certain point, at which it escapes by a waste-pipe. The moment that prosperity raises the price of British labor over the low-fixed price of gold, (about \u00a34 the ounce) away goes the gold, the cause of this prosperity, as being the cheapest article in the export market! and even when not annoyed by an export of gold, on account of the higher prices of goods\u2014which is surely bad enough, for it is surely a most inhuman system under which prosperity is the necessary mother or cause of adversity\u2014Britain encounters the still greater evil of having her internal and colonial prosperity interfered with by continual drains by Foreign loans, and by India (India having always been the grave of British treasure), for which there is no immediate return to the country. It is obvious that to the extent that Gold goes abroad in payment of goods, the demand for the Country's labor, and consequently the price thereof, is lessened. And if it is an injurious thing for the Country's labor that Gold should go abroad in payment of something, which is, or may be, a comparative advantage to the mass of the people, how much worse that it should be given away for nothing, which in any way benefits British Industry.\n\nBut\u2014as is shown in the second illustration\u2014there should be no waste-pipe in the cup of Britain's prosperity, and India and Foreign countries could not have it open to them to introduce their syphons into our national cup, but only in the depositories of its overflow. To leave it open to them to do as at present, is to leave it open to Foreign producers to prey upon the nation's vitals. It is to take our children's bread and to cast it to the dogs. Our gold should be retained as money, or as a basis or security of money, for the purpose of our own people generally, till it completely fills and overflows our own national cup, and then, and not till then, should it become available as an exportable commodity; for money is a thing created for the internal trade alone, and should only be so used. This can only be done by the use by us of an emblematic or paper money, which will be of no use beyond our own country; and in these pages various modes of establishing this have been pointed out\u2014one of which may be better suited to one state of circumstances and another to a different state of circumstances. There is evidently, however, no necessity to wait till a more economical system than the present be proposed. The boon of paper money to the masses, to businesses, and to Banks, can be attained, and the independence of the country's prosperity can be attained, even although by our new system no direct gain is meantime made; i.e., although paper money is not made for the present a legal tender to a greater extend than the mere amount of the gold in the vaults of the issuer, the banks or governments, specially held for the security of such paper money.\n\nThe object of these Illustrations, and the following explanations, is simply to endeavor to get Members of Parliament, as well as their constituents, to ask themselves whether it was the intention of the country in establishing Banks, and in establishing a paper circulation to make these the more handmaids of the Foreign Trade! There was a day in the Province when those Banks and that circulation did not exist. And was it then the intention of the people, in applying for these to the Legislature, that the result should only be to increase Foreign Trade, or, more properly, to increase the importation of Foreign labor, thus begging the province? So far from this being the people's object, it\nwas the result which of all others it was the interest of the province to avoid. It is clear, then, that though they have been the best possible Institutions, and their paper circulation the most undoubtedly safe to the holder, the Banks have not realised the higher object which it is the interest of the Province, as well their own interest, they should subserve. They have been little more than Exchange Brokers, and they could not possibly have been anything else. For what purpose then, it may be asked, was the establishment of Banks and of a paper circulating medium demanded by the people? The purpose of the people in increased circulation, could only be INCREASED EMPLOYMENT TO CANADIANS. They had been told that THE MORE MONEY, THERE WOULD BE THE MORE DEMAND FOR CANADIAN LABOR, and (as a necessary consequence of more BIDDERS) a greater price for it. It was, however, concealed from them that this law of supply and demand had already in fact been violated in the admission of the principle of the money law of Canada, in existence before the Banks were created, so that FIRSTLY, the Canadian Banks' notes cannot safely be advanced, except to parties who can sooner or later produce something convertible into Foreign Exchange\u2014and, secondly, the increased demand (that apparently greatest blessing to the producer) is NOT ALLOWED TO SHED ITS BENIGN INFLUENCE IN RAISING THE PRICES EVEN OF COMMODITIES FITTED FOR EXPORTATION; for the Foreign or Export Merchant, always having it in his power to exchange his Bank notes for gold near the price it will fetch abroad, will not of course take wheat or other Canadian exportable commodity at any higher price; and indeed from this price has to be deducted a margin to save him from the contingencies of markets, besides the freights and charges to the foreign market. THIS PERPETUAL INCLINATION TO THE DARKEST RAW MATERIAL PRICES FOR OUR EXPORTS is, as I have fully explained in the following pages, A VERY SERIOUS CONSIDERATION FOR THE CANADIAN FARMER, and the more so as while this is the highest price he will get, there is NO CERTAINTY THAT HE WILL EVEN GET THIS PRICE FOR HIS PRODUCE, unless he goes to the trouble of himself sending it to the foreign market.\u2014[From \"Britain the Country versus Britain the Empire,\" by Isaac Buchanan, Esq., M.P.P., Hamilton]\nto avoid.
