Indian Day School, Big River Reserve, Victoire, Sask.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 5th instant, Section 10 (2) of the Indian Act refers particularly to the placing of children in Indian residential schools. However, when there are day schools of different religious denominations on the same reserve it has always been our general practice to insist that the Catholic Indian children attend the Catholic day school on the reserve and the Protestant Indian children attend the Protestant Indian day school. Consequently the action you have taken in regard to the case you mention is correct.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn the above-named reserve there are two schools, one operated by the Roman Catholics, the other by the Anglicans. In nearly all cases, children of Roman Catholic parents attend their school; the Anglican children there. In one or two cases however, children are close to the Roman Catholic school, and three or four miles from the school of their religious denomination. The opposite condition exists also.\n\nFather Bequet, of the Roman Catholic mission informs me that it is the ruling of the authorities that under no condition must children of one denomination attend the other school. This ruling, if strictly adhered to, causes hardship and sometimes involves risk to the child in severe weather.\n\nI am asking that permission be given for children to attend the school nearest to their home. This would affect very few children of\nthis minute,\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nyour very truly,\n\nChief Papaweenen. X.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 19, 1943.\n\nMr. T.B. Prince, In Charge Indian Agency,\nLeask, Sask.\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Chief Papeweenan of the Big River Reserve in which he asks permission for the children on that reserve to attend the school nearest their home.\n\nWhen there are day schools of different religious denominations on the same reserve it has always been our general practice to insist that Catholic Indian children attend the Catholic day school on the reserve and Protestant Indian children attend the Protestant Indian day school. At the present time the Department does not see any reason for making a change in this practice and you should so inform the Chief.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 19, 1943.\n\nEX'D\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nWith reference to your telephone request, the cheque for Sister Cecilia of Jesus, teacher of the Big River R.C. School, was not issued at the end of October due to the fact that she had not forwarded the proper forms. These were received about the end of November and cheque 50136 was mailed from here on November 28 in payment of her salary for the months of October and November, 1942. Her salary is at the rate of $100.00 a teaching month and the amount paid her for these two months was as follows:\n\nSalary ........................................... $ 200.00\nBonus (17%) ........................................ $ 34.00\n\n$ 234.00\n\nDeductions\n\nRetirement fund (5% of $200.00) .. $ 10.00\nIncome tax for two months ........ $ 11.46\n\nBalance $ 222.54\n\nHer cheque was also issued for the month of December for $117.00 less deductions of $5.00 and 73\u00a2 respectively, or a total of $5.73, leaving the net amount payable to her $111.27.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

Besides, the Sister who is teaching is helped by two other sisters and they support themselves on the salary of the Sister who is teaching. Could you explain me why they are to pay the income tax? The Sister Superior assures me their Rev. Provincial Sister at Prud'homme has a special form certifying that the religious corporation of the \"Filles de la Providence\" is exempted from the income tax in the teaching profession. Thus, in this province of Saskatchewan, the Rev. Sisters \"Filles de la Providence\" are teaching at Doremy, Cowville, St-Front, Perigord, Wonda and so forth and they are exempted from the income tax. I do not see why the Rev. Sisters here, on the Big-River I.R., are not exempted from the income tax?\n\nWould you be kind enough to look over this matter and the Rev.

Indian Day School.\n\nWith regard to the ruling of the Department of National Revenue, Income Tax Division, the Indian Affairs Branch have not deducted income tax from the salaries of Sisters of recognized religious corporations engaged as teachers if the Branch is advised of the facts when the appointments are made. The Cost of Living Bonus regulations do not permit of payment of cost of living bonus to institutions and, where teaching Sisters, members of recognized religious corporations, have claimed exemption from income tax, the cost of living bonus has not been paid.\n\nIn the case of the Reverend Sister Cecilia of Jesus, cost of living bonus has been paid in addition to salary and the deductions made on account of income tax; in other words, the Sister has been treated in the same manner as any other employee of the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nFrom the letter of the Reverend Father G.M. Paquette, O.M.I., it is noted that the compensation paid is used by the Reverend Sister for her maintenance and is not turned over to the religious corporation.\n\nI would appreciate if you would explain the above to the Reverend Father Paquette and advise the Indian Affairs Branch further in this respect.\n\nDirector.\nDept. of Mines & Resources, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from the Sisters at the Big River Day School R.C. asking that the school be put under the direction officially as the Daughters of Providence rather than under the name of a particular teacher in charge.\n\nThey explain that during the fiscal year a teacher may be changed through illness or other reasons and that it would accommodate them.\n\nE.S.

R. School was but ninety two dollars while usually it was one hundred and seventeen. There must have been an error. Lately, the name of Sister Cecilia of Jesus was changed to that of Sister Marie Rose, on the cheque. Perhaps it was believed that the latter has no dependents. But the three Sisters working here on the reserve live upon the salary of the one who is teaching. As they have expenses to meet too, you understand that the teacher has a right to her full salary.\n\nLately, the Indian Agent, Mr. Jones, even remarked that the Reverend Sister deserved an increase of salary considering all the work they do here. You may, thus, judge of their surprise and deception upon seeing the cheque amounting but ninety two dollars.\n\nCould you please give us a reason for this change or see if there is not an error to rectify, as soon as it will be possible.\n\nI thank you sincerely, Honorable Minister for the service you shall render and I remain very truly.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sister St. Victorien is a member of a religious community which does not pay income tax. I enclose copy of letter of appointment and staff questionnaire will reach you shortly.\n\nfor Deputy Minister.\nDear Sir:\n\nThis forenoon, Sister Superior was calling my attention on the stubs of the cheques from April to November the fourth. In fact, I noticed that there is a difference in each. As a proof, here are the facts:\n\n| Month | Bonus | Gross Earnings | Fund | Income Tax | Net Earning |\n|-------|-------|----------------|------|------------|-------------|\n| April | $17.00| $117.00        | $5.00| $4.05      | $107.95     |\n| May   | $17.00| $117.00        | $5.00| $19.25     | $92.75      |\n| June  | $17.00| $117.00        | $5.00| $20.25     | $91.75      |\n| Sept. | $17.00| $117.00        | $5.00| $16.50     | $95.50      |\n| Nov 4 | None  | $100.00        | None | None       | $100.00     |\n\nFirst, I shall ask you why the income tax of $19.25 for the month of May\n$20.25 for the month of June\n$16.50 for the month of September\n\nand why this difference for each month??\n\n2) Why the income tax of $4.05 in April? For you may notice on the forms \"ad hoc\", the teaching sister took the trouble to mention that they are three sisters to get a living from the salary whose names are the following: Sr. St-Alain, superior; Sr. St-Victorien, school teacher; Sr. St-Paul de la Croix who helps the others. Therefore, according to the law, she is exempted from the income tax. Up to now, the Indian Department made away with the article relating to the salary of the teaching Sister and every month since October 1942, has taken off $4.05 from her salary.\n\n3) Furthermore in June 1944, I mentioned on one of my letters to Mr. Christianson that the teaching Sister belonged to a religious order. As such, she is exempted from the income tax. The Indian Department did pay no attention to it. For, the members of this department were satisfied in sending forms to fill up. First, the Sis-\nIn June 1944, two forms were received; no explanation was given to say there was an error. The present sister received two also. What was the result? That she has to fill a third form. Notice from the end of May 1944 to November 17th, 1944, it seems that the Department is taking pleasure in the Sister's ignorance regarding this fact and is satisfied in sending them forms without giving any explanation.\n\n3) Why is it that on the stubs of the cheques dated Nov. 28th, there isn't anything mentioned regarding the bonus that the Department of Indians Affairs grants to any teacher even if he has no pupil to teach? Up to now, I attributed these misunderstandings to some errors, but now I see in there, only bad will. You must not believe that there is lack of attention of this case. I am able to certify that the Sisters are doing their work and they really honor the Department of Indian Affairs. The latter seems to forget it in willingly refusing to give the bonus it gives to other teachers. No explanation concerning it. I would like the Department to give me information on this fact.\n\nFinally, I hope the Department will be honest enough to refund the following sum:\n\n| Month   | Amount |\n|---------|--------|\n| April   | $4.95  |\n| May     | $19.26 |\n| June    | $20.25 |\n| September| $16.50 |\n\nAn answer to each of the questions would be greatly useful to me.\n\nYours: [Signature]\n\nP.S.

In June tax purposes, i.e., single unit, two dependents, the tax classification was debatable at the time but she gave Sr. Cecilia the benefit pending classification of her status and claims, and was taxed accordingly $4.05.\n\nSr. Mary Anne being a new appointee also claimed from these regulations and lost revenue. She claimed on a T.D.T. form submitted 6.00 dollars which left her tax 19.25.\n\nThen in June we received an amended T.D.T. tax form classifying 5.00 dollars which changed her tax to 20.25.\n\nShe kept 5.00 portion of tax was discontinued & etc. Dunn went leaving her tax 16.50.\n\nHer total tax remained the same.\n\nIn all three months May 25.25\n\nThe current balance is not assessed.\n\nIncome tax and consequently dues not deemed borne.\nOttawa,\nDecember 1, 1944.\n\nDear Father Paquette:\n\nYour letter of the 20th ultimo, regarding salary payments to the teachers of the Big River R.C. School for the period April 1 to October 31, has been received and very carefully reviewed.\n\nIt is true that religious teaching orders have been exempted from the payment of income tax. However, when members of a religious order claim that privilege we are not permitted to pay bonus.\n\nThe small income tax deduction of $4.05 made in April was due to the fact that Sister Cecilia of Jesus had filed a T.D. 1 form stating that she had two dependents. We noted that she referred to the two Sisters associated with her in the work. These cannot legally be claimed as dependents. The classification consequently was debatable but, in order not to delay forwarding the cheque, she was considered as having two dependents and consequently only $4.05 income tax was deducted. An official ruling was obtained in May to the effect that the two other Sisters engaged with her in the work did not actually constitute dependents and consequently the full tax deduction of a single person without dependents was made.\n\nRev. G.E. Paquette, O.M.I.,\nBig River Indian Reserve,\nVictoire P.O., Sask.\nWe have recently refunded to Sister Marie Reine an amount of $15.17 covering the deduction of 5\u00a2 for the retirement fund for the months of May, June and September. The deduction in each case was $5 a month and the 17\u00a2 was the amount of the interest allowed. As the matter stands now the present teacher of the school will be paid at the rate promised her, namely, $100 a month, and, as she is a member of a religious order, no deduction will be made for income tax but, as stated above, she will not be allowed the bonus. No deduction will be made for retirement fund. Consequently her salary in future will be at the rate of $100 a month.\n\nI am bringing to the attention of the Trusts Branch your statement that three Indians did not receive their Treaty last spring.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nAttention: Mr. Phelan,\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nEnclosed please find Form C150-52 in connection with the appointment of an assistant teacher and handicraft directress for the Big River Indian day school.

I enclose copy of letter of appointment and staff questionnaire will reach you shortly.\n\nSister St. Alain is a member of a religious Order, under which her salary in total is turned over to the religious organization, and consequently she is not subject to income tax nor does she receive bonus.\n\nfor Deputy Minister.\nMr. W. Tucker,\nMember for Rossmere,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI already sent a copy of this report to one of my friends, Mr. Lionel Bertrand, member for Terrebonne. However, he advises me to address myself to a deputy from the West. As you are one of the two liberal deputies of Saskatchewan, I address myself to you, certain that you will help me and that you will use your influence at the Indian Department to obtain the favor that I ask.\n\nNow here is the question: It would be to enlarge the actual school by thirty feet in order to keep the children free Monday morning till three thirty on the next Friday. Mr. Jones, the Indian Agent, is doubtful as he is not able to know what the authorities of the Roman Catholic Church think. After having taken information, I wish to say that the authorities of the R.C. Church are not opposed to it and they even told me to go ahead. I do not ask for a boarding school, but a reform day school according to the expression of Mr. Jones, a school like the one at Fort Pelly.\n\nNow, here are the reasons I bring forth to get a reform day school:\n\n1. The actual school is too small, for the exterior measurements of the school are twenty-five feet wide and thirty-eight feet long. Then the average attendance at school is also twenty-two usually the number of the pupils varies from twenty-five to thirty-two every day. Furthermore, there are only twenty-eight desks. It is really troublesome for the teacher to supervise, when the children are two in a desk. Since nearly two months the Sister Superior teachers the beginners in the basement of the school, which, in winter, is too cold and of which the floor is out of use. The Sisters asked for times, I think, to have the floor repaired and they, always, had the same reply from the Indian Agent: no money, next year, we will try to do something. It is a good escape from requisition.\n\n2. Since January 1939, I was obliged nearly every day to go around in order to have the children come to school. It was a real corvee. Since September 1945, with the help of the family allowances, the children come to school more willingly, but they are late and I have to continue the same strategy: get the children at home in order to have them come on time for the beginning of school.\n\n3. Nearly every morning, the children arrive at school very dirty. The Sisters take three quarters and often an hour making them (the children) wash and clean themselves. This causes a lateness for school.\n4. Some parents keep their children because they are too far to go to school every day. When hunting time season comes, every one leaves the reserve and there are no children or few at school.\n\n5. The children whose father or mother is dead will have an opportunity to attend and to have a home for, at least, five days in a week.\n\n6. Keeping the children for five days in a week, they will make more progress and it will not be a trouble for the teacher to begin every morning the lesson explained the day before.\n\n7. Finally, the money given for the Family Allowance will be useful to the children. Otherwise, the parents use it to buy anything and the children are the last served. Very often, the children come to school after having eaten only a little food which renders impossible all effort in school.\n\nFor these reasons, I think that a school where we would keep the children from Monday morning till Friday afternoon and which would be something like the great units would do a great deal of good to the children.\n\nA reform day school will be an honour to the Indian Department, which, at this time, seems to be the aim of criticisms from every one, and the Indians would derive the greatest profit from it.\n\nAs you can see, while reading these lines, the project is worth while trying, and I dearly hope that you will use all the influence you have so that the little Indian children of the Big River Reserve learn and be able to enjoy the benefits of the education received at the reform day school.\n\nThanking you in advance for what you will do and I am,\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd.)

Tucker,\nMember for Rosetown,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI already sent a copy of this report to one of my friends, Mr. Lionel Bertrand, member for Terrebonne. However, he advises me to address myself to a deputy from the West. As you are one of the two liberal deputies of Saskatchewan, I address myself to you, certain that you will help me and that you will use your influence at the Indian Department to obtain the favor that I ask.\n\nNow here is the question: It would be to enlarge the actual school by thirty feet in order to keep the children from Monday morning till three thirty on the next Friday. Mr. Jones, the Indian Agent, is doubtful as he is not able to know what the authorities of the Roman Catholic Church think. After having taken information I wish to say that the authorities of the R.C. Church are not opposed to it and they even told me to go ahead. I do not ask for a boarding school, but a reform day school according to the expression of Mr. Jones, a school like the one at Fort Pelly.\n\nNow, here are the reasons I bring forth to get a reform day school:\n\n1. The actual school is too small, for the exterior measurements of the school are twenty-five feet wide and thirty-eight feet long. Then the average attendance at school is about twenty-two usually the number of the pupils varies from twenty-two to thirty-two every day. Furthermore, there are only twenty-eight desks. It is really troublesome for the teacher to supervise, when the children are two in a desk. Since nearly two months the Sister Superior teaches the beginners in the basement of the school, which, in winter, is too cold and of which the floor is out of use. The Sisters asked four times, I think, to have the floor repaired and they, always, had the same reply from the Indian Agent: no money, next year, we will try to do something. It is a good escape from requisition.\n\n2. Since January 1939, I was obliged nearly every day to go around in order to have the children come to school. It was a real curse. Since September 1945, with the help of the family allowance, the children come to school more willingly, but they are late and I have to continue the same strategy: get the children at home in order to have them come on time for the beginning of school.\n\n3. Nearly every morning, the children arrive at school very dirty. The Sisters take three quarters and often an hour making them (the children) wash and clean themselves. This causes a lateness for school.\n4. Some parents keep their children because they are too far to go to school every day. When hunting time season comes, everyone leaves the reserve and there are no children or few at school.\n\n5. The children whose father or mother is dead will have an opportunity to attend and to have a home for, at least, five days in a week.\n\n6. Keeping the children for five days in a week, they will make more progress and it will not be a trouble for the teacher to begin every morning the lesson explained the day before.\n\n7.

I was on this reserve on March 2nd, this being a Saturday I did not go into the day schools. I did, however, inspect both Day Schools on February 6th last and I particularly remember there were fifteen children in attendance at the Anglican Day School and I felt it necessary to compliment the teacher, Mrs. McLeod a treaty Indian, on the cleanliness of the school and her pupils. Since Mrs. McLeod is pretty much alone and can obtain these results it does not seem reasonable that the three Sisters at the other school should encounter more difficulty.\n\nThe average attendance at the Catholic Day School is 25 to 30 pupils and these pupils like the pupils of the other day school presented a very respectable appearance also.\n\nRegarding the remarks in connection with Family Allowances. The Store keepers at all points have repeatedly been requested to co-operate with us in trying to have the Indians make purchases out of Family Allowance cheques which are most suitable for the well being of the children concerned, and I believe we are receiving co-operation from these sources.\n\nE. S. Jones,\nIndian Agent.\nDear Mr. Bertrand:\n\nWhen we met last summer at Ste.-Therese, I spoke to you about a project regarding the Catholic School of the Big River Reserve. You answered: Send me a report and I will submit it to the Minister of National Resources. As it was stopped by my work and trips, I could not do it before the last few days. This was the cause of my delay. Now here is the question: It would be to enlarge the actual school by thirty feet in order to keep the children from Monday morning till three thirty on the next Friday. Mr. Jones, the Indian Agent, is doubtful as he is not able to know what the authorities of the Catholic Church think. After having taken information, I wish to say that the authorities of the Catholic Church are not opposed to it and they even told me to go ahead. I do not ask for a boarding residential school, but a Reform Day School according to the expression of Mr. Jones, a school like the one at Fort Pelley.\n\nNow here are the reasons I bring forth to get a Reform Day School:\n\n1. The actual school is too small, for the exterior measurements of the school are twenty-five feet wide and thirty-eight feet long. Then the average attendance at school is about twenty-two, usually the number of pupils varies from twenty-two to thirty-two every day. Furthermore there are only twenty-eight desks. It is really troublesome for the teacher to supervise, when the children are two in a desk. Since nearly a month, the Sister Superior teaches the beginners in the basement of the school, which, in winter, is too cold and of which the floor is out of use. The Sisters asked four times I think, to have the floor repaired and they always had the same reply from the Indian Agent: - No money, next year we try to do something. It is a good escape from the requisition.\n\n2. Since January 1939, I was obliged nearly every day to go around in order to have the children come to school. It was a real corvee. Since September, 1945, with the help of the family allowances, the children come to school more willingly, but they are late and I have to continue the same strategy: get the children at home in order to have them come on time for the beginning of school.\n\n3.

Finally, the money given for the family-allowances will be useful to the children. Otherwise, the parents use it to buy anything and the children are the last served. Very often, the children come to school after having eaten only a little, which renders impossible all effort in school.\n\nFor these reasons, I think that a school where we would keep the children from Monday morning till Friday afternoon and which would be something like the great school units highly recommended in Saskatchewan, would do a great deal of good to the children and would not be a cause of worry for the teacher. Will there be children or not at school today? Will they be clean?\n\nA reform day school will be an honor to the Indian Department which, at this time, seems to be the aim of criticism from everyone and the Indians would derive the greatest profit from it.\n\nAs you can see while reading these lines, the project is worth while trying and I dearly hope that you will use all the influence you have so that the little Indians of the reserve learn and be able to enjoy the benefits of the education received at the Reform Day School.\n\nThanking you in advance what you will do and\n\nI am, Yours\n\nG.

Paquette, O.M.I.\n\nLe P\u00e8re Paquette sugg\u00e8re, dans sa lettre, d'agrandir la pr\u00e9sente \u00e9cole afin de loger les enfants du lundi au vendredi, au lieu de leur permettre d'aller chez eux tous les soirs. L'adoption de cette suggestion signifierait, en fait, l'\u00e9tablissement d'un internat, parce qu'on devra fournir les lits, les repas et augmenter le personnel afin que les enfants puissent recevoir des soins appropri\u00e9s. Nos fonctionnaires ne sont pas en faveur de cette suggestion puisque l'\u00e9cole catholique de Big River fut construite il y a quelques ann\u00e9es avec l'id\u00e9e que les enfants resteraient sur leur r\u00e9serve et qu'il ne serait pas n\u00e9cessaire de les envoyer \u00e0 un internat.\n\nLe P\u00e8re Paquette semble \u00eatre sous l'impression que si une \u00e9cole de ce genre \u00e9tait \u00e9tablie on pourrait employer les allocations familiales \u00e0 l'entretien des enfants dans une institution de ce genre. Il n'est \u00e9videmment pas au courant du fait que les allocations familiales ne sont pas vers\u00e9es dans le cas d'enfants qui fr\u00e9quentent un internat Indien.\n\nJe puis ajouter \u00e9galement que le D\u00e9partement a appris de l'agent des Indiens que les marchands de toutes les r\u00e9serves ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pri\u00e9s de collaborer avec le D\u00e9partement en essayant que les Indiens ach\u00e8tent ce qui convient le plus au bien-\u00eatre des enfants, \u00e0 m\u00eame les ch\u00e8ques d'allocations familiales. L'Agent des Indiens est d'avis que nous recevons la collaboration des marchands.\n\nBien \u00e0 vous,\n\nW.J.F. Pratt,\nSecr\u00e9taire particulier.\nHon. J.A. Glen,\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Glen,\n\nOn April 23rd you answered to a letter which I had sent you on the 9th of the same month, transmitting to you a letter which had been addressed to me by Reverend Father G.E. Paquette of the Big River Indian Reservation, Saskatchewan.\n\nFather Paquette whom I know intimately, has just sent me a few commentaries in connection with this letter, and I am transmitting them to you as follows:\n\n\"In my letter, I did not mention the building of a boarding school outside of the Reservation or the sending of the children to a boarding school outside of the Reservation. All that I asked was this: My request had to do with the enlargement of the present school by about thirty feet in order to keep the children there from Monday to Friday. Then, I mentioned the reasons for which I made that request. There is a reason to which I draw the attention of the Department. The children arrive in a condition verging on filth. The three nuns spend one hour every morning cleaning them. Uninteresting work to which the twelve years of missionary life among the Indians have failed to accustom me, and the nuns start this work again every morning and change their (the children's) clothes, in order that they be properly dressed. Those clothes are gifts which they got, and Mr. Ostrander also sent a few bundles. Once the school day is over, they put on their dirty clothes to go back to the house.\n\nThat request does not come from me. It comes from the Indians themselves. Already a family from that Reservation have sent their seven children to the boarding school of Beauval; another made such a request and, this Summer, the Gilbert and Alex Keenatch families want to send their children to the Beauval residential school. Recently, another family made the same request. Since the Department for Indian Affairs wish the children to stay on the Reservation, they must take the means of seeing that they do stay on their own reservation. I forgot to mention how many times the nuns have kept the children or rather have sheltered them during their absence, in order that the children might be at...\"\nschool every day. I have no doubt that the Indian Affairs department can meet my request and will do everything in their power for the welfare of the children.\n\n\"I willingly admit that I was unaware of the fact that the children going to a boarding school were not entitled to family allowances. However, I can affirm that I have never seen the Indians in such a condition of idleness as since they receive the family allowance. They rely only on the allowance cheque to live. With that money they are enabled to buy everything they want, and the children have nothing to wear and nothing to eat. Repeated visits to the Reservation would convince anyone who is not aware of the facts, I have never seen them as poor as this summer, and it seems to me that if that money or the equivalent were used to feed and clothe the children, it would be more useful to the children than encouraging the parents to be idle.\n\n\"Regarding the third paragraph, concerning the co-operation of the merchants, that is a big question mark because I have noted that the co-operation is very small or does not exist at all\".\n\nI again bring this case to your attention, and I think that it will be possible for you to grant the request of this good priest whose family, living at Ste. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se in my county, count among my best friends.\n\nCordially yours,\n\nLionel Bertrand\n\nM.P.

This suggestion then involves a lot more than the mere extension of the school by thirty feet.\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch has written to\n\nLionel Bertrand, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\n......... its\nits Inspector of Indian Agencies for Saskatchewan, requesting a report by him on conditions on this reserve.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6297, file 629-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**TREASURY ONLY**\n\nPay to: G.

It should be noted that this is below the minimum required for teachers with permanent certificates in Saskatchewan.\"\nBig River Indian Reserve\nVictoire, F.P., Sask.\nMarch 15, 1947.\n\nLionel Bertrand, Esq.,\nM.P. for Terrebonne,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRecently I wrote you stating that I would again take up the matter of the Catholic school of Big River reservation. First of all, it is too small, because at the last trimester (from Sent. to December) the pupils' average was 29.9. There are only 28 desks. What can be done when there are 32 to 34 children present in the classroom. As you can see the school is at its full capacity and the ventilation is defective in view of the large number of pupils. Only one class-room for all of them. The Revd. Sister Superior also teaches the highest and lowest courses in the basement of the school to assist the school teacher in her work. Regarding the basement, the cement floor is in very bad condition. The sisters have called the attention of the inspector and of the Indian agent. They examine, make plans and go away; in the Fall or in the Spring repairs will be done. We have been waiting for those repairs for three or four years. It seems that something should be done and the matter would be settled. Nice words and promises. They are well able to give them, our good agents ....\n\nTo come back to the letter from Mr. Glen who states: \"We are trying to encourage the Indians to accept some responsibility in the education of their children\". I wonder if the minister, Mr. Glen, has visited all the reservations of Western Canada. Undoubtedly, some of them are more civilized than others, when they are compared to those of the East which have a civilization of 2 or 3 hundred years before them. That counts for something.\n\nIn that connection, an employee of the Indian department mainly admitted: our officers in Ottawa do not understand anything. They judge the western reserves in the same light as those of the east. Without Indians deeply anchored in their habits and whose object is to enjoy the moment's satisfaction, it is very hard for them to understand what it is to be responsible in the education of\ntheir children. As soon as the children have reached the age of 14 or 13, their studies are over. They know enough to saw a piece of wood or to spend their time doing nothing. With the girls, it is the same thing because at the age of 13 or 14 they are already married by their parents. Here are some names, if he wants some:\n\nCatherine Lachance Married under the Indian manner, in February last; born on October 9, 1932.\n\nNaney Whitefish or Attikamen Married in the Indian manner in July last; born Feb. 22, 1933.\n\nNetmaker F. Married in the Indian manner at the age of 14.\n\nThomas M. Married in the Indian manner at the age of 13 or 14.\n\nThose marriages are for the year 1946 until today. I do not dare bring up cases of the past years.\n\nUnder such circumstances, how can you expect the parents to understand their responsibility. Since 1939 almost, as a truant officer handling a stick, I have to walk a mile or two to send the children to school. Unless I did that, they would arrive at twelve o'clock or they would not come at all. Sometimes I have to parley with the parents who want to keep their children for the smallest of reasons. As you can see, civilization has a long way to go before the parents understand their responsibility regarding the education of their children.\n\nFurthermore, the minister of Resources adds: \"In a day school of this size it has been felt that the children are happier and more contented in their classes than in a residential school, where they are often far from their parents and homes.\" First, I want to point this out: I am not asking for a residential school but a semi-residential school, according to the minister's word. Furthermore, I am not making a request for a semi-residential school outside the reserve, but for one on the reserve. That is what the minister seems to ignore. That school will be for the children of the reservation, that is to say, for the Big River reservation commonly known as Whitefish, and not for the children of other reserves. Second point, the children will be happier\nand more contented than those of the residential schools. A big interrogation mark can be placed here. A sure thing is that the children kept at school during the whole week will be happier and more contented than those fed at home because, at least, at the school they will satisfy their hunger as, at the house, it is no longer the parents who support their children but rather the children themselves, by the family allowance cheque, who support the parents and keep them in a condition of semi-idleness. Enquire of the merchants of Lascal and of Victoire. They will say what I have just told you and even that a good number spend their family allowance cheque before they receive it.\n\nHappiness from the material viewpoint is very small and can hardly exist. Furthermore at lunchtime (for which the department grants $65 for 34 or 35 children) the children devour what the nuns contrive to give them as if they had hardly or not eaten in the morning before coming to school... The nuns could give you much information in this regard which would surprise you greatly. As you can see, happiness is far from being what the minister thinks. Finally, certain Indian families ardently wish to send their children to an industrial school. Already, since two years, seven or rather then, have gone to such a school. Others have made requests to that effect. I refused and asked the Indian agent, Mr. Jones, to support me in my refusal. That means that the Indians know very well that their children will be happier and more contented in a residential school than in a day-school. It is for the purpose of trying to obtain a semi-residential school or a reform day school, according to the word used by Mr. Jones, Indian agent at Leask, that I bring up the matter again.\n\nI hope that you will send to Mr. Glen the various remarks that I make in this letter and that you will support my request with all your influence. If, one day, the Indian children have a semi-residential school, they will owe it to you and will be glad to thank you by asking God for the graces that you need and for success in your undertakings.\n\nThanking you very much, I remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. F. G.E. Paquette, O.M.I.\n\nTranslation\nAP/\nMay 15/47.\nHon. J. Allison Glen,\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYou will undoubtedly recall that I wrote you in the past concerning Reverend Father G.E. Paquette, O.M.I., who ministers to the Indian Reserve at Grande Victoire, Saskatchewan.\n\nHe is one of my very personal friends and he has just written me a letter of which I send you a copy.\n\nOf course, that is not a matter which concerns my county.

I may say in this connection that we have two Indian day schools on the White Bear's Reserve, one under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church, and the other under the auspices of the Women's Missionary Society of the United Church. There was an understanding when the Roman Catholic Day School was opened last year that parents of children living closer to the Roman Catholic School should be permitted to send their children to that school, even though they belong to the United Church, and that parents of Roman Catholic children living closer to the United Church School should be permitted to send their children to the United Church School rather than have them travelling a greater distance to the school operated under their own denomination.\n\nI certainly favour this method as it seems unnecessary, even unwise, to insist upon Indian children travelling a greater distance to school in order that they may attend the school of their own denomination.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nOttawa, October 22, 1947.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nWe have your letter of the 14th instant, file #1557-303-11B and 300-11B, with reference to the matter of attendance of Indian children at the day schools on the Big River Reserve.\n\nUnless there is mutual agreement between the churches under whose auspices day schools are operated on the Big River Reserve, the Department has no alternative than to insist on carrying out the provisions of Sub-Section 2 of Section 10 of the Indian Act.\n\nBernard F.

Day School.\n\nPlease find attached a letter which has been received from Lionel Bertrand, M.P., concerning correspondence which he has received from Reverend Father G.E. Paquette, O.M.I., Missionary at Big River.\n\nThe first paragraph of this letter refers to an Educational and Family Allowances matter. The second paragraph refers to the Indian Health Services and is, therefore, being passed to them for attention.\n\nWith regard to Sam Lachance, our records here show that he was absent fourteen days in September (toxoid illness) five days in October (sore arm) and three days in December. Since then we have received no monthly reports from the Big River C.E. School. Therefore, it will be necessary for us to be provided with local details in order to answer this letter. We should also have the monthly reports from the Big River R.C. School for January, February and March, 1948. A copy of this letter is being sent to Indian Superintendent Jones so that you can correspond directly with him.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nEncl:\nBFN/HM.\nHon. J.A. Glen,\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReverend Father G.E. Paquette, O.M.I., ministerant at Big River, Indian Reservation, in Saskatchewan, and who comes from my own city, calls the following facts to my attention and asks me to make them known to you. In his letter he states:\n\n\"Since September, we have difficulty in getting certain children to attend school. They say that at the Anglican school they can stay away as much as they like and that the family allowance is granted to them just the same. The Department has set five days for absenteeism per month. If the children are absent over five days per month, they do not get the allowance. At the school here, the teacher is strict about this. Last fall, young Sam Lachance of the Anglican school spent almost two weeks in front of the Catholic school waiting for the pupils to go and play. The nuns have, like myself, seen young Lachance play truant. The allowance was granted for that month such as in the case of the pupils who attend school regularly. I would not have said a word if the councillor Thomas Whitefish whose children go to the Anglican school had not stated before three or four Indians at our school, \"at the Anglican school the children are absent as often as they like and the allowance is granted regularly\". That is a source of annoyance for us and it seems to me that the same law must apply to the children of other denominations as well as to the Catholic pupils.\"\nRecently an Indian woman, Mrs. Benjamin Netmaker went to the Ste. Famille hospital at Prince Albert. After having been examined, the doctors stated that she took too great a quantity of Indian medicine and that her internal tissues are destroyed. That is what Dr. Tucker of Prince Albert, said here to a family on the reserve, and he tried to find out who gave her the medicine. First, this woman got Indian remedies from Frank Netmaker and in addition, he bled her at the elbow. I have proofs concerning what I state. Then, Charlie Lachance also gave her medicine. When they have wheedled as much money as possible from the patient and when they see that there is no more hope, those two men call for a doctor and, if the latter is not successful, they accuse him of being inefficient, etc. I think that this is the good time to bring those two nitwits to their senses, particularly in this case; it is thought, according to the doctor's report, that the woman has blood poisoning. I would ask the Indian Department to get busy and to see that the two men get severe punishment. Then the whites who live near the reservation will stop to believe that the Indian Department is not doing its duty in this respect and that the Department appoints unqualified doctors to look after the Indians\".\n\nI believe that those facts certainly deserve your personal consideration and that of your Department. Hoping to hear from you soon, I remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nLionel Bertrand.\n\nM.P. Terrebonne.\nTo - The Deputy Minister\n\nFile 107-13-1 (E.1)\n\nAttention - Director of Indian Affairs.\n\nOn May 29 Mr. Hoey replied to a memorandum of Mr. Bethune's regarding a letter received from Mr. Lionel Bertrand, M.P., regarding representations made by Father Paquette concerning the Big River Indian Reserve.\n\nI am wondering if there is any further information which can be passed to us at the present time.\n\nA.C.L.

(RG 10, Volume 6297, file 629-1, part 1)\nOttawa, June 24, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nWith reference to Mr. Adams' memorandum of June 22nd, the only additional information that we have received is contained in a letter from Regional Supervisor Ostrander and Superintendent Jones. I enclose copies of both these letters.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP/MGD\nOttawa, June 30, 1948.\n\nLionel Bertrand, Esq., M.P.,\nSte. Therese de Blainville, Que.\n\nBig River Indian Reserve.\n\nI am now able to provide you with further information concerning the situation mentioned in my letter of April 19.\n\nYou will recall that the Reverend Father G. E. Paquette, O.M.I. of the Big River Indian Reserve, made certain representations with regard to conditions on this reserve. The delay in answering has been caused by the fact that our field officials have been unable to reach the reserve because of the condition of the roads. However, we have now received a report from our Indian Superintendent and also from the teacher of the Church of England school on the Big River Reserve.\n\nThe essential fact in this situation seems to be that some members of the Big River Band have refused to accept family allowances. For this reason, our field officials have not pressed the regulations regarding school attendance. In this way it was hoped that the parents would be encouraged to register their children for payment.\n\nThe teacher at the Big River Church of England School is an Indian named Mr. Smith Atimoyoo who is a graduate in Theology from Emmanuel College. He has submitted a report upon his pupils' attendance during the year. Unfortunately, this\nreport was delayed because of lack of transportation and the flooded river.\n\nIt shows that Sam Lachance was absent during September because of toxoid illness.\n\nOur local Indian Superintendent will be giving special attention to the attendance at this school in future.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nA.G.L. Adams,\nPrivate Secretary.\nOttawa, le 30 juin 1948.\n\nM.

Indian day school, was not sent out for the months of September and November. You are not without knowing that the three Sisters here do nothing only air and water in the lake. They are very embarassed to see that they have to oblige the store keepers to wait for their pay.\n\nWould you be kind enough to see to this that Dr. Ladulais is paid as soon as possible.\n\nThank you cooperation and assure you most truly,\n\nFather Paquette\nDecember 13, 1948.\n\nReverend Father Paquette, O.M.I.,\nBig River Indian Reserve,\nVictoire P.O., Saskatchewan.\n\nBig River R.C. Indian Day School\n\nDear Father Paquette:\n\nI have for answer your letter of December 6 and regret the misunderstanding which has arisen with regard to the payment of the teachers' salary at this school. I believe that the Reverend Sister will be receiving her cheques regularly now.\n\nHowever, I feel the Department is not to blame in this case. Please find attached letter which I wrote on September 2, 1948, and which is self-explanatory. You will understand that the Department must be notified of changes in teaching staff. We must be notified as soon as possible in order that we can make the necessary adjustments with Treasury Branch. When Sister Bernadette Marie was replaced by Sister Marie Ladislas, the Department should have been notified. Fortunately, we did receive an application for classification on our Revised Salary Schedule from Sister Marie Ladislas and we immediately wrote on September 2 to the Reverend Sister Superior. I have carefully searched our files since that date and can find no record of an answer having been received to my letter.\n\nFortunately, Mr. McLeod wrote us in November, and we immediately asked that salary cheques be forwarded to Sister Ladislas. I would suggest that you discuss\nthis matter with the Sisters and ascertain whether or not a reply was sent to my letter of September 2.\n\nIt is our earnest desire to have our teachers paid promptly, and anything you can do to assist in this matter will be appreciated.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nJanuary 7, 1949.\n\nMr. N.J. McLeod,\nIndian Superintendent,\nDuck Lake, Saskatchewan.\n\nBig River R.C. Indian Day School\n\nWe have now received Mr. Provincial Inspector Amundrud's report on the above school. In his general comment he states as follows:\n\n\"From money won as prizes for work exhibited at the Prince Albert fair last summer a full set of rhythm band instruments has been secured. I was rather impressed with the quality of performance with these instruments and also with the fact that every child took part. Considerable time is now being spent in learning Christmas songs also. This is commendable, although I did feel since the learning of English presents sufficient difficulty, that the learning of songs in Latin is unnecessarily burdensome.\n\nPupils in the higher grades read sufficiently well to understand and do problems from their texts. Reading in the primary grades tends to be word-saying, not too closely associated with the meaning since English is heard and spoken only within the classroom. If the obstacles are not too great, I would suggest that English rather than Cree be the language of the playground also.\n\nThe schoolhouse is as usual very clean and well kept.\n\nThe furnace smokes too readily and should be repaired.\n\nIn order to free the one cloakroom for its intended use I would suggest the building of storage cupboards across the back of the classroom.\"\nWould you please discuss with Sister Marie Ladislas the possibility of having the Indian children use English on the playgrounds rather than Cree. We realize only too well the difficulty involved in this but would appreciate a redoubling of her efforts to have English spoken. It is presumed that we will be hearing from you with regard to the furnace. Would it be possible to have a tender obtained for the installation of the storage cupboards required, or would you suggest the purchase of an unpainted cupboard from Eaton's or Simpson's?\n\nBernard F.

Castleden, Esq., M.P.,\nYorkton, Saskatchewan.\n\nDear Mr. Castleden:\n\nI have for answer your letter of April 7 addressed to the Superintendent of Education. The information which you requested is as follows. On the Big River Reserve there are two day schools in operation. One of these is for the Roman Catholic children (the 1944 census shows 199 Catholics) and one for the Anglican children (the census shows 65 Indians for this denomination).\n\nBoth schools are located on the reserve about a mile and a half apart. They are identical in size and structure, but the classroom operated for the Roman Catholic children is crowded, and we are now investigating the possibilities of enlarging it. The teacher at the Anglican school is an Indian named Smith Athayoo who attended high school in Prince Albert and then attended Emmanuel College for a period of four years. There he received his Associate in Theology. He taught at the Shoal Lake Indian Day School from 1942 to 1947. He began teaching at the Big River C.M. Indian Day School in September, 1947.\n\nThe teacher at the Big River R.C. Indian Day School is Sister Marie Ladislas. She holds a First Class Teaching Certificate for the Province of Saskatchewan and has had three years of experience in private and provincial schools. She was appointed to this position on the 1st September, 1948, and replaced Sister Bernadette Karle who also had a First Class Teaching Certificate with some ten years of experience in provincial schools.\n\nOur Educational Survey Officer spent a considerable part of last Spring in Saskatchewan, and as a result of his inspections, we are planning the building of a number\nof day schools in that province. As you are aware, we have completed the schools at Meadow Lake, Nut Lake and Poorman. The new two-room school at Thunderchild is just now beginning construction.\n\nWe will shortly be advertising for tenders for other schools.\n\nThese schools are inspected by both the Provincial School Inspectors and by our own Indian Superintendents. The school inspectors naturally concentrate on classroom technique and teaching methods, whereas our superintendents check on the condition of the building, cleanliness of the children and school administration generally.\n\nThe Provincial School Inspectors visit these schools at least once a year, and our own superintendents visit them as often as possible, usually once a month.\n\nI hope the above information provides you with the facts you are seeking.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nDirector.\n\nDictated by H.F. Henry\n\nVERRY POOR COPY\nApril 16, 1949.\n\nJ.F. Pouliot, Esq., M.P.,\nRiviere du Loup, P.Q.\n\nDear Mr. Pouliot:\n\nI have received your letter of April 8 addressed to the Superintendent of Education. On the Big River Reserve we have two Indian Day Schools, one for the Catholic children and the other for the Anglican children.\n\nIt is evident that the Indian from whom you have received the letter attached to yours of April 8 is complaining against the teacher at the Anglican school.\n\nThis teacher is Mr. Smith Atimoyoo who is himself an Indian. He attended high school in Prince Albert and after four years of study graduated from Emmanuel College in Saskatoon with an Associate in Theology. He taught for five years at the Shoal Lake Indian Day School and transferred in September, 1947, to the Big River C.E. Day School.\n\nWe have written to our local Indian Superintendent under whom this teacher works and have requested a full report concerning the complaints listed in Mr. William Joseph's letter.\n\nYou can anticipate hearing from me again when I have heard from the Indian Superintendent concerned.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nDirector.\n\nDictated by B.F.

The first was from Mr. Castleden who had received a complaint relative to the maintenance of the schools in that area and who raised several questions concerning the two schools.\n\nThe second was from J.F. Pouliot, M.P., who attached a letter from William Joseph, an Indian of this reserve. I have made a copy of this letter which I attach for your information. I have arranged to have a duplicate copy of this letter sent to you and also an extra copy of Mr. Joseph's letter, as you will presumably wish to get in touch with Mr. McLeod concerning the complaints made against Mr. Atimoyoo.\n\nAs I dictated this letter, I received a long list of names from Father Plourde which totals 54 children who will be of school age next September and also 11 children whom Father Paquette claims to be attending school at the Anglican Day School. If Mr. McLeod wishes copies of these letters, I will be pleased to forward these to him. In Mr. McLeod's letter of March 16, he advised that he would be seeing Father Paquette in the near future concerning the request for additional classroom accommodation at the Big River R.C. School.\n\nBernard F.

As you are aware, the Residential Schools at Prince Albert are now providing for many of the children formerly served by the Lac la Ronge Residential School. The Gordon's Residential School has been closed for major repairs and the provision of an adequate water supply. It will re-open in September, 1949. Even with one school being closed, the enrolment at our residential schools in Saskatchewan has increased by 46 this year over the number enrolled last year.\n\nThe Day School statistics are as follows:\n\n| Year   | Number of Schools | Enrolment | Average |\n|--------|-------------------|-----------|---------|\n| 1947-48| 31                | 900       | 761     |\n| 1948-49| 33                | 1009      | 829     |\n| Increase| 2                 | 109       | 68      |\n\nI feel that our school building program this year and next year will go a long way towards alleviating the present school shortage in Saskatchewan.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDirector.\nJune 28, 1949.\n\nMr. J.F.B.

We have a letter from her successor advising that a cheque for $22.00 sent to Sister St. Alain has been returned. I understand that you have received this cheque, and it should be deposited.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nPP/ST Chief, Education Division\nVictoire, Sask.\nOctober 27, 1949.\n\nMr. N. J. McLeod\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letters of October 2nd file 1477-15-118 (109) and the one of October 22 file 1551-15-118 (109) re attendance of R.C. children to the Anglican day school on this reserve. Your instructions concerning those children have not been carried out at all. Nothing was done, because I saw with my own eyes the children of Joseph Whitefish going to the Anglican school a few days ago.\n\nNow, I know the trouble come from just because they think they are two and half or three or four miles away from our school, they can send their children to the Anglican school. It might be a good thing to have somebody to bring to our school those children every morning and to bring back home every night those children and to be paid for this like the Provincial Government do for the whites. In this way, there will be no trouble at all for the parents.\n\nThey will finish to build the road today or tomorrow across the reserve from Capassin.\n\nThe following children do not come to school at all:\nGordon Lachance: Mrs Julie Lachance\nVital Netmaker : Mrs Flora Netmaker\nJames Netmaker : Simon Netmaker.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd) Father Paquette, OMI\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nEnclosed herewith please find a copy of a letter forwarded to this office by the Rev. Father Paquette, R.C. Missionary on the Big River Indian Reserve. The contents thereof is self explanatory.\n\nAs you are aware, Big River Band of Indians are served by Anglican and R.C. Missionaries both of whom are struggling to convert the members of Big River Band from Paganism to a christian way of life, with the results that considerable pressure is being brought to bear upon the Indians by the Missionaries concerned to adhere to the particular faith which the Missionaries represent, due to this pressure the Indian mind is confused and while a few are becoming strong adherents of the faiths mentioned, the majority are asea as it were and cannot understand the difference or shall we say animosity that exists between the two christian denominations who are in competition in connection with their conversion from Paganism.\n\nThe suggestion outlined in the enclosed letter received from Rev. Father Paquette would no doubt assist the Missionaries and place the onus of deciding which Indian is Pagan, Anglican or Roman Catholic upon our Branch, with the results that the Superintendent would eventually receive the wrath of Anglican and Roman Catholic Church officials. This responsibility I do not feel we should accept nor do I feel that we should expend the taxpayers money to assist either religious denomination now striving in competition to convert the Indians of Big River Band to their respective faith.\nThe writer has issued a directive to both Anglican and Roman Catholic school teachers as outlined in section 10, subsection 2 of the Indian Act. The teachers report that they have advised the parents of children in attendance at the schools under their charge to the effect that no Protestant child shall be assigned to a Roman Catholic school and no Roman Catholic child shall be assigned to a Protestant school.\n\nThe writer has also endeavoured to iron out the difficulty however I find that Indians who at one time adhered to the Anglican faith have been baptised by the Roman Catholic clergy and previous to the coming into Big River Reserve by Roman Catholic Missionaries the Big River Band were recognized as adherents of the Anglican faith, however, I would go so far as to state that Paganism possibly would be the correct term.\n\nAgain, referring to the enclosed letter, I believe that our Branch is now being requested to supply transportation with a view towards our accepting responsibility to decide which Indian family is R.C., Anglican or Pagan, thereby leaving ourselves open to criticism in the event of an error arising.\n\nOur day schools on the Big River Indian Reserve are located from three to five miles apart, therefore the solution appear to be for our Missionaries to induce their adherents to place their home near the day schools conducted under their auspices. This method should now be feasible as we have provided materials for the erection of twenty new Indian homes on the Big River Indian Reserve.\nThe difficulty confronting our Missionaries is a problem that they themselves should solve and the Missionaries concerned must face the fact that the Indians of Big River Band have not advanced towards acceptance of christianity and the Indian's mind is becoming confused to the extent that due to competition in converting them to christianity they have become neither good Pagans, Anglicans or Roman Catholics. This is as explained to the writer by the Chief of Big River Band.\n\nShould you disagree with my views outlined herein I am prepared to act on your instructions. In the meantime I am not prepared to recommend the suggested method of providing transportation as outlined in the enclosed letter from Rev. Father Paquette.\n\nOn my next visit to Big River Indian Reserve I will again discuss this matter with Rev. Father Paquette, and, if necessary submit a further report.\n\nN.J.

McLeod  \nSupt., Indian Agency,  \nDuck Lake, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Indians of this reserve are selling cords of wood to the price of five dollars and forty cents to Mr. Walter Charpentier at Pascal. He takes away 60 cents for hospitalisation or such reasons like that. Mr. Courchene of Debden buys too cords of wood from the Indians seven dollars and twenty five cents a cord in the carload. Too big difference between those two buyers of cords of wood. Both want wood close the track. It is up to you to pay some attention concerning those facts.\n\nLast Friday I saw the children (Three children) of George Morin and Louis George Morin coming from the Anglican School - I waited one month to know if your instructions will be carried out or not. Now, my first move will be to publy yours letters and the ones of Mr. Jones - and so on to the new papers, for the way the things are going you are just to fool me. It is my duty to do it and I am taking this opportunity to let you this thing known before I will do anything.\n\nYours truly  \n(sgd) Father Paquette, OMI\n\nM.B.

O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\nUniversity of Ottawa,\nLaurier Avenue East, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nBIG RIVER INDIAN RESERVE\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nAs you are aware, there are two separate mission groups working on the above reserve, in the Duck Lake Agency, Saskatchewan. Both are endeavouring to convert the members of the Big River Band from paganism to a Christian way of life, with the results that considerable pressure is being brought to bear upon the Indians by the missionaries concerned.\n\nDue to these pressures, the Indian mind is confused and we are advised that while a few are becoming strong adherents of the faiths mentioned, the majority are rather undecided and cannot understand the difference and the feelings which exist between the two Christian denominations who are in competition in connection with their conversion from paganism.\n\nI have discussed with you previously the activities of your missionary, the Reverend Father Paquette, and now wish to bring to your attention another matter which has recently arisen concerning his activities. Recently Mr. Indian Superintendent McLeod has issued a letter to both Anglican and Roman Catholic school teachers, in accordance with Section 10 (subsection 2) of the present Indian Act. The teachers report that they have advised the parents of children in attendance at the schools under their charge concerning the provisions of this section.\n\nThe Indian Superintendent has also tried to iron out the difficulty but he has found that Indians who at one time adhered to the Anglican faith have been baptized by the Roman Catholic clergy. This of course has led to a great deal of confusion as to the exact religious status of some of the Indians.\nFather Paquette has now made a request with regard to transportation which would place the onus of deciding the religious denomination of the Indian children directly on Departmental officials. The onus of deciding which Indian is pagan, Anglican, or Roman Catholic, would involve the Indian Superintendent in many controversies and would eventually arouse the wrath of both the Anglican and Roman Catholic Church authorities.\n\nAs you are aware, the decision with regard to residential school pupils is made on the basis of the application forms completed by the parents and if necessary supported by statutory declarations. This is not possible in the case of day school pupils and it would lead to endless confusion if each day school pupil had to fill out an application form for submission to the Department.\n\nIt is evident that the Indians of the Big River Band have not advanced towards acceptance of Christianity and in fact the Chief of the Band has described the situation to the Indian Superintendent in very apt terms. He claims that the minds of the Indians are becoming confused to such an extent, due to competition in converting them to Christianity, that they have become neither good pagans, good Anglicans or good Roman Catholics.\n\nFurthermore, Father Paquette seems to be intent on pressing this matter and on October 31 he wrote to our Indian Superintendent as follows:\n\n\"Last Friday I saw the children (Three children) of George Morin and Louis George Morin coming from the Anglican School - I waited one month to know if your instructions will be carried out or not.

It is my duty to do it and I am taking this opportunity to let you this thing known before I will do anything.\"\nWith this explanation in front of you, I would appreciate an interview with you in the near future so that Father Paquette can be advised of the difficulties which he is creating and which it is felt the Department should not decide but rather the missionaries concerned.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

(RG 10, Volume 6297, file 629-5, part 1)\nOttawa,\nSeptember 14, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of a requisition for the supplies and equipment necessary for the operation of the Big River Catholic Indian day school. I note on this requisition you ask for 20 combined seats and desks for school pupils and also 1 kitchen range for preparing midday lunches.\n\nMay I express the opinion that you should be reasonably familiar with the regulations governing the purchase of Departmental supplies. It is wholly impossible for Purchasing Agents, who are in no sense familiar with the operations of an Indian day school or, for that matter, any other day school, to purchase seats unless they have before them information indicating the age of the pupils that are likely to use these seats. In the case of the kitchen range I naturally ask whether it is intended to burn wood or coal in this range and ask for additional information with respect to the size, etc. I must again express regret that this information was not forwarded with your requisition. Your failure to send it forward must, of necessity, result in delay in sending forward these supplies and it is just possible delay in the opening of the school.\n\nYou are authorized to purchase locally, from firms on the approved list, the other supplies listed on your requisition with the exception of the seats, the stove and the desk and chair for the teacher. Your immediate attention to this matter will be very much appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. S. Davis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn answer to your letter of Sept. 14th, file 107-13-5, I have to advise that the combined seats and desks, which were asked for in our requisition for the Catholic School on the Big River Reserve, are required for pupils of the following ages:\n\n8 desks for pupils 7 years old.\n4 desks for pupils 10 years old.\n4 desks for pupils 12 years old.\n4 desks for pupils 14 years old.\n\nA kitchen range similar to the one shown in Eaton's catalogue on page 407, No. 45 L 100 at $62.75 would be satisfactory for use at this school. Wood will be used for fuel.\n\nAs this school is now being erected the opening will not be delayed. It is expected that the school will be ready for use in about a month and a half.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. S. Davis, Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Can.\nLeask, Sask.,\nSept. 22nd 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn our letter of August 31st we omitted to request authority for an expenditure for mid-day meals for the children who will be attending the new Catholic Indian Day School, on the Big River Reserve, now being built.\n\nYou granted authority for one school on the Big River Reserve in your letter of Sept. 11th, file 107-2-5; I presume that this will be for the Anglican School. The amount granted for mid-day meals in your letter was $50.00. A similar amount should be granted for the Catholic School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. S. Davis, Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Can.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 27, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 22nd instant the Department will allow an amount of $50.00 for the current academic year for serving a midday lunch at the Big River R.C. school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

S. Davis, and to date nothing has been received yet and we are short of everything. This school was opened on January 15th 1940 and we are still without a chair or desk for the teacher, no clock, no bell, not enough desks for the children, no broom, no dust pan, no tub and scores of other things are lacking.\n\nThe attendance is over twenty-three now and seven or eight more are expected within a week. How can I carry on without impairing the efficiency of the school.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Missionary and the teacher have been supplying whatever they could afford but is it reasonable that they should be forced to do so.\n\nFollowing my responsibility as a teacher, I feel it my duty to lodge a complaint to your office without however laying the blame on any body in particular, but surely someone is responsible. I find it queer that from a communication from Mr. Phalen through Father Plourde O.M.I. about the pupil's desks: we were told to send our order to the agent and he then would notify Mr. Phalen that our request would be granted. In the mean time, the teacher sent a requisition form asking all what was necessary in the school and the desks were mentioned. No reply from the agent. About at that time, the agent told us to put every thing on the requisition forms and mail to him.\nThis was done according to his instructions.\n\nI hope that this letter will bring a favorable reply.

School requesting a desk and chair. On reviewing our files I find that while you forwarded a request for these articles last January you were informed in official letter of January 30 that we had no funds available at that time to make the purchase. You were directed to again bring the matter to our attention early in April but as you did not do so no order was placed. I am arranging with the Purchasing Branch today to secure these articles at once.\n\nYou may purchase 1 ordinary alarm clock and 1 broom. If there are any other articles required you should advise me.\n\nThe teacher states that the attendance is over 23 and 7 or 8 more children are expected shortly. As a result he stated additional desks are needed. Please let me know the number and size of desks which you consider are required.\n\nThe teacher also writes as follows:\n\n\"Seven bags of potatoes have been given lately to the Anglican school out of the community garden but none have been given to this school although most of the Catholics have been working there.\"\n\nI should appreciate receiving your comments on the above statement.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. R. S. Davis,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAttention Mr. R.A. Hoey\n\nMay I call your attention to the case of the Big River R.C. Day School. Although it was opened last January, the teacher has neither desk nor chair; there are no brooms, dust pans, wastepaper baskets; neither is the quantity of school books and writing pads large enough. Moreover the Department only supplied 17 desks and there are at the present time 24 pupils.\n\nThe suggestion is made that if the Department cannot supply desks immediately it direct the local Agent to transfer the surplus desks from the Anglican Day School to the Catholic Day School as there are only 8 pupils in the latter at the present time. We wouldn't want it done however if it is to cause any friction between the two groups.\n\nThe missionary in charge complains that his Indians have not been fairly treated by the Agent as far as help for his school garden is concerned. It appears that the Agent refused to break the land selected for the garden; neither would he supply wire for fencing it. Again the complaint is made that all these services were rendered to the Anglican school.\n\nThere are other minor complaints made against the Agent which I do not think it opportune to include in this letter. I know that you will want to investigate the case and if the statements made to me are true proper corrective measures will be immediately taken.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Fleming, M.P.,\nHumbolt, Sask.\n\nDear Mr. Fleming:\n\nI am home after a sick-call 25 miles away and passing at Shell-River at 8 o'clock in the morning I received your letter giving the Minister's answer. No doubt he finds an easy way out, but he does not tell the truth. After having been deceived many times by the Indian Agent we are no further ahead than when the school opened on January 15 last. The Minister states in his letter that \"at that time (he mentions the month of February) all the desks which the Indian Agent considered necessary were supplied\". Now please note that the children's desks were here at the end of November or at the beginning of December. When the Agent came to the Reserve for the opening of the Anglican School, he could notice that there were not enough desks for the children. That is why he asked the carpenter who built the school and who was building my house, to make a few. As the Agent asked him to do this work for nothing, that is to say without any remuneration whatever, the man refused to do so. He used the same method for the teacher's desk. In November he told me to go to the railway station to call for the teacher's desk which he had ordered. I made two 20-mile trips and there was no desk there. In January he asked the carpenter to make one; for nothing, of course. The man would not; so you see he was knowingly lying when he said he had ordered a desk.\n\nMoreover the school is not finished completely. The shelving is not yet in place and is still in the school basement. A cupboard has been started and not finished. What happened? you will ask. The Agent said he had no more money and would have liked the carpenter to work without remuneration, but he would not do so, you may imagine. The carpenter had to take the paper, paint, wood, etc. in order to receive full payment for the work he did. The Agent would not pay him although he was well satisfied with the work. Many people witnessed this mean scheme of the Agent.\n\nAnother question to which I would like to draw your attention is the garden. The teacher agreed to make a garden under the condition that he be supplied with seed, the\nground ploughed and a fence given him. The Agent absolutely refused to give him anything while at Sandy Lake he had the soil ploughed and he gave the seed. He also gave two rolls of barbed wire for a fence and $10 for the work. When he was through he asked: \"Is that enough?\" As you may see by this instance, there are two ways of treating people.\n\nThe Government allows 50 dollars for the children's noon lunch. In the past, the Anglican teacher would order whatever she needed and sent her bill to the Agent. Last year, he offered the teacher money. As the teacher did not know how to go about it he asked the Agent to buy whatever he needed. This year the Agent refused to give him the money and he wants to buy the food for the school here. Moreover we have 29 children registered and just now the daily attendance is 22-24. The Anglican school receives the same amount for about ten children who attend school there. A few days ago the Indians told me that there were seven pupils at the Anglican school. In June last, when the Inspector visited the school, there were four. It was the Inspector at Shell-Lake, Mr. Faris, who told the teacher so. As you can see there is something wrong and it is detrimental to us. Fifty dollars for 25 or 26 Catholic children and fifty dollars for seven to ten Anglican children. Nice way of dividing! Do you think that is just? ...\n\nLast Friday, October 18, the Agent was on the Reserve and met the teacher on his way. As the schoolmaster only asked him for essential things and that they be sent as soon as possible, the Agent answered back: \"You are lucky to have it opened\" -- speaking of the school. As you can plainly see there is lack of co-operation on his part.\n\nI have been here three years now. I have always tried to be kindly-disposed towards officials of the Indian Affairs Department and except in very few cases, I received very little deference. So in future I will change my attitude and I warn you that they will find me pretty hard. Since a short while I have found a way out and as soon as my mission trips are ended, I will make it a point to make the people learn by newspaper channels the wrongdoings of the Department of Indian Affairs officials on this Reserve. Be assured that I will not flatter them and those officials will\nbe ashamed for I have a voluminous file. That will be a good way of busying myself at a work that my superiors have asked me to do in Indian.\n\nI am enclosing the list of the articles which have been asked for three times since January 15, but in vain, to the Department of Indian Affairs. The Agent asked us to wait till the end of March and then until September. Nothing has reached us except a few books. The teacher was without books for three months. How can we be expected to work? I added to this list a water pump because the teacher is obliged to carry about ten pailfuls of water every morning from the lake. The Agent insists on manual training. As there are no tools, I thought it was better to mention this on the list.\n\nA few days ago I met Indian women who were going to the Pagan dance for the Dead, called waskasimowin, and they told me that the mocassins and other skin over-shoes would be ready in about two weeks. They asked me if you wanted buttons or zips put on these. Please let them know.\n\nThanking you, I am\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.) G.E. Paquette, O.M.I.\n\nP.S. I am giving you these details in order that you may be posted, for I expect the Agent will have a story all his own. The Anglican school received seven bags of potatoes from the Community Garden and the authorities refuse to give any to the Catholic school.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nConfidential.\n\nOttawa, 18th October, 1940.\n\nDear Dr. Fleming,\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, addressed to Mr. Crerar, in which you say Reverend Father Faquette of Shell River, Saskatchewan, feels that he has not been well treated by the department in connection with the furnishing of the school at that point.\n\nI might point out that this building was completed in February. At that time all the desks which the Indian Agent considered necessary were supplied. Within the past few days authority has been given to supply additional desks and the Agent has also been instructed to arrange for the purchase of the other articles mentioned in your letter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd) W.J.F.

It should be unnecessary for me to point out that unless prompt replies are forwarded to official communications Departmental business is greatly hampered.\n\nBefore you receive this letter you will have no doubt replied to official letter of October 18 but subsequent correspondence which has just reached us makes it necessary for me to request another reply at once to the following questions:\n\n1. It is reported that the shelving is not in place and is still in the school basement and that the building of a cupboard has been commenced but not finished. Please let me know at once the reason for this delay.\n\n2. It is reported that the teacher wished to cultivate a garden but that you refused to secure authority for any expenditure although it is reported that you approved an expenditure for the cultivation of a garden at another school in your Agency. There is no information on our file regarding this and you should report fully on this complaint.\n\n3. It is stated that the enrolment at the Big River R.C. School is 29 and that the enrolment at the C.E. School is less than half that number. In spite of this it has been brought to our attention that you have requested authority for the same expenditure at both\n\nMr. R.S. Davis,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\nschools for midday meal purposes. Please let me know the enrolment at the Big River R.C. School and at the Big River C.E. School on November 1, 1940. There is no record on our files of your having applied for any authority to purchase midday meal supplies for the current academic year and under these circumstances I presume that you consider it is unnecessary to do so.\n\n4. It is reported that a water pump is necessary, also manual training equipment. You should state definitely if these articles are necessary and, if so, give an estimate of their cost.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hosey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nNovember 15, 1940.\n\nDear Doctor Fleming:\n\nI wish to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of November 8 enclosing letter dated October 24 which you received from Rev.

The Indian Agent has been requested to supply this information at once and as soon as he replies the order will be placed.\n\nThe last report received from Inspector Ferris shows that there is an enrolment of 17 children at the Big River C.H.

At the same time a requisition was forwarded to the Purchasing Branch for a teacher's desk and chair and this was ordered on October 23.\n\nMr. Davis has not yet replied to official letter of October 18 but on receipt of Mr. Pratt's memorandum a telegram was sent directing him to reply immediately by air mail.\n\nAs you are aware the Big River R.C. School was completed and opened in the latter part of January, 1940. At that time less than 20 children attended and on the recommendation of the Agent 20 desks were ordered. It is quite possible that additional pupils are now attending this school and consequently new desks will be supplied as soon as Indian Agent Davis supplies the information requested in the third paragraph of our letter of October 18.\n\nThe Indian Agent has not yet applied for any allowance for midday meal purposes for the current academic year at either the Big River C.E. or the Big\nRiver R.C.

Fleming, Esq., M.D.,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Fleming,\n\nIn reply to the letter which you have received from the Department of Indian Affairs, I may say that we have the teacher's desk and the chair.\n\nAs to the children's desks, the teacher, to my personal knowledge, has filled out three times the forms which have been sent to him. I find it strange that the Department does not know anything about this.\n\nConcerning the report from inspector Ferris of Shell-Lake, who came here in June last, there were then 29 pupils who had registered (called in English \"Enrollment\") and there were 17 of them present on that day. On the 6th of November last, Inspector Ferris came around 11:00 o'clock, a few minutes before my leaving to teach catechism. 23 students out of 29 registered children were present in spite of a hopping enough children on the reserve. To convince you, I am sending you a copy of the school register for the months of January, June and November, 1940, and moreover, every morning I see to it that the children are in school although the Indian Act mentions that a \"truant\" officer be appointed to that effect. As you may see, Inspector Ferris or the members of the Indian Department have impudently lied, which happens too often, alas, and they believe that I will let this go without saying a word. I do not belong to that kind. I hope that you will send this information to the Indian Department to confound their lies.\n\nRegarding the other items, I know that the school teacher has received 2 brooms, one pail, 6 plates, 6 knives, 6 forks, 6 spoons and 6 cups, one tub and a mop. I do not know when the other articles will come.\n\nThe agent was here on Friday last. As I had been called to see a patient, he notified the school teacher to inform the carpenter to finish the cupboard and gutters. As you can see there is something wrong somewhere.\n\nIn thanking you very much, dear Mr. Fleming, for all you are doing for the Catholic Indians of Big River who attach great importance to what the Canadian Government does for them and assuring you again of the help of my prayers, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd) G.A. Paquette, O.M.I.\n\nP.S.\n\n(1) The Anglican School received from the \"Community Garden\" seven bags of potatoes from the Councillor of the reserve without the permission of the Indians. We have received nothing. Only, the farm instructor said: \"It is not fair\". I have heard nothing else since that time.\n\n(2) I am sending you a copy of the rations given on the reserve by the Department. I hold this information from the farm instructor, and Councillor Thomas Whitefish stated to me that the Indians are not receiving what the farm instructor told me they were getting. The \"relief\" gives four or five dollars per month to one man in addition to an order to the store for clothes in the fall while a family of two is getting a few dollars per month to live on.\n\nThank you.\n\nG.A.

Davis.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nDecember 23, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant in which you advise that before receipt of my letter of the 28th ultimo you had already supplied the midday meal supplies authorized in official letter of October 8.\n\nIn view of the fact that there is a much larger attendance at the Big River R.C. School than at the Big River C.H. School you may supply immediately another $20.00 worth of midday meal supplies for the Big River R.C. School.\n\nIn official letter of the 28th ultimo you were instructed to arrange for the immediate erection of the shelving and cupboard required at the Big River R.C. School. Information has just reached us to the effect that when you visited the Reserve you notified the school teacher to inform the carpenter about the work necessary. This procedure is not considered likely to be very satisfactory and if you have not already done so you should interview the carpenter at once and give him definite instructions regarding what should be done.\n\nPlease let me know when you have taken action in this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. R.S. Davis,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nDecember 30, 1940.\n\nDear Doctor Fleming:\n\nThe information contained in Reverend Father Paquette's letter of December 2 has been referred to the Departmental officials for immediate consideration.\n\nSince writing to you on November 15 the school desks have been shipped to the school. The Indian Agent is being again instructed to personally arrange for the shelving in the basement and the building of a cupboard.\n\nI am directing the Departmental officials to write to the Indian Agent with reference to Father Paquette's complaints in connection with the amount of relief that is being issued.\n\nThe correspondence which you forwarded to me is enclosed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.J.F. Pratt,\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nH.R. Fleming, Esq., M.D., M.P.,\nHumboldt, Sask.\n\nPP\nLeask, Sask.\nJan. 15th/40.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter 107-13-5 dated the 23rd ultimo, regarding Big River R.C. School.\n\nI have to advise that it has been difficult to contact a suitable carpenter to complete the shelving and cupboard; this was due to illness of a man within reasonable distance from this school; I have now made arrangement, and the work will be carried out at once.\n\nThe pump and piping authorized by your letter 107-13-5 dated Nov. 28th, was ordered on Dec. 30th, as soon as advice was received from the Teacher where this pump was to be placed,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nClerk in Charge.\nT.B.

Plourde, O.M.I., visited the Department yesterday and discussed with me your recent letter to him regarding the teacher's residence at the Big River R.C. Day School.\n\nOur records show that a combined school and teacher's residence was erected in 1939. It is possible that the living accommodation for the teacher is not very extensive but it should be suitable for an unmarried teacher. It has not been the practice of the Department to erect a teacher's residence separate from the school. Due to present conditions our appropriation has been greatly reduced and I regret that I cannot hold out any hope of enlarging the teacher's quarters at the Big River R.C. School at the present time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRt. Rev. R.

It is impossible for us to keep track of expenditures at the various schools if the correspondence and accounts in connection with them are not forwarded separately.\n\nYou should, therefore, forward separate vouchers for the midday meal supplies purchased for each of the schools shown on voucher 610.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Prince.\nClerk in Charge.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nFebruary 16th, 1941.\n\nH.R. Fleming, Esq., M.D.,\nHumbolt, Sask.\n\nDear Mr. Fleming,\n\nA few days ago I saw the old Half-breed who made the deer skin clothes. She told me that if they do not fit they ought to be returned to her. So, if you would send them back to me I shall bring them to her on my next trip to that mission.\n\nBesides, I asked her to make for me a pair of gloves with beads which I intend giving you. This is a way to thank you for what you have done for my Indians and for what you will do again.\n\nOn his last visit here Mgr. Duprat, Bishop of Prince Albert, has not found adequate the room for the schoolmaster here. He made complaints to that effect to the Department and the answer of Mr. Phelan is enclosed.\n\nHere are some of the observations made in Mr. Phelan's letter. \"It is possible that the living accommodation for the teacher is not very extensive, but it should be suitable for an unmarried teacher\". Here are the facts: The room is 10 ft. by 12 ft. It has a wardrobe 3 feet deep on the full length of the room. There is also a stair 3\u00bd ft. wide which takes some space. As you may see a room 7 ft wide by 10 ft. long is not really an adequate room where the schoolmaster should betake himself. Moreover, the height is 6\u00bd or 7 ft. How do you expect such a room to be hygienic. The rooms of the Prince Albert prison are better than that of the schoolmaster, and add to that defective ventilation. You know also that most of the Indian children are suffering from tuberculosis and venereal diseases. All day long the schoolmaster has to breathe in a bad atmosphere and he is still obliged at night to breathe the same bad air. Finally, he has to use the same table as the children because of the exiguity of the place. It is really dangerous for the teacher to catch venereal diseases. As you may see it is far from being \"suitable for an unmarried teacher\". I know that it is not pleasant for the schoolmaster to have such a room and not a residence as it is stated by Mr. Phelan.\n\n\"It has not been the practice of the Department to erect a teacher's residence separate from the school\". I do not ask for a residence separate from the school, but what is convenient for a civilized man. Several rooms could have been easily built in the upper part of the school. It has simply been refused.\nThe Indian Agent told me himself that the room was not large enough to lodge the schoolmaster and he has encouraged me to ask for a teacher's residence. Mr. Phelan states that it is not the practice to build a house separate from the school. How is it that at Leask, on the Mistawasis reserve, the Department has built a residence for the Anglican schoolmaster and another one for the Presbyterian teacher at Sandy Lake; the Anglican schoolmistress has her own house built by the Department at Sturgeon Lake; the Anglican teacher has also his own residence at Montreal Lake; the same thing exists at Chitek (?) These are reserves that I visit nearly four or five times per year. As you can see, he has boldly lied, if the word can be used among polite people. It is the matter of Catholics asking for something which is turned down, while all kind of help is given to the Anglican Church. We have an average of 20 to 24 students attending the school every day, while the other Anglican school has from 6 to 7 only. The schoolmistress has a nice residence and our teacher here has nothing, absolutely nothing. As you can see that is not fair.\n\n\"Due to present conditions\" from Mr. Phelan, you know as much as I do, times are hard, I know it, but the government grants some money for roads, etc. It seems to me that the Department could do something for our school here.\n\nI am writing you this letter at the request of the diocese Bishop who insisted that I ask you to take this matter up with the Minister. I already saw Mr. Omer Demers at Debbien about one or two weeks ago. He told me that he was to write you. As I was called to attend sick people on several occasions, it was impossible for me to send you a few words in that connection. I comply today with Mgr. Duprat's wishes and I hope that Providence will help you obtain from the Department what others could not get.\n\nI thank you very much and be assured of the help of my prayers.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.) G.E. Paquette, O.M.I.\nShell River Post Office, Saskatchewan.\n\nP.S.\nCould you tell me the size of gloves for your two sons? Perhaps I could have some made for them by the Indians here. Some owe me money. It is the only means to recover it.\n\nI am enclosing Mgr. Duprat's letter. I have kept a copy because before long, if I am authorized to do so by the Bishop, I will write in the newspapers!! I will soon discuss this matter with him. I thank you. Sgd.

J. F. Pratt,\nPrivate Secretary.\nMarch 7, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Dr. H. R. Fleming, M.P., Humboldt, Sask., with which he has sent forward a communication received by him from the Reverend G. E. Paquette, O.M.I., Shell River, Sask. In this letter Father Paquette deals at length with conditions at the Big River R.C. Indian Day School.\n\nIn his discussion of the teacher's quarters at the Big River R. C. School, Father Paquette states:\n\n\"The room is 10 ft. by 12 ft; it has a wardrobe 3 ft. deep on the full length of the room; there is also a stair 3\u00bd ft. wide, which takes some space. As you may see, a room 7 ft. wide by 10 ft. long is not really an adequate room where a school master should betake himself. Moreover, the height is 6\u00bd or 7 ft. How do you expect such a room to be hygienic? The rooms of the Prince Albert Prison are better than those provided for the school master - and add to that defective ventilation. You know also that most of the Indian children are suffering from tuberculosis and venereal disease. All day long the school master has to breathe in the bad atmosphere and is still obliged at night to breathe the same bad air\".\n\nYou are probably aware that the Indian Day Schools on the Big River Reserve were constructed under the direct supervision of Indian Agent Davis, and it should -\n\nM. Christianson, Esq.,\nGeneral Superintendent\nof Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Building,\nCor. Scarth & Victoria Sts.,\nRegina, Sask.\nshould perhaps be stated that at Montreal Lake, where the teacher's residence was detached from the classroom, conditions appear to be no more satisfactory than they are at Big River. The teacher at Montreal Lake complains bitterly against the distance of the school from his residence. It would appear to be somewhat difficult to satisfy Indian day school teachers in northern Saskatchewan.\n\nIn view of the fact that Dr. Fleming's letter has been sent to this Branch from the office of the Minister, we feel that the Minister will desire a full and complete report on the Indian day schools at Big River. We have been wondering, therefore, if it would be possible for you to make an inspection of these schools at the time of your visit to northern Saskatchewan and about the same time that you inspect conditions at the Montreal Lake School.\n\nIn acknowledging Dr. Fleming's letter, we intimated to him that an inspection of the Big River School would be undertaken by you at the earliest convenient date and that your report on the condition of the school, with any recommendations you might care to make, with respect to alterations to the teacher's quarters, would reach the Department in due course.\n\nYours truly,\n\nFor Secretary.\nOttawa, March 7, 1941.\n\nDear Doctor Fleming:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of February 26 and also copy of a communication received by you from the Reverend G.

(RG 10, Volume 6297, file 629-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to refer you to your letter No. 107-13-5 of March 7th in connection with a letter that you wrote to me regarding the Big River R.C. Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply, I visited both the above mentioned Roman Catholic School and the Church of England Indian Day School on the Big River Reserve. In the third paragraph of your letter you quote from a letter written by Father Paquette to Dr. H. P. Fleming, M.P., of Humboldt, Saskatchewan. This quotation is absolutely correct with the exception of the second line, where reference is made to a wardrobe 3 ft. deep and the full length of the room. Instead of being a wardrobe, this is a Winnipeg cot on which the teacher has to sleep.\n\nThe present incumbent is Mr. R.A. Bonneau. He lives about seven miles from the school and goes home Friday night, returning either Sunday night or Monday morning. He has fourteen children of his own, therefore we would have to have quite a large sized residence to take care of this family, which consists of himself, his wife, and the above mentioned fourteen children, who are all living at home. The oldest, I believe, is about 15. No racial suicide here.\n\nTurning back to the upstairs room of the school, I would refer you to your plans. This room is absolutely useless as a living quarter. You will see this by the size and what the Priest said about it not being a fit place to live on account of the ventilation, the fumes coming up into this small room from the room in which the children have been all day. I am quite sure that everybody will agree with me that this is not a fit room for anybody to sleep in because the stairway is open and allows all the impurities to rise from the room below to the upstairs. However, the present teacher would not move to the school anyway.........\nthe school anyway because it would be out of the question to build\na house for a man with that sized family. In any event the building\nof quarters for the teacher will have to be considered sooner or later.\n\nI note that you state that the school was constructed\nunder the direct supervision of Indian agent Davis, and to the best of\nmy knowledge Mr. Davis followed out the plans to the letter and from\nwhat I could see, good workmanship has been performed on both schools.\nHowever, I wish to point out another defect in this institution and\nthis is that in the Winter time the furnace smokes. The chimney is\nbuilt on the outside of the wall and I have always been told by builders\nthat this was a mistake in a cold climate as the heat from the inside\nand the cold from the outside meet in the chimney and form a vapour\nwhich turns into soot, and no doubt during the time when there is no\nfire on and the brick chimney is exposed to the weather, a frost forms\non the inside of the chimney during the night and when the fire is put\non the heat naturally thaws out the frost and this is the cause of the\nvapour. However, I would suggest that you check this over with\nMr. Dudley, the Architect. You will realize that up around where this\nschool is located, there is nothing but lakes north of it and I am\nsure it become pretty cold in the Winter time. However, instead of\ntearing down the chimney and building it inside, which would cost a\ngreat deal, I would ask you to see Mr. Dudley and ask him if the chimney\ncould be raised up 4 ft. and one of those hoods that change with the\nwind put on it, if this would improve the situation any. As far as I\ncan remember the chimney does not come up as high as the top of the\nroof of the school. This may be something to do with the smoking and\nwe thought that by raising it about 4 ft. and providing a hood for it\nas described, it might help, but I am not an expert on this and am\njust giving my opinion. There is eaves troughing on the school and the\ndrain pipe from the eaves troughing which runs along the side of the\nbuilding carries all the rain and melting snow down along the basement\nwall. I noticed when I was in the basement that the walls on that\nside were damp and unless steps are taken to take care of this water\nthe foundation will be ruined. Mr. Davis offered to look after\nthis if he were authorized as all that is necessary is to make a trench\nand put a pipe in there and connect a down pipe with the sewer pipe.\nThis will run the water away from the building and as the soil is sandy\nit will not be an expensive job by any means, and Indians can be hired\nto do the work. I wish to point out in conclusion, that this is important\nbecause there are considerable rain falls in that part of the country.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6297, file 629-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, July 22, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of a report from Mr. Christianson regarding his recent inspection of the Big River R.C. Indian Day School.\n\nWhile no funds were specifically provided in the current year's appropriation for the erection of new buildings at any Indian day school in Canada, at the same time it is desired to make the teacher at this school as comfortable as possible. Please review the matter again and let me know the approximate cost of material and labour of erecting a lean-to, which would provide suitable sleeping quarters for the teacher. We will endeavour to find funds for the purpose from a small unallotted amount which we have available.\n\nIn the case of this school also, the chimney should be extended 2 ft. higher than the highest point on the roof. You may arrange to have this work done immediately.\n\nMr. Christianson also refers to the fact that the walls of the basement are damp. You may arrange for a trench with pipe to connect with a down pipe with the sewer pipe.

(RG 10, Volume 6297, file 629-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of a copy of Departmental letter No. 107-13-5 of July 22nd, addressed to Mr. Davis in connection with the accommodation for the teacher at the Roman Catholic Indian Day School on the Big River Reserve, and I note it is suggested that a lean-to be built on the school for this purpose.\n\nIn this regard I personally believe that it would be a mistake to have this done. The present teacher sleeps part of the time in the residence of the Priest, which is nearby, and while a lean-to would probably suffice for him, he is liable to resign at any time as he has a farm and no doubt when he becomes established there he will give up his position as teacher. I believe if the Church were advised that a suitable residence for a teacher will be built as soon as the War is over, this would satisfy them.\n\nI have written to Mr. Davis and asked him to hold the matter up for the present as I am finishing up my inspection of the Carlton Agency probably within the next three weeks.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nHumboldt, Sask.,\nJuly 23, 1941.\n\nW.J.F. Pratt, Esq.,\nPriv.

I wonder if you will fulfill his request and bring it to the attention of the Minister and see what they can do about it.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nsgd) H.R. Fleming\n\nH.R. Fleming,\nM.P. for Humboldt.\n\nHRP/16H\nEnc.\nDear Sir,\n\nMr. Christianson was here yesterday to visit the Day School. This is what he said in the presence of the Indian Agent, with regard to the complaints that I had made last winter.\n\nIn the first place with reference to the Teacher's room, \"He cannot live here\" and as to the chimney that does not function well, he added, \"This chimney must be moved inside as in this country it is too cold to build a chimney outside\".\n\nAs you may conclude for yourself, the Secretary for the Minister, who no doubt received his information from the Indian Agent, is really in error when he wrote in his letter, that you were good enough to forward me, \"It is a matter of regret to learn that in the opinion of Father Paquette the living quarters provided for the teacher appears to be somewhat limited and unsatisfactory from the standpoint of health and sanitation\". I can add that no member of the Indian Department would have lived in a similar pigeon hole from the 8th of January 1940 until this date. This means that a school teacher has lived in an unsanitary room and from that point of view his health has suffered.\n\nIn addition to this, Mr. Christianson added that during the war it would be difficult to obtain something from the Department. The Agent informed me that on the 16th of May last not something would be done. I hope that through your influence that you would be able to obtain something for the teacher in order that he will have sanitary and proper apartments.\n\nAs to the report regarding the Indian Day School and Residential School there are some remarks which I feel I should make. I quite admit that the total amount allowed by the Government to the Catholics is larger than the amount allowed to the other denominations here. That is quite clear, when you know that there are 1155 Catholic boys attending Industrial schools where they are clothed, nourished and looked after, and I might add that there is not sufficient money allowed for that number of children and on the other hand, the other denominations have only 495. There is no comparison to be made. If the Minister wishes to make comparison he should begin by comparing things on a similar basis. When I refer to Day Schools I am not referring to Industrial Schools or Residential Schools. Let him compare the Day Schools under the direction of Catholics and those under the direction of the Anglicans and I will be in accord with him but not otherwise. From what I have seen at the Leask Agency I realized with my own eyes that there is much more consideration given to the Anglicans than to the Catholics. I hope that I will not be asked to furnish figures but if they wish so, I will be ready to undertake this work.\n\nIn addition to this the Minister wrote to you, \"It is very regrettable to learn that Father Paquette has convinced himself that the Schools operated under the auspices of the Anglican church in Saskatchewan appear to receive greater consideration than the schools operated under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church\". Possibly the Minister himself could inform me of the meeting of the Agents and the Farm Instructors at South Battleford 3 years ago, presided by the then Inspector, Mr. Robertson of Regina, where the question of Industrial Schools was discussed. Why was general sentiment against Industrial Schools?\n\nNo doubt.\nNo doubt the schools of other denominations were suffering financially, whereas those under the Catholic Supervision were prosperous. Where did these ideas come from? I may be mistaken but there are indications that I am not mistaken. Why was Canon Paul at this meeting? Why was he invited if he were not considered? Why did he speak at this meeting? The Minister might wish to reply to me, on this point, but so far as I am concerned I have no answer other than the following: \"The Reverend Paul was well considered by the Officers of the Indian Department and that consideration seems to be quite evident in other spheres.\n\nWhy did not the Agent at Leask proceed to the election of the Counsellor on the Reserve on the 15th day of May last without following the provisions of the Indian Act? This meeting was called without proper notice and 10 of the Indians were absent. The Catholic Indian was seeking election was himself absent and the Agent proceeded, with the election because he wanted a certain one elected and that one was an Anglican. I am not opposed to the Candidate thus elected and accepted by the Indian Department, and that this particular Indian has always given me consideration but the election is illegal. An Indian and an Anglican protested at the time and said, \"It is not fair you choose a time that so and so is away to make this election. I know that if he were here he would get all the votes.\" On two occasions the Agent refused to proceed with the election as he knew that this man would get in. In view of these facts it is difficult for me to remove from my mind the words in the Minister's letter, in view of the fact which I have set out, \"to remove from Father Paquette's mind any mistaken impression he may be entertaining.\"\n\nAll I ask you is to give to the Catholic Order what they deserve, in which case I will be satisfied and I will not lose any time to vindicate certain matters to which the Catholics have a right on this Reserve.\"\n\nThe Catholic Indians, according to the report of the Minister, is four day schools, attended by 86 pupils. Here we have 24 pupils, on the school register, and we have an average of 18.5 for attendance. The Department cannot complain, the attendance is good. No child of Metis, White or Indian from the other Reserves come to this School. On the other hand in the Anglican school they have six or seven children only as I am informed by the Farm Instructor. In addition to this, there are two or three Indian Children that do not belong to that Reserve and in addition to this, there are some children three or four years old, attending school in spite of the fact that Indian schools restricted them to six or seven years of age.\n\nI wish to thank you for all you have done for me, I know that I have given you a lot of work and inconvenience.\n\n\"G.E. PAQUETTE\"\n\nP.S.

On the other hand in the Anglican school they have six or seven children only, as I am informed by the farm instructor. In addition to this, there are two or three Indian children that do not belong to that reserve and in addition there are some children 3 or 4 years old attending school, in spite of the fact that Indian schools are restricted to children 6 or 7 years of age\".\n\nIn view of the fact that Father Paquette's statement is at variance with our records here, it would be appreciated if you could submit to the Department a report on the attendance at the Big River Anglican school and any comments you may care to offer on the age of the pupils enrolled at the end of the school year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Certain figures quoted by Father Paquette in his communication are wholly at variance with our records here. Father Paquette, in his reference to the Indian schools on the reserve, states:\n\n\"No child of Metis, White or Indian from the other reserves come to this school. On the other hand in the Anglican school they have six or seven children only, as I am informed by the farm instructor.

A proposal made by the Department at that time, that the living quarters of the teacher should be remodelled and somewhat enlarged, was not acceptable to Mr. Christianson, who took the position that a promise from the Department to build a distinct and separate cottage to serve as a teacher's residence, after the war, would be acceptable to the teacher and to the church authorities. It is our intention to communicate again with Mr. Christianson in respect to this matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW. J. F. Pratt,\nPrivate Secretary.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, July 31, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th instant, in which you express the opinion that it is inadvisable to erect a lean-to at the Big River R.

The suggestion in regard to the lean-to was made with a view to making the teacher as comfortable as possible for the coming winter.\n\nIn your letter you state as follows:\n\n\"I believe if the Church were advised that a suitable residence for the teacher will be built as soon as the war is over, this would satisfy them\".\n\nToday we have received another very strong letter from Father Paquette, demanding immediate action to improve conditions at the Big River R.

The Reverend Father Paquette was absent at the time of my visit therefore I was unable to see him. However, I visited the teacher, Mr. Bonneau. He lives about five or six miles from the school and adjacent to the Indian Reserve.\n\nUpon going into the matter of a lean-to for the school I found that this isn't practical. One side of the school is all windows and on the opposite side there are four windows in the basement above the ground. Therefore it is out of the question to build a lean-to here. I have made a sketch of a suitable building which would be about 16' x 20' with 9' studs placed on a surface cement foundation. There is no basement but provision is made in the centre of the building for a dug-out lined with lumber, for the purpose of keeping vegetables. I showed this sketch to the teacher and he advised me that this building would be entirely satisfactory to him. If in a few years we want additional room an \"L\" could be built on the present building and this would then provide an additional two rooms or more if required.\n\nI hope that the Branch have sufficient funds at their disposal to erect a building as per the attached sketch. If you have the Architect draw up a plan and send it to Agent Davis, he can have it built by the Indians.

Comme je n'\u00e9tais pas ici, il alla voir le ma\u00eetre d'\u00e9cole, Mr Bonneau, au sujet de la maison que le d\u00e9partement indien a l'intention de construire. Il fut d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de lui en b\u00e2tir un petit \"cottage\" de 16 pieds par 20 pieds. Ce sera sans doute suffisant pour le ma\u00eetre actuel, mais le jour qu'il quittera l'emploi de ma\u00eetre d'\u00e9cole, le sera-t-il pour son successeur. Mr Bonneau s'est permis de lui dire qu'il ne sera pas toujours ici, ce \u00e0 quoi Mr Christianson lui a r\u00e9pondu que si le cottage serait trop petit, le d\u00e9partement donnerait ce cottage aux Indiens et en construirait un autre. Je pr\u00e9vois que les m\u00eames difficult\u00e9s seront \u00e0 recommencer. Pourquoi pas b\u00e2tir quelques pieds plus grands et ce sera fini une fois pour tout.\n\nMaintenant le ministre dans sa lettre du 31 dernier affirme que \"certain figures quoted by Father Paquette in his communication are wholly at variance with our records\". Le ministre devrait bien distinguer entre \"enrolment\" et \"attendance at school\" dont je veux parler. S'il y a 21 qui sont inscrits comme allant \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole, je sais qu'il n'y a six ou sept qui fr\u00e9quentent l'\u00e9cole. J'esp\u00e8re qu'il me demandera d'autres explications.\n\nEn outre le ministre trouve que c'est difficile de se convaincre lui-m\u00eame \"that any good purpose can be served by entering into a lengthy discussion with Father Paquette in respect to the administration of the anglican and Roman Catholic indian day school on the Big River Reserve... C'est bien simple qu'on m'accorde \u00e0 ce que les catholiques ont droit et je leur laisserai la paix. Vous pouvez vous en rendre compte par les plaintes que je vous ai fait parvenir que mes plaintes \u00e9taient fond\u00e9es.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Cette d\u00e9marche du juge Beaudry n'a abouti \u00e0 rien. Ils savent qu'ils ont tort et veulent bl\u00e2mer pour r\u00e9viser.\n\nL'inspecteur de Regina a affirm\u00e9 au ministre d'\u00eatre, que \"j'avais fait activement \u0153uvre au sujet de la maison ou la chambre du ministre.\"\n\nBonjour et merci\n\nJ.E. Paquette\nShell River, P.O. Sam\nTRANSLATION:\n\nAugust 22, 1941.\n\nMr. H.R. Fleming, M.D.\nHumbolt, Sask.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Inspector from Regina, Mr. Christianson, was here the day before yesterday. As I was absent, he called on Mr. Bonneau, the teacher, to talk about the house that the Indians Affairs intends building. They decided to build a small cottage, 16 by 20 feet. It will be sufficient for the teacher they have now, but this one leaves, will it be large enough for the one who will take his place? Mr. Bonneau took the liberty of telling him that he would not remain there always, and Mr. Christianson, answered that if the cottage was then found to be too small, that the Department would give it to the Indians and build another one instead. I see that the same difficulties lie ahead of us for the future. Why not build on a larger scale and the work will be done once for all?\n\nNow the minister in his letter of the 31st of last month states that \"certain figures quoted by Father Paquette in his communication are wholly at variance with our records\". The minister should make the distinction between \"enrolment\" and \"attendance at school\", which I mentioned. If 21 pupils are entered as going to school, I am aware that only six or seven attend school. I hope that he will ask me more details.\n\nThe Minister thinks that it is hard to convince oneself \"that any good purpose can be served by entering into a lengthy discussion with Father Paquette in respect to the administration of the Anglican and Roman Catholic Indian day school on the Big River Reserve.\" That is a simple matter: Let them grant us what the Catholics are entitled to and I will\nleave them alone. You can see for yourself that the complaints I have made are well founded.\n\nI thank you very much and beg to remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Signed) G.G.Paquette, O.M.I.\n\nP.S. The Minister's answer was known long before your letter came, for the Indian Agent at Leash communicated it to Father Beaudry, who spoke about it to my superior, expecting that I would let the matter drop and that I would not write any more against the Leash Agent. Father Beaudry's steps were of no avail. They know that they are in the wrong and they use indirect means in order to succeed. The Regina Inspector has told the school teacher \"That I was right\" about the teacher's house or room. Good-bye and thank you.\n\nG.E.Paquette,O.M.I.\n\nShell River P.O., Sask.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nIndian Affairs may retain this translation.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 15, 1941.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nThe living quarters for the teacher at the Big River R.C.

Phelan,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\n165 Sparks Street,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI am today in receipt of a letter from the Reverend Mother St. Victor, Prud'homme, Sask. You will remember you phoned me about this, and I was not sure of the information, so I got in touch with the Sisters by air mail, and that told me that this was the Big River Reserve, and that Father Paquette was the priest.\n\nI think they are very fortunate in being able to get the Sisters to go up there and teach at the Reserve, and the Department of Indian Affairs should make it as comfortable as possible for them. Their wants will not be very much, but they should have their house properly furnished, and have good sleeping accommodation. It may take $200 or $300, but that is not very much when you consider the wonderful work they will do, and the service they will render at that point.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDr. H.R.

Detailed information should be given regarding the latter, as it may be necessary to place the order through our Purchasing Branch, if the total cost exceeds $50.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

Indian Day School,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nI regret the delay in replying to Mr. Pratt's memorandum of June 12, with which he enclosed a letter received from Dr. H. R. Fleming, M.P. This delay was due to the fact that Dr. Fleming had stated \"Whitefish Reserve School\", whereas it turned out upon investigation that he meant the Big River R.C. School.\n\nWe have funds provided in the current year's appropriation for furnishings at Indian schools throughout the country, and I am writing to the Indian Agent to ascertain the minimum quantity that can be supplied at the Big River School.\n\nAs requested, I attach a draft reply for Dr. Fleming.\n\nEncl.\n\nDirector.\nLeask, Sask.\nJuly 7th/42.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter 107-13-5 dated the 3rd, instant regarding Big River School R.C.

C. School on the Big River Reserve. The Government, in my experience, is seldom, if ever, criticized for the expenditure of money. The criticism was directed against us for what was alleged to be discrimination on your part, not for furnishing the teacher's residence at the Big River R. C. School, but for your refusal from time to time to purchase furniture for teachers' residences operated by other churches. It was alleged also that in the employment of men certain favours were shown. However, the critic promised to submit the whole matter to the Director in writing, and I do not know that any good purpose can be served by an interchange of correspondence on the subject at this time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Two Sisters stay with me and help in the arduous task of civilizing the little Indians.\n\nWhen the Indian Agent, Mr. Davis came to see us last fall, he found that our residence was too small for three persons. Mr. Prince came later on and passed the same remark. Both said they would apply to you for having an addition built and make our house more hygienic.\nDear Sir, I come to beg the same favour of you. Our little house is well built, well furnished, for which we are very grateful, but it is really too small and our health will suffer from it.\n\nTherefore, we'll be very thankful if you are kind enough to see that an addition be built to our residence as soon as possible.\n\nThanking you in anticipation,\n\nI remain, Dear Sir,\n\nYours very gratefully and respectfully,\n\nSister Cecilia of Jesus.\nOttawa, April 1, 1943.\n\nReverend and dear Mother:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, enclosing a communication from the teacher of the Big River R.C.

Besides, many materials are extremely difficult, if not impossible, to secure. However, we are writing the Indian Agent about the matter and it will receive further consideration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend Mother St. Victor,\nProvincial,\nThe Convent,\nPrud'homme, Sask.\nOttawa, April 1, 1943.\n\nMr. T.

S.\n\nTHE SECRETARY,\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH,\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES,\nOTTAWA,\n\nCanada\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of Apr. 19th, I enclose herein the measurements of the teacherage and the number of the rooms in it.\n\nThere are three rooms: a living-room, a bedroom, and a kitchen.\n\nThe inside dimensions of the rooms are:\n- The living-room: 37' x 12';\n- The bedroom: 18' x 9';\n- The kitchen: 9' x 9'; there are a little entrance and a small pantry in that part of the building measuring 10' x 4'.\n\nThe outside measurements of the building are the following:\n- The main part of the house measures 21' 8\" x 15\";\n- The kitchen: 16' x 10' 3\".\n\nI would like an addition of at least the same size as the main part of the house, that is 21' 8\" x 15\"; also of possible a cellar with a furnace and a back door in the kitchen.\n\nThanking you, dear Sir, for the interest you take in our school, I remain\n\nYours gratefully,\n\nMother St. Victor.\nLeask, Sask.,\nJune 4, 1943.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nIn reply to your letter of April 1st, file 107-13-5, regarding the construction of an addition to Big River R.C. School teacherage,\n\nI am enclosing herewith a letter from Reverend Mother St. Victor giving the dimensions of the teacherage.\n\nThis residence is really too small to accommodate the three Sisters at present in occupancy. There is no rear entrance, no outside porch for wood, etc., and no privacy for the occupants between living room and kitchen.\n\nDo you not think that a wing the same size as the twin rooms on the left side looking at enclosed maps would be suitable.\n\nThe Indians who constructed this teacherage are still available, and there is no doubt of their willingness to undertake this work if given a chance.\n\nI would recommend that if the Department decide to build an addition that a hot air heating system be installed, a rear door, good size outside porch and good cellar.\n\nT.B. Prince,\nClerk in Charge.\nOttawa,\nJune 10, 1943.\n\nMr. T.B. Prince, In Charge Indian Agency, Leask, Sask.\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, with reference to an addition to the Big River R.C. teachers' residence. Very careful consideration has been given to your request, but, as no funds were provided in the current year's appropriation for this work, I regret that it will not be possible to authorize an addition. No doubt the Sisters are doing very good work at Big River, but for reasons that will readily suggest themselves to you it is not possible for the Department to consider erecting additions to buildings for the duration of the war.\n\nR.A.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA\u2014\n\nI wish to inform you that I visited the Roman Catholic Day School at Big River and the day I was there there were 23 children in the classroom. As you know, there are three Sisters in attendance there and I believe they are doing splendid work because I noticed quite a change to what it was before they took over.\n\nThese Sisters brought to my attention that they had no place to keep food because they have no refrigerator or anything of that type and of course they have no ice. What they wanted was to have a little porch built on the outside with a few shelves in it so that they could keep their perishable food supplies on this porch.\n\nAs there was an opportunity of getting Adam Ahenskew, who built this in the first place, in about a week's time I told the Agent to go ahead with it. I cannot give you the cost but I do not think the work and labour would amount to over $60.00 or somewhere in that neighborhood. I instructed the Agent to voucher for the material and labour on two separate vouchers. If, however, you think otherwise if you will let me know by return mail this can be cancelled but I hope it will be allowed because it is required.\n\nM.

S. Jones, Indian Agent, Leask, Saskatchewan,\n\nWith reference to requisition of April 24th, for supplies for the Big River R.C. Indian Day School, for the academic year 1944-45, the Department approves the purchase of the following articles:\n\n10 yds. Hand toweling,\n24 rolls Paper towels,\n2 towel racks,\n24 yds. dish toweling,\n4 Brooms,\n2 boxes Soap,\n6 tins Lye,\n12 Combs,\n3 Paint brushes,\n1 Kalsomine brush,\n1 gal. Green paint,\n1 gal.

Please let me know the cost of the water fountain and also advise if there is a sewing machine in the school at the present time.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nRegina, June 24th, 1944.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI wish to bring to your attention that while up at the Carlton Agency I was in the R.C. Day School on the Big River Reserve. The Sister Superior there informed me they were getting $70.00 a year for a mid-day meal but this was not sufficient for the number of children they have going to school and she requested that this be raised to $85.00 for the coming year.\n\nI would ask that the amount be raised to the latter figure as I think the Sister Superior was very reasonable in her request.\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, July 7, 1944.\n\nMr. M. Christianson, General Supt. of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Building, Regina, Sask.\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 24th ultimo, with reference to the amount allowed for the purchase of supplies for midday meal purposes at the Big River R.C. School.\n\nVery careful consideration has been given to your suggestion, but I regret that we cannot see our way clear to approve any increase. We are prepared to allow this school, for the academic year 1944-45, the same amount as last year, viz.: $70.00.\n\nI may add that this school will receive biscuits which are being manufactured from a very special recipe, prepared by the Acting Superintendent of Medical Services in conjunction with the officials of the Department of Agriculture and others. These biscuits are costing considerably more than we have been accustomed to paying, but we feel that their quality justifies us in making the increased expenditure. Before the biscuits are delivered, we expect to issue a circular letter to all schools receiving them, pointing out the necessity for distributing them as carefully as possible.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nLeask, Sask.,\nJuly 7th, 1944.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nIn reply to your letter #107-13-5 dated June 28th, 1944, I wish to advise the water fountain required would be five gallon size and would cost in the neighborhood of $9.70. However, I am very doubtful if one could be procured locally.\n\nRegarding a sewing machine, I would advise that at the present time there is not one at the school.\n\nE. S. Jones,\nIndian Agent.\n\nESJ.\nOttawa,\nJuly 17, 1944.\n\nMr. E.S. Jones, Indian Agent, Leask, Sask.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 7th instant, you may purchase a water fountain at a cost of approximately $10 for the Big River R.C. School. A sewing machine is being ordered.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Big River R.C.

Please let me know what repairs are required and the approximate cost of the material and labour.\n\nWe have been advised also that the amount allowed for midday meal supplies at this school was insufficient. In a letter written to Mr. Christianson on July 7, 1944, we authorized $70.00, and your voucher No. 645 of February 15, 1945, covered the expenditures incurred to that amount. It has been decided to allow an additional $15.00 for midday meal supplies for the balance of the current academic year. This will make a total of $85.00, which is the amount previously requested by the teacher.\n\nIt should be definitely understood by the Reverend Sisters and any other parties interested in this school that in allowing an amount of $85.00 for midday meal supplies for the current academic year the Department is making a special concession and that this amount is not to form a precedent for future years. As you know, we have supplied a considerable quantity of biscuits, and in view of the family allowances coming into effect this fall, we will have to review our whole policy regarding the serving of midday meals at Indian day schools.\n\nIt is not our intention to totally dispense with the serving of midday lunch, but, as stated above, we intend to review the whole matter in September.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**REQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES**\n\n*July 16th 1945*\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF\n\nCarlton Agency.\n\nVOTE 76 Allotment 10-691\n\nSHIP TO James Bryce, Acting Indian Agent,\n\nDebden, Sask.

Day School. This chimney smokes badly as there seems to be no draft in it. Some efforts have been made to correct the difficulty but I do not think it can be corrected without dismantling and rebuilding the chimney off the inside of the building.\n\nThe chimney is of single-ply brick and is built on the outside of the wall on the north end of the building. In cold weather, and particularly on days when there is a north wind the chimney remains so cold that it cannot possibly have a good draft. I did not measure its length but would estimate it to be about 30 ft. The smoke pipe passes from the furnace through the concrete wall of the basement into the chimney. At this point there is naturally a considerable chilling of the air before the smoke pipe enters the chimney at all.\n\nI have asked Mr. Bryce, Acting Indian Agent of the Carlton Agency, to submit a requisition through this office for the reconstruction of the chimney and I shall forward it with my recommendation as soon as it is received.\n\nJ.P.B.

Day School has requested a further $35.00 be authorized to purchase supplies for the noon lunches for the children attending the above school. Mother Superior's letter reads in part as follows:\n\n\"Unless you help us we will not be able to serve a real day lunch to the pupils very much longer.\"\n\nLast fall the sum of $65.00 was authorized for the purchase of supplies for the noon day lunches at this school.\n\nMr. Hancock, teacher of the Ahtahkakoops Day School Sandy Lake Reserve has requested an additional sum of $30.00 be authorized for the purpose of purchasing further supplies for noon day meals for the pupils attending his school.\n\nMy policy in connection with noon day meals since the start of Family Allowances has been to encourage the parents to contribute towards the supplies, such as to contribute meat when game is killed also garden produce.\n\nLast year garden crops were badly frozen on the above reserves. This winter, too, there has been a closed season on elk and moose. These facts together with the hard winter we have experienced makes the above requests seem justified.\n\nE. S. Jones,\nIndian Agent.\n\nESJ/ae\nOttawa, March 10th, 1947.\n\nMr. E.S. Jones, Indian Agent,\nLeask, Saskatchewan.\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of the 4th instant, it has been decided to allow an additional amount of $33.00 for the current academic year for supplies for mid-day meal purposes at the Big River R.C. School and an amount of $30.00 for additional supplies for the same purpose at the Ahtahkakoops Indian Day School. You should inform the teachers of both of these schools that this is a special grant that has been made owing to the information supplied in the last paragraph of your letter and is not to form a precedent for future years.\n\nThe Department agrees with the action that you have taken as outlined in the second last paragraph of your letter. It is our policy to continue in assisting in supplying funds for mid-day meal purposes but it is not our intention to increase the amount allowed in previous years. We feel that in view of the payment of family allowances it is reasonable to suppose that the children should be better fed and that the parents should be in a better position to give their children some food to take to school for their mid-day lunch.\n\nBernard F.

S. Jones, Esq., Indian Agent, LEASK, Saskatchewan.\n\nWith further reference to the matter of the floor in the basement of the R.C. Indian Day School at the Big River Reserve while visiting the St. Philip's Indian Residential School I find a kind of floor finish which I believe to be satisfactory to the Reverend Sister Superior at the Big River Indian Day School.\n\nThis material is called \"Flintmix\". It is mixed with coarse sand or fine gravel and laid on top of the concrete floor. It can be smoothed and levelled and has a soft feeling underfoot. It is being used on the floor of the boys' playroom at the St. Philip's School and seems to stand a lot of wear.\n\nI was warned by the Reverend Principal, Father Tetrault, that paint or any material which contains turpentine cannot be used on this floor as it seems to destroy its texture. He showed me some spots where they had attempted to use paint. I mention this because the Sister Superior will have to be advised that the floor will be practically black and will have to remain so. If she is not satisfied with this I do not know of any other type of floor finish to advise.\n\nIf the Reverend Sister Superior agrees to this type of floor finish you could get information as to the cost, etc. from Marshall Wells and submit a requisition through this office for the quantity required. In calculating the quantity Father Tetrault has used a thickness of from 2\" to 4\" in levelling off the floor and he says he thinks it should not be less than 2\" in order to take advantage of the feeling of softness underfoot.\n\nJ. P. B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nJPBO/ed\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nReference is made to letter 107-13-1 (WTI) of May 26th, 1947 Re: the Big River R.C. Day School.\n\nIn connection with the shortage of desks, these are already on hand in the Agency warehouse, awaiting dispatch to the school.\n\nRegarding the cement floor in the School basement; on the contrary, the floor in question is a good floor and is in good state of repair.\n\nThe Sister spends a certain portion of each school day in the basement preparing meals and for the past two years, Sister Superior has complained that the cement floor causes her feet to become tired and sore.\n\nFor some time I have been looking for a product to lay on the floor, last night the enclosed letter was received from Mr. Ostrander.\n\nThe Sister has been written in this regard.\n\nE.

Jones,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI thank you Mr. Jones, and I also thank sincerely Mr. Ostrander for the interest shown in the project of repairing the floor of our school basement. We appreciate much the trouble to undertake this rather difficult enterprise. But although we most desire to have this floor renewed, we do not wish it changed unless a sewer is placed.\n\nWe even ask more as it may be more convenient to go through it while work is going on than to look for it after it is completely done. This, we wish to have the water system (running water) installed if not at the teacherage, at least at the school.\n\nWe feel that once the new floor will be given it will be quite impossible to obtain either the sewer and the running water.\n\nBoth Mr. Ostrander and you, Mr. Jones, found these modern accommodations necessary, when you visited the school and discussed the problem together.\n\nWe do not wish to have the basement floor repaired just for a matter of appeasement but we believe these modern accommodations essential.\n\nWe are now at Prudhomme for our annual retreat and expect to be here until the end of the month.\n\nPlease accept our respect, we are yours very thankful.\n\nSister Superior and\nSister St. Victorien, teacher.\n\nIndian Day School R.C.,\nVictoire, Sask.\nLessk, Saskatchewan,\nJuly 7, 1947.\n\nMr. J.P.B.

The floor in question is a rough concrete floor and the Sisters were complaining to me that it was hard to keep clean and it made their feet tired and sore walking on it. I suggested the use of a preparation which has been used on a similar floor in the Boys' Playroom at St. Philip's Indian Residential School. The material in question is called \"Flintmix\".\n\nPlease advise me whether the Department consider complying with the request now made by the Sister Superior.\n\nJ.P.B.

I can not recommend this request be granted due to the fact that this school has not met with any more difficulties than other day schools throughout this Agency.

Indian Day School\n\nWe have now received Mr. Provincial Inspector Amundrud's report on the above school. In his general comment he states as follows:\n\n\"From money won as prizes for work exhibited at the Prince Albert fair last summer a full set of rhythm band instruments has been secured. I was rather impressed with the quality of performance with these instruments and also with the fact that every child took part. Considerable time is now being spent in learning Christmas songs also. This is commendable, although I did feel since the learning of English presents sufficient difficulty, that the learning of songs in Latin is unnecessarily burdensome.\n\nPupils in the higher grades read sufficiently well to understand and do problems from their texts. Reading in the primary grades tends to be word-saying, not too closely associated with the meaning since English is heard and spoken only within the classroom. If the obstacles are not too great, I would suggest that English rather than Cree be the language of the playground also.\n\nThe schoolhouse is as usual very clean and well kept.\n\nThe furnace smokes too readily and should be repaired.\n\nIn order to free the one cloakroom for its intended use I would suggest the building of storage cupboards across the back of the classroom.\"\nWould you please discuss with Sister Marie Ladislas the possibility of having the Indian children use English on the playgrounds rather than Cree. We realize only too well the difficulty involved in this but would appreciate a redoubling of her efforts to have English spoken. It is presumed that we will be hearing from you with regard to the furnace. Would it be possible to have a tender obtained for the installation of the storage cupboards required, or would you suggest the purchase of an unpainted cupboard from Eaton's or Simpson's?\n\nBernard F.

This\nwill receive my attention during the coming summer months.\n\nLanguage.\n\nA special effort will be made by the teacher to\nendeavour to have the children use English rather than Cree\non the School playground, however this will create quite a\nproblem for the teacher and it is a course that will require\nconstant supervision.\n\nN.J.

McLeod, regarding the Big River R.C. Indian Day School, I am enclosing herewith letter of Indian Superintendent McLeod, of the Duck Lake Agency, on the subject of increasing classroom accommodation for that school.\n\nI am inclined to agree with Mr. McLeod's attitude as shown in his letter, for the reason that although the one classroom in the R.C. day school is usually filled, the classroom in the Anglican Day School, on the same reserve, is not filled. Actually, what is happening is that a number of the Indians of that band who have formerly been considered Anglicans are gradually switching to the R.C. faith, and I am of the opinion that eventually the number of Anglicans on that reserve will be so few that the Anglican Church will decide to withdraw from the picture. In that case the building now used for the Anglican Church Day School will be available for the R.C. Day School.\n\nI do not think it advisable at this time to start a controversy between the two churches by adding a classroom to the R.C.

Indian Day School on the Big River\nIndian Reserve.\n\nThe situation on this particular Indian Reserve\ncalls for very careful consideration before making any\ndefinite commitments, as you are aware we now have two\nIndian Day Schools in operation on this particular Indian\nReserve, one run under the R.C. Mission and the other under\nthe Anglican Mission, both schools are located one and one\nhalf miles apart and the buildings are identical in size and\nstructure and immediately any additions or alterations are\nmade to one school then you may rest assured that the other\nmission will immediately demand that its buildings at the\nother setup receive the same treatment in regards to additions\netc and if this is not done then we will be accused as showing\nfavouritism and this can lead to a large amount of unnecessary\nwork and correspondence, while I quite agree that the classroom\noperated under the R.C. Mission is crowded and should be enlarged\nbut possibilities of the future would indicate that in say\nfive years, we would find that the Anglican mission will be\nclosed due to low membership amongst Big River Band, which\nwould then mean that we would be confronted with a vacant class\nroom.\n\nPersonally I would suggest that we leave matters as they\nare for the present and I believe that we will find that the\npresent classrooms on the Big River Indian Reserve are sufficient\nto accommodate all Indian pupils for many years to come without\ngoing to the expense of making any further additions to either\nday school at the present time. It is also quite possible that\nthe overcrowding at the R.C. School can be taken care of by sending\na few children into the Duck Lake School commencing with the\nSeptember 1949 term.\n\nOn my next visit to Big River Indian Reserve I will\ndiscuss this matter fully with the Missionary in charge\nwith a view towards arriving at a working solution to the\nproblem confronting our Branch at this particular Indian\nDay School. When a solution has been arrived at a full report\nwill be submitted.\n\nN. J. McLeod,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency.\nOttawa, April 11, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nBig River R.C.

I have arranged to have a duplicate copy of this letter sent to you and also an extra copy of Mr. Joseph's letter, so you will presumably wish to get in touch with Mr. McLeod concerning the complaints made against Mr. Atimoyoo.\n\nAs I dictated this letter, I received a long list of names from Father Picarde which totals 54 children who will be of school age next September and also 11 children whom Father Paquette claims to be attending school at the Anglican Day School. If Mr. McLeod wishes copies of these letters, I will be pleased to forward these to him. In Mr. McLeod's letter of March 16, he advised that he would be seeing Father Paquette in the near future concerning the request for additional classroom accommodation at the Big River R.C.

C. Indian Day School.\n\nEnclosed herewith please find the plan and lists of materials and labour as submitted to your office by the Teacher in charge as submitted by Bonneau & Tremblay, Contractors. In view of the low cost of this particular tender I recommend that approval be given to proceed with the work and expenditure as setout therein. We would not make any additional saving by proceeding along lines of calling for additional tenders and I believe were we to do so we would find that additional tenders would submit a larger amount. I have discussed this addition to the teachersage at Big River School with the Contractors mentioned and find that they are quite prepared to go ahead with the work at an early date. The addition is necessary to provide the Sisters in charge with suitable living quarters and in view of the isolated point at which the school in question is located we should do all in our power to provide the staff with suitable living accommodations.\n\nAdditions to the Class-room is also required, however I am not prepared to recommend this addition until the matter is given further consideration in connection with the views outlined in my letter dated March 16th, our file 396-II8.\n\nIn discussing this matter with the Missionary in charge, Rev Father Paquette, we have decided to go into the additions to the classroom fully with a view towards providing educational facilities for the Witchekan Lake Band in addition to the Big River R. C. children. When a final decision has been arrived at provisions will be made in our 1950-51 estimates for the required additional classroom facilities.\n\nI recommend that the tender of Bonneau & Tremblay enclosed herewith be accepted and authorization be given to proceed with the work at an early date.\n\nN. J. McLeod,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency.\n12th May, 1949.\n\nMr. N.J. McLeod,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nDuck Lake, Saskatchewan.\n\nWe have your letter of the 6th instant with reference to the addition to the teacher's residence at the Big River R.C. Indian Day School. We are submitting the tender of Bonneau & Tremblay to the Minister for his approval, and as soon as this has been obtained, you will be further advised.\n\nIt has been noted that you do not recommend any addition to the classroom at this school at the present time, but that you will make a final decision before preparing the 1950-51 estimates.\n\nBernard F.

Indian Day School on the Big River Indian Reserve.\n\nOn my recent visit to this particular day school I discussed with the missionary in charge a plan whereby additions could be made of a temporary nature that would accommodate the increased pupilage for a period of three or four years.\n\nWe decided that a suitable class room could be set up in the basement of the present building by eliminating the kitchen now installed therein. It is estimated that the costs in connection with converting the basement would amount to approximately $1000.00 covering costs of new desks, blackboards and either installing a wood floor over cement floor of basement or covering cement floor with linoleum. The additional class room will also entail salary of teacher. Living accommodations will be ample for an additional teacher immediately present additions to the teacher's residence is completed.\n\nShould your office consider this arrangement satisfactory I would recommend that authority be given to have the contractors Messrs. Bonneau and Tremblay who are now working on the addition to the teacher's residence, employed to make the necessary alterations in the basement of the school and when it has been decided upon as to the proper manner to prepare the basement floor materials could be secured from local approved source.\n\nRequisition for school supplies, desks, blackboards, etc will be forwarded immediately this proposal meets with your approval.\n\nPersonally I believe this proposal will take care of the anticipated increase in attendance at this particular day school for a few years at a minimum cost without causing any conflict or ill will arising between the Missionary services now on Big River Indian Reserve.\n\nN.J.

Indian Day School\n\nI have your letter dated July 19th with reference to the proposed additions to the classroom at the above named Indian Day School.\n\nEnclosed herewith please find form #37 listing thereon the required materials, furnishings for classroom and heating facilities that will be required.\n\n1. Materials required. - $67.25.\n   add for labour, - $80.00\n\n2. Classroom furniture - $445.25\n\n3. Furnace, coal & Wood burner - $350.00\n   add for labour installing, - $100.00\n\nTotal - $1,042.50\n\nLabour in the amount of $80.00 covers costs of altering partition in basement, laying floor over cement basement floor, installing chalkboard, patching holes in cement basement floor and any other labour in connection with installing the classroom. Quotation by Bonneau & Tremblay at $60.00 however I believe that their quotation, (attached) does not allow for installing chalkboard and setting up desks etc., therefore I have raised their figure in order to assure that sufficient finances would be available to cover extra work entailed.\n\nIn regards to furnace, the present furnace is in a poor state of repair and was checked over by a representative of the Moffatt Plumbing & Heating Company, Prince Albert, Saskatchewan in fall of 1948 and recommendations made that the furnace now in use be replaced by a new furnace as the costs of repairing the present furnace would amount to costs of a new furnace due to distance covered in removing and replacing a retired job. In view of the proposed installation of a classroom I strongly recommend that the furnace be replaced by a new furnace and I regret that I am unable to forward quotations other than that of M & K Company as the Moffat Plumbing Company has recently discontinued business due to the death of the senior member of that firm. I would therefore recommend that our Purchasing Agent place an order with the M & K Plumbing & Heating Company of Prince Albert who it would appear are the only firm who will go out into remote areas to do work on this kind.\n\nIn the event of the proposal receiving Department approval we do not require any advance to cover labour as all items can be vouchered in the usual manner.\n\nN.

The letter refers to the enlargement of a Catholic School at Big River Reserve. He states that he will have more than 50 students at the school and there is no room for them. He also states that sums were put aside in this year's budget for an annex to the school, and is wondering why this has not been done.\n\nYou might prepare a reply for the Secretary's signature, in the absence of the Minister, in French, to Mr. Bertrand. I have today acknowledged the letter.\n\nMr. Mackay:\nFor draft reply as requested.\n\nAugust 15 - 4:30\n\nOttawa, Ontario,\nAugust 15th, 1949.\n\nJ. B.

Q.\n\nDear Mr. Bertrand:\n\nFurther to my letter of August 15, with respect to the Big River Indian Day School, I am providing you with the information requested. Since Father Paquette's letter of June 11, we have carried out the following installations and repairs at this school:\n\n(a) authorized the purchase of the materials and labour required to convert the basement room into an extra classroom, as recommended,\n\n(b) purchased approximately $250.00 worth of paint for the painting of the exterior of this school,\n\n(c) ordered 17 pupils' desks, one teacher's desk and one teacher's chair, with an approximate value of $400.00, for this extra classroom,\n\n(d) requested the Departmental Purchasing Agent to secure tenders on the installation of a new coal and wood furnace with an approximate cost of $350.00,\n\n(e) authorized an expenditure of $201.00 for material and labour for the erection of a fence around this school.\n\nIn view of our action as indicated above, we feel that Father Paquette should have little complaint concerning\nthe efforts of the Department to increase the efficiency of the Big River R.C. Indian Day School. In fact, our Indian Superintendent at Desk Lake, Saskatchewan, reported that he had discussed the above changes with this Missionary early in July and we therefore presume that Father Faquette is now satisfied.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nJ.

I am today requesting our Assistant on the Big River Indian Reserve to check on the matter.\n\nIn connection with coal bins in the Teachers residence and day school. Contractors were authorized by myself to have this work completed and it is presumed that due to rush of seasonal work elsewhere the contractors have been unable to have the work completed to date. In fact the coal burning furnaces were only installed a few days ago and the contractors were requested to complete the bins immediately we were sure that coal burning furnaces would be installed.\n\nI believe that the teacher is becoming unduly alarmed that the work will not be completed and I feel confident that the contractors will not overlook this item.

This expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter, File No. dated.\n\nVoucher No. 1553\n\nDate October 24, 1949\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nReference is made to your letter dated October 27th your file 629-5 (El) commenting on the contents of a letter forwarded by Reverend Father Paquette, OMI, R.C. Missionary, Big River Indian Reserve from the wording of your letter I presume Father Paquette's letter reached your office through the usual channels.\n\nPlease refer to the contents of my letter addressed to Indian Affairs Branch and dated July 9th, 1949, our file 1024-15-118 (109) setting out therein the agreement reached with Rev. Father Paquette for additions to Big River R.C. Indian Day School Classroom, the contents of this particular letter explains exactly the working agreement in which Rev. Father Paquette concurred.\n\nThe writer submitted the proposal to your office for your authorization, your letter dated August 15th, file 629-5 (El) authorized an expenditure of $67.25 for materials and $60.00 for labour, which was expended and the work completed under supervision of Assistant, Indian Agency, Mr. H. A. Jove and Rev. Father Paquette. Messrs Bonneau and Tremblay were engaged to do the work in connection with alterations and repairs to the basement floor, install blackboards etc.\n\nYou will note by the contents of my letter dated July 9th that an agreement was reached whereby the Missionary (Rev. Father Paquette) agreed to the proposal of eliminating the kitchen in the basement and installing therein a class room.\nOn my next visit to Big River Indian Reserve following engagement of carpenters, I found that the work had been completed, however, under instructions of the Rev. Father Paquette, a complete change had been made from our original plan and instead of removing the kitchen as agreed upon previously the kitchen was retained and only a small portion of the basement set aside for a class room, space sufficient to accommodate 15 pupils, I questioned Rev. Father Paquette in regards to changes made under his authorization and was advised by the Rev. Father, that he had decided not to eliminate the kitchen and dining room, as he considered it would be necessary for the teachers to furnish the pupils with a full course hot dinner, in attendance at the R.C. School. On being questioned as to who would furnish supplies for a full course dinner, I was advised by the Mother Superior that this would be done from the source of vegetables they had produced in school gardens plus supplies from our Branch and further supplies from their own resources.\n\nTo my mind any complaint that the Rev. Father Paquette has now to make is the results of his own interference with our original plan for altering the basement of the Big River R.C. Day School and he was advised that the changes he had made without any authorization would never prove satisfactory.\n\nWe must however also bear in mind that alterations to the basement in question in an expenditure of only $127.50 could not be considered of a permanent nature and with all respects to the Missionary, Rev. Father Paquette, the installing of a class room in the basement of the day school in question was not made with any intentions of becoming a permanent set up, we merely endeavoured to eliminate over crowding in the R.C. Indian Day School Class room until such time as an addition to the main building could be placed in our estimates.\nYou will note that the amount of $5000.00 is shown in our 1950-51 estimates for erection of an addition to the R.C. Indian Day School, Big River Indian Reserve.\n\nMight I go so far as to state that the letter forwarded to your office was written by the Rev. Father Paquette to some of his friends with the view of impressing upon them the importance of having our estimates put through in order to have finances available for the addition to the Big River R.C. Indian Day School. I believe you will find this statement to be correct, as I cannot understand why the Rev. Father would or could try to place the blame for the class room being placed in the basement of this particular school, especially in view of the fact that it was placed therein at his own request and under his supervision.\n\nI might also mention that when the original plans were made for placing the class room where it is now located, the Sisters in charge of the school were absent and again may I presume that on their return pressure was brought to bear upon the Rev. Father by the teachers to retain the dining room facilities.\n\nPlease excuse the lengthy report, however, I feel all angles of the matter should receive careful explanation and consideration.\n\nN.J.

Indian Day School. Original on File 629-5.\n\n\"Sr. Dominique Marie teaches the Grade I class in an improvised classroom in the basement of the schoolhouse. This tiny classroom is poorly lighted, inadequately heated and unsafe in regard to fire. Whoever is responsible for the continued operation of this classroom must accept full blame in the case of injury or death to any of these children on account of the existing hazards. I am sure that the sisters in charge will do everything possible to guard against any unfortunate accident but their care may not be enough. Certainly a safer and more suitable classroom must be found.\"\n\nRec 1949\n\nIndian Affairs.

Day School on Onion Lake Reserve and found the teacher, Mr. Mullans, who had previously been the teacher at Ministikwan, doing an excellent job there. Due to the disastrous fire which occurred there some time ago it left this group of Indians without an adequate school. Mr. Mullans has taken one of the old granaries and through his ingenuity and improvisations he has made the building into a school that is meeting the requirements for the present. Some expenditures will have to be made on this book to make the building satisfactory. Too much praise cannot be given Mr. Mullans for the way in which he has made this old building workable.

Onion Lake Indian Day School: - I visited the C. of E. Day School on Onion Lake Reserve and found the teacher, Mr. Mullans, who had previously been the teacher at Ministikway, doing an excellent job there. Due to the disastrous fire which occurred there some time ago it left this group of Indians without any school. Mr. Mullans has taken one of the old graineries and through his ingenuity and improvisations he has made the building into a school that is meeting the requirements for the present. Some expenditures will have to be made on this school to make the building satisfactory. Too much praise cannot be given Mr. Mullans for the way in which he has made this old building workable. He seems to have the confidence of the Indians and the children he is teaching certainly they are responding to his leadership.\n\n(Sgd) J. A.

The Church authorities are not asking any rent for the use of the building but feel that the sum of $10.00 should be paid to cover the cost of fire insurance.\n\nReverend Father G. Laviolette, the Missionary, has secured the services of a suitable teacher, a single man who will board with Mr. J.R. Morrison, the Farming Instructor of that reserve, for the remainder of this term. As a married man and wife would be more suitable as a permanent appointment other arrangements might have to be made before the next term starts in September, 1946, and the erection of a small teacherage might be necessary. The present expenditures which I am recommending are in order to make temporary arrangements to open the school at the earliest possible date.\n\nA requisition for the school supplies is being forwarded by Mr. W.J.D. Kerley, Indian Agent, Crooked Lake Agency, direct to the Department at an early date.\n\nWhen the school is re-opened there are twenty-five pupils ready for immediate entrance and perhaps over thirty in the future.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, 15th November, 1945.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n414 Federal Building, Regina, Sask.\n\nI have your letter of the 8th ultimo with reference to the St. Francis R.C. Day School on the White Bear Reserve. P.C. 6828 dated November 6th has now been passed authorizing the establishment of the school and consequently we are now in a position to approve the following expenditures:\n\n(1) An amount of $98.60 for material and labour required for the erection of toilets.\n\n(2) An amount of $87.08 for storm windows and materials for cupboards.\n\n(3) $100 for fuel for the term, $5.00 per teaching month for janitor fees and $5.00 per teaching month for hauling water.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nRequisition for School Material\n\nDate Oct. 1st 1945\n\nFor White Bear (West) School Crooked Lake Agency\n\nNOTE:\nTo avoid delay, teachers should give full particulars regarding each article required.\n\nThe name, series, number of grade, and name of author and publisher of all books required should be given as fully as possible.\n\nWhen ordering kindergarten material, the catalogue number of some well known firm should be given for each article required.\n\nOnly one item should be specified on each line of this requisition and no entry should be made under heading \"Number Authorized\".\n\n| ARTICLES                        | NUMBER ON HAND | DATE OF LAST RECEIPT | NUMBER REQUIRED | NUMBER AUTHORIZED | REMARKS |\n|---------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------|\n| 8 gal. can for water            |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| Alarm Clock                     |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| Pyrene Fire Extinguisher        |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| Coat Hooks (Heavy)              |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| Weathering Strip                |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| Window Sash Springs             |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| Toothbrushes                    |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| Combs                           |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| Towels                          |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| Water Pails                     |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| Scrub Brushes                   |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| Mop                             |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| Stove Pipes 6\"                  |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| Elbows 6\"                       |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| White Chalk                     |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| Colored Chalk                   |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| Map of Canada                   |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| Map of World                    |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| Map of Saskatchewan             |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| Union Jacks                     |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| Desk Bell                       |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n\nN.B.\u2014Explicit information regarding address must be furnished.\n\nName Reddy Harris Little, O.C.W.\nSchool White Bear (West)\nPost Office (nearest) Carlyle, Sask.\nExpress Office (nearest) \" \"\nProvince Saskatchewan\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that I have examined this requisition, and that the articles asked for by the teacher are necessary and are such as are in use in the Provincial Schools.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Ostrander, Inspector of Indian Agencies, Regina, Sask.\n\nORIGINAL ON File: 108-8-1\n\nIn my letter of October 8th last on the subject I stated that the Church authorities are not asking any rent for the use of the building but felt that the sum of $10.00 should be paid to cover the cost of fire insurance. Reverend Father Laviolette has discussed the matter of the upkeep of the building such as painting and minor repairs from time to time, as well as the insurance for the building valued at $2,000.00, and furniture valued at $1,000.00 including the 30 desks supplied by the Department, with His Grace, the Archbishop of Regina.\n\nI am now in receipt of a communication from Reverend Father Laviolette asking that the Department pay a rental fee of say $20.00 a month during the school term and from this he would look after the upkeep of the building and pay the insurance on the building and furniture. I believe this is a good suggestion and I would recommend that it be given consideration by the Department.\nOttawa, 13th December, 1945.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIn view of the recommendation contained in the last two paragraphs of your letter of the 7th instant the Department will allow an amount of $20.00 a teaching month as rental for the St. Francis, R.C. Indian Day School in the Crooked Lake Agency. This payment will be effective December 1st, 1945.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nGentlemen,\n\nRe purchase order #7046\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 13th instant, please be advised that it will be in order to supply your #24 teacher's desk with top rail.\n\nWe note that this shipment for Carlyle, Sask., will be made before the middle of January 1946.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nVilas Furniture Company Ltd.,\nCowansville, P.Q.\nGentlemen,\n\nRe purchase order #7046\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 13th instant, please be advised that it will be in order to supply your #24 teacher's desk with top rail.\n\nWe note that this shipment for Carlyle, Sask., will be made before the middle of January 1946.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nVilas Furniture Company Ltd.,\nCowansville, P.Q.\nWhite Bear Reserve; Carlyle Sask.\n\nFreighting supplies; Edwin Longchild.\n\nDec 14/45 200 lbs fish 20\u00a2\nPotatoes 25\u00a2 Match 9\u00a2 Paper 13\u00a2\n\nTotal $8.00\n\nCertified correct\n\nJ.

While our 1947-48 Estimates provided a total of $135.00, owing to increased cost of food supplies I would recommend that this be increased to the following amounts:\n\nWhite Bear Day School $100.00\nSt. Francis Day School $80.00\n\nW.J.D. Kerley, Indian Agent.\nOttawa, December 10, 1947.\n\nMr. W.J.D. Kerley, Indian Agent,\nBroadview, Saskatchewan.\n\nWe have your letter of the 4th instant requesting us to increase the amounts allowed for mid day meals at the two schools in your Agency.\n\nThe Department has no funds available for increasing the amount and consequently we will only be able to allow for the current academic year the same amount as last year, namely $75. for the White Bear School and $80. at the St. Francis School.\n\nIn view of the payment of Family Allowances the Department feels that the Indians should be in a better position financially to provide additional food for their children and even give them some lunch to bring to school with them. We are not reducing any of the amounts we previously allowed for mid day meal purposes but it is not our intention to increase them.\n\nBernard F.

We presume there was an error in typing the amount for the St. Francis Day School as only $60.00 was granted last year.

I believe his name is Miller. The chief is a Natives - the Rattlesnake - who was also baptized. I understand he has been very attentive.\n\nThe reserve is not, I believe, in the best of circumstances. We have heard that the Indians are discontented, but we have had no opportunity to meet them.\n\nVery Poor Copy\nK Reed,\n\nMemo\n\nPlease see Minister's request. I will write when you give me the material.\n\nA Christie\n\n1-7-95\nOttawa IIth July 1895.\n\nIn reference to the request made by His Grace, the Archbishop of Rupert's Land for a teacher for the Valley River Reserve in the Birtle Agency, and the suggestion of His Grace that the lay-reader receive the appointment, the undersigned begs to state that there never has been a school established nor has been made for one on this Reserve. It might, however, be possible to make a saving elsewhere so as to contribute; say $200 towards a teacher's salary, were it considered advisable to open a school on this Reserve. Similar applications have been received from the Roman Catholic and not entertained for want of funds.\n\nEnquiries will, however, be made as to the number of children of school age on the Reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Supt:Genl:\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nHon: T. Mayne Daly,\nSuperintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nOTTAWA.\nteacher. In the schoolroom there are 6 poorly constructed desks, a boxstove, blackboard, a cupboard for school material and a bench or two. I made suggestions to the teacher and \"John Rattlesnake\" to improve the desks, and John promised to change the construction of the desks to the form suggested by me. There were six boys and six girls present, all were neatly dressed and particularly clean for Indian children, and I complimented them and their parents on this important point in language that the most foolish could understand.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised at the progress the pupils had made during the short time the school has been in operation.\n\nThe teacher has not a proper register and I will be glad if you will supply one for the use of this school, also a map of the Dominion, and if you will authorize me to send up ten boxes of biscuit, I will be glad, for issue to the pupils at mid-day, and I will try and get the teacher Mr Miller, to send me in regular returns.\n\nI am, etc.\n\nsgd J.A. Markle.\n\nI A.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to report that when at the Valley River Indian Reserve, No 624 I visited the school that has been in operation on that Reserve under the auspices of the Episcopalian Church, and wholly maintained by them for the past year off and on.\n\nI have already mailed to your address two writing books, and a half out of a third one for your to judge as to their advancement in writing.\n\nThe school building is of hewn logs with about twelve feet walls, and almost a flat pole and sod roof. There have been some heavy rains this season, and I noticed the roof was not water tight but the teacher informed me it was his intention to get it repaired. The building is about 16x20 feet, has a good door, floor, well lighted, but without any special means of ventilation, which was pointed out to the teacher.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner.\n\nRegina.\nDear Sir,\n\nI venture to call your attention to an important matter in connection with Indian work in the district of which I have charge. I refer to the Valley River Reservation, on which decide, as you may be aware about 87 Indians.\n\nThe great need\u2014 the large number of children\u2014the willingness, not to say anxiety, of these Indians to have their children educated appealed to us so strongly that without waiting to pass through the usual formalities, we placed a competent teacher among them about 18 months ago. To do so, it became necessary to erect suitable buildings, the expense of which including allowance for teacher for the 18 months above named amounts to the sum of $576.95.\n\nI need not remind you that we cannot afford to take this sum from funds so badly needed for sustaining the Gospel among the heathen, nor need I call your attention to the fact that the work done at the above school in the time specified has met with the approval and been carried out to the satisfaction of your...\nMr. Markele, who visited the school from time to time.\n\nWriting on behalf of the authorities of the church we would like you to take the necessary steps to have the above sum of $576.25 refunded us at an early date.\n\nThe Sup't of Indian Missions Archdeacon Phin has just returned from a visit to the mission and reports most favorably of the progress the children have made during the short time the school has been in operation.\n\nIt is felt however that the time has come when the financial responsibility of this school should rest with the Department.\n\nI would therefore ask you kindly make the necessary arrangements for taking over the school, appointing a teacher, furnishing the necessary school materials, biscuits etc., so that this very promising school may receive all the encouragement and help it deserves from the Dept. Perhaps I should inform you that the average attendance for the winter ending 30th Sept. was 11.5 and when it is kept in mind that the No. of children on the Reserve of school age is only 19, the above average is promising.\n\nI am very anxious this matter should have your earliest attention and\nI should be glad if you will communicate with Archdeacon Phelan at Winnipeg that he may recommend a competent and suitable man for this important work, and also that the teacher may reach his work at the Valley River before the winter sets in.\n\nMr. Marble will probably have informed the Dept. of the great want and pressing the supply of medicine has been to these isolated Indians, on whose behalf we beg to thank you most sincerely, and trust that a necessary supply for the present winter will be forthcoming in good time.\n\nRemain\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeorge Gill\nMEMORANDUM for the Deputy Minister:\n\nIn regard to the application made by the Rev. Mr Gill of Russell, Manitoba, for a grant of $516.95 to reimburse the Church for the outlay made in building a schoolhouse on the Valley River Reserve, and paying the salary of a teacher.\n\nThe undersigned begs to say that this application is similar to the one lately made by the Missionary at Eagle Lake, who was informed that the Department regretted that any expenditure had been incurred with the expectation of getting the Department to recoup the Society, without first making their wants known to the Department.\n\nNo provision is made in the Estimates for the establishment of these schools and no funds are available for paying anything for buildings or equipment. The policy of the Department as lately followed is in the direction of limiting the number of day schools when possible.\n\nThere are said to be 19 children of school age on the Reserve, while in his report for '95 the Agent gives the number as 10, and judging by the attendance at other schools in the Territories it is considered to be the largest possible average that could be obtained, which would give an average cost per pupil of about $55, after adding $100 to the usual salary for repairs, equipment, school material, fuel &c.\n\nThe undersigned considers that the money could be spent to better advantage in providing for more pupils at the existing boarding schools than in the establishment of day schools where the average attendance would always be small.\n\n19th November '96\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant applying for a grant of $500.95 to reimburse the Church for the outlay made in building a schoolhouse on the Valley River Reserve, and in providing the salary for a teacher; and in reply I beg to say that it is regretted that the Department is not first communicated with before any expense was incurred in connection with this school, as were it disposed to sanction the establishment of a school on the Reserve, provision would have to be made in the Estimates and the money voted by Parliament for the purpose, before any authority could be given. As it is the Department regrets that it has no funds available from which the grant asked for could be paid.\n\nI may add that the Department, owing to the extremely large and increasing outlay in connection with Industrial and Boarding schools throughout Manitoba and the Territories, is averse to increasing the number of day schools now in existence and instead of doing so, it contemplates closing some already in existence.\n\nThere are still vacancies at the Rupert's Band school, where children belonging to the Church of England could be sent.\n\nI may say that it is only under very exceptional circumstances\n\nRev. Geo. Gill,\nRussell,\nManitoba.\ncircumstances that the Department could consider an application for the establishment of a day school, as past experience has shown that the results obtained in many cases are far from satisfactory, and the efforts are now directed to fill up the existing vacancies at the Boarding and Industrial schools, where permanent results can be obtained.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Superintendent:\nof Indian Affairs:\nEXAMINED\nSCHOOL BRANCH.\n\nOTTAWA 24th November 1896\n\nTHE LETTER HAS BEEN SENT\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith for your information in regard to the matters referred to therein, a copy of a letter addressed to the Rev.

Your report should state the number of children of school age, the distance they reside from the school and any other information that will enable the Department intelligently consider the request of the Indians. The general habits and character of the parents should be dealt with and the probability there would be of their taking advantage of the school, should it be reopened. These Indians are not all of one religious belief and your report should give your views as to how the situation might best be met.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.G.

Sir,\n\nWe the Indians of Gally River Band in Council assembled, do hereby petition the Government to grant us an appropriation of funds to maintain, and erect a School House on this Reserve, as being now engaged in farming operations too much time consumed and too much expense incurred in taking and bringing the children to and from the Industrial School at Birtle, and on account of the number of small children on the Reserve who could attend a day school but not old enough to go to the Industrial School, and as services are being held on Sundays by the Methodist denomination, said School House could be used for Church or any other meeting purpose, and your Petitioners will ever pray,\n\nJohn Kettle Snake x\nHenry Kettle Snake x\nDoctor Mentuck x\nWilliam Marichees x\nJoe Marichees x\nJames Catahaw x\nJames Catahaw x\nTito Catahaw x\nJohn Son Eagle x\nJames Son Eagle x\nLegn x Leg x\nSimon Seminole x\nWillie Ka Raqqua x\n\none Boy\none 11 thru girls\ntwo girls\none girl\none Boy\none girl\ngirl and boy\none 75 y.\none Boy\nboy and girl\nboy and girl\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of Sept. 8th, 1909.\n\nNo. 145277/1.\n\nI beg to enclose petition for school which was attached to copy I filed instead of enclosed to you.\n\nThe children mentioned in the list would live from \u00bd to 2 miles from school if the school were built in a central location. There is at present no school building on the Reserve. These sixteen children are of school age and would be all who could possibly attend at present, of course there are always others growing up who would add to these. A large number of the Indians of this Band spend several months each year hunting and trapping and would be absent with their families from the Reserve but we hope, that as they increase their farming operations, the families at least will be home all the time even if the men go out on short hunts. The fact of the Indians being of two religious beliefs is the greater difficulty, as it would leave about half the number in each denomination, thus making too small a number of children to attend each school. Could not the Department build the school and make it non-denominational and thus allow all to attend the one school? Unless this can be done or the children of the religious belief in the minority allowed to attend the school of those in the majority, I would not deem it advisable to go the expense of\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nbuilding and equipping a school for 8 or 10 children, but would rather send them to one of the many boarding schools two of which are in this Agency, for a year or two at least until the parents settle down to work on their Reserve and keep their families home.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.G.

The Department furnished the building and pays the teacher's salary, and it would be willing to accord similar treatment to the Indians of the Valley River Reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. STEWART\nAsst. Secretary.\n\nWE G. BLEWETT, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRamsack, Sask.\nValley River Reserve, Nov. 8th/69.\n\nW. G. Blewett, Esq.,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reference to your letter of Oct. 26th re Day School for the Indians on this Reserve.\n\nI have had a meeting of Chief and headmen about the matter and they are perfectly willing to put up a building for a School house if the Department will furnish the School and pay the teacher, but they would prefer, that when they are putting up a School house, it would suit them better to put up a frame building that could be used as a church or meeting house as well and as I have been informed the Methodist Church people are likely to help them build, by granting them a sum of money from their Missionary Funds, and as they have also plenty of timber suitable for making limber on this Reserve there would be no trouble I think in their getting the material to build a frame building and at no extra expense to the Department.\n\nAs to a building for present use temporarily, Henry Rattlesnake has just finished improving his house by raising it three or four rounds higher, and making an upstairs in it, and putting on a shingled roof, and he has offered the use of his house for present use till they can build one for a School House. There are also two new houses just finished ready for use, and never been used yet, belonging to Wm. Ironstone and Jim Eagle, either of these can be secured temporarily for School purposes particularly if a small rent can be given in some way. These are both good houses with upstairs and shingled roofs and fair size.\n\nRe Denominations:\n\nI may add, that, as I organised the School District of Baycentre, at Lake Dauphin, built the School House, and was Secy-Treas. of the district for ten years, and also fought through the Separate School Campaign in the Liberal interests I can understand something of the Departments doubts on this point, so to prevent misunderstanding as much as possible among the Indians on this matter, I explained to them where any likely\nlikely trouble would arise and they all promised to send all their children to the one school no matter what denomination they might be.\n\nYours truly,\n(signed) J.G. Chard.\nOverseer.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of 19th Oct. 1909.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a copy of Mr. Chard's letter re this School.\n\nI also wish to state that when at Valley River last Saturday I arranged with Mr. Chard to get Wm. Ironstand's house (as it is new and most centrally located) and if Wm. Ironstand wanted to get paid for the temporary use of his house the Band would have to pay him by subscription among themselves. The Indians will have ample time and means of getting lumber sawn to erect a good school house and I believe will do so. I would strongly oppose any church of any one denomination paying for building it as it might lead to controversy afterwards. I think it would be better for the Indians to own the building and then let the clergy hold services in it if they were all agreed.\n\nThe building is ready as soon as the Department can send the equipment and teacher.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 2nd, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd ultimo in further reference to the opening of a school on the Valley River reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department would like to have an estimate of the cost of the necessary furnishings and also to know definitely the rent that William Ironstand would ask for the use of his house until such time as the Indians can provide the material to erect a new building. A definite arrangement must be made with him before any expenditure is incurred.\n\nThe Department would also like you to make inquiries with a view to securing the services of a qualified teacher to take charge of this school, and it will be prepared to pay a salary of $400.00 per annum. Any applications received by you should be submitted to the Department for its consideration before action is taken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nW. G. Blewett, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamsack, Sask.\nOttawa, December 2nd, 1909.\n\nEx'd\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department has under consideration the advisability of opening a school for the Indian children resident on the Valley River reserve. The Department is informed by Mr. Agent Blewett that a house belonging to an Indian can be obtained at a nominal rental until such time as the Indians are able to provide the necessary material for building a new school-house.\n\nThis will be an undenominational school, and the Department would like you to make inquiry with a view to securing the services of a Protestant teacher with the necessary qualifications. It will be prepared to pay a salary of $400.00 per annum to a suitable teacher. The Department would be glad if you would endeavor to obtain some applications for this position and submit them for consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nBalcarres, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI understand it is the intention of the Department to start a day school at Valley River. I would strongly advise the Department to defer this matter. A school started at Valley River at the present time would be a failure beyond doubt, and I am positive that no teacher would live in Chard's house for one month.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Signed) W. M. Graham\n\nInspr. of Indian Agencies\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of 2nd Dec. 1909\n\nNo. 145277-1\n\nI beg to say that I expect to visit Valley River shortly and will find the exact rent that Wm. Ironstand wants for his house. In the meantime, I will get an exact estimate of the cost of the necessary furnishings for the school which will be forwarded as soon as possible.\n\nWith reference to securing the services of a qualified teacher, I find that they will cost from $600.00 upwards. In my last letter I overlooked mentioning an important matter namely, a boarding place for the Teacher. There are only two places namely, the Section House and the Overseer's House where the teacher could board which are one mile and three miles respectively from the proposed temporary location of the school. At the first place, no teacher would board, as the section people are all Galician and the latter place would be very little more desirable. Personally I think it advisable to withhold the opening of a school until an official is placed in charge of that Reserve who will have some control over the Indians to ensure a regular attendance of the children. Moreover it is almost certain that no teacher can be found to go there before Spring.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 17th, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant in reference to the opening of a school on the Valley River reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department agrees with you that it would be well not to take any action in this matter at the present time; however, in the meantime it would be well for you to be on the watch with a view to securing the services of a teacher.\n\nWe have in Saskatchewan a number of excellent Indian day schools to which we have been paying particular attention for sometime past. The Department recognizes the difficulty in securing people to take charge of these schools. Many qualities are necessary to make a successful teacher and experience has shown that the holding of high certificates is not the chief essential, but rather an interest in Indian work. It may be that you will come in contact with someone who would like to take up this work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nW. G. Blewett, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamsack, Sask.\nOttawa, December 17th, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department has decided to defer the starting of a school on the Valley River reserve until a later date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nBalcarres, Sask.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of 25th Dec. 1909.\n\nNo. 145277/1.\n\nI beg to say that while on my last visit to Valley River Reserve, Mr. Overseer Chard introduced me to Rev. Mr. Crookshanks of Grandview, who is holding services fortnightly among the Indians at Valley River Reserve and with whom Mr. Chard has been talking School matters. Mr. Crookshanks wished me to inform the Department that they would help the Indians with $200.00 towards building a School House if the Department would guarantee them the free use of the School House for Sunday Services. He also said that if the Department wished it, he could suggest a teacher (who could also hold Sunday services for the Church) to the Department, who in this way would come for less money and be under the direct instructions of the Department and in no way controlled by the Church.\n\nI beg to ask for the Department's opinion on this matter so that I may inform Mr. Crookshanks as soon as possible.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, January 26th, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th instant in further reference to the establishment of a day school on the Valley River reserve, and in reply I beg to say that, while the Department appreciates the offer of Mr. Crookshanks to assist the Indians in erecting a school house on the conditions stated in your letter, it cannot avail itself of his offer. As you are aware it is the wish of the Department to conduct on this reserve a nondenominational school owing to the fact that the Indians belong to several denominations, and it is considered that this is the only kind of school that would in all probability prove ultimately a success.\n\nYou will be good enough to advise Mr. Crookshanks as to the attitude of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

The Indians expressed a desire to have a church built\u2014felt they could not accomplish the work without aid. We stated in my last for 3 years out of our missionary has been giving service each second Sunday our Society was applied to for a grant to assist in the Church enterprise. The grant was made then later the idea of a school was spoken of & I wrote to our missionary authority speaking of the proposal to build a school to this they offered no objection.

I think I used the term \"unmolested use.\"\n\nPerhaps I should have remembered I was dealing with a matter in which great care should be exercised lest a double meaning or a different meaning might be taken.

Of course this would mean, in most cases, someone connected with one of the churches, and under date of Jan. 18, 10 I referred to Mr Crookshanks suggesting a teacher as well as helping build the school but the Department in its letter No. 145277/1 of Jan. 26, 10 refused the offer, and I think rightly, to save trouble.\n\nOn May 17, 10 the Department asked me to try my best to get a teacher and I saw one in Grandview of whom I wrote the Department on June 6, 10 I asked her to send her application to the Department which she said she would do but I find that after seeing the location and boarding houses she said she would not take the school. I saw several others with like result. I have made every possible effort to get some teacher to apply for the school but my letter of Dec. 7, 09 explains, I think, the reasons why no one will go there.\n\nI am well aware that Annie Rattlesnake is not a suitable teacher and kept school closed as long as I could in hope of getting a qualified teacher to assist at the opening, but\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Ind.

The children present were clean and well dressed and read their exercises very well, and in good clear tone of voice. Their copy and exercise books were neat and well written. On the strength of what I saw, I allowed them to re-open the school, the Chief promising, that they would pay the teachers salary if the Department refused to do so. As the Indians seem so much in earnest about this school, and as Annie Clair Rattlesnake is doing better work than I had expected, I beg to request that the Department allow school to continue and pay Annie Clair $25.00 a month until a qualified teacher can be obtained.

I have been thinking over the matter and consulting the Executive of our Indian Mission Committee in the West. In the opinion of the Committee Mrs. McKenzie, the wife of our missionary at Hurricane Hills, would make a good teacher. I want to be thoroughly frank in writing you about this matter. We think that on the whole it would be in the interests of the work at Hurricane Hills if Mr. McKenzie were removed. If your Department sees fit to employ Mrs. McKenzie as teacher at Valley River, our Committee would probably give Mr. McKenzie some employment as missionary in that quarter. I understand that you are offering $400.00 for a teacher at Valley River. Mr. Blewett has been unable to find a qualified one at that rate. Our Committee do not think that one can be had at less than $500.00 a year. Salaries have gone up very much during the last few years and teachers are hard to find. Mrs. McKenzie, I believe, has a certificate as teacher from Scotland. Yours truly,\n\nJames Farquharson\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6298, file 632-1, part 1)\nOttawa, November 17, 1910.\n\nRev.

All read distinctly with the usual Indian intonation and readily. All evidenced an intelligent knowledge of the reading matter in their pages.

She is still in charge of this school and the various reports received from time to time from Mr. Inspector Graham and other officers who visited the school show that she is doing excellent work and the school is progressing favourably under her management.\n\nMr. Graham, in his last report on this school dated the 31st of October, calls the Department's attention to the small salary paid Miss Clair, which, he states, is utterly inadequate for the work she is doing, and recommends that her salary be increased to $40.00 a month with the prospect of a further increase in the spring, should she decide to remain. As this is a non-denominational school she receives nothing from any other source. As Miss Clair's services are so satisfactory I would suggest that\nthat she be kept on at a regular annual salary of $400.00, which would be at the rate of $40.00 a month for ten months, as recommended by Mr. Graham. It would be a pity to lose her as she is doing well at the school and her place would be hard to fill.\n\n[Signature]\n\nRecommended\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, November 7, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that the Department has decided to increase the salary of Miss Annie Clair, teacher of the Valley River Indian School, to $400.00 per annum.

She received $120.00 on two quarterly payments but on the last only $60.00. Both the teacher and Overseer Stanton say that Inspector Graham told her that she would get an increase. I fear the teacher will resign if there is no increase, and as she is and has been doing good work, I would recommend that she get at least the $120.00 per quarter. She should really get $125.00 per quarter as she often has to board several of the pupils, whose parents go hunting.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 22, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant stating that Miss Annie Clair Rattlesnake, teacher of the Valley River School, has asked for an increase in salary.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will grant her an increase of $50.00 from January 1st, next, making her salary $450.00 per annum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

She is very highly recommended by Indian Agent Wheatley, and the Principal of the Birtle school, of which she is a graduate, having taken her third class certificate with honors. I might add that she is a sister of Overseer Stanton's wife, and would be able to board with them as well as be company for Mrs Stanton at any time Mr Stanton should be absent. I would strongly recommend the acceptance of Miss Haines' application, to start on the re-opening of school after Xmas holidays, as it is very hard to get a stranger to take the school, all previous offers being for from $60.00 to $75.00 per month.

The Department will allow her a salary at the rate of $500.00 per year for her services.

I went to Valley River last Monday to see if she would not remain, as she was doing well there, but found she was getting married so could not stop her. Annie Clair Rattlesnake would like to take the school again. I might say that Annie Rattlesnake resigned also to get married but her white groom to be deserted before they could be married, so she is now anxious to return to teaching. She did good work and it would be better to engage her as it is extremely hard to get white teachers to stay there.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 28th ultimo reporting the resignation of Miss Haines, teacher of the Valley River Day School, to take effect on the 9th instant and recommending the appointment of Miss Rattlesnake, a former teacher at this school, as her successor I beg to say that Miss Rattlesnake may be engaged temporarily at the salary she was formerly paid, viz.- $400.00 per annum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I find that the children attending this School have made very little, if any, advancement during the year. Much could not be expected of them owing to the several changes of teachers which have been made in addition to the School being closed part of the time. Rattlesnake, the present teacher, is personally a bright young man but being an Indian himself and related in various ways to all his pupils he therefore does not get the results he should.\n\nI would respectfully ask the Department to make a change in this respect as soon as possible because for this School to continue as it is at present is only a waste of money as the children are making very little headway.

At the time of writing I was informed by Mr. Walls that the Roman Catholic Church was willing to place a man in charge of this school, and that I was not prepared to meet with their request until I had your approval, as I felt that the missionary work on this reserve belonged to the Protestant denominations.\n\nSince writing you however, I am in receipt of a letter from the Roman Catholic Priest, at Kamsack, in which he informs me that he wrote to Mr. Inglett, the party about whom he spoke to Mr. Walls as likely to accept the position at the Valley River School, telling him that\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nhe had better make application himself for the position, but has received no reply from him.\n\nThe Reverend Father suggests that a half-breed, without any qualifications, be placed in charge of the school, temporarily. I have no hesitation in saying that this would be a great mistake and I would be the last to recommend any such move. I doubt very much if this school should be re-opened, as I am strongly of the opinion that we will never get results from Day Schools for a long time. The parents of the present day children do not take the interest in the schools that they should and the home influence and environments are so strong, that any good that is derived from the school during the day is more than offset by the time the children spend at home.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCommissioner.\nOttawa, November 2, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd ultimo in regard to the re-opening of the Valley River School and stating that the Roman Catholic Priest at Kamsack suggests that a certain half-breed, without any qualifications, be placed in charge of this school temporarily.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department would not approve of the half-breed referred to being placed in charge of this school. Unless a qualified teacher can be secured it is considered that it would be better for the school to remain closed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nOn the 22nd October I wrote to the Secretary of the Department re the opening of the Valley River School, pointing out in the said letter that the Reverend Father in charge of the Valley River district suggested the appointment of a halfbreed, without any qualifications, be placed in charge of the School, temporarily. I pointed out to the Department that I thought this would be a great mistake and went on to say that I doubted very much if this school should be re-opened as I thought we would never get results from it. The Department acknowledged my letter on the 22nd October, but made no mention of that part of my letter, viz: that I thought it would be a great mistake to re-open the school and certainly opposed the appointment of a halfbreed.\n\nThe Department also assured me that the school had always been\n\nD. C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nbeen classed as an undenominational one. This may be true, but it has always been more or less considered a protestant school, and I feel quite satisfied that if it were handed over to a Roman Catholic teacher and the Priest visited the School, there would be trouble before very long. My opinion is that the school should be closed until such time as we are able to come to something definite regarding educational matters.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCommissioner.\nNovember 7th, 1916.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nI have your communication of the lst. instant with further reference to the re-opening of the Valley River School. Taking everything into consideration I agree with you that it is better to allow the school to remain closed for the present. You may, therefore, notify those interested accordingly.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, August 1st, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st, ultimo, forwarding a petition from the Valley River Indians, requesting that the day school be reopened.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to reopen this school, at present.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nChief Rattlesnake,\nValley River Indian Reserve,\nValley River,\nMan.\nMy Dear Mr. Scott:\n\nFrom time to time during the past two or three years, I have been approached with a view to having a teacher appointed for the Valley River Indian Reserve near Kamiskat. Lately the matter has come to a head, and I am asked to take it up officially. During the war, it has been found quite impossible to procure suitable teachers but now the prospects appear to be growing better. If I am to look out a man, it will be necessary for me to know what the salary will be and what accommodation there will be for him to live in. I may probably have to take a married man as I have had to do recently at Peguis.\n\nThe Indians at Jack Head have been pressing for a long time to have a teacher at that point, and I practically promised to send them one next spring, if I am not able to have one go during the winter. Though the Church will supplement the salary with a small grant, I cannot hope to procure a suitable man at the old amount, namely, $300.00. Kindly let me know whether the Department will be inclined to raise the salary to at least $600.00.\n\nI am,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nIndian Affairs, Ottawa.\nOctober 21st, 1919.\n\nMy dear Archbishop Matheson -\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Grace's communication of the 17th inst., in reference to the Valley River and Jack Head Schools.\n\nWith reference to the former, I beg to state that the chances of a successful day school are so remote that the Department has hesitated to reopen this school. I may at the same time also inform Your Grace that a similar application from the Roman Catholic Church for the establishment of a school could not be favourably considered. I would suggest, therefore, that the question be left in abeyance in the meantime.\n\nYour request regarding Jack Head will be dealt with in a separate communication.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nMost Rev. S. P. Matheson, D.D.,\nArchbishop of Rupert's Land,\nBishop's Court,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nMy dear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am in receipt of your two letters, and I note what you write about the Valley River School. I know nothing of this reserve but for some years past, periodically a request has come to me to open up the school at that point. I will let the petitioners know the contents of your letter.\n\nWith regard to Jack Head, the Indian Agent at Peguis informs me that it is too late this winter to send anybody out, so that the chances are that I shall not have a man available till next spring. I will send nobody but a good man.\n\nIt may be remembered that the Indians at that point have given us a great deal of trouble with the result that I removed the teacher and told them I would not send another until they changed their attitude towards the agents of the Church among them. For the last two years they have become very penitent and have promised to do everything in their power to help the man whom I send. I am anxious, therefore, to send somebody to them not later than next spring.\n\nWith kindest regards, I am,\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDepartment Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department agrees with you that it would be better, if it is possible to do so, to arrange for the placing of these children in residential schools. The children of school age and in good health of Catholic parentage could be sent to the Qu'Appelle Industrial School and the Protestant children to the File Hills Boarding School.

It is, therefore, considered that this number would not warrant the expenditure involved in re-opening the school. It is considered that the children on your reserve of school age would receive a better education in a residential school. The children of school age and in good health of Catholic parentage could be sent to the Qu'Appelle Industrial School and the Protestant children to the File Hills Boarding School.

He recommended that the Roman Catholic children be placed in the Qu'Appelle Industrial School and the Protestant children in the File Hills Boarding School.\n\nA request was also received in October, 1919, from the Archbishop of Rupert's Land to have this school re-opened under the auspices of the Church of England.\n\nThis school has been closed since March 31, 1918; having been closed at that time on account of poor attendance.\n\nWhen this school was in operation it was classed as undenominational.\n\nThe Agent states that the school building is in a fair state of repair, but it would be necessary to re-plaster the walls in places, and provide new screens for the windows and doors, at an approximate cost of $75.00.\n\nThe parents object to send their children to residential schools. It may be that there are now a number of children mentioned by His Grace who would attend if the school is re-opened, the majority of whom are Roman Catholics.\n\nI would suggest that, if the church authorities can obtain the services of a qualified teacher, we might give this school another trial, especially as the Indians have requested that it be re-opened.\n\nThere is only one point to be considered, viz: under whose auspices the school should be conducted. The Indian Commissioner reports that he always considered this school as being under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church, and that if it were handed over to a Roman Catholic teacher and the priest visited the school it would cause trouble. The best solution, if it could be carried out, would be to have the children placed in residential schools of the denomination to which they belong.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department suggested to the Agent that these children be placed in boarding schools.\n\nIn January of this year, the Department again refused the request of Chief John Rattlesnake of the Valley River Band and suggested Qu'Appelle and File Hills Residential Schools.\n\nIn September, the Archbishop of Winnipeg (R.C.) petitioned the Minister to reopen the Valley River School. Your memorandum to Sir James Loughhead mentioned the poor success of this school and of Indian day schools generally in Western Canada, and you informed the Minister that you questioned the details in the Archbishop's letter. The answer to your letter to the Agent is now to hand and it appears from Mr. Agent Bradbrooke's communication that there are 8 children available for a day school (6 R.C. and 2 Prot.).\n\nIn view of these facts, I would recommend that the Valley River Indian Day School be left closed.\n\nI believe, Sir, that a further reply to the Archbishop of Winnipeg is in order over either your signature or that of the Minister.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Binds -\n\nI agree with Mr. Ferrier's recommendation, but as Archbishop Sinnott wrote to the Minister I thought you might like to see the outcome of the correspondence on the question of the establishment of this day school.

I might state that it was a letter of the Archbishop's to the Minister that reopened the discussion in connection with the advisability of a school at Valley River.\n\nI beg to suggest that the Qu'Appelle School is available for the Roman Catholic children and the Birtle and File Hills Boarding Schools for the Protestant children of this Reserve.\n\nYou might take steps to see that an effort is made to place some of the children in these schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

A day school was operated on the reserve at one time but closed down years ago, and at the present time the children from there mostly attend the residential school at Camperville, and a few Protestants go to the Birtle school in Manitoba.\n\nI explained to the Indians that it would be impossible for our Branch to build any schools at the present time on account of not having the funds but when the war is over their request would no doubt be taken into consideration. The Indians informed me they understood this and if a day school was furnished for them after the war is over it would be perfectly satisfactory to them.\n\nYou will note that the petition has been typed and states that the Indians of Valley River reserve, Saskatchewan, are asking for the erection of a day school on their reserve with a Catholic teacher.

Bowman & McFadden,\nBarristers,\nDauphin, Manitoba.\nHonorable Minister:\n\nOn the radio, I hear that Parliament is in session. Because I am a resident in your constituency and because you represent the Indian Dept. I come to ask you a very special and urgent favor. I am the Indian missionary for the reserve of Valley River, Manitoba. This Indian reserve is situated between Roblin and Grandview, close to Shortdale, Manitoba. There are 25 families of Indians there and here is their plea. They absolutely want a day school on the reserve. In their names and mine, I humbly ask you to use your absolute influence to get the Government to vote a sum of $5000 dollars for this purpose. Our reasons are the following: The Indians want their children near them. Actually they are in Camperville and St. Philip's boarding schools which are approximately 125 miles away. The reserve is an ideal place for a day school, all the families are very near each other. Children would not need to walk far. There is yet another reason. The parents are so much taken about the idea of a day school, that they are taking every legitimate and illegitimate means to get it. For instance, they will encourage their children to run away from boarding schools. They even tried to influence some C.C.F. members of Parliament to get it for them. Actually they have approached some lawyers to work the matter out for them. Seeing all that, I decided to write you. I did not have time to consult their Indian Agent of Kamsack, Sask., as I should have, I understand. I would have liked to see you personally at Russell, but I was told that you were away.\n\nWould you, therefore, do everything in your power to get the Indian Dept. to grant us this urgent request. A day school at Valley River Indian Reserve is needed, I know. A teacher would do much to maintain order on the Reserve. The Catholic teacher of the Indian school of Skownan, Manitoba, is ready to take over at Valley River. She is a Sister of Service, Patricia Fuller, who is about to quit on the Waterhen Reserve because she has too few children.\n\nI urgently hope that you will obtain this day school for us at Valley River. At any rate, your answer will oblige me very much. I am a Catholic missionary; the Indians at Valley River are mostly Catholic and our Oblate Fathers, Principals of both the Catholic schools at Camperville and St. Philip's have urged me to appeal to you in the matter. They have difficulties with the children of Valley River precisely because they want a day school to be near their parents. We can hardly blame them, nor the parents. So it is serious and I beg you to believe that I am not talking through my hat. We want this to come through and we know that you can do everything to help us.\n\nTrusting that you will give this matter, your complete and kind attention, I am,\n\nYours very humbly,\n\n(Sgd) Rev. Joseph Poulette,\nO.M.I.,\nElphinstone, P.O.Man.,\n\nFor more details, confer next page.\nHere is a list of children actually in Camperville, Manitoba boarding school:\n\n| Name       | Name     | Name    | Name   |\n|------------|----------|---------|--------|\n| Thomas     | Eagle    | Grace   | Eagle  |\n| James      | Myrtle   | Eda     | Shingoose |\n| Dave       | Severight| Maria   | Gladys |\n| Adelard    | Ironstand| Isabel  | Minuck |\n| W.

So a school for 35 children is what we want. I presume that a building 24 x 40, would do. Moreover, an attachment house 20 x 20 would have to be built for a resident teacher. She would need a full basement under house and rooms above house, and school.\n\nI estimate that a sum of $5000, would cover the whole construction complete with desks, blackboards and paint, jakes for boys and girls. So it does not appear too extravagant, I think.\n\nNow the best time for building a school at Valley River, would be in May or June, so that we get the Indians to help. In August and September they go harvesting. I am sure they stand ready to help, if they can only get a school. Mind you, I know for a fact that they have already raised money to buy books for their children. There is a beautiful spot for a school, right across the road from the church. It is their so-called fair-ground, which they are ready to give for a school lot. Lumber could be had right there for there is the Continental Lumber Company, 600 yards away. The farthest children would have no more than a mile and a half to walk to school. Everything is so convenient that there seems to be no obstacle to the project.

This makes a total of 34 children who are receiving education, and if the figures given in our 1944 census are correct, practically all the children of the Valley River Band have educational advantages.\n\nFather Poulette estimates the cost of a school, teacher's residence and furnishings for same at $5,000.00. As you are aware, a one-room school with a teacher's residence attached has in recent years cost us between seven and eight thousand dollars. In addition, all the necessary furnishings such as desks, etc., have to be purchased.\nWe have requests for a very large number of day schools throughout the country, but, owing to present conditions, it will be possible to erect only a few of these this summer. In many places where schools are required no educational facilities are available at the present time. In the case of the Valley River Reserve, the children are able to attend a residential school.\n\nSeveral years ago we operated a day school on the Valley River Reserve, but it was closed in 1916 and has never been re-opened.\n\nIf a day school were opened on this reserve, it would involve taking 24 children from residential schools. In the case of the Pine Creek Residential School, it would mean a loss of 29 pupils. Possibly they could recruit others to replace those from Valley River, but on the other hand, it is possible that they would be unable to do so, and in the latter event the operation of the Pine Creek Residential School would be extremely difficult from a financial standpoint.\n\nIf it is desired to operate a day school on this reserve during the academic year 1946-47, the only possible solution would be to rent a building, as we have not provided any funds in the coming year's appropriation for the erection of a new school.

Bryant, Esq., Indian Agent, KAMSACK, Saskatchewan.\n\nI am sending forward herewith copy of a letter received by the Minister from the Reverend Father Poulette, Elphinstone P.O., Manitoba, and also copy of the Minister's reply thereto.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you could visit this reserve at an early date with the object of discussing with Father Poulette the establishment of an Indian day school on the reserve. It is just possible that there might be a building on or near the reserve which, with a little repair, might be used for the time being at least for school purposes. No provision has been made in the estimates this year for the construction of a day school at this point, and the cost estimated by Father Poulette seems, in my judgment, to be very low. The Minister is, himself, deeply interested in this proposal and a full and complete report from you at an early date would be very much appreciated.\n\nDirector.\nMr. Philip Phelan  \nChief, Training Division  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nAfter giving mature consideration to the project of once more building a day school on the Valley River Reserve and seeking the advice of Fathers who are in a position to form an opinion on the subject, I arrived at the conclusion that the project is untimely. Furthermore, in the event that the school was built, I hardly think we could find a teacher who could handle such a difficult situation and succeed in gaining the full confidence and securing the sincere cooperation of the Indians.\n\nFather Poulet seems to have been moved, in presenting his request, by the conditions now prevailing in the Province of Saskatchewan and the sudden interest the politicians of that Province have shown for matters connected with the Indians generally. The issue was raised at Valley River by a politician holding views similar to those of the politicians of the neighbouring province.\n\nFather Charles Ruest, Principal of the Pine Creek Residential School, in answer to a request from me, expressed his views on the matter as follows:\n\n(1) Against a day school at Valley River\n\nFormerly, there was a day school on the Valley River Reserve but, owing to a lack of cooperation from the parents and their bitter criticisms of the teachers in charge, its doors had to be closed.\n\nThe dealings our Principals and missionaries have had with these Indians for many years past tend to show that it is almost impossible to get along with them and that, whatever one may do to meet their demands, they will never be satisfied.\n\nIn view of the fact that, among the 124 children now boarding at the Pine Creek School 25 are from Valley River, the Principal is wondering whether he could reach his number if the latter were to attend a day school on their own Reserve.\nThere are serious grounds also to question the ability of the parents to give the children the food and clothing they require. It is rather to be expected that many of them would not be properly looked after and hence would suffer from malnutrition. Father Ruest mentions ten children in particular who either have no father, or whose father vagabonds from one place to another, or whose parents are in a condition of extreme want.\n\n(2) In favor of a day school at Valley River\n\nThe attitude of the parents towards the Pine Creek Residential School is openly hostile. The children are aware of this and are naturally influenced by their parents. Hence the Pine Creek School is greatly hampered in its efforts in behalf of these children although some of them, at least, profit by their attendance.\n\nOn the other hand, the residence on the Reserve itself of a capable Catholic teacher who could hold sway over the Indians might help a great deal in bringing them to their senses and have a beneficial effect on parents and children alike. Unfortunately, however, the unfavorable dispositions of the parents make this hope seem very problematic.\n\nI might add that the very motives that prompt the Valley River Indians to ask for a day school are in themselves rather an added reason for us to doubt that the venture would have any success at all.\n\nI trust the above will throw some light on the matter and enable you to help those concerned in reaching the best decision in the circumstances.\n\nTruly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. Majorique Lavigne, O.M.I.\nProvincial\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Valley River Indian Day-School.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nSometime ago, you wrote me regarding the establishment of a day-school on the above Reserve and requested that I contact Reverend Father Lavigne and the missionaries interested before making any decision.\n\nThe enclosed letter will give you the reasons for and against this foundation and I am asked to say that any decision which you may take in the matter will be accepted by the parties concerned.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.O.

It would be appreciated if you would forward your report at the earliest possible date.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nKamsack, Sask.,\nApril 30, 1946.\n\nPhilip Phelan, Esq.,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Valley River Reserve School:\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of 26th inst. under file 117-5-1 drawing my attention to Mr. Hoey's letter with respect to the proposed school as asked for by Reverend Joseph Poullette, O.M.I., of Elphinstone, Manitoba.\n\nThe Rev. Pollette does not live on the reserve and it was not possible for me to interview him, however, I have called him up on long distance and suggested that he come to Valley River early next week so that we could arrive at some decision in regards to having a school built for the Valley River Indians. As soon as I discuss this case with him I shall be in better position to give you a complete report.\n\nThey have a church on Valley River reserve which was suggested for temporary school accommodation but as far as I can recall I do not think the arrangement will be satisfactory. As far as I can see it will be necessary to erect a new building.\n\nJ. L. Bryant,\nIndian Agent.\nKamsack, Saskatchewan,\nMay 10, 1946.\n\nR.A. Hoey Esq., Director, Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of March 23rd, with copies of letters from Rev. Fr. Poulette to the Hon. J.A. Glen, and his answer thereto.\n\nFor various reasons I was unable to contact Rev. Fr. Poulette until last Monday at Roblin Manitoba. The matter of a Day School at Valley River Reserve was discussed fully and from every angle with the Reverend gentleman.\n\nI might say that there is no suitable building on or near the Valley River reserve that would be suitable for school purposes, except the new Roman Catholic Church. Rev. Fr. Poulette thought that his superiors would have no objection to us using the church for this purpose provided we paid a reasonable rent and put in the necessary desks, blackboards, possibly erected a small shed for storage of church furniture and other uses.\n\nI have since discussed this matter with the Reverend Father Provincial of this Catholic Order and he advises that we are at liberty to use the church until we build a school next year provided other obstacles are overcome.\n\nRev. Fr. Poulette was sure that he could on short notice secure a capable teacher that would be quite willing to start in at Valley River in September providing we had the necessary building. He had in mind Miss Fuller, who has been teaching at Shoal River Reserve in Manitoba for several years. However the Rev. Fr. Provincial points out that Miss Fuller is very poor health, which is possibly unknown to Rev. Fr. Poulette.\n\nThere used to be a day school at Valley River many years ago, and the Catholic order found that it was almost to satisfy the parents or children; complaints were many and often unwarranted according to the recollections of the Rev. Mr. Principal. Finally the school was destroyed by fire and the bone of contention was removed. The Rev. Fr. Provincial does not appear to be at all anxious to see another day school started unless we could be sure of a good man teacher for the first couple of years at least.\n\nMr. Dousette and the Rev. Fr. Provincial called together to discuss the matter of this school with me, and we had a round table discussion in connection with this proposed school.\n\nMr. Dousette advised that he already had several school vacant because he was unable to get the suitable teachers. This would appear to be the main reason why action should be deferred for the time being.\n\nPersonally I would like to see a day school on this reserve. It is very suitable for a day school as most of the children would be quite close and none more than one and a half miles from the proposed site. The right type of teacher would be a great help in improving the conduct of the younger people at least, by finding other suitable outlets for their surplus energy by directing them in wholesome pleasures and sports.\n\nEvery Indian on the reserve appears very anxious to have the Day school again, which I think could be made a success in spite of past failures. The church could be made quite suitable for our use for a year. The cost would I am sure of a new building would run to around $15,000.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6298, file 632-1, part 1)\nIn view of the fact that the children of this Reserve are forced to attend residential schools so far away from home and the parents keen desire for a day school where they can have their children at home, I would recommend that plans be made to open a school in September, provided we can be assured that a suitable man teacher will be available.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.L. Bryant,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 15, 1946\n\nDear Father Lavigne:\n\nIndian Agent Bryant has written with reference to his recent interview with you regarding the establishment of a day school on the Valley River Reserve. I discussed the Agent's report with the Director this morning, and if it is possible to secure a qualified male teacher to take charge of this school on September 1, 1946, this Branch is prepared to open the school. Please let me know as soon as possible if you are in a position to nominate a qualified male teacher.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend M. Lavigne, O.M.I.,\nSt. Boniface, Manitoba.\nOttawa, May 16, 1946.\n\nMr. J. L. Bryant, Indian Agent,\nKamsack, Saskatchewan.\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, with reference to opening a school on the Valley River Reserve. The contents of your letter have been discussed with the Director, and I am writing to Father Lavigne, Provincial of the Oblate Order, requesting him to nominate a qualified male teacher to begin duties on September 1, 1946. If we are able to secure such a teacher, we will be willing to open this school.\n\nIt is noted from your letter that we can use the Church for school purposes, provided a reasonable rent is allowed. You might let me know what monthly rent has been requested. You should also let me know the number of desks that will be needed. Desks are made in three sizes - large, medium and small. The dimensions of the blackboard required should also be stated. At the same time you might let me have a statement regarding any other expenditures that will be necessary in the event of the school being opened.\n\nI would like to have this information at your earliest convenience, so that if Father Lavigne advises that he can secure a qualified male teacher, we will be in a position to complete the matter.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nKamsack, Saskatchewan,\nJuly 10, 1946.\n\nDept. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch, OTTAWA.\n\nAttention Mr B.F. Neary\n\nI have for acknowledgement your letter of July 4th in connection with the proposed Day School at Valley River. I do not know the Rev. Sister Patricia, of Skowan, Manitoba, but sincerely hope that she has the ability to teach and handle the children, as it would be very unfortunate to open the school and get away to a bad start. Rev. Fr Poulette, the Priest in charge of Valley River Reserve speaks very highly of her ability, and as it is almost impossible to get a male teacher at the present time, I expect we should accept her application, and hope for the best.\n\nI have just heard from Father Lavigne in regard to living quarters, and we are allowed to have the use of the three rooms attached to the church for the use of Sister Patricia.\n\nI am trying to arrange to meet Rev Fr. Poulette of Elphinstone, Manitoba, at Valley Reserve in the near future. He has this reserve under his charge, and I am unable to get into the church otherwise. We will then size up the situation up, and order the necessary desks, blackboards and anything else that will be required. It may be necessary to build a small building on skids that could be used for a wash room, and for storage purposes. Toilets for the boys and girls and one for the staff will also be required.\n\nI am without a clerk here, but I will give you a further report on this as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.L. Bryant, Indian Agent.\nOttawa, 19 September 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Valley River Indian Day School - No. 632\n\nThe Valley River Day School is being re-opened and its code number in future should be No. 632.\n\nBernard F.

The attendance was very good the first month in fact the accommodation was taxed to the limit.\n\nJ. L. Bryant,\nIndian Agent\nKamsack Agency Quarterly Report\nending December 31st, 1946.\n\nEducation:\n\nThe Valley River Day School at Timberton in charge of Rev. Sister Patricia, T.O.S.F. is doing very well indeed in spite of lack of space and shortage of equipment. The attendance has been exceptionally good and the children appear to be making splendid progress.\n\nThe parents are well pleased with the Day School and having their children at home daily. It is hoped that every effort will be made to have a new school constructed in 1947 to take the place of the leased Catholic Church being used for a school at the present time. It would appear advisable to erect a two room school on this Reserve.\n\nJ.L.

The pupils transcribe them.\n\nThese children coming from Boarding Schools, where everything\nnecessary is supplied, and where, also, they attended class only\nhalf days, have not taken kindly to scribbler text books.\n\nThey also find the days very long and frequently ask me\n\"When are our books coming? We want to colour\".\n\nFrom the first the conduct of these children has been poor.\nIt is not improving much. With the exception of Walter Lynxleg,\nthey are not really bad children, but are discouraged working under\nsuch unsatisfactory and monotonous conditions. They take very\nlittle interest in study. As much as possible, I take their studies\n\f\nKamsack, Saskatchewan,\nFebruary 7th, 1947.\n\nB. F. Neary, Esq.,\nSuperintendent,\nWelfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Valley River Day School\n\nI am attaching herewith a letter that Sister Patricia, the teacher of Valley River school forwarded with my mail yesterday.\n\nIt does seem unfortunate that necessary school books are still not available for this school and I trust every effort will be made to have these supplied as soon as possible.\n\nThe Sisters request for permission to close school at 3 p.m. during the balance of the winter months has my approval as the Church building is very crowded and there is no space for recreation at the noon hour or recess during cold and stormy weather.\n\nJ. L. Bryant,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 13th, 1947.\n\nMr. J.L. Bryant, Indian Agent,\nKamsack, Saskatchewan.\n\nWe have your letter of the 7th inst., enclosing letter received from Sister Patricia, teacher of the Valley River Day School. The Department approves the school closing at 3 p.m. during the balance of the winter months.\n\nWith reference to the books which she has not received, Geographies and Spellers were ordered from the Government Stationery Office some weeks ago but they have experienced great difficulty in securing the quantity that we require. Consequently, delivery of them has been delayed. However, we hope that they will go forward shortly.\n\nThe crayons were also ordered from the Government Stationery Office. These are also difficult to secure in large quantities. You may purchase thirty-six boxes of crayons locally and forward them to the school.\n\nWith reference to the Histories, we wrote Sister Patricia on January 8th asking her to let us have the title of the history text book that she requires, also the grade or grades for which it is intended and the name of the publisher. We have not yet received any reply to that letter.\n\nAs you are aware, there was a special order form attached to the Indian School Bulletin No. 1, Vol. 1 issued on October 10th. We have no record of Sister Patricia having forwarded the form to order the books that we usually supply.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nValley River Day School,\nTimberton, P.O., Man.,\nMay 19th, 1947.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nHaving enjoyed, for the past twenty-five years, the happy experience of the cooperation and generosity of the Indian Department, I wish at the closing of my first year at the above school, to acquaint the Department with the existing conditions regarding the school building and supplies, etc.\n\nAs the Department is already aware we are using the church as a school-room. The floor space is 22 ft x 20 ft, in it we have thirty-six separate desks, all occupied. It is necessary for me to walk the length of the room to pass from one row of desks to another. In September we are expecting ten new pupils. I have the desks in storage for them, but where to put them is a problem I am leaving, in the hope that the school building will be ready for the September term. We have not a table nor cupboard, as there is absolutely no space to put them. All reserve supplies are laying on my bed-room floor, as was also the winter dinner supplies.\n\nThe Department has questioned my request for laundry soap. As the school and towels have to be washed every week, I\ndo not think I asked for too much for a whole year's supply, taking into account that the women use now three cakes a week, and that the school building will be much larger, and furnished. But I did make the mistake of ordering for the whole year. Mr Agent Bryant informs me that I should requisition as needed, and that he will purchase paper towels for us. This pleases me greatly. If we could have paper cups, instead of as now, every one drinking from the one cup, I should be even more pleased.\n\nThe Department mentioned to Mr Agent Bryant, that I am seemingly indifferent to the new Indian School Bulletins, as I have not applied for any of the books. Quite the contrary is the truth. I am deeply interested in them. But while we have not even shelf space we can not avail ourselves of their benefits.\n\nThis brings me to the subject of text books. Mr Inspector Ostrander informed me that he wishes these pupils to advance to Grade eight at least. Given the necessary books at once, I can see no reason ten out of my thirteen teen age pupils should not pass. But at present they have only Arithmetics, Spellers, Children Round the World and Living in Manitoba, to study from. I asked the Department for 14 Elementary English Grammars, by MacLaurin and Campbell. I have been informed that I may have only one.\n\nIt is impossible to teach Geography, Grammar, and History, etc., orally in a school of this size. A few of the brighter ones might pass their entrance examination with this method, but not the majority, and the three divisions of Grade one could not receive the strong foundation I feel every beginner needs.\nMay I now refer to the more personal subject under the Indian Department's consideration, that of my teaching classification. I come very definitely under the Welfare Teaching Division.\n\nThat I am doing little Welfare work here at present is due solely to the lack of a building. At present I can only aid in their spiritual and moral welfare. I hold services on Sundays, then I take the opportunity of teaching the adults something of morality.\n\nThe Farm Instructor is also the despenser. So I have not the sick to care for. On this Reserve I would not wish it. We have three doctors at phone's call. There is nothing either interesting or satisfying for the despenser.\n\nNow, how can I class myself as a Welfare Teacher? On my past experience and future hopes. I served three years at Berens River, and four years at Bloodvein River. Six months of each year it was impossible to connect the doctor either personally or by mail. Then I had full responsibility of the sick and injured. The winter mail took a month, and the summer mail took one week to bring me doctor's instructions. During my 17 year service at Waterhen Reserve, I sent for the doctor three times\u2014it took 24 hours to get him, and I sent out an average of one patient a year.\n\nI had girl's and boys clubs, Nursing and First Aid Classes for women. Encouraged and assisted the Indians in their gardens and homes, and in everything that interested them. They brought all their sorrows and troubles to me, even their sick animals. In all this I found great satisfaction and happiness. I could not have done so badly, as I have had many letters and one petition\nfrom the Indians asking me to return to them.\n\nI have promised Rev Father Poulette, my present superior, that I will stand by him to get this school completely organized, and to give the adults a fair opportunity to show if they wish to improve their moral and spiritual standards. We have already observed a slight improvement. At both Christmas and Easter, some Indians who had not been to the sacraments for eighteen and twenty years did so then. Under these circumstances I wish the Department to allow me to remain here for the 1947-48 term. But I am asking very frankly to be allowed to return to another isolated mission\u2014preferably to the Kamloops B.C. Agency. I wish to serve in the beauty and warmth of B.C. I have friends there who write me of its picturesqueness and of the fine type of Indians.\n\nApart from the church and clubs, these Indians do not need me. They are all very nice to me, and state that they will not let me leave them. But they have the Farm Instructor all the time, The Agent and Inspector often, and the doctor every time they ask. Of course, Rev Father Poulette feels strongly that I am the only one to handle the situation at present. I think he is right. The spiritual and moral standards of these Indians are at such a low level, that, I agree with Rev Father Poulette, that a lay teacher could not do much. As a religious they know it is my work to try to straighten them up, and so, at least, listen respectfully. These Indians are wishing for a little hospital here. If I may be allowed to express my own opinion, I would suggest that the very best thing for this Reserve would be to have Sisters here to teach\u2014in 1949 there\nout to be about sixty pupils\u2014take charge of clubs and meetings for the children and women, the church and a cottage hospital.\n\nI do believe the Department would gain financially, and the church and Indians in spiritual and moral strength. There was much opposition to my coming here owing to the impression that the Indians are too rough. I have found all very respectful. I am sure other sisters would find the same. But I do think a lay woman would have too much attention from certain of the men, and I am inclined to think a man teacher might have too many interferences. But as I stated, all this is just my own opinion, I have not discussed it with Rev Father Poulette.\n\nFinally, my teaching qualifications. I have no Canadian standing. I received my education at private schools in England. I was taking a preparatory medical course, when financial reverses forced my leaving school. Then came war 1914. I served as a despatch clerk, and a volunteer ambulance and signalling instructor.\n\nI am a St John's silver medalist, and a member of the Pelman Institute of America. I have found this course most useful, especially in teaching my weak minded pupils at Waterhen Reserve, and the one poor little mentally defective boy in this school, as well as applying the teaching in so far as it is suitable for children.\n\nWhen I have a pupil ready to take the entrance examination I shall take the course, by correspondence, first, to be certain that I am teaching the child in every detail as required by the province. But I have not had the means to take a course that would not be used for years, if at all. The medical studies, I have\nkept up as best I could. I would very gladly pay for a course if it is possible to obtain one by correspondence.\n\nIf the Department can assure me that I shall be given another dispensary, I intend to take the St John's examination for the gold medal.\n\nWithout being conceited, I feel that my St John and Pelman Institute diplomas, along with my twenty-five years of practical medicine and minor surgery, and general Indian Reserve experience should place me in the higher salary bracket. Had I all these years held a First Class Teacher's Certificate, of what value would it have been to me compared with the diplomas I now hold and my experience. Is it quite just to keep me in the lowest classification, with the same salary as a young inexperienced girl.\n\nI leave my classification to the Department's sense of fairness and generosity.\n\nI beg to remain\n\nYours respectfully\n\n[Signature]\n\nPatricia T.C.S.F\nKamsack, Saskatchewan,\nAugust 13th, 1947.\n\nCol. B. Neary,\nSuperintendent,\nWelfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Valley River School.\n\nRev. Sister Patricia has now been transferred to B.C. and I wondered if any arrangements have been made to appoint another teacher for Valley River School in order that school may re-open on September 2nd. The Indians of Valley River Reserve are very anxious to have the day school continued and I hope every effort will be made to find a suitable teacher. This is a very heavy school and a male teacher would be much preferred. It might be possible to have Mrs. Allbright the wife of the Farming Instructor open the school and carry on for a few weeks if a teacher was not available by September 2nd.\n\nMrs. Allbright is a fully qualified 2nd class professional teacher with many years teaching experience in Manitoba.\n\nI discussed this matter with Rev. Fr. Poulette some time ago and he would be very pleased to have Mrs. Allbright in charge of the school if a Catholic teacher is not immediately available. I understand Fr. Poulette is doing his best to locate a suitable teacher that would meet with the approval of your Department.\n\nJ. L. Bryant,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nOn a recent visit to the Pelly Agency I visited the three Indian day schools therein, namely Valley River, Key's, and Cote.\n\nI found the attendance at the Valley River Reserve was very satisfactory. There are 36 children on the roll, and the average attendance for the immediately preceding month was 93.8%. A large number of the children had not missed a day, and those who had missed, had missed only a very few days because of illness.\n\nThe attendance at the Key's and Cote Day Schools was very unsatisfactory. That of the Key's School was 70.23%, and that of the Cote School 58.95%. The Key's School, with 26 on the roll, had an average daily attendance of 18.26. The Cote School, with 44 on the roll, had an average daily attendance of 25.94. I pointed this out to Indian Agent Mr. J.L. Bryant, and the teachers concerned, and drew the attention of Mr. Bryant to the fact that Family Allowances payments should be stopped in many instances. Mr. Bryant is to immediately warn the parents that failure to greatly improve the attendance will result in loss of Family Allowances payments, and possibly prosecution. Aside from the matter of attendance I feel that very little is being accomplished at either the Cote Day School or the Key's Day School, and I do not consider the teachers concerned are giving the service which we are entitled to expect.\n\nThe teacher at the Valley River Day School, a Miss Zastre, commenced her duties this term. She is a teacher of long experience, and although her qualifications are not high I believe she is performing very satisfactory work. She is making the classroom work interesting; which, of course, accounts for the good attendance to a great degree.\n\nJ.F.B.

File 117-5-1 W-E-1 in connection with the transfer of Reverend Sister Patricia from Meten Indian School to the Valley River Indian School, effective September 1st, 1946.\n\nBy arrangement I met Reverend Father Poulette at Valley River Reserve last Thursday. The Church building with two living rooms attached will be fairly suitable for the school and living quarters for Reverend Sister Patricia. There is no basement in the Church and no suitable place for storage of vegetables, butter or other perishable supplies and I would recommend that a cellar 10ft. by 12ft. be excavated under the living room attached to the Church, this could be done by Indian labour. This would cost approximately $50.00. We will also have to dig pits and build two outside toilets at a cost of approximate $35.00 each.\n\nI am attaching a requisition for necessary desks, blackboards etc. which I think could be supplied by Christie's School Supply Co., Brandon Manitoba.\n\nI have also asked Reverend Father Poulette to get in touch with Reverend Sister Patricia as soon as possible so that she may make up a requisition for the school supplies books etc. that she will require before the school opens.\n\nIt is expected that the usual noon day lunch will be provided for the children and I would appreciate being advised the amount that may be expended for the purpose during the Academic School Term, September 1st to June 30th 1947.\n\nSome cooking utensils, dishes, spoons, knives, forks, pails etc. will be required but these could be purchased locally as soon as Reverend Sister Patricia lets me know what she will require in this connection.\n\nWe have a large portable granary on Valley River Reserve that will not be in use this year and I plan to have this moved to the rear of the Church where it can be used for storage purposes for this year.\n\nJ.

An expenditure of $35.00 for new toilets is also approved. You may purchase ten window blinds. Kitchen utensils such as spoons, knives, forks etc. may be purchased.\n\nIn view of the payment of Family Allowances we do not consider it necessary to allow as much as we formerly did for mid-day meal purposes.

Neary, Esq.,\nSupy. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe Valley River School.\n\nI visited this school yesterday. Sister Patricia seems to have the situation well in hand, but she is still very short of books etc. She started school on Sept 3rd and at that time only had 15 small desks, however when I was there yesterday the other desks arrived. She still has no blackboards that were ordered with the desks. Mr Allbright the farming instructor is going to paint a sheet of Beaver board black, and I think she will be able to get along with this until the black boards arrive.\n\nWe will have to get a box stove and an axe for the school. Batons have one in their fall and winter catalogue as per sheet attached that would be suitable.\n\nI am also enclosing a requisition for further supplies that are required.\n\nThere were 35 pupils in the school yesterday and there are still a few more to come in.\n\nJ.L.

There is an attendance of 40 pupils at the present time and there are at least another nine of school age that should be in attendance after harvest.\n\nRev. Sister Patricia is really getting along splendidly, she has excellent order and almost a 100% attendance. The blackboards just arrived this week and Mr Allbright expects to get them put up for her this week end.\n\nThe Sister has a pony that she is very attached to and I had a small log stable put up back of the school for this animal. I might say that water for the school has to be hauled about three hundred yards, she has a stone boat and a 40 gallon tank and the pony is used to haul the water. She also uses her pony and buggy to visit on the reserve, and she is very ready and willing to give advice and assistance in cases of sickness. Under the circumstances I think you will agree that the small outlay for the little stable is justified.\n\nJ.L. Bryant,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 26 September 1946.\n\nMr. J.L.

In view of Mr. Doucet's recommendations, we are transferring money from Valley River (where we intended to erect a two-room school) to Lake St. Martin (where we intended to erect a one-room school). This change in plans means that we will have funds for a two-room school at Lake St. Martin and for a one-room school at Valley River.\n\nIt is anticipated that we will be receiving from you in the near future a tender for the labour on the construction of this building. In the meantime we cannot place the entire order for the bill of materials until Ministerial approval as to the contractor is obtained. However, we are ordering the cement immediately so that there will be no delay with the excavation of the basement and the pouring of the concrete. If the contractor could give an indication as to the approximate cost of the lumber required for the concrete forms we could authorize local purchase of this amount, so that work could begin on the basement almost as soon as we have Ministerial approval for the labour tender.\n\nTherefore, we are today forwarding to the Departmental Purchasing Agent a requisition for the purchase...\nof 700 bags of cement. It is presumed that we will also hear from you with regard to local purchase of the gravel required. I would also like to know if we should forward an accountable advance of $500.00 to you in order to cover hauling and other local charges.\n\nBernard F.

I hope to have this completed by the 15th of May after which we hope to go to Fort Frances - there it will depend on the gang employed. I will rush the work as much as possible and if Reverend Brother Boulais comes to help us, I will allow him to do the finishing.

A Danielle\nElkhinstone, Manitoba\nMay 25th 1948\n\nMr. Alphonse Slouet\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose Mr. Barville's letter about conducting and building our Indian School at Tinterton, for Valley River Indian Reserve.\n\nThey are Albert Barville and Sons, Jean and Roland, from St-Pierre Joly, Manitoba.\n\nI do not think you can find any better Carpenters for good, quick, and efficient work. You will notice that they\nhave raised their price, from $1.00, and 70c for his tools, to $1.50 for himself, and $1.25 for his sons. I can't help that. The 0.50c allotted to Indian helpers seems to satisfy them, although some of them are getting 55c per hour at the mill.\n\nMy humble opinion is that they should be paid 0.75c per hour, if they work well, and I think they will. It would be only fair to help them out, while at the same time making them work for a good cause. With Banville & Sons, they are bound...\nMost of lumber, shingles, could be had at the Centennial Lumber Co., a few yards away. I believe plans should be sent to me, or Mr. Albright, Farm Instructor, so as to know what is actually required as far as lumber, or other materials, are concerned. Or do, as you please; it is none of my business. But we are completely blind in trying to help you.\n\nAt any rate, the site is chosen, a very good one. We are all satisfied. But as far as water is concerned, we have tried to guess with a fellow. None of\nus, is an expert at it. But we do hope water could be found near our chosen spot. Some say water can be found almost everywhere. Some others have some doubts; we leave it to you. But please advise us to the progress of your intentions.\n\nOr should we wait patiently? Tell us your wishes or intentions, in a word, advise. That will be appreciated. Actually, we are completely alike minds.\n\nNow here, I wish to mention one important point. It is my wish, that about six more treaty Indians, be\naccepted in our new schools. So far, I have asked for this favour, without avail. Mr. Bryant, Indian Agent, has always refused me, for lack of space. In the meantime, those children are without schooling. I wish you help me at this point. Or should I write to the Minister of Indian Affairs? It is a serious problem, and I am asking this, not for doing a favour to myself or parents of these children, but for the education of some six children, which is sorely needed. One parent, at least, is ready to pay a little.\nI believe it could be arranged that the Dept. of Education of Manitoba pays for them. The Indian Dept. is doing just that here, in Big Earth, where I presently am, and where you have seen me.\n\nNow I am exhausted. But I shall appreciate your kind cooperation on all these matters.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. Joseph Poulet\n\nElphinstone\n\nManitoba\n\nThe above is my right address\nto give their very maximum of work.\n\nNow Indians have teams of horses and they can well dig out basements. But a larger pay should be allotted for Indians working with their teams. After talking with them, they all seemed to be satisfied, with 50 cts per hour for men, and an extra 50 cts for a team of horses, per hour.\n\nNow, the only thing to decide is to be responsible and pay them fair wages, and also more. This is not for me to decide. I have given my humble opinion and that is all. You know of their wishes, at the same time.\nI hope to get the Barrie's by 1st of August. Indians would like to start in June or July.\n\nAt any rate, I was at Valley River on Sunday May 28th. Mr. Allbright and I, as well as most Indians, have agreed of having the school built right at East end of sports ground, across the road from church. The teacher would then have windows facing west, having children on sport ground, right under her eyes, recess times. Some day windows must be facing East. To that, I can't say much.\nI hope to get the Barnville's by 1st of August. Indians would like to start in June or July. At any rate, I was at Valley River on Sunday May 28th.

(RG 10, Volume 6298, file 632-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nRe: Valley River Day School\n\nI have for acknowledgement your letter of June 18th, together with bill of material required for this school. Blueprint plans have also been received.\n\nThis week I called to see the superintendent of the Continental Lumber Co. branch, at Timberton, Manitoba.\n\nThis Company have a mill at Timberton siding, and can supply all our requirements in spruce lumber. They also have connections with several mills in British Columbia but are very doubtful if they could supply the fir lumber that we require due to the recent serious flood situation in that Province. However, I am sure that if they are unable to obtain the fir there will be little hope of getting it anywhere else this year. This firm supply most of the local lumber yards in the district. The Superintendent would not quote a price, but intimated that as our requirements would amount to more than a car load the lumber would be supplied at wholesale prices!\n\nThey have some nails on hand at Timberton and are satisfied that they can obtain all we require. These are American nails and will cost approximately 12\u00a2 per pound. However nails are still in very short supply and we will just have to pay the price.\n\nThe firm will quote a price on the lumber delivered at the school site as required. The school site is a little over half a mile from their planning mill.\n\nThe Indians at Valley River Reserve will be employed to deliver the stone but the gravel and sand will have to be hauled by truck. I examined three gravel pits within ten miles of Timberton but was not quite satisfied with the gravel, there is still another pit that I wish to see but due to a very heavy rainfall on Tuesday afternoon I was unable to get there. If it could be arranged I would prefer Mr. Banville to meet me at Timberton, for a few hours as soon as possible in order that we could decide on the most suitable gravel available and other matters.\n\nThe Continental Lumber Co. have a large Cat Tractor and Bulldozer with which they could excavate the basement. They will supply the outfit to us free but we pay the operators wages and gas and oil required. It is estimated the excavation could be completed in about three days. Mr. Banville may wish to have this work done after he arrives or he may prefer to have me proceed with the work now.\nWe have a building 14 x 12 which will be hauled to the school site for storage purpose and I have also arranged for a storage shed at Timberton siding that we can have use of to store supplies cement and other supplies until they are required at the site.\n\nI might add that the Continental Lumber Co. in Winnipeg, have very good connections and I would suggest that they be requested to supply all the building material, lumber, bricks, clay tile pipe, weeping tile, asphalt shingles, wall board, paper etc. They would possibly have less difficulty obtaining material in short supply than we would.\n\nMr. Theo Sparks is the general manager and is possibly well known by Mr. Hoey, Mr. Pratt and other officials of our Department.\n\nJ. L. Bryant,\nSuperintendent.\n\nP.S. Mr Albert Benwell is at present located at Fort Frances ON.\nI wish to advise that the excavation for this school is almost completed.\n\nWe are also digging a well and are down 20 feet but have not yet struck water.\n\nThe cement for the foundation has arrived and is unloaded and stored near the school site.\n\nArrangements have been made to haul the gravel by truck. Lumber and nails for the forms for the cement work is available at Timberton, and will be delivered by the Continental Lumber Co. as we require it. This firm has not yet heard from the purchasing agent in connection with supplying the other building material.\n\nThere are three gravel pits from which gravel may be obtained and I will wait until Mr. Banville arrives before starting to haul, as I would like his opinion as to which is the most suitable. We can haul the gravel while he is erecting the forms so there will be no delay in this connection.\n\nI understand that Mr. Banville is finishing a school at Fort Francis and that he expects to be ready to start work at Timberton the first week in August.\n\nMay I suggest that a septic tank and inside toilet and bath be installed in this school when it is being built.\n\nJ.

Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nMr. Banville arrived yesterday morning ready to start work on the Valley River Day School.\n\nHe has three carpenters with him including his two sons. I understand Mr. Banville is to be paid at the rate of $2.00 per hour but this was not stated in your letter of June 18th, 1948.\n\nThe excavation is completed and a well has been dug with a fair supply of good water at 40 feet.\n\nThe material for the forms has been purchased and we practically are assured of the supply of all material required for the cement work.\n\nI met Mr. Sparks of the National Lumber yards Ltd. this morning at Timberton, Manitoba. I advised you that the material should be purchased through the Continental Lumber Co. but evidently the firm is now known as the National Lumber Yards Ltd. Mr. Sparks feels that his firm can supply all the building material required but points out that 3 inch hardwood flooring would have to be supplied instead of 2 inch.\n\nMr. Sparks advised that up to the present he had not heard from the purchasing agent in connection with the material required for this building.\n\nMr. Banville requests that he and his men be paid weekly but in view of Income Tax deductions etc. I hope he will agree to being paid every two weeks.\n\nIt is expected that there will be at least two months work providing we are able to get another one or two carpenters and a few handy men to assist with the rough work. It is expected that a few Indians will be employed.\n\nI will require a further accountable advance to pay wages and would suggest $3,000.00 as the amount that may be required. It would be appreciated if this could be forwarded as soon as possible.\n\nThis morning I ordered the coal chute and we will also have to get the basement window frames within a few days as these should be put in before we run the cement. These will also be ordered at once.\nWithin a couple of days I will send you a copy of the orders for material that have been placed so that there will be no duplication of the order. However, I have just ordered everything that is necessary for the construction of the basement.\n\nJ. L.

The school site is excavated, a well 40 feet deep has been dug close to the school site, and the cement is on hand. The carpenters were on the job ready to start work and the other material was not on hand.\n\nMr. Superintendent Bryant was telephoned, and he visited the reserve in the afternoon. We were informed that immediate arrangements would be made to get out the gravel and stone for the cement work, steel reinforcement rods had been on order for some time, and he would do all possible to expedite delivery. The delivery of the above material would allow the carpenters to commence work on the footings and basement.\n\nThe lumber and other materials have not been ordered by the Purchasing Branch, as far as he knew. Immediately delivery should be made, otherwise the job will be held up.\n\nWill you kindly take the above matter up with the Purchasing Branch.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. Waite,\nField Agent.\nSeptember 2, 1948.\n\nMr. J. L. Bryant,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nKamsack, Saskatchewan.\n\nValley River Indian Day School.\n\nReference your 1-3-10 of August 18\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter with attached list of materials ordered for the school, as authorized by our letter of July 30.\n\nIt is presumed that you will submit the accounts for these materials in due course.\n\nI note that you have settled the matter of an hourly wage with Mr. Banville. This rate of $1.50 an hour was agreed on with him some time ago and you should so advise Father Poulett.\n\nIf any materials are left over after the school has been completed, please store them in the basement and we will advise you next Spring where they can be shipped, for use in another of our school building projects in Manitoba.\n\nBernard F.

The new school being constructed at Valley River should in my opinion have been a two room school to take care of the children of that reserve. There are also several white children at Timberton siding that are unable to attend school due to lack of accommodation. It is also a very lonely life for one teacher living alone on an Indian Reserve and from this point alone I would strongly recommend 2 room day schools where there are sufficient children to warrant the two rooms.\nRECOMMEND SELLING APPROXIMATELY HUNDRED SACKS SURPLUS CEMENT FROM VALLEY RIVER SCHOOL UNLESS REQUIRED ELSEWHERE BY THE DEPARTMENT THIS FALL NOT ADVISABLE TO KEEP OVER WINTER.\n\nJ L BRYANT.\nOttawa October 26, 1948.\n\nMr. J.P.B.

Neary Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch.\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Valley River School.\n\nI wired you Saturday night to advise that we had approximately 100 sacks of surplus cement at Valley River School. In case you might wish to use this elsewhere this fall. There may be close to 150 sacks but they were difficult to count as we have the hard wood flooring stored in the shed which covers most of the cement.\n\nMy experience is that cement gets very hard if kept over winter in freezing temperatures. However, if the school basement is really dry which I think it should be it could be stored there. I am advised by several dealers that it would be safer to dispose of it this fall if it is not going to be used. The cement cost us about 90 cents and will readily sell at 1.25 per sack.\n\nWe have had some delays in the construction work due to lack of material and I had to lay off three of the carpenters over a week ago. The insulation and the windows were the chief holdup. However, we got half of the insulation last week with the balance promised in a few days. The windows had to be specially made and these are promised for shipment from Winnipeg tomorrow. The insul brick siding should also arrive this week so there should be no more delays due to lack of material. It would appear now that it will be around November 15th, before the work is fully completed.\n\nI consider Mr. Albert Banville a very competent foreman who thoroughly understands all branches of construction work, and I would recommend that you obtain his services for any other school building you may plan to build next summer. His three sons and a nephew work with him and are all good workmen.\n\nJ. L. Bryant,\nSuperintendent.\nOctober 30, 1948.\n\nMr. J.L. Bryant,\nSupt. of Indian Agency,\nKamsack, Saskatchewan.\n\nValley River Indian Day School.\n\nWe are pleased to note your progress report of October 26th submitted on the construction of the above school.\n\nBy now you will have received our telegram advising you to ship the surplus cement to Mr. Indian Superintendent Booth. This is to be charged to the Little Black Bear funds. Would you please write to Mr. Booth advising him of the actual cost of the cement supplied and also the shipping charges. We can then have reimbursement made to our vote from the Little Black Bear band funds.\n\nThe delays due to the lack of materials are regretted. However, I note that the school should be ready for occupancy on or around November 15th.\n\nA quick search of our files would indicate that no arrangements have yet been made to provide furniture for this school. If this is so, would you please check the attached suggested scale of issue for furniture for teacherages.\n\nYou will know what furniture we have on hand and from the attached list you can prepare a requisition for the remainder required.\nOn October 5th we mailed to the Campbell Heating Company of 701 Portage Avenue, Winnipeg, Manitoba, a plan of the school being erected at Valley River. Apparently, we have had no answer from this company and we would appreciate knowing whether you have been able to obtain any other tenders for the heating unit. I am sending a copy of this letter to Mr. Davis.\n\nWe have noted your comments concerning Mr. Banville. We already have him in mind for the construction of similar schools next year and are pleased to receive your report on his work.\n\nBernard F.

I note that there were no charges included for installation by this firm, see our Voucher No. 1007.\n\nYou have advanced us $3,800.00 for payment of wages etc. and after paying wages up to October 30th, we have on hand $303.05 we will account for all expenditures up to the end of October this week if possible. I have had to purchase some nails, wire etc. as well as pay wages from this advance and regret to advise that a further advance of $200.00 for wages may still be necessary to complete the building, interior painting, and installation of the heating system.\n\nIn regard to the furniture for the teacherage I will prepare a requisition after visiting the school on Friday as I will then be in a better position to know just what will be required. A good size cook stove range will be necessary and arrangements should also be made for a supply of furnace coal. The coal could no doubt be purchased in Grandview or Roblin and delivered by truck to the coal bin. However, there is sufficient seasoned wood on hand to do for a couple of months.\n\nJ. L. Bryant,\nSuperintendent.\nPelly Agency.\n\nP.S. Mr. Banville estimates that he will take until Nov 27th to finish all the work at the school. With Mr. Banville at 15\u00a2 per hour 4 carpenters & 12\u00a2 per hour one or two helpers at 75\u00a2 per hour pay will come approximately $400 per week.\n**REQUISITION FOR CHEQUE**\n\nTO BE USED FOR ADVANCES OR AUTHORIZED PAYMENTS FOR WHICH THERE ARE NO ACCOUNTS\n\nDEPARTMENT: MINES & RESOURCES\nBRANCH: INDIAN AFFAIRS\nDATE: November 8, 1948\n\nAPPLICATION IS HEREBY MADE FOR THE ISSUE OF THE FOLLOWING CHEQUE OR CHEQUES:\n\n| CHEQUE NO. | IN FAVOUR OF | AMOUNT |\n|------------|--------------|--------|\n|            | Pelly Indian Agency Trust Account | $1200.00 |\n\nand send to:\n\nMr. J.L.

Neary Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Valley River School Supplies Cement.\n\nWith reference to your telegram of October 29, I would advise that I shipped 157 sacks of cement to Superintendent F. Booth of Qu'Appelle Agency. This cement was shipped collect to Lottie, Saskatchewan for use of the Black Bear Band.\n\nThis cement cost $89.72 per sack F.O.B. Timberton. Unloading and reloading again cost an additional 10 cents per sack, so the charge to Black Bear Band will be at the rate of $99.72 cents per sack.\n\nI used 15 sacks of the Timberton cement at Cote Day School and also allowed the National Lumber Yards at Timberton to purchase 25 sacks at a time that they urgently required it and we knew we had considerably more than would be required. This firm made every effort to get our building material for the school and it was very difficult to get considerable of the material when it was required.\n\nThe understanding was that they would credit us for the cement when their account was rendered. However, when the account was submitted this was overlooked.\n\nMr. Gowan will be advised of this matter when we turn over all our Valley River accounts and records on Friday of this week and will see that the necessary adjustment is made.\n\nJ. L. Bryant,\nSuperintendent.\nPelly Agency.\nRe: Valley River New Day School\n\nI have visited this school every week with the exception of one since construction started. Mr. Allbright the Assistant, at Valley River Reserve is there almost every day and we feel satisfied that the workmanship has been very satisfactory but I must admit that it has taken more for wages to pay the carpenters and helpers than was expected.\n\nWages are paid up to the week ending November 27, and Mr. Banville and his two sons will still take all this week to complete the finishing work inside. The weekly wage for these three men amounts to $240.00 for 6-10 hour days.\n\nI am turning over Valley River Reserve to Dauphin Agency at the end of November. I have $34.50 on hand which will be returned to you with an accounting for all expenditures since October 31.\n\nThere is also Income Tax deductions outstanding for the weeks ending October 30, to November 27, in the amount of $226.82. It is assumed that you will send the Manitoba Income Tax Director a cheque for this amount when you receive the time sheets. I would also suggest that you send Mr. Wm. Gowan's Superintendent, of Dauphin Agency, a further $400.00 to take care of wages until the job is completed.\n\nThis school has a pleasing appearance on the outside, is well laid out inside and I am sure will be most comfortable for the teacher and pupils.\n\nJ. L. Bryant,\nSuperintendent,\nPelly Agency.\nDecember 3, 1948.\n\nMr. J.L. Bryant,\nSuperintendent, Felly Agency,\nKamsack, Saskatchewan.\n\nRe: Valley River Indian Day School\n\nWe are pleased to note from your letters of November 29 and 30 that satisfactory progress is being maintained in the construction of this school.\n\nWe are sending a copy of this letter to Mr. Gowans and are also sending him an accountable advance of $400.00 to take care of wages until the job is completed.\n\nWe are referring the question of Income Tax deductions to our Chief Treasury Officer.\n\nIt is noted that we will receive a credit from the National Lumber Yards for the twenty-five sacks of cement allotted to them. It would be appreciated if we could have photographs of this school when it is completed. These are most helpful to the Department in future years.\n\nBernard F.

On the completion of the work these tools may be distributed as you think best among the Indians who performed the labour.\n\nThe Department will also consent to the opening of the school after the summer holidays and to the temporary appointment of Annie Clair Rattlemake at a salary of $300.00 per annum, provided a qualified teacher is not available before that date. You will be good enough to make every effort to secure the services of a satisfactory teacher. It is not considered advisable to open the school for the short period intervening between this date and the 30th of June and no doubt the new building will be completed in time for the opening of the school after the holidays.\n\nWhen nearing completion you may purchase 10 double desks, table, two chairs, heating stove and pipes. I may add that the cost of the articles quoted by you appears to be reasonable except in the case of the desks, which are rather\n\nW. G. Blewett, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamsack, Sask.\nhigh. Be good enough to state if this is the best price you can obtain for desks of the style specified and also if the price for the heating stove is reasonable.\n\nA requisition for books and other supplies may be sent in at least a month before the opening of the school. The Department would like to know whether you can purchase hyloplate blackboards at any point there and, if so, at what price.\n\nMention was not made by you in your last letter in regard to the site. The building should be erected on property belonging to the Band. The site should be high and dry and at least one acre should be available in order that a garden may be conducted at a later date. The building operations should be carefully watched to insure good workmanship and a satisfactory structure when completed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of No. 145277/1.\n\nI beg to say that when at Valley River paying Annuity on the 3rd inst. I found that the walls of the School House were up and the Indians are trying to have the whole building finished by the 1st of July. It is on a high and dry site and an acre or more of land will be left for garden or other school wants. I instructed Mr Chard to keep a close watch on the work to have it well done. I gave him a list of the tools and building material allowed and he was to buy them on Saturday last. I am enclosing herewith a list of School Material needed for opening the School as soon as completed. I saw a local dealer at Grandview about Desks and chairs, table &c and find that by sending to Toronto for Desks we can get them for $5.50 or $6.00 each so ordered them from there, it will take a little longer getting them that is all. The same merchant has agreed to get us the hyloplate too for blackboard. I have heard that there is a teacher qualified at Grandview who might take the school I expect to hear from her shortly and will send her application on to the Department for consideration.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume 6298)\n\nFile 631-3, part 1\nCrooked Lake Agency - St. Francis - Carlyle\nRoman Catholic Day School - Teachers' Salaries. 1946\n\nFile 631-5, part 1\nCrooked Lake Agency - St. Francis - Carlyle\nRoman Catholic Day School - Establishment -\nBuilding Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts.\n1945 - 1949\n\nFile 632-1, part 1\nPelly Agency - Valley River Day School -\nTeachers - General Administration. 1895 -\n1896, 1909 - 1927, 1942 - 1947\n\nFile 632-5, part 1\nPelly Agency - Valley River Day School -\nEstablishment - Building Maintenance -\nSupplies - Accounts. 1946 - 1948\n\nFile 632-9, part 1\nPelly Agency - Valley River School - Esta-\nblishment. 1910 - 1910\n\nFile 633-3, part 1\nPelly Agency - Fond du Lac Day School -\nTeachers' Salaries. 1947 - 1947\n\nFile 633-5, part 1\nPelly Agency - Fond du Lac Day School -\nEstablishment - Building maintenance -\nSupplies - Accounts. 1947 - 1949\nOttawa, August 15, 1947.\n\nB.C.

The lake is drying up and ruining the chances of survival by other means than relief doles. The Church, the Hudson's Bay Company and Inspector Ostrander have been trying for several years to get these Indians to move to a more favourable location, preferably to a place called Bull's Head, near Peter Pond Lake, where there are fishing possibilities for farming and hay and the prospect of a road to Lake La Loche. The obstructionist is Chief Alfonse Piapot who is abetted by some of the older people for what are said to be entirely sentimental reasons. It may be that the withdrawal of artificial means of support would convince them that settlement elsewhere is mandatory.\n\nThere is no reason to build a school at the present settlement, but if the Band would move to Bull's Head, construction of a two-room school would be justifiable. Nursing service would be available at La Loche or Ile a la Crosse, 50 miles in either direction.\n\nC.A.F.

Coy's agent (black), Constable Duffy, R.C.M.P. all on 4 April, 1947.\n\nDuring the past winter there were enough Indian children on the spot to fill a two-room school. About $2000 a month was handed out in family allowances. The children speak only the tribal tongue. Across the lake there are about 6 or 8 children who are the province's charge. At Fond du Lac it is definitely our move. We'd need land.\n\nThe H.B. Coy will let us have a building about 24' by 18' which with some fixing up could become an immediate token of our good intentions. It will need some windows added to one side and a good heater.\n\nFreight, including blackboards, desks and classroom expendables should be at Waterways by June 1st. The first barge usually arrives at Fond du Lac during the last week in June.\n\nFor new construction we should begin with a two-room building adaptable for conversion into a four-room school. A nursing station-residence should follow. Meanwhile, the H.B. agent could accommodate one woman teacher. For a man teacher a small \"house\" is available.\n\nThe situation appears to be one which we should exploit without delay. Admittedly the transportation of desks, etc., will be expensive (and we might as well send good ones) but the need for these things will persist and more will likely be required next year.\n\nC.A.F.

If not, have you any suitable heaters in stock which we might buy?\n\n(6) Can you equip the teacherage, if necessary, from your stock of kitchenware and bedroom necessities?\n\n(7) Have you any suggestions regarding the construction and siting of toilets?\n\nThe use of the buildings under discussion is, of course, only a temporary expedient pending design and construction of indicated requirements. Permanent installations can only be built on land to which the Dominion Government holds title. Information concerning the owners and probable prices of suitable sites is desired. An acre of ground is considered necessary. It is hoped eventually to make the best possible educational facilities available to all the children of the settlement.

I hope also that your replacement problem will not result in any inconvenience to your flying in the Northern School Teachers, a month hence. There is a slight touch of self-interest in all this, as it is our intention here to get that school at Fond du Lac going this fall. The supplies are on order to go up on the last boat which is scheduled to leave on the 6th of September, but the Canadian Pacific Air-Lines, if I read their folder correctly, no longer maintain a regular service along the Athabasca Lakes. As you will have to get a teacher into Stony Rapids, I wonder whether we can come to some arrangement, providing, of course, that we are successful in obtaining a teacher for Fond du Lac.\n\nI understand your Traveling Motion Picture Man gave a show in the old building at Fond du Lac which we now have permission to convert to school use, and so we should be able to accommodate most of the Indian and non-Indian children who really want to attend school.\nwhen I was in Edmonton last month, I tried twice to communicate with you by telephone but had no luck. Early next month I am due at Norway House, Manitoba, where the agent is having to charter a plane so that we can collect data on educational needs in North-Eastern Manitoba. It may turn out that I will be in North-Western, Manitoba and North-Eastern Saskatchewan. I will let you know what develops.\n\nYours most sincerely,\n\nG.A.F.

We understand that the only difference between the two desks is that the base on No. 16 extends to the floor.

Walls are to be repaired outside and inside the building banked up with sand, paint will be forwarded from here and the inside will be painted cream which will possibly offset any darkness that might be caused by want of sufficient windows. Two toilets will be erected at a reasonable distance from the school.\n\nAll necessary supplies for this repair work are available at this point, and the labour will be local and mostly Indian. It is hard to estimate the cost as there is no skilled labour available there but Mr Black will supervise.\n\nA supply of wood has already been cut and as this was green wood a larger supply was cut so that there would be some available for the following winter, for this winter green wood will have to be traded with The H.B.Co for dry wood so that at least half green and half dry wood can be used. The approx. cost of this wood is $490.00 or one year's cost approximately $350.00.\n\nI would mention that even if a teacher is available school could not be opened until the school supplies are received there which will about September 15th.\n\nJ.W.

That the Lessee, without prejudice to the Lessor's right to distrain for rent at any time, and to all its rights and remedies, will pay to the Lessor in case any rent hereunder shall at any time remain unpaid, interest upon such rent at the rate of six per cent (6%) per annum from the day for payment thereof to the day of payment thereof.\n\n13. That the Lessee will observe, obey, and conform to and cause his employees to observe, obey and conform to reasonable rules and regulations made from time to time by the Lessor with regard to the management, use or occupation of the demised property.\n\n14. That no waiver on behalf of the Lessor of any breach of any of the covenants, provisions, conditions or stipulations herein contained, whether express or implied, or negative or positive in form, shall take effect or be binding upon the Lessor unless the same is in writing under the authority of the Lessor, and any waiver so expressed shall extend only to the particular breach so waived and shall not limit or affect the Lessor's rights with respect to any other or future breach.\n\n15. That in case the Lessor should sell or agree to sell or require for any purpose the demised property during the term of this lease, it may at its option forthwith give notice thereof to the Lessee, and in such case this lease shall cease and be at an end following the giving of such notice.\n\n16.

In the event of the total destruction, damage or failure of the demised property by fire, cyclone, tempest, decay or any other cause, or such partial destruction, damage or failure as in the judgment of the Lessor does not warrant the repairing or rebuilding of it, the Lessor may within thirty days after such destruction, damage or failure give notice to the Lessee terminating this lease.\n\n17. That any elevator, loading platform, service room, passage, lane or yard connected with the demised property is for the use of all the occupants of the property of the Lessor to which the same is appurtenant, and the Lessee will not obstruct nor hinder the use of same by the Lessor, its employees, agents, customers or tenants.\n\n18.

That the Lessor shall not be responsible for any defect in or change of conditions affecting the demised property, nor for any damage to any person or to merchandise, goods, chattels, machinery or equipment contained therein howsoever caused.\n\n21. That if the Lessor shall be unable to deliver possession of the demised property at the commencement of the term of this lease, neither the Lessor nor its agents shall be liable for any loss or damage caused thereby, nor shall this lease be void or voidable, nor the date of the expiration of same be changed by reason thereof, but in such event the Lessee shall only be liable for rent at the rate hereby reserved from such time as the Lessor shall be able to deliver possession of the demised property.\n\n22. That if the Lessee should hold over, and the Lessor should accept rent after the expiration of the said term, the new tenancy thereby created shall be a tenancy from month to month, and not a tenancy from year to year, and shall be subject to the covenants and conditions herein contained so far as the same are applicable to a tenancy from month to month.\n\n23. That if the term hereby granted shall at any time be seized or taken in execution or attachment by any creditor of the Lessee, or if the Lessee shall make any assignment for the benefit of creditors, or become bankrupt or insolvent, or shall take the benefit of any Act that may be in force for bankrupt or insolvent debtors, then three months' rent shall thereupon become due and payable, and this lease and all rights and privileges hereby granted shall, at the option of the Lessor, cease and be at an end, notwithstanding anything to the contrary.\n\n24. That in case of default in the payment of the said rent or any part thereof, for thirty days after the same should have been paid, or in case of the breach or non-observance or non-performance on the part of the Lessee of any covenant, proviso, condition, restriction or stipulation herein contained, whether express or implied, which ought to be observed or performed by the Lessee, and which has not been waived by the Lessor, the Lessor may cancel this lease by written notice to the lessee, or in case of an approved assignment by written notice to the assignee (or in case of the death of the Lessee or the assignee and no personal representative being appointed to the estate of the deceased in the Province in which the demised property is situate within six months after such death, then the Lessor may cancel this lease without any notice by cancelling the same in its books), and in any of such cases all rights and interests hereby created or then existing in favor of the Lessee or any assignee or assignees or derived under this lease shall thereupon cease and determine, and the Lessor may re-enter into and upon the demised property (or any part thereof in the name of the whole) and to have again, repossess and enjoy the same as of its former estate, anything herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding. Provided, nevertheless, that in case of any such cancellation or re-entry the Lessee shall continue to be liable to pay and the Lessor shall have the same remedy for the recovery of any rent then due or accruing due as if this lease had not been cancelled but remained in full force and effect, and moreover that any right of action of the Lessor against the Lessee in respect of any antecedent breach of any of the said covenants, provisions, conditions, restrictions or stipulations shall not thereby be prejudiced.\n\n25. That any notice to be given to the Lessee hereunder may be given on behalf of the Lessor by the Manager or acting Manager of the Land Department of the Lessor, or by any agent or solicitor acting for the Lessor, and may be personally served on the Lessee or mailed in a registered envelope addressed to the Lessee at the post office for the district in which the demised property is situate, or at the last or usual place of abode or business of the Lessee, or in the case of an approved assignment by the Lessee of any\nrights and privileges hereby granted or any interest therein, any notice to be given by the Lessor to the assignee may be given on behalf of the Lessor by any such officer or agent as aforesaid, and may be personally served on the assignee or mailed in a registered envelope addressed to the assignee at the address mentioned in the assignment or at the last or usual place of abode or business of the assignee and in the event of any such notice being mailed in such registered envelope, it shall be deemed to be given to the party to whom it is addressed at the time of such registration, and any notice to be given by the Lessee or an approved assignee to the Lessor shall be signed by the Lessee or approved assignee giving such notice, and shall be personally served on the Manager or Acting Manager of the Land Department of the Lessor at the said City of Winnipeg, or mailed in a registered envelope addressed to the Manager of the Land Department of the Lessor at Winnipeg.\n\nTHE LESSOR covenants with the Lessee that the Lessee paying the rent hereby reserved and performing the covenants hereinbefore on the part of the Lessee contained shall and may peaceably possess and enjoy the rights and privileges hereby granted without any interruption or disturbance from the Lessor whatever, subject as aforesaid.\n\nWhere the context permits the expression \"the Lessee\" herein includes the Lessee and the executors, administrators, successors and assigns of the Lessee, and the expression \"the Lessor\" includes the Lessor and its successors and assigns, and all the words which import the singular number shall be construed as applied to each and every person, and a corporation, named as the Lessee, and in case there are two or more Lessees, the covenants, provisions, conditions, restrictions, and stipulations herein contained on the part of the Lessee shall be construed to be several as well as joint.\n\nThe Lessee doth hereby accept this lease of the demised property to be held by him as tenant and subject to the conditions, restrictions, reservations, stipulations, provisions and covenants above set forth.\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF the Lessor and Lessee have executed these presents in triplicate this day of\n\nSIGNED by the above named\nThe Governor and Company of Adventurers of England trading into Hudson's Bay, the Lessor,\nin the presence of\n\nSIGNED, SEALED AND DELIVERED\nby the above named Lessee in\nthe presence of\n\nL.479-300-2-37.\n\nIndian Affairs.

For example it\nwould not be possible for a pupil who entered on October 1, 1945,\nto attend as many days as a pupil who entered on September 1, 1945,\nprovided they both remained in attendance until June 30, 1946. In\ncalculating the totals under the above headings ignore absences due\nto causes which did not involve permanent withdrawal, e.g., illness,\nattending a funeral (unless the whole class was dismissed), being\nkept at home to work, etc. That is to say, ignore absences when the\nschool was in operation and available for use so far as the school\nauthorities were concerned. This is the meaning of \"possible atten-\ndance\" for present purposes.\n\nSignature of teacher\n\nPlease note that FORM C asks for the POSSIBLE ATTENDANCE while FORM\nB asks for the ACTUAL ATTENDANCE.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Stewart, dated 5 inst.,\nregarding provision of more desks.\n\nThe school has 28 desks. The classroom is\nonly about 24' by 18'. They seem to have\nlittle enough space already. With desks so\nexpensive and in short supply we might\nrather consider the adoption of a part-\ntime schedule.\n\nThe age-grade distribution for last term\nmakes me think that attendance was on a\nselective basis. Perhaps it would be better to\ngive a 100% part-time coverage rather than\nto cram them all in all day or allow\nsome to avoid school completely.\n\nC.A.V. Clark\nColonel Henry:\n\nFond du Lac Teacherage - furnishings:\nReference to agent's telegram:\n\n1. At the present one linoleum rug should suffice (9'x12')\n2. The studio couch (\"sofa\") to replace \"bed only.\"\n3. A kitchen table and three kitchen chairs would be more appropriate to the set-up than the buffet table, etc.\n4. An axe has already been provided.\n5. Coal should not be needed much.\n6. You have little pillows. I urge that an exception be made (similarly to N.W.T.) and that bedding be purchased from local H.B. post. As the Hudson's Bay Company's co-operation is a factor, purchases from them either at Edmonton or Fond du Lac might well be as large as from other sources.\n7.

Here I would refer you to your radiogram of August 19th authorizing repair work of $300.00, this was to repair upstairs of school for teachers quarters. The orders for these supplies were mostly cancelled but this order was shipped so promptly that it was impossible for it to be cancelled. These supplies are at Fond Du Lac at present, and are complete, and will be available either for there or some other school.\n\nJ.W.

F. Neary, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: Teacherage - Fond du Lac, Athabasca Indian Agency.\n\nFurther to my letter of July 25th and with reference to your Army Message of July 20th re the above.\n\nAttached please find requisition in triplicate supported by quotation received from the Hayward Lumber Co. Limited, Edmonton, Alberta, covering materials in the amount of $2351.90 which they consider will be necessary to finish the proposed new teacherage at Fond du Lac.\n\nAlso attached is a letter received from the Hayward Lumber Company. The door and window frames can easily be made up on the job. I would certainly recommend the installation of the Selkirk prefabricated chimney. With regard to finishing on the outside of the building, the natural log finish will be sufficient.\n\nI hope the information we have given you will enable you to place an order with the Hayward Lumber Co. The shipment should go forward as soon as possible in August. A copy of this letter with a list of the materials is being sent to Mr. Stewart.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies\n\nPer\n\nRFB: IDF\nEncs.\nHAYWARD'S LUMBER CO. LIMITED\n\nP.O. Box 459,\nEDMONTON, Alberta,\nJuly 26, 1949.\n\nMr. G. H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor,\nIndian Agencies,\n507 Public Building,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAttached hereto please find estimated quotation on materials required for Teacherage at Fond du Lac, Saskatchewan, as requested by Mr. J. W. Stewart, Superintendent of Fort Chipewyan in his letter of July 21st.\n\nThere are one or two things about this quotation which we would like to draw to your attention. The first is that Mr. Stewart informs us that the walls are to be of log construction but he does not mention how thick these walls are. We have taken it for granted that they will be about seven inches thick and if they are less than that or more than that, then there will have to be some changes made in the window and door jams. Also we note that he asked us to quote on the window and door frames. We did not do this, as delivery on frames at the present in Edmonton is very bad and we have therefore listed materials required to make these up and you can have the carpenter do this on the job, which will save you money and besides give you good service.\n\nThe next thing we would like to draw to your attention is the fact that we quoted on our Selkirk prefabricated chimney for this job as it will be more economical than shipping bricks and lime etc. into Fond du Lac. A couple of labourers can easily install this chimney in a few hours. It is a very good chimney and we are shipping quite a number of these to the North West Territories at the present time. We enclose herewith literature which we have on these chimneys.\n\nMr. Stewart indicates in his letter that he wished this material to be shipped with the least possible delay. Therefore if we are successful in getting this business we will appreciate having your reply so that we can have this material prepared for shipping.\n\nWe note from the schedule we have on hand that the last boat leaves for Fond du Lac on September 4th and we should have a little time at least in which to get materials prepared for shipment. We do not think there is anything on this bill of material that we cannot supply on fairly short notice. The windows would no doubt have to be made in our factory here or possibly some of them and this would take about one weeks time to manufacture. Outside of this item the balance of the material is all in Waterways at the present time.\n\nThere is also one other thing. Mr. Stewart did not mention in his letter what he wanted to put on the outside of the building and therefore we were unable to quote on this. We are in a position to offer you Insul-brick Siding, Cedar Siding or Spruce Drop Siding whichever you might require. If you decide to put any of these materials on the building, we would only be too pleased to quote you on them.\nIt has been rather difficult for us to quote very accurately on the materials required for this building in view of the fact that the plan which we received was not any too clear. However, we feel that you have more than enough material listed on this quotation to do the job should you decide to go ahead with it. We can assure you that we will do our utmost to have the material shipped as quickly as possible after receiving your order.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nHAYWARD'S LUMBER CO. LIMITED\n\n(sgd) L. A. Carbert\n\nLloyd A.

Father Gamache informed him when he paid Treaty at Fond du Lac in June that he is not prepared to continue to teach the day school. It will be necessary therefore to find another teacher.\n\nThere is no accommodation for a teacher and an item of $5,000 was included in the estimates to build a teacherage. The season is now so far advanced that it would be next to impossible to bring in much building material or erect a frame building. Therefore I suggested to Mr. Stewart that he investigate the possibilities of building a two-room log house, using Indian labour to get out logs and employ qualified Indians or Metis to erect it.\n\nHe is going there to investigate a report that the Indians are destitute and will arrange for the construction of this building if he finds that logs can be readily secured and labour to construct the building is available. Furthermore, this will give much needed employment to these Indians. He stated that he could obtain the necessary finishing material from McMurray. The cost of such a building should be considerably less than $5,000 and should be quite comfortable for a single person or a married couple. Immediate action was necessary and I hope you approve.\n\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies\nFT. CHIPPEWYAN AUG. 3\n\nB.F.

I was disappointed to find that the whole band was against having a school opened on the Reserve. One man did say that if a school was opened, he would send his children, but as the others were against it he had no more to say. The Indians of this band are in many ways a fine body of men that one can't help feeling could be made into successful farmers if they could be got to settle down. They are very independent and I think that the real underlying objection to a school is a fear that by accepting it they would in some way part with some of their freedom.\n\nThe question must stand until a Farmer is placed on the reserve. He may, after a time, by judicious tact overcome their prejudices.\nSir,\n\nI have to bring to your notice that Farmer Hamilton of the Nut Lake Reserve in making his report states that those Indians who have children, are anxious to have a school established for them.\n\nI understand that at the last Treaty payment this request was made by them to the late Agent, and when visiting the reserve during the winter Farmer Hamilton as well as one of the Indians spoke about the matter, but as our time was fully occupied we did not go into details.\n\nFor the Department's guidance, it would appear that there are upward of 50 children of school age, all of whom, like the rest of the band are Pagans, and I fancy there is only one or two who can speak English. As you are aware the Reserve is about 40 miles from Wadena on the main line of the Canadian Northern, and in the past the band have lived by hunting. During the past few years the whole of this country has been settled up, with the exception of a strip to the north for about 30 miles. It is expected that the Thunder Hill branch of the C.N.R will pass near the reserve, in which case the bands hunting grounds would to a large extent be closed. This matter of hunting with the Nut Lake people is a most difficult one, and as the country gets more settled up these hunting disputes are likely to become more numerous, and it would be to their interests to do as much as possible to enable the younger men to get a living from their farming operations. At present they are farming in a small way, the drawback being the distance to haul their grain, they are however making more of a success with their cattle, as there is a large quantity of hay.\naround the reserve and lake. At the same time also when they find themselves hemmed in by the settlers, unless they can obtain a living from their farms the rationing of so large a band is likely to be on the increase.\n\nUnder these circumstances the establishment of a school is a matter that might have consideration. It has been found that the school in some cases keeps the people from wandering about the country so much, which to a small extent keeps them on the farm. During the settling up of the country it would be wrong, as well as expensive, to allow the young men to grow up with only their hunting abilities to depend on for a living. There are one or two young men here on the Beardys reserve who are a continue worry to themselves, and everyone in a small way. They are never settled. Also the Nut Lake men cannot speak English, which is a difficulty, as the younger men cannot hire out with the neighbouring farmers so easily as those who know what his employer is talking about, and in a year or two the whole of the reserve will be surrounded by white people.\n\nI understood from Mr Swinford that when he was Agent at Touchwood many years ago, and had charge of this band, these people were almost wild and very troublesome; if this is so their request for a school goes along way to show that in having a Farmer with them, and what little contact they have had with the white settlers, they are beginning to realize that it is a good thing for the children to receive education, also it might be the means of their giving up their Pagan belief in years to come. At the same time they are so very touchy that the whole matter would depend, as far as success goes, on the teacher.\n\nIt would be absolutely necessary to have someone who has had experience in Indian schools, however I expect the matter will come up next time I visit the reserve, and I would be glad of any suggestions the Department might make, that I could place before these people if they question me on the matter.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

There would now be no serious objection to it on the part of the Indians, who, I believe would for the most part willingly send their children. And it could be so located that 30 children of school age would be within 1\u00bd miles of it, as the Indians are located at present.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n(Signed) F.J. Chisholm,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\n\nPrince Albert,\nApril 16th 1913.\nDear Sir,\n\nI was appointed to the above reserve by the Rev. J. Ferrier of the Brandon Industrial School to work amongst the Indians as Teacher and Missionary, he having received your consent to begin work here, in a letter dated from Ottawa April 28/13.\n\nWhen I arrived here the Farm Instructor, Mr. Hamilton, said that he had not received any such information as above, and would not allow me to work on the Reserve as Teacher until he had received the consent of the Agent, or word from the Duck Lake Indian agent, who has charge of this Reserve.\nHe received information last Friday, &c., so he says, to the effect that the Court will allow missionary work on the Res., but teaching the children is still under consideration, which is directly contradictory to the copy of the letter which I received from Rev. J. Ferrier, which he received from you, and you say, \"If you could open a day school, we would assist.\"\n\nThere is some mistake somewhere, &c., I would like to know the truth concerning the matter.\n\nHas Mr. Hamilton, the Farm Instructor, any right to interfere with an appointment of this kind, and did you give consent to the Rev. J. Ferrier to open school work on the above Reserve? Will you please answer these questions?\n\nI have been here now two months & have not been able to do any work on the Reserve owing to Mr. Hamilton objecting, because he has not received any information.\nrespecting the appointment.\n\nWhich I heard with Rev. J. Ferrier,\nhe said that the government paid\nfor the teaching & the church for\nthe preaching work. What does the\ngovernment pay for the teaching per\nmonth?\n\nWill you please reply as soon as\npossible to my letter, so that I may\nknow where to stand.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Rev.) Geo.

Sir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo in reference to your work as missionary and teacher on the Nut Lake Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that on May 9th, last, the Department informed the Indian Agent that it had no objection to your working among these Indians, but no action was to be taken to erect any buildings without the consent of the Band and the authority of the Department. The Farm Instructor will now be written to direct.\n\nWith regard to the salary allowed teachers I may say that this depends upon the qualifications and ranges from $400.00 upwards.\n\nBe good enough to let the Department know if you are at the present time conducting a school and if so what accommodation there is. In reply to your inquiry I may state that the Department did not as yet give its formal consent to the opening of a school, but is prepared to do so if conditions warrant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

Goodson's working among the Indians on the Nut Lake Reserve as teacher and missionary. Until the Department has information respecting the conditions it is not possible to make a grant for the school work, but will do so if conditions are favourable. The only restriction made by the Department was that no action was to be taken to erect any buildings without the consent of the band and the authority of the Department.

I have at present sufficient seats for the children and am working with chalk & slates, which is so far satisfactory.\n\nI have now 11 names on my register.\n\nIt is rather difficult to one would wish, owing to the system of camping which they adopt, at present there are no less than 5 or 6 different camping places, & it\nIt is impossible for me to be in 6 places at the same time seeing that I'm not infinite.\n\nThe children are attending school and very bright & anxious to learn. I am not in a position at present to say whether it would be advisable to build a school or not, but will be able to tell later how things might be.\n\nI would be very pleased if you would send me several things which I am needing.\n\nThese Indians are Saulteaux, therefore would need books suitable for them. 12 feet / 12 Books / Box of crayons / 12 copy books / 12 Slates / Box pencils / Lesson cards / Biscuits / Blackboard / Football.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Goodson,\nNut Lake Indian Reserve,\nPerigoosk P.O., Sask.\nPRINCE ALBERT, SASK.\nAugust 4, 1913.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI address this letter to you as instructed, and I ask your assistance and advice towards obtaining my request. It is a matter of such importance that I would ask you to bring it before the Minister of Indian Affairs at the earliest possible opportunity, and also to see that the matter is not dropped after it is opened up.\n\nMy work and the work of my missionaries among our Indians gives us the opportunity of learning their state, their needs, their desires, in a way that you will rarely learn from your Indian Agents and Instructors. I beg therefore, to press upon your Dept. the pressing need of Day Schools as follows; (among others perhaps not mentioned) I am sure the I.D. knows of the non-existence of such schools and of the desire of the Indians to have them, and perhaps the I.D. has been considering the matter. But I would press for the building and maintaining of these schools almost immediately. (1) The Indians are retrograding and suffering for the lack (2) It does not seem in accordance with \"Treaty\" to leave them without. (3) They desire and ask for them. I cannot be sure of correct names, but I think what I write is sufficient to point them out correctly.\n\n1.- Frog Lake, Nos. 121 and 122, but especially Conceptionwhao (121) We have worked here for years, but there has been no school. They sent a few children to Onion Lake Boarding School. They will no longer do so as they want the day school system. I have sent a Cree teacher there Ch. Quinaly, an intelligent educated man (half breed) I think), to open school as best he can in his own house, or\nin the Indian houses. I have to build a house for him. This is not fair to the Church funds which are not meant for schools. I beg to apply (1) for his salary, (2) for purchase of the residence for him (3) for a school to be built (4) for an improved day school to be maintained.\n\nN.B.- I would recommend the closing of Onion Lake school as hearing school and opening it as improved day school.\n\n2.- Island Lake Band Nos. 161 and 161A.\n\nWe visit them and hold service there. They belong to our Church more than to any other. They come in at times to Onion Lake Church. They should have a school and we are prepared to undertake it on the usual terms.\n\n3.- Thunderchild Band. South from Bright Land Lake.\n\nIt is really a shame that the I.D. has (I believe) given them no school or teacher since they were moved to this location. My missionary visits them, but only too rarely since they were moved so far away from his other bands. They should have a good improved day school. The Church of England should be intrusted with its management.\n\n4.- Nut Lake Band No. 90.\n\nNothing in this line has ever been done for them. Settlers are now closing in round them and they need and desire a day school. This ought to be given them without delay.

Indian reserves) if if house and decent salary is forthcoming.\n\nKinistino.\n5.- Kinistino Band, No. 91,\n\nNothing has ever been done by Church or State for this band. They are heathen still.

They should have, each, a day school for the little ones. They would form capital feeders for the Lac la Ronge and the Pas (when we get it) Boarding schools.\n\nI should be glad to learn what the I.D. will do, and what I, or my missionaries, can do to hasten matters.\n\nI beg to remain\n\nYours faithfully\n\nSgd. J.A. Newnham,\nBishop of Saskatchewan.\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of July 15th. Therein you say that the Department has decided to make a grant of $400 for the work for annum. I was hired by the Rev. T. Ferrie in April with the understanding that I was to receive $2 for every teaching day, which is equal to $50 per month paid by the Department, & my expenses paid by the Methodist Church. This of course has nothing to do with your support, because that I was hired by the Rev. T. Ferrie, but merely to hold\nI am sorry to say that the articles for which I sent will be too late to be of any use, seeing that my time expires the end of Aug. I came here at the beginning of April for 5 months. I should very much like to stay longer, but I cannot, because I must return to my home land by the beginning of Sept. I am very much interested in the work, & think there is a good future for some of these Indian children. One boy who has been at the school only 3 weeks, is about 8 yrs. old, knows well at least 60 different things in English. The one discouraging\nfeature about this work is the carelessness of the parents in respect to the attendance of the children at school. They are roaming from one place to another nearly all the time. I have spoken to them about sending their children to school, but it seems nearly useless. I suppose in time they will see the necessity of it. The convenience at present is not good for teaching. I have an Indian house, where, of course, not having desks, I cannot put the children to work which I should like to do; yet I believe at present the conditions do not warrant the opening of a school on the reserve. After carefully studying the system, & reading the Indian Blue Book report, it seems to me that\nthe best method to deal with the Indians is to send them to an Industrial School, then at Idle Hills (from the graduates) into a Colony by themselves.\n\nI am afraid the returns will not be very satisfactory to you, but you will understand that this is the first attempt on this Reserve with school work.\n\nI came the beginning of April, the Indians were away hunting until about the end of May, at the same time I could not begin work owing to the Farm Instructor not having received information concerning my appointment. I began to teach school June 3rd which lasted for 8 weeks with an attendance of from 6 to 8. Then the...\nleft for Touchwood (forts 30 & 50) some way, then went to Madina (forts 8) after wards had the treaty & pow-wow, this taking up three weeks when no one attended school. After that Little Cree was so very anxious for his children's education joined his house again & his children, & sometime another one or two would come. It has been now opened 3 more weeks, & hope it will continue so until I leave at the end of August, but the probability is, with a fair weather, they will be away again for a week or two. My address will be in the future, to which I wish you to send all communications.\nWishing you every success in your work.\n\nI remain,\n\nYour sincerely,\n\nGeo. Woodman.\nOttawa, August 22, 1913.\n\nRev.

No. 350369/1 re payment of Mr. Goodson for his services at Nut Lake.

(RG 10, Volume 6299, file 634-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nWhile at Nut Lake I found a student, I think of the Methodist church, supposedly teaching school there. I understand he was there nearly two months under pay from the Government before the Department knew of his appointment. He had been sent to that point by Mr. Ferries of Brandon without the knowledge or consent of the Department. I found him living in the house of \"Little Cree\" where he was supposedly teaching school. The house is a little bit of a shanty about 18 X 14, in it there lived about ten people and the dogs. I found this young fellow about two o'clock in the afternoon in his stocking feet, holes in the slack of his pants, no coat and with the appearance of not having washed or combed his hair for a week. I think myself he was having an afternoon nap.\n\nHe told me he had two pupils, children of \"Little Cree\", a little boy and girl, neither of whom as far as I could find out knew B from a bull's foot. Teaching of some kind is certainly necessary on this reserve but it is absolutely necessary that it should be undertaken by one qualified to teach and under the guidance and auspices of the Department. There are dozens of children on this reserve who are of school age and who would be benefitted by having among them a proper teacher. Take for instance the family of the Indian who was burned in the Farm Instructor's house trying to save the books of the Agency. There are 12 children left by him divided among his widows, at least 7 of these I think are of school age. The young school teacher there I would say was absolutely unfitted for the position and the work, though his aspirations are of the best.\nKnowing the language I could hear the remarks made by Indians regarding him and they were not very flattering. You can understand if a man has not the regard and respect of the Indians he can be of little use among them. I bring this to your attention with the hope that before another spring arrangements may be made after consulting with the Inspector in charge of that district and the Farm Instructor to have a school of some kind properly run on this reserve.\n\nYours &c.,\n[Signature]\nChief Inspector.\n\nPlease don't take my remarks re the clothing of the young man derogatory to him as a man but only as applying to him as a teacher, who by example should be a lesson to those people among whom he is teaching.\nOttawa, December 26, 1913.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nAs you will recollect, on your nomination, Mr. George Goodson, a student at Wesley College, was appointed by the Department as teacher of the school at But Lake during the summer months. During the time that Mr. Goodson was there the reserve was visited by the Chief Inspector of Indian Agencies, who, in a subsequent report, informed the Department of conditions as he found them. He states that school was held in a shanty 18 x 14, in which there lived some ten people. It was two o'clock in the afternoon when the Inspector went to the building where the school was supposed to be held and found the teacher in his stocking feet, carelessly clad and appearing as if he had not performed his ablutions for sometime. To all appearance the teacher had been having an afternoon nap. There were only two pupils at\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nthe school and these were the children of the Indian whose house was supposedly being used as the school-room.\n\nWhen the attention of the Department was first drawn to the necessity of a school on this reserve, the wisdom of giving it a trial was not questioned. I think you will admit, however, that if any good is to come from the school work it must necessarily depend upon the interest taken by those placed in charge. Much effort may be needed to influence these people and bring them to realize the benefits that will accrue to their children from an education, and it will require the services of devoted and zealous servants, imbued themselves with a desire to improve and elevate the standard of these people.\n\nShould a school be conducted next year, the Department will have to be assured of the competency and earnestness of the teacher before it will be prepared to make an outlay such as was made this year for salary, etc. It would appear evident that Mr. Goodson did not gain the respect of the Indians, without which, of course, his efforts, if he made any, could bear no fruit.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(AS) A.D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, January 7, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th ultimo reporting upon the condition in which you found the school at Nut Lake.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Rev. Mr. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, has been written to in regard to the manner in which the school is being carried on by Mr. Goodson. Mr. Ferrier has also been informed that should the school be continued next year the Department will have to be assured of the competency and earnestness of the teacher before it will be prepared to make any outlay for salary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The Inspector in charge of that Reserve and the Farm Instructor should be asked their views in regard to what is best to be done for the education of the children on that Reserve, and an incompetent young man should not be placed there to draw salary without the knowledge of the Inspector, the Farm Instructor or even the Department as was done in this case.\n\nYours &c.,\n\n[Signature]\nChief Inspector.\nJanuary 21, 1914.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, addressed to the Secretary, with reference to the appointment of Mr. Goodson as teacher at Butte Lake. In reply I wish to correct your impression that this appointment was made without the knowledge of the Department, as the matter was discussed between myself and a representative of the Methodist Church in Ottawa before any action was taken. Mr. Goodson arrived on the reserve before the Agent was advised by the Department for the reason that the name of the teacher had not been submitted before that time.\n\nI may say that the establishment of this school had been before the Department since 1909 and several of our officers had reported.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGlen Campbell, Esq.,\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nI have the honour to inform you that while at Nut Lake reserve making the annuity payments last week, I met Mr. W.G. Challis late of Wesley College, Winnipeg, Man., who is on the reserve teaching school, having been sent there by Rev' J. Ferrier principal of the Brandon Industrial school.\n\nMr. Challis does not know whether the Department are granting him any renumeration for his services, and I not having had a single word of correspondence on the matter was unable to tell him whether the Department would or not.\n\nAccording to Farmer Hamilton's diary, Mr. Challis arrived at Nut Lake on June 24th last and started school on July 6th, and has been teaching since. The attendance, Mr. Challis informed me is rather low as a large number of the children are out digging Seneca roots with their parents.\n\nI would be greatly obliged if the Department would inform me what is to be done in the matter, that I may in turn inform Mr. Challis.\n\nWill Mr. Challis receive a grant?\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 13th, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant with regard to Mr. W.G.

My idea is that pupils should be sent from this reserve to Boarding schools where they can be kept till they do learn something. After a time when ex-pupils come back to the reserve and mix up with their people, the young children are certain to remark them, and this will create among them a desire to learn English and go to school.\n\nI am certain that there would be no trouble in recruiting pupils from this reserve. One young girl has already made known her desire to go to a Boarding school.\n\nMr. Hamilton, the Farmer remarked this to the Inspector and I was greatly surprised at his answer, which was, \"The Department won't stand for that\". I would ask the Department what their view on the matter is.\n\nShould I encourage the recruiting of pupils for Boarding schools on this reserve or not?\n\nAs regards a day school, I cannot recommend the building of one at present; The Indians ask for a school where they can\n\nleave -----\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\f\nWesley College,\nWinnipeg,\nOct. 2nd. 1914.\n\nMr. Schmidt\nIndian Agent\nDuck Lake Agency\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nEnclosed please find report ending Sept. 30th, which I think you will find correct.\n\nRe the days in June (June 24th to 30th) during which school was open but during which there was no attendance.

He is being paid at the rate of $60.00 per month and a cheque for $192.00, being payment in full for his services to the 30th of September, is being sent to the Treasurer of the Methodist Missionary Society, Toronto.

Mr. Agent Schmidt, in his report on this school, stated that in his opinion it would be a great task ever to make a day school on this reserve a success and he recommended that the pupils on this reserve should be sent to boarding schools where they would have an opportunity to learn something. He states that there would be no trouble in recruiting pupils from there. The Department has tried the experiment of a summer school on this reserve for two years and in 1913, under the Rev. Mr. Goodson, the attendance did not average one for the time the school was in\nin operation.\n\nI do not think the Department would be justified in re-opening this school next summer, as the only one likely to benefit by so doing is Mr. Challice.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I was ignorant of this; had I known I would have had more children attend school last summer.\n\nThere is not an Indian father living on this reserve that ever attended a school; so you can readily understand their objections to sending away their children to school. Since reading the Regulations I see no reason why a lot of the children of this Band should not be gathered up and sent to a Boarding School.\n\nAll the children of school age are pagan, with one exception No. 116 his wife is a Christian, one of her children was baptized, we have ten or twelve children of school age or thereabouts, No. 81 is very seldom on the reserve; she went with the trappers doing nothing should be done at once for these children. No. 76 has six of school age, these children would be far better in School. We have about sixty children of school age.\n\nThis band is scattered 60% of them is away in winter hunting & trapping.

Ferrier.\nSir,\n\nI beg to report to the Department that I have just returned from a visit to the Nut Lake Reserve and when there at a meeting of the Indians who were present on the reserve I impressed upon them the desire of the Department that they send their children to school. I have informed them that they have a choice of schools to which they may send their children and at each of the schools their children will not only be taught to read and write English but they will also be given a practical training in general housekeeping, soil culture and the care of stock. I have made an earnest effort during the past year to overcome the objection of the members of this band to education. Have pointed out the fact that their hunting grounds are being rapidly settled up and it will only be a matter of a short period of time until they will of necessity be compelled to abandon their present mode of making a living and they will then have to make their living by cultivating the soil and that they are not doing their duty to their children if they do not embrace the opportunity afforded by our schools of equipping their children with the education and training so necessary in the management of their business and which will enable them to become self supporting, self respecting and useful citizens.\n\nThere are at present about seventy children of School age belonging to the Nut Lake Band and only two\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDep't Of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa.\nof this number are now attending school.\n\nThey are a fine, healthy looking lot of children. The members of this Band make their living chiefly by hunting and trapping. They practice their aboriginal beliefs and are very much under the influence of their Medicine men who are opposed to education or any movement which would have the effect of weakening their influence over the Band.\n\nI find also that this Band have a grievance owing to the fact that they have no Chief or Councillors and that none have been appointed since the death of the old Chief Yellow Quill. I stated to them over a year ago that if they would select a Chief and Councillors I would forward their request to the Department for consideration. They however have not been able to agree on a selection and I would suggest that one of the deceased Chief's sons named Kenewase No.85. be temporarily appointed Chief by the Department.\n\nThis man agrees if so appointed to immediately send two of his children to school and to assist me in inducing the Indians of his band to carry out the regulations of the Department.\n\nI will be glad to know at an early date if the Department will make the appointment as the Indians will very shortly depart from the reserve on their fall and winter hunt and it will be a difficult matter to get in touch with them.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, October 29, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to that portion of your letter of the 21st instant in regard to the education of the children on the Nut Lake Reserve I beg to say that the Department is not prepared at the present time to re-open the school there.\n\nWhen you again visit this reserve you should do all in your power to induce the Indians to send their children to one of the residential schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

He notes that no educational facilities are provided for these Indians, or means of religious instruction. He expresses the opinion that they are much in need of both, and states that he would be willing to put up a small building on the Reserve, and spend a few days each week in teaching them if the Department will bear part of the expense.\n\nI have merely acknowledged Mr. Ward's letter, and stated that the matter has been referred to you, and I shall be glad to have from you an expression of your views as to the desirability of accepting Mr. Ward's suggestion.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nM. M. GRAHAM,\nIndian Commissioner\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOctober 26th, 1921.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, mentioning the request of Mr. John A. Ward that he be given some assistance for the purpose of erecting a day school on the Nut Lake Reserve.\n\nWe realize the need of educational facilities at this point. There are approximately 60 physically fit children of school age on this Reserve, and it appears that there are only 4 receiving any schooling (1 at Brandon and 3 at Lebret).\n\nThe Superintendent of Indian Education reports that Mr. Agent Hardinge believes there is a good opening here for a missionary teacher, and that it is a C. of E. cause. The latest figures available show that the majority of the Band are pagan.\n\nBefore taking any action, the Department should know Mr. Ward's denomination and whether or not he is already in the employ of a church as missionary. You might also secure further information as to where the teacher would live, for the town of Kelvington, Sask., is 13 miles from the nearest part of the Nut Lake Reserve. Mr. Agent Hardinge might be instructed to ascertain if the plan advocated by Mr. Ward is acceptable and if this gentleman has the confidence of the Band.\n\nMr. Ward states, \"he would be willing to put up a small building on the Reserve, and spend a few days each week teaching them if the Department will bear part of the expense.\" You might ascertain the exact nature of this building and what grant and salary, if any, would be expected.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nKelvington,\nDecr. 7th. 1921.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nDear Sir,\n\nAn Agent of Indian Affairs called the other day to see me in reference to the Nut Lake Indian Reserve work about which I wrote you last October. He spoke about a school on the Reserve. I have a certificate for teaching, and would be willing to move on the Reserve if I had a house to live in. We would also require to put up a small school, which could be used as a Church for the time being. I think that the Church would later put up a building. I think with logs which are on the Reserve we could put up a house and school for $800.00 or $1000.00.\n\nWith reference to my salary, I would need to be there the five regular teaching days I think to give the best results. I have five years experience in teaching, and salaries for experienced teachers run from $14 to $1800. It would require special work and care to get them started, and to manage them, and I think $1700 would be a reasonable salary for the year with the regulation holidays. I would undertake the mission work among the older ones under the Anglican Church or the Methodist Church, of which I am a Minister, as you decide.\n\nHoping that these figures are satisfactory, and that something can be done at once in the matter of building and preparation. I think it would be quite a cause among the Nut Lake Indians, and I would be willing to spend my time there and live on the Reserve. If you wish me to do meet with the Anglican Church you might get me in touch with the Officers of that Church so we could come to some arrangements about the work.\n\nAwaiting to hear from you,\nI am,\nYours truly,\nJohn A. Ward.\n\nP. S. I do not know whether you think this financial outlay is too high. It is not for money, however, I am advocating this undertaking. Kelvington now having the steel, and a good town springing up, the necessity of some real help to the Indians living so near I think is really needed. Write and say what the best you can do.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nOn October 26th last I wrote you in regard to the request of Mr. John A. Ward to give him some assistance for the purpose of erecting a Day School on the Nut Lake Reserve. I wrote to the Agent Mr. Hardinge requesting him to furnish me with a report in regard to Mr. Ward and his proposals. I have not yet heard from him, but today received a letter from Mr. Ward, a copy of which I enclose. The tenor of Mr. Ward's letter does not commend itself to me. In his first communication, a copy of which I forwarded to you, he stated that he would be willing to put up a small building on the Reserve if the Department would bear part of the expense. The outlines of his proposals seem to me to be altogether too formidable, and the salary he thinks reasonable is altogether too large. It is a Church of England cause, and Mr. Ward states in his letter that he is a Methodist Minister. I do not see, therefore, how he can operate an Anglican organisation. I submit this letter for your consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. GRAHAM,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOTTAWA, December 27th, 1921.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nI have been directed to reply to yours of the 18th instant, referring to the proposed activities of Mr. John A. Ward on the Nut Lake Reserve. I beg to state that I have read the copy of Mr. Ward's letter that you enclosed and I am of your opinion that his request should be refused. The fact that Mr. Ward claims to be a Methodist minister, and would be quite willing to do the work under the Church of England, assures me that he is probably not the type that would do good work under the joint management of the Department of Indian Affairs and any missionary society.\n\nI am not overlooking the educational needs for the children of the Nut Lake Reserve and will write to the Church of England authorities, suggesting that at this point there is need for a missionary teacher.\n\nWould you be good enough to write to Mr. John A. Ward, of Kelvington, Sask., instructing him that the Department is not prepared to take advantage of his offer at this time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir,\n\nre Mr. John Ward's application to teach Nut Lake Reserve.\n\nReplying to your letter #312/14 dated December 19th, 1921, I beg to report that I have enquired into the above matter and find that Mr. Ward is a Student Preacher located at Kelvington. He volunteers to teach on Nut Lake provided the Department pay him a Teacher's salary.\n\nHe also proposes a building for schools and residence be erected. Mr. Ward states that although he does not know which denomination claims this field, he is willing to accommodate his faith to any creed provided he gets the appointment.\n\nMr. Ward does not appear to have any particular qualifications for the appointment, and although Nut Lake very much lacks educational facilities my experience of Day Schools would lead me to think that the suggestion of Mr. Ward would not be a great benefit to the Reserve.\n\nMr. Ward is more or less unknown to the Indians and the Indians on the Reserve have not expressed any desire for a Day School.\n\nOn the completion of the Gordon School here, I am of the opinion many children could be brought from Nut Lake and if the Department considered it advisable a small Day School could be established as well under the proper auspices and with a qualified teacher in charge.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. B. HARDINGE,\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nRegina.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nFurther to my letter of the 18th inst., in connection with the suggestion to erect a Day School on the Nut Lake Reserve, I now forward copy of a letter I have received from Mr. Hardinge, who has interviewed Mr. Ward, and submits certain conclusions which seem to me to meet the situation on this Reserve. I agree with Mr. Hardinge that Mr. Ward does not appear to be a proper person to undertake the education of the Indians on this Reserve, and I shall be glad to have your views in regard to the situation there.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. GRAHAM.\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, January 5, 1922.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge yours of the 30th ultimo, referring further to the proposed activities of Mr. John A. Ward on the Nut Lake Reserve. I am of the opinion that my letter of the 27th ultimo has crossed yours that is to hand today.\n\nI feel that the extra light thrown on this matter by your letter and the enclosed one from Mr. Agent Hardinge need not cause the Department to alter its decision, as expressed to you in my letter of the 27th ultimo. I am of the same opinion as you, concerning Mr. Ward, and I agree with Mr. Agent Hardinge that it might be advisable to operate a day school on the Nut Lake Reserve, under the proper church auspices and with a qualified teacher in charge.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, January 5, 1922.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nThe Department would be grateful if you would keep in mind the educational needs of the Indian children of the Nut Lake reserve, south of Tisdale. I am of the opinion that in the near future this Department will have to provide educational facilities at this point. Our agent, Mr. J. B. Hardinge, of Lunnichy, Sask., states that this is properly a Church of England cause.\n\nWhen the Department decides to open a school at this point, I will look to you to nominate a teacher. I am strongly impressed with the opportunities for a missionary teacher among the Nut Lake Reserve Indians.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

He informs me that there is no school being carried on among these people and that they are greatly in need of the same. He wishes me to take action towards the establishing of a day school.\n\nI may say that we had a missionary teacher at this point some years ago, but when he withdrew from the work we did not continue, on account of the difficulty of securing the proper type of man to take up that class of work.\n\nWould the Department kindly inform me as to what might be done in order to commence educational work among these people.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[T.

Ferrier,\nSuperintendent\nMethodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nOttawa, October 9, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Methodist Church Authorities have offered to cooperate with the Department in the conduct of a day school on the Nut Lake Reserve. A year ago, Mr. Ferrier of this Department understood that you believed this to be a Church of England cause. I have examined the files, and I find that in 1915 the Methodist Church commenced teaching operations at this point. At that time it was considered that the Indians of the band were pagan, and the Methodist Church was given permission to do missionary work. School operations were conducted for two summers under the auspices of this church. I am at a loss to know why it should be considered a Church of England cause.\n\nI might inform you, further, that the Methodist Missionary is holding services for the Nut Lake Band once a month during this year, and I am writing to you for a report concerning which church should be offered conduct of the day school, if re-opened.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. B. Hardinge, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\nOttawa, October 9, 1922.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nOn the 5th of January, last, I wrote to you concerning the need for educational facilities for the Nut Lake Indian Band, south of Tisdale, Sask. I have to inform you that the Methodist Church authorities have communicated with us regarding the re-opening of the school at this point. In 1913 the Methodist Church had a missionary on this reserve, and in the summer of 1914 and 1915 conducted a day school for Indian children.\n\nAs their claim to this cause at Nut Lake has some apparent justice, I would be pleased to hear from you before authorizing the re-opening of the Indian Day School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

However as it would appear that the Methodist Church has broken ground on the Nut Lake Reserve, and is ready to resume the work, and as the Anglican Church has never done anything for those Indians, it is, I think, our part simply to leave the matter in the hands of the Department and wish the Methodist Church every success.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours obediently,\n\nJ. A. Mackay\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Oct. 23, 1922.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nI have yours of the 14th instant, intimating to the Department that you do not consider the Indian band on the Nut Lake Reserve is a charge of the Anglican Church. I will assure the Methodist Church Authorities of your wishes for their success as they undertake this work again.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nVen. Archdeacon J. A. MacKay,\nSynod Office,\nPrince Albert,\nSask.\nOttawa, Oct. 23, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer further to the proposed re-opening of the day school on the Nut Lake Reserve. Ven. Archdeacon J. A. MacKay of Prince Albert, Sask., is of the opinion that this is a Methodist Church cause, and, unless your answer to our communication of the 9th instant offers the Department different information, we are prepared to assist the Methodist Church in their efforts to educate the youth of the Indian Band at this point.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. B. Hardinge, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\nReferring to my letter of the 10th instant and your reply of the 24th instant regarding the educational facilities on the Nut Lake and Fishing Lake Reserves, I note that the Methodist Church Authorities have intimated a desire to re-open a day school on Nut Lake Reserve. You point out that this school was formerly conducted by their Missionary. The school to which you refer was open for only a few months and the work was carried on in an Indian house. The attendance was very poor indeed; no returns were sent to the Agent or to the Department so far as I know. The report I have from the Indian Agent in charge of the reserve at that time is that the venture was a failure.\n\nI wish to call the Department's attention to the conditions existing at Nut Lake Reserve at the present time. The Indians are hunters; they are seldom at one place for any length of time, particularly in winter. This being the case, you can readily understand that a day school there would not be a success, no matter how good a teacher is sent or how good a building is erected. Knowing conditions, as I do, I would consider that to re-open a school there would be only a waste of money.\n\nThe Department will remember that when the question of building the Gordon's Boarding School was under consideration the Anglicans claimed that as Fishing Lake and Nut Lake Reserves were considered Anglican Territory they would be able to get many children from these points. The school is now completed and the accommodation is there.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nthere for many more children than they have at present, and all that remains to be done is to see that the children are placed in the Institution. This cannot be done, however, without commission. My opinion is that the children from Nut Lake should be sent to a Boarding School and as the Department have accommodation provided already at Gordon's and possibly at Brandon, they should be sent to either of these schools.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

I have noted your opinion that a day school at this point would be a failure and that the children might well be recruited for the Gordon's and Brandon Residential Schools.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that the Department has not authorized any expenditure for a day school at Nut Lake as yet, and your recommendation is being referred to the Methodist Church authorities.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nW.

Mr. Commissioner Graham, however, is of the opinion that a day school would be unsuccessful because of the itinerant habits of the Indians. He strongly recommends that the children of school age be recruited to Gordon's and Brandon Residential Schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T.

In 1913 this church had a missionary on the reserve, and in the summers of 1914 and 1915 the Methodist Church conducted a day school for Indian children. The Venerable Archdeacon J. A. MacKay, of the Synod Office, Prince Albert, states that the Anglican Church has never had an active interest in this band, and he wishes the Methodist Church every success.\n\nYou might bring these facts to the attention of His Lordship, as an explanation of why the Department considers offering a day school, if re-opened, to the Methodist Church authorities. I wish to inform you, however, that the Department will be slow to provide a grant for this proposed school, as we are of the opinion that the children of school age should be recruited to either Gordon's or the Brandon Residential Schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I told the Indians that these children would have to attend school and that if they came forward voluntarily the choice of a school would be left as far as possible with the parents.\n\nIn spite of this there was not one Indian who would give his consent to have his children sent to school; they were all very strongly opposed to the idea.\n\nUnder the circumstances, and in view of the number of children involved, I did not care to take the responsibility of using coercive measures, so I allowed the matter to stand until I had placed the facts before the Department.\n\nWe have accommodation for twenty-five or more pupils in the Gordons and Muscwequan schools and this would be a good opportunity to fill up these schools from one of our own reserves.\n\nI anticipate strong opposition from the Nut Lake Indians but if I am backed by special authority from the Department I will see that these children are placed in schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 13, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 6E of the 5th instant, with reference to the education of the Indian children of the Nut Lake Reserve.

The Department understands that this Band is backward and difficult to interest in the matter of education; but in this connection I do not consider it advisable to put into effect the compulsory provisions of the Indian Act at the present time.\n\nI should be pleased if you would make a report, following the recruiting campaign.

Mr. Barnet, Superintendent of United Church Indian Missions, informed me today that his church had looked into the question of establishing a mission school at Nut Lake and that they are not prepared to do anything at the present time.

It is bounded by reserves that are being administered to by the Anglicans.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6299, file 634-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThere are, I ascertained, about 40 children on this reserve of school age and no day school. Something should be done to recruit them. I understand this reserve is claimed to be the recruiting field of the Anglican Church. There is no resident missionary on the reserve and it seems to me that the children should be recruited for the Brandon or File Hills Schools. Would it be in order to have the File Hills Principal go up there and see what he could do? The authorities at Brandon might also be notified. I believe that if the children on this reserve were sent to school and the young men properly handled when they leave school, they could develop quite an industrious reserve.\nOttawa, October 5, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to that portion of your 312-9 of the 27th ultimo which is relative to the children of school age on the Nut Lake Indian Reserve. I think all are agreed that a day school would not meet the situation. There remains a residential school training. The Gordon and Brandon Schools are not in operation at the present time and File Hills has a full complement of pupils. I believe it timely to consider this question next year, when it is possible accommodation for 20 or 25 could be found. I should be pleased to learn if you concur.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

The children should be recruited as soon as possible. There has been a field here for recruiting for the last twenty years to my knowledge. It is most unusual to see so many young Indians growing up without any education, with long hair and not speaking English, and the time has arrived when we must try to make inroads on this reserve in the way of educating the children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

I note that there is room for a few pupils in the File Hills Residential School, and the Department would be grateful if you would arrange with the Principal and the Indian Agent for recruiting activity leading towards the enrolment of half a dozen children from the reserve. This would have a good effect and would pave the way for a major recruiting effort at a later date, when accommodation is available at the Gordon and Brandon Institutions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Murphy,\nMinister of Interior,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Murphy; Nut Lake Indian Reserve.\n\nThis Reserve is about 7 or 8 miles from Rose Valley and there are in the neighborhood of 375 to 400 Indians on the reserve. There is no school or anything on the reserve for training these Indians and no one seems to have any interest in them. There are a very quiet class and as long as Liquor and Extracts are kept away from them they are law abiding. Wm Gilchrist, is, Resident Farmer, but not much farming is done and the young Indians are allowed to drift along like savages. Now is it right to allow this when church organizations are collecting for foreign missions to educate the people in foreign countries.\n\nBesides this Reserve is situated in between Kelvington and Ponass Lake Municipalities, two of the best Municipalities in the Province of Saskatchewan. There is a population of around 8000 people and the Government owe it to the white people to see that something is done with them.\n\nI would suggest a Government Indian School and farm right on the south side of the Reserve and near the Big Nut Lake. The land is well suited for cultivation and they should be taught to produce their own food. The influx of settlers to all lands north of the Reserve is destroying fur bearing animals and big game and eventually if this is not done the Indians will be on relief. It would be much better to try something now before it is too late.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd) J. B. Lorimer.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nEnclosed is a copy of a letter received from Mr. J.B.

I would request that, upon the occasion of your next visit to the agency, you will discuss the matter with the Indian Agent and submit a report, setting forth your views as to whether it would now be advisable to provide school facilities, if the Indians would be favourably disposed and would send their children to school.\n\nIt is considered that, if a school is started on this reserve, it should be undenominational and under the sole control of the Department.

They are strongly opposed to any interference with their aboriginal beliefs and I do not think that more than four or five of this Band profess to belong to a religious denomination and they cannot be classed as very strong adherents to Christianity. I was in charge of this Reserve as Indian Agent for over fifteen years and during that period I made a very determined effort to recruit children from the Nut Lake Band for the residential schools in the Touchwood and Qu'Appelle Agencies with very little success. I think during that period I was only successful in obtaining three or four recruits. These unfortunately died either in the school or shortly after their return, which did not tend to make the Indians feel more kindly towards our schools. Mr. Waddy informs me that he has never had a request during his term as Agent from any of the Indians of the Nut Lake Band with regard to obtaining educational facilities for their children.\n\nApart from this, even if there were a friendly feeling towards the question on the part of the Band (which there is decidedly not), the very nature of their means of subsistence would not incline me to recommend the expenditure of money in the establishment of a school on this Reserve. The Indians obtain their livelihood by trapping and hunting in the winter months, digging seneca root, working for settlers, scrubbing land, and the sale of pickets during the summer months. The country to the northeast of their Reserve is a large forest reserve and practically uninhabited. These Indians have used this as a trapping ground for generations. From about the middle of February until the end of May practically the only Indians left on the Reserve are the old and destitute who are on the annuity list. The able-bodied Indians who of course have the large families are all away earning their living and, as they have no means of leaving their children on the Reserve, they have to take them along. Again their occupation during the summer of digging seneca root and scrubbing land for settlers takes them away from their Reserve.\n\nIt will be readily understood that under these conditions the prospect of obtaining even a small regular attendance would be very doubtful. The older men on the Reserve are bitterly opposed to\u2014\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nbitterly opposed to changing their belief and their influence is dominant amongst the younger people, and so long as they have to obtain their subsistence by following their present avocation their influence will remain the same.\n\nIn my opinion we might be well advised to encourage the Principals of the residential schools to make a determined effort to recruit young children from this Reserve; and, if successful, which I doubt at present, in time the influence of these young people after they have received some years of training might gradually have the effect of other Indians assuming a more kindly attitude with regard to education.\n\nNo doubt there are missionaries and others who, without a knowledge of the efforts that have been made in the past and without full information regarding the mode of livelihood of these Indians, will take the viewpoint that they are being neglected. This is not correct however. The Indians appear to be contented with their present mode of living and the only request they made to me during the many years I was there was that they be left alone to enjoy their own beliefs. Until the time arrives when it is imperative that they settle down to farming and stock raising on the Reserve as a source of livelihood, I do not consider it advisable to incur the expenditure which would be involved in the establishment of a day school on the Reserve. It would simply mean providing a position for a teacher, and I question very much if the influence of a school on the Reserve would have the effect of raising the standard of civilization amongst these Indians until such time as they change their attitude towards this question.\n\nIt will be seen by the foregoing that neither myself nor Mr. Waddy concur in the recommendation that a day school be established. In view of this I hardly consider it necessary to give my opinion as to the type of building which should be provided. There are no buildings on the Reserve at the present time which could be used even temporarily for school purposes or a teacher's residence.\n\nThe foregoing report is respectfully submitted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

It is not likely, however, that he will direct any further action be taken in the matter at the present time.\n\nIt is noted that both yourself and Mr. Agent Waddy are of opinion that a day school would not meet with success.

Though I make my headquarters at Prince Albert, in the Diocese of Saskatchewan, I still visit the Reserves in the Diocese of Saskatoon, at the request of the Bishop of Saskatoon.\n\nWhile at Nut Lake we stayed with Mr. Burch, and we were discussing the possibility of a school. As you know, Blue Cloud and a few of the other Indians are keen to have a day school, and he said that he had found fifteen children of school age whose parents would be willing to send them to school. He told us that you said if fifteen children were prepared to attend you would do your best to obtain a school for them.\n\nWe, as a Church, would be very pleased to do what we could to help; and I feel sure the Bishop of Saskatoon would be glad to write to Ottawa about it, if you also are willing to advocate the school. The Department are building a school at Chagoness, and there are more children at Nut Lake than at Chagoness.\n\nPossibly my a native teacher might be more successful than a white teacher to begin with, and I think we could provide one by next Spring. One young Indian man is going through Normal at Saskatoon at the present time.\n\nI know that you, and all who are interested in the Indians, are anxious to see the Nut Lake band taught and uplifted from their present condition, and we feel that the Church can help towards this end.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW.

A few days ago the Principal of Lebret school discussed with me the establishment of a school there.\n\nThis is a place that will require considerable work to get a school going, at the same time I believe it will be the only way to get these Indians educated.\n\nI expect to visit this reserve within the next few days, if roads keep open and will report on return.\n\nIn the meantime it is my opinion that if a school is established at this point, it should be non-denomination with a married man who would act as both overseer and teacher and his wife as assistant.\n\nConsiderable more advancement among these Indians could be made before both a Farming Instructor and teacher would be necessary.\n\nThe school could be closed an hour earlier on two days of each week to permit religious instructions by the different churches.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nDear Sir;-\n\nI beg to advise that I visited Nut Lake Reserve on Wednesday November 10th. From the information I can gather there has only been three or four of these Indians who have ever attended school and I do not think there are any there at the present time.\n\nPractically no farming is being done, they are depending on hunting, fishing and seneca root for a living. Their homes are only huts and they are scattered all over the reserve.\n\nThese Indians will not send their children to residential school. It is my opinion that before any advancement can be made on this reserve a day school will have to be established with a teacher carefully selected for the position.\n\nAt the present time it would be difficult to get many to attend owing to the way they are scattered over the reserve, but I believe this could be quickly overcome by assisting them to build houses which will have to be done and making assistance available only to those who would build within reasonable distance of the school.\n\nI am..........\n\nDr. Harold McGill,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nI am informed both the Church of England and the Roman Catholic are approaching the Department re the building of a school on this reserve. I am of the opinion that if a school were established here a non-sectarian in which each denomination would be given - say an hour each week for religious instructions - would be most satisfactory to all concerned.\n\nI am also of the opinion that if a school were erected here with a good married man as teacher and overseer and his wife as assistant the services of the Farming-Instructor could be dispensed with. This would avoid the necessity of building a teacherage and make the Farming Instructor available for say Moosimin reserve.\n\nI would recommend that this matter be given serious consideration by the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan. P.C.H.\nWINNIPEG, December 16, 1937.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nIndian Affairs Department,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nThe Reverend Oblate Fathers in charge of the Lestock Indian residential school have, for the last five years, visited quite regularly the Indians of the Nut Lake reserve. These Indians are all, less three Catholic families, of aboriginal belief. It is only within the last few years that they have allowed the missionary to visit them on their reserve. For the last two years, the Oblate Missionaries have organized picnics for this band of Indians and have succeeded in becoming quite friendly with them and with their children with the result that they have agreed to place some of their children in the Muscowequan residential school.\n\nThe Fathers propose to erect a Catholic church on the immediate outskirts of the reserve; in fact, the church will be situated just opposite the reserve, on the main highway.\n\nThe friendly relations which have existed, as stated above, for the past several years would, in our estimation, entitle the Missionaries of the Lestock school to be selected as having the first right to superintendent the education of this band of Indians.\n\nIt may be suggested that a neutral or undenominational school would better serve the purpose as all the Indians with possibly a few exceptions are still pagans. In the estimation of our Missionaries, this would hardly be a just and fair solution of the problem as invariably when a so-called neutral school is established, the teacher selected is a non-catholic and, to all intents and purposes, the school becomes a non-catholic school. It is to avoid this unsatisfactory condition that we are asking that the proposed school be given to the Missionaries of the Lestock district.\n\nWe hope, my dear Mr. Hoey, that you will give the Oblate Fathers' request in this matter your favorable consideration.\n\nWith renewed thanks and good wishes, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Inspector Murison, who was for a period of 15 years agent in charge of this reserve, opposed the erection of a school in a report sent forward by him to the Department, dated January 3, 1935. Dr. Robertson reported on the proposal in a letter addressed to the Department on November 16, 1937. Dr. Robertson's report reads in part as follows:\n\n\"At the present time it would be difficult to get many pupils to attend, owing to the way they are scattered over the reserve, but I believe this could be overcome by assisting the Indians to build houses, making assistance available only to those who would build within a reasonable distance of the school.\"\n\nIt is my intention to discuss the matter further with Dr. Robertson during his attendance at the Inspectors' Conference, which will be held at Ottawa, I understand, in the course of a month or two. In the meantime, I think that an attempt might be made by the church authorities, in cooperation with the Indian agents, to recruit pupils on this reserve for residential schools.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

Plourde, O.M.I.,\n619 McDermot Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., June 7, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMr. J. W. Waddy, Touchwood Agency, advises that Archdeacon W. E. J. Paul has requested permission to construct a building at Nut Lake Reserve at which instruction may be given Indians by the Anglican Church. The building is to be 18' x 24', built on skids so it may be moved, and the place chosen for a site is close to the farm house.\n\nNo offer of payment is made, as the Archdeacon only proposes putting up a temporary place if permission is granted.\n\nMr. Waddy, in speaking to the Archdeacon, advised him that, in his opinion, the Indians would have to be consulted.\n\nThis request is submitted for your consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos.

In view of this decision, it is considered that it would not be advisable to grant permission to the Anglican Church authorities to erect a building for school purposes. You should, therefore, inform Archdeacon Paul that the Department is not prepared to grant, at the present time, the permission which he requests.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nDr. Thos.

He states that the chief difficulty he has there is that there is no building for the purpose. In asking permission to erect a temporary building, it was not the intention to use it for school purposes, but for the purpose of giving lectures and showing pictures.\n\nUnder those circumstances would there be any objection by the Department to the construction of such a building?\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nThos.

McCookin,\nActing Secretary.\n\nDr. Thos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to draw your attention to conditions on the Nut Lake Reserve, Touchwood Agency. These Indians have always been hunters and trappers, and are pagans. I do not think at the present time there are any of their children attending school, and only about half a dozen have ever done so. There is good agricultural land on the Reserve and the future of these Indians must depend on agriculture, as the hunting and trapping for them are over.\n\nWe have had Farming Instructors on this Reserve for quite a number of years, but aside from issuing rations, they have been of very little assistance to either the Department or the Indians. They have altogether failed in securing the co-operation and confidence of the Indians.\n\nI would strongly recommend that serious consideration be given to the construction of a school on this Reserve this season if at all possible. I would point out that this is a Band similar to those Indians on Kinistino Reserve, where we had a similar experience\u2014no progress was made until we built a school and appointed competent men as teacher and Farming Instructor. I would strongly recommend that the same action be taken on this Reserve, as I believe the same\u2014I might say remarkable\u2014improvements would result as on Kinistino.\n\nMr. Burch, our present Farming Instructor, is temperamentally unfitted for the position he holds, and never should have been employed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDep't of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nTR/FMc\nOttawa, March 9, 1939.\n\nRe - Educational facilities, Nut Lake Reserve\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the third instant, in which you recommend that serious consideration be given to the construction of a school on the above noted reserve, this season, if at all possible.\n\nThe 1939-40 estimates were prepared early last fall, were printed in due course and are now under consideration by Parliament. The supplementary estimates were prepared about six weeks ago. It is my understanding that these estimates, too, are printed and will be submitted to Parliament in the course of a few days. You will readily appreciate therefore how difficult it would be to make provision in the estimates of this year for the construction of a school at Nut Lake, or for that matter, at any other reserve throughout the Dominion. Provision is usually made for the construction of Indian day schools in the regular estimates which, as I have already intimated, are prepared early in the fall of each year.\n\nProvision has been made this year for the construction of two schools on the Big River reserve, one at Mistawasis and one at Thunderchild. If in your judgment however the need at Nut Lake is more urgent than it is, say, at Thunderchild, a recommendation could be made to the Minister to have the appropriation for Thunderchild transferred to Nut Lake.\n\nThe erection of an Indian day school on the\n\nDr. Thomas Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\nNut Lake reserve, unless very carefully handled, is likely to prove very controversial. The records indicate that the Methodist, United, Anglican and Roman Catholic Churches have made attempts to establish missions on this reserve from time to time. The Catholics asked for the establishment of a school on this reserve in a letter written by Father Plourde on December 16, 1937. The Anglicans on the other hand requested permission to erect a building on the reserve in a letter dated June 7, 1938, sent forward to the Department by you at that time.\n\nIt is unnecessary to remind you that there is no provision in the Indian Act for the establishment of an undenominational Indian day school. An Indian day school with a Catholic teacher in charge is usually described as a Catholic School or a school conducted under Catholic auspices, and an Indian day school with a Protestant teacher in charge is described as a Protestant school or a school conducted under Protestant auspices.\n\nI am personally disposed to favour the erection of a school on this reserve with a capable agriculturist in charge, preferably a man with an agricultural college degree. The task ahead of him would be exceedingly difficult and would be, in my judgment, impossible, unless he had the cooperation of the Indians and the church authorities who have been until now interested in mission work amongst this particular Band.\n\nMay I suggest therefore that the Indians themselves be called together, either by yourself or by the agent, and an expression of opinion secured from them with respect to the education of their children and the general welfare of the adult population. It might be well also to discuss the matter with the local church authorities, telling them definitely what you have in mind and suggesting that, if the Indians are willing, provision might be made for certain representatives of the churches to visit the school and give a certain amount of religious instruction from time to time.\n\nI shall be glad to hear from you again with respect to this matter, as soon as you have had an opportunity of discussing it with the parties concerned.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nR. A. Hoey\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nJune 16, 1939.\n\nMemorandum for file:\n\nIn letter of March 9, 1939, on this file addressed to Dr. Thos. Robertson Mr. Hoey suggested that the amount provided in the special supplementary estimates for the erection of a new school on the Thunderchild Reserve could be used for the erection of a school on the Nut Lake Reserve. To this date no reply has been received from Inspector Robertson and apparently he does not consider it necessary to proceed with the erection of a school on the Nut Lake Reserve.\n\nOn file 155-26-5 a memorandum dated today was submitted to the Minister's office suggesting that the amount provided for Thunderchild be expended at Fisher River and Boothroyd. Consequently if Inspector Robertson answers official letter of March 9 the erection of a school on the Nut Lake Reserve will have to be deferred until the next fiscal year.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDear Sir:\n\nRef: Your 121-8-1 of March 9th, Educational Facilities, Nut Lake Reserve.\n\nI beg to advise that last week I visited the Nut Lake Reserve on the day of Treaty payment and discussed school matters with the Indians.\n\nThe conditions on this Reserve are that they have as fine an agricultural Reserve as there is in the Province\u2014at least 1,000 acres of land could be broken without any brushing, but the Indians themselves are doing practically no farming. They are trying to make their living by hunting, trapping, and seneca root. The Indians themselves can no longer make a living in this way, and must turn to agriculture. There are a number, I believe, who would take up agriculture if they had horses and implements, but they would also need some assistance in the way of rations the first year to live on while getting their land broken.\n\nThe housing conditions are very bad. There are only three houses on the Reserve. The rest are simply shacks with mud roofs and floors. Mr. Waddy placed $5,000.00 in his 1939-40 estimates for assistance on this Reserve. He also has about 500 logs which he had the Indians take out in exchange for food supplies during the past two winters. These are splendid building logs, and it would require from 36 to 40 of them for a house. None of the Indians are carpenters, consequently a foreman would have to be brought in. Mr. Waddy had an Indian from another Reserve building a granary when I was there. This man was employing two or three of the local men as assistants, and would be quite competent to act as foreman for the building of Indian homes.\n\nIn discussing.....\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nIn discussing the construction of a school, some of the Band were opposed to education altogether, others were favourable. After spending some time discussing different matters, I asked the Band to discuss the matter among themselves and then appoint a committee of three or four to meet the Farming Instructor and draw up a programme that they considered would be beneficial. I also discussed the matter with the Farming Instructor and arranged with him to return and meet the Indians again to discuss with them the school and other matters.\n\nMr. Waddy considers the securing of homes for these Indians as being of the first importance, and it is his intention, if any money is granted this year, to have the houses built within a radius of a mile of the Agency buildings. I enquired what it would cost to construct these buildings, but Mr. Waddy did not have the figures with him. He stated it would be about the same as was allowed last year for building houses on that Reserve.\n\nWith regard to the construction of a school, I am personally of the opinion that this is necessary before we can hope for very much improvement on this Reserve, also the appointment of a carefully selected married teacher who will carry on along similar lines to those being carried on on Kinistino Reserve.\n\nWith regard to the religious aspect, while paying the Treaty Mr. Waddy took a census, and these Indians all profess to be Pagan, except 5, five of whom are R.C. and one Protestant. There are about 70 children of school age on this Reserve, only one being in school or receiving any education.\n\nWhen in Battleford at the Agents' meeting, I had an opportunity of discussing with Archdeacon Paul conditions on this Reserve, and he was favourable to the establishment of a school with the class of teacher suggested by you, giving each church the privilege of certain hours for religious instruction. Mr. Waddy has discussed this matter with the R.C. prelate of this Reserve, who suggested that there was room enough for two schools, one on each end of the Reserve. At a meeting of the Indians, strong exception was taken by many of them to any religious training in the school, and it is my opinion that a school along the lines suggested (that is, with a teacher giving no religious instruction, but with each church having the privilege of going in and giving religious instruction during certain hours, but not compulsory) is the only way we can hope to establish a school and get the children to attend at present.\n\nI will, however, personally interview the R.C. prelate, either before or immediately after my next meeting with this Band, and submit another report.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThos.

We were not able to include in the estimates of this year the amount asked for by Mr. Waddy. It is just possible, however, that we may have funds that would enable us to carry out on the reserve a moderate building programme this year. I am anxious, therefore, that you ask the Indian Agent to let us have an outline of the program he has in mind, the estimated cost of the buildings he is anxious to erect and the name of the carpenter who built the granary, with his address. If Mr. Waddy will send this in at once, the matter will be dealt with promptly.\n\nIn view of our extensive building programme throughout the Dominion this year, I am not at all sure that we can seriously consider\n\nDr. Thomas Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina,\nSask.\nthe erection of a day school on the Nut Lake reserve this year. If, however, a housing programme is promoted and a start made at an agricultural programme, consideration could be given to the erection of a school next year. I note with interest that it is your intention to discuss with the Roman Catholic Church authorities the desirability of establishing a school on the reserve.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nAIR MAIL\n\nRegina, June 19, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Your #121-8-1 of March 9th, Educational Facilities, Nut Lake Reserve.\n\nIt will be noted in my report of June 13th, covering my last visit to this Reserve, that I asked the Indians to discuss the above matters among themselves, stating I would meet them again after they had considered them.\n\nOn Thursday, June 15th, I received a wire from the Farming Instructor, stating that the Band wished to meet me on Saturday, June 17th, as they were all leaving to dig senega root on Sunday the 18th. On Saturday morning I left Regina at 6 a.m., taking Mr. Reichman with me owing to bad conditions of the road. I visited the Reserve and returned to Regina at 4 a.m. Sunday morning.\n\nOn arriving at the Reserve, I found that a great many of the Indians had already gone, the Chief and one of the Councillors and about half a dozen of the Band being still there. The following matters were discussed: Education, homes, farming, etc.\n\nEducation: The Councillor expressed himself as strongly in favour of a day school. The others present were also in favour, but they claimed they had not had an opportunity to discuss it fully with the Band, and that the Band would not be all together again until haymaking started, and asked that a decision be deferred until that time.\n\nHomes: As pointed out in my previous report, there are only three homes on the Reserve. At our previous meeting, we had\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\npointed out......\npointed out that while we admitted that homes were necessary and we would do everything possible to secure assistance to build those homes, they must build on locations approved by us and those locations must be within a mile or a mile and a half of the Department buildings. At this meeting, objection was made to these requirements, only three or four being willing to comply. We again pointed out to them that they admitted themselves they must take up agriculture in order to earn a living, and that by locating in a central part of the Reserve, they would receive a great deal more assistance and supervision. They would not require so many implements, nor would the wear and tear on them be so great. Our medical officer would be able to see them much more easily and give them better service. We pointed out that the requirements we had specified were solely for their own benefit, and under those circumstances we could not grant any assistance unless the requirements were complied with.\n\nAs pointed out before, they have over 500 splendid spruce building logs, perfectly straight, about 20 feet in length, averaging about 8 inches at the butt and 6 inches at the top. The Chief and Councillor expressed themselves as favourable to our requirements and are going to discuss the matter further with the objecting members. I have asked Mr. Waddy to send in requisitions to meet the requirements and I trust the Department will be able to give some assistance this season.\n\nFarming: As pointed out in my previous report, there is nothing but ponies on this Reserve, which are of no use for breaking land. A number of the Band expressed themselves as very anxious to do some breaking this season. The Chief, a good Indian, who formerly did considerable farming, informed me that he would take it up again if he received some assistance. He also assured me that several others would do the same, and asked that he be supplied with five teams of horses this season. After discussing the matter with Mr. Waddy, we explained to them that our funds were very limited, that it would be useless to ask the Department for five teams this season, but if they would agree to work together, we would try and get the Department to supply them with three teams and harness this season, and if they satisfied us that they would farm, we would try to give them some more horses next season; but that if the horses were supplied, they would belong to the Department, and if we found they were not being properly cared for or were being misused, they would be immediately taken away from them. They agreed to this, and I would recommend, if funds are at all available, that they be supplied with three teams of horses and harness, as I believe they would make an honest effort to improve their conditions.\n\nThe conditions......\nThe conditions of these people are pitiful. They have no homes. Their women and children are ragged, and they are finding it very, very hard to secure food supplies.\n\nI am satisfied this Band will support a school. I am also satisfied that, with a good man and woman who would take an interest in them and work with them, great improvements could be made. I have not much hope of very much improvement under the present Farming Instructor. He has not the proper temperament, nor have the Indians any confidence or trust in him. The Chief pressed very strongly for another Farming Instructor.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 19th instant in further reference to the proposed erection of a day school on the Nut Lake Reserve. It is noted that the Band will meet later in the year and discuss the matter. Following this meeting you should report to the Department and this will enable us to consider including the necessary funds for the erection of a new school in our appropriation for the fiscal year 1940-41.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nDr. Thos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Your 121-8-1 of June 21, Educational Facilities and Buildings, Nut Lake Reserve.\n\nIn my File 312-4B of June 21st, I forwarded a requisition for building supplies for nine homes, stating that it was Mr. Waddy's intention to employ the Indian he had used for building the granary on Nut Lake Reserve, for the construction of these homes. The name of that Indian is Frank Buffalo of the Day Star Reserve. He is not only a good worker but also a man who can handle the Indians employed by him. Needless to say, if it is not possible to grant the amount asked for for nine homes, we would appreciate all the assistance we can receive.\n\nWith regard to the school, Mr. Waddy feels that securing homes for these Indians, centrally located, is more important than the construction of a school this season. He, however, like myself, believes that we cannot hope for much advancement in this Band until we have a school on the Reserve. Needless to say, a school with only a classroom teacher would be useless. Progress depends on the careful selection of a teacher and his wife, he to carry on not only classroom work but also gardening, manual training, etc., and his wife organization work among the women.\n\nAs you are aware, these Indians are very primitive. Only two or three of them have ever received any education at all. For the next generation, reading, writing, arithmetic, health, and citizenship are all we can hope to teach them, or all that, in my opinion, would be of any service to them in any way. The education of this Band should be carried on not only among the children but also among the adults. We have Montreal Lake as a striking example of what, in my opinion, has been a waste of public money in attempting to educate the children only, in regular school curriculum work. We have also Kinistino Reserve, where we have had a Farming Instructor only for a great many years.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nNo progress....\nNo progress was made in this Band until we combined the two. I think I am safe in saying that more progress has been made on both Montreal Lake and Kinistino Reserves under the present set-up than had previously been made during the whole course of our efforts.\n\nI will take the first opportunity possible of discussing with the R.C. officials the establishment of a school at Nut Lake.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nRegina, Saskatchewan,\nJuly 28, 1941.\n\nNut Lake Reserve\n\nSchools\n\nThe Branch of course is aware that none of these Indians, or at least a very few, have ever attended school and although Priests and Missionaries have visited them repeatedly they do not seem to be able to get anywhere with these Indians. To the best of my knowledge they are all pagans. However, that is not what is bothering me at the present time, Facilities have never been provided by the Branch to give this Band a school therefore we cannot expect very much progress from them, as the changing times seem to mean nothing to them at all. However, I am advocating a school when the war is over, not at the present time, as they have been waiting for the ever since the Treaty was signed in 1875 and they can wait a few more years.\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies\nHouse of Commons\nCanada\n\nOTTAWA\n\nJune 10, 1943\n\nDr. H. W. McGill, Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\n165 Sparks Street,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have a letter from one of my constituents concerning conditions in the Nut Lake Indian Reserve. I am advised that there are about 400 Indians without any schools available. I would appreciate having a report from you regarding the situation.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nA. M. Nicholson\nM.P. for MacKenzie\nOttawa, June 14, 1943.\n\nDear Mr. Nicholson:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of June 10, in which you seek information with respect to educational facilities at the Nut Lake Indian Reserve, Touchwood Agency, Saskatchewan.\n\nThe last census (1933) indicates that there are 289 Indians living on the reserve lands at Nut Lake. This is one of the most primitive bands anywhere in the Dominion. They appear to be vigorously opposed to missionary effort and consequently opposed to the enrolment of their children at Indian residential schools, which schools, as you are no doubt aware, are conducted by the Department in co-operation with the churches. Our records indicate that a number of investigations of conditions on this reserve have been undertaken by our inspectors, in co-operation with the Indian agents. The desirability of establishing an Indian day school on the reserve was thoroughly investigated by Inspector Murison in 1935. In his report the Inspector states:\n\n\"I have discussed this matter with Indian Agent Waddy and find that he holds the same views as myself with regard to the attitude of the Nut Lake Indians towards education - that is that their attitude has not changed. They are strongly opposed to any interference with their aboriginal beliefs. ...... I was in charge of this reserve as Indian agent for over 15 years. During that period I made a very determined effort to recruit children from the Nut Lake Band for the residential schools in the Touchwood and Qu'Appelle agencies, but with very little success. I think during that period I was only successful in obtaining three or four recruits. ...... These Indians appear to be contented with their present mode of living and the only request they made to me during the many years I was there was that they be left alone.\"\n\nA. M. Nicholson, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nO T T A W A.\nalone to enjoy their own beliefs. It will be seen by\nthe foregoing that neither myself nor Mr. Waddy concur\nin the recommendation that a day school be established.\"\n\nThe late Dr. Robertson took a personal\ninterest in the Nut Lake Indians and discussed with them\nthe desirability of establishing an Indian day school on\nthe reserve on a number of occasions. In a report dated\nJune 26, 1929, Dr. Robertson states:\n\n\"With regard to the establishment of a school,\nMr. Waddy feels that securing homes for these Indians,\ncentrally located, is more important than the construction\nof a school this season. ... Needless to say, a school\nwith only a classroom teacher would be useless. Progress\ndepends on the careful selection of a teacher and his wife,\nhe to carry on not only classroom work but also gardening,\nmanual training, etc., and his wife, organization work\namong the women.\"\n\nConditions at the Nut Lake Reserve\nwere again investigated by the General Superintendent of\nIndian Agencies, Mr. M. Christianson, who, in a report\ndated July 28, 1941, reminds us again that missionaries\nwho visit this reserve from time to time have failed to\nsecure the co-operation of the Indians. However, Mr.\nChristianson advocates the establishment of a school on\nthe reserve immediately following the close of the war.\n\nIt is exceedingly difficult to deter-\nmine exactly what should be done to provide these Indians\nwith educational facilities. Our experience on other\nreserves has been that unless the active co-operation of\nthe parents can be secured, a day school is practically\nworthless. I am personally of the opinion, however, that\nsteps should be taken to establish a day school on this\nreserve, just as soon as the right type of welfare worker\nor teacher can be secured. Dr. Robertson's suggestion,\nthat a teacher capable of giving farming instruction\nshould be provided, appears to be a sensible one and well\nworth a trial. At the moment, however, I can only state\nthat this matter has been reviewed from year to year by\nthe Department and will be very carefully and sympathet-\nically considered in the future, with the object of taking\nthe steps necessary to provide the best possible educat-\nional facilities for this band of Indians.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDirector.\nREPORT ON TOUCHWOOD INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF JULY, 1943.\n\nConditions on the Nut Lake Reserve are not the same as other reserves as these Indians are not educated, and are very backward, they have real good land on the reserve but have nothing to work it with and not been educated are not ready to do so. I would recommend a school be established as soon as it is possible, along the same line as the one on the Kinistno Reserve where the Farm Instructor holds the position as teacher and Farm Instructor.\n\nR.S. Davis,\nIndian Agent.\nRegina, June 10th, 1943.\n\nREPORT ON INSPECTION OF TOUCHWOOD INDIAN AGENCY\n\nNut Lake Reserve;\n\nAs you are aware, this is a very backward reserve. I do not know the exact number of Indians on this reservation but it is somewhere around 325. Out of this number only two can speak English, the Chief's wife who came from the Ote reserve, Ramsack, and was educated at the Regina Industrial School, and an Indian who was educated in the United States. It is hard to realize we have this number of Indians on a reservation surrounded by white people and only two out of the 325 speak the language of the country they are living in. However, it is easily understood as there has never been a school on the reserve and very few of the children are sent to boarding schools because the Indians are opposed to this. In the past they have mostly been hunters and for years their nearest railway station was Wadena. I think Rose Valley is only about fifteen or sixteen years old, that is when the railway came in. For this reason the Indians were more or less isolated but of course since the railway came in the country has been opened and now you are in a thickly populated settlement no matter which way you go from Nut Lake reserve. A great many of the Indians have from time to time worked for white farmers and no doubt understand a little English but the time has now come when we should try to establish a school on the reserve. After what I have seen take place on the Chagoness reserve in the Duck Lake Agency I think we should try to do the same on Nut Lake. The Indians on both reserves originally belonged to the same tribe. I spoke to the Indians before I left about establishing a school on the reserve and pointed out to them it was a pity to let their children grow up in ignorance. However, I informed them they could not expect anything at the present time but I was sure as soon as the war was over our Branch would take steps to build a school on the reservation providing I had their assurance they would support the school by sending their children there. I hope when the time comes this matter will have the attention of our Branch.\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\nArcherwell, Sask. Nov. 25/45.\n\nThe Commissioner,\nIndian Affairs,\nREGINA, Saskatchewan.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have just had a visit from some Indians, pouring out their woes, troubles, and injustices, and requesting that I write you in regard to some of these things. It has always been a source of grief to me to see the treatment the Indians here have received at the hands of the white man. They have no more educational facilities than they had 100 years before the white man came. A young Indian will grow up to manhood before he has a name or can speak a word of English. There has been no school or church as a means of education on either line either secular or religious. They still follow the ways of their ancestors, and when one takes sick, they sing continuously to drive the evil spirits away. I have heard them at it, but the patients died. If they violate the white man's law they are sent to jail, that is the extent of their education, the jail is their only school. The white man has not helped them morally either. A boy and girl decide to live together, and that is all there is to that. A few years ago, 4 or possibly 5, a man of perhaps 40 left his wife and family and lived with a young girl. The wife, who had a number of children, appealed to the white man's law. It was to have him support the family. She was told nothing could be done about it as they had never been married. A year or so later she had a child, and when the Dr. asked who was the child's father, she said \"Birch! Birch!\" I was told the Indians got rid of him as he was too much squaw and I was informed he was transferred to another reservation. Morals! God help us! Now the man who made the complaint told me that they had it in for him as the police in Kelvington was a particular friend of Birch. Now this man, whose name is Bluecloud, had arranged with a farmer near Kelvington for himself and boy and team to go threshing. The man was to meet him there would drive in with the car to let him know when they would start. A car drove in and Bluecloud went to see the man, thinking it was his man. He stumbled over the tent rope and nearly fell. The police had been informed that there were Indians drinking around there, so when Bluecloud stumbled over the tent rope the Police grabbed him saying \"you are drunk\" and ordered him to get into the car, which he did. He was not drunk as his wife can testify, but the state of the police may be questioned as the \"drunk\"? had to tell him he was going in the wrong direction. He was kept in jail (in school if you like it better) for several days, then the Inspector arrived, and the prisoner heard him from his cell say, \"Well, if he is stubborn (he stoutly denied being drunk) we will give him a heavier sentence. He managed to get a lawyer who, after conferring with them, told him he better plead guilty as they were going to give him two months if he pleaded not guilty (quite a school) and he would (by telling a lie) get off with 30 days. He did as his schoolmaster told him, and got 30 days. He turned to his persecutor, not prosecutor, and asked what they would do with his wife and family, 7 in all. Oh, we will take care of them. Well he was taken to Regina where he spent 30 days, during which time the threshing was over, and his chance to earn at 10 days $150.00. His wife was given an order for $5.00 on a store. Now my contention is that the Government of this country owes Bluecloud an apology, and $150.00 in cash, and nothing less than the\nwould be justice. I know this man well. He is a University man, got his education in the U.S. He is a temperate man, does not smoke or use vile language, but he knows when he gets a dirty deal from the whites. He was a veteran of the first World War, was shot in the knee, which, of course, helps to make a \"drunk\" out of him as it is hard for him to walk without a slight limp. We talk of the Germans and the Japs, and their injustices, but I think it is time Canada cleaned up her own front yard. If this thing is not straightened up I intend to take it to Ottawa, and then to some of our newspapers who are always willing to print any such article if the writer signs his name to it. If Birch is still drawing good Canadian money for taking care of squaws whose husbands have deserted them, the people of this country should know it. If all the education in morals, religion, and secular matters are left to the jails, unjust judges, and immoral agents, then it is time for a change, and time for a house-cleaning. Now a personal word. I am near 75 years of age, and don't want trouble with anyone, but when downtrodden, oppressed people come to me asking me to speak up in their behalf, I am still ready to fight.\n\nHoping to hear from you, I remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd. R.J. Laing.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of a letter from Mr. R.J. Laing of Archerwell, Saskatchewan, in connection with affairs at the Nut Lake Reserve of the Touchwood Agency.\n\nVery little progress has been made on that reserve in the past but plans are under consideration for improvement. They are all pagan Indians and do not want their children educated. A day school should be built at that reserve in the near future and a real effort made toward the education of the children.\n\nMr. Burch, the farming instructor referred to in this letter, is now at the Muscowpetung Reserve, Qu'Appelle Agency, and I do not think that a complaint in connection with alleged actions of his four or five years ago should be considered by our Department at this time.\n\nThe present farming instructor is Mr. F.N. Murphy and we might hope that under his direction, and later the assistance of a good day school teacher, some progress might be made.\n\nThe other complaints in this letter abuses of the Indians in the past, although of some concern at the present time, cannot now be remedied. Our only hope is that the action of the Department officials at that point will not be the subject of complaints in the future.\n\nThe present complainant says he is seventy-five years of age and he writes as though he has been associated with the Indians of the Nut Lake Reserve for many years. My only regret is that he waited until he was seventy-five years of age before deciding that something should be done about it.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nRe education for Nut Lake Band\n\nWe have around 75 children on this reserve and something should be done without delay.\n\nThese Indians are all Pagans, therefore we would have to have a school run by the Department as I knew they would not attend a church school or one run by them.\n\nWe have timber on the reserve and could cut up lumber this winter at a cost of around $25.00 per thousand.\n\nPlease give this matter your consideration as this band is one of the most backward, therefore no time should be lost in starting to educate them.\n\nR.S.

As you know, we failed last year in our attempt to provide an appropriation for the one Indian day school for Saskatchewan. This year we are going to attempt to put through four schools. Would you include Nut Lake in this top four priority or would you prefer us to follow the list which you left in the office with Mr. Phelan on the occasion of your last visit to Ottawa?\n\nBernard F.

Davis, Indian Agent,\nPunnichy, Saskatchewan.\n\nProposed Indian Day School\nat Nut Lake.\n\nYour letter 90-11 of August 28 has received careful consideration. I am writing to Inspector Ostrander to decide whether we should include this school in our 1947-48 appropriation. Can you provide us with a rough estimate of the cost of building a one-room day school on this reservation? Normally we allot $8,000.00 for such an appropriation, but if the lumber is being cut on the reserve, we should be able to do it much more cheaply.\n\nThe main difficulty here will evidently be the provision of a capable and strong-minded teacher and his wife. Our file on this situation shows that for many years these Indians have opposed the opening of such a school. Do you feel that their attitude is now changing and that they would be willing to cooperate in matters of punctuality and attendance?\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 18th instant, File No. 121-8-1 (T.T.), in connection with the proposed Indian Day School at Nut Lake.\n\nI visited the Nut Lake Reserve on the 24th instant accompanied by Indian Agent R.S. Davis, for the purpose of discussing with Mr. Davis, Farming Instructor Cervais, and the Indians, the matter of establishing a day school on that reserve.\n\nThe Nut Lake Indians seem to be anxious to have a day school but they insist that it be non-denominational, the same as the one on the Kinistino Reserve. Very few of the Nut Lake Indians have accepted Christianity and no Christian Church has been successful in its efforts to become established amongst them.\n\nMany day schools are needed in this province and the need should be filled at all those reserves at the earliest possible date. I do not think it would be advisable to give priority to the Nut Lake Indians in view of the fact that a number of other reserves where day schools are required will have better attendance than will the Nut Lake Indians, the reason being that many of the Nut Lake Indians are away from their homes a considerable part of the year hunting, trapping, and performing casual labour, there being no other way for the Indians to make a living on that reserve at the present time. Most of the reserves where I have asked for the establishment of day schools have a large proportion of the Indians earning their living on the reserve by farming. On those reserves the Indians are not travelling so much and it would not be so difficult to keep up good attendance in the schools.\n\nI may say that as soon as I commenced discussing the school question with the Nut Lake Indians on this occasion they immediately asked for a residential school of their own citing as their reason the fact that they do not live at home very much. Of course I informed them that the department would not consider giving them a residential school for their reserve.\n\nAn effort is being made to commence farming on a much larger scale on the Nut Lake Reserve than has been done in the past and I hope that before many years a day school there will be more useful than at the present time.\n\nWith reference to the letter on the same file which was addressed to Indian Agent R.S. Davis and copy sent to me, with regard to the approximate cost of a one-room day school at Nut Lake, I discussed with the Nut Lake Indians and the Farming Instructor the possibility of getting out a fairly large quantity of saw logs this winter to be sawn into lumber and used for the building of a day school on their reserve, also buildings for the Farming Instructor which were asked for in the Estimates for 1947-48. If this is done, and I have reason to believe it will be done, the amount of $3,000.00 which you mention would probably be sufficient to build the classroom building, as well as the teacher's residence and out-buildings for a day school. I would suggest that the $3,000.00 be added to the Touchwood Agency Estimates, that if the Indians get out logs and get a sufficient quantity sawn to provide all the necessary rough lumber for buildings needed on their reserve, they be given first consideration for a day school. If they do not do...\nday school. If they do not do this no doubt the $8,000.00 could be made available for day school buildings at some other point where one is needed. I am writing another letter to the Department in connection with logging at the Nut Lake Reserve and if authority is granted I am hoping that rather a large amount of lumber will be procured in this manner, not only for the Nut Lake Reserve but for other reserves where buildings are needed.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nWith reference to your letter #121-8-1 (WT) dated September 18, 1946, re the Nut Lake Day School.\n\nI do not know what class or size of school you propose to build. Lumber cut on the reserve will cost us around $25 to $30 per thousand, planned. This would include dues for the logs that would have to be paid to the band funds. It would be necessary of course to purchase flooring, shingles and inside finishing lumber from a lumber yard.\n\nI am of the opinion we could build a nice school and teacherage for $10,000.00.\n\nThese Indians have always taken the attitude that they did not want a school, owing to the fact that our schools are run by the churches, all but two families on the reserve being pagan.\n\nThey now are very much in favor of a school, but have more than once made it quite clear to me that they will not attend any church school, but want a school run by the Department and no religious instructions taught in the school. As one of the Indians said that when their children were grown up they could change if they wished, but did not want any religion pushed on them.\n\nWe have around 70 children that are of school age. I would recommend that a school be built and run in the same way as the Day School on Chagoness Reserve, Duck Lake Agency, as the Nut Lake and Chagoness Indians are more or less one band of Indians.\n\nR.S. Davis,\nIndian Agent.\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nREGINA, Sask.\n\nWe have received your letter of the 26th ultimo with reference to the proposed Indian Day School on the Nut Lake Reserve. We have noted your statement that many Indian Day Schools are required in Saskatchewan and that there are other reserves more entitled to have a day school than Nut Lake.\n\nThe possibility of including funds for the erection of a day school at Nut Lake in the 1947-48 appropriations will be given further consideration when we are preparing our estimates.\n\nWe have also received a letter from Indian Agent Davis regarding the proposed school. He points out that lumber cut on the Reserve would cost the Department from $25.00 to $30.00 per thousand.\n\nBernard F.

This includes all labor, including chimney, with the exception of painting.\n\nOur tender price is Four thousand dollars.\n\nThe forms and footings are already in.

Ostrander, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nWith reference to your letter 1852-300-11A 312-11A dated December 1st, 1947, I enclose herewith Requisition for most of the material required for the school at Nut Lake Reserve.\n\nThese prices are subject to market changes and Call Lumber Company of Rose Valley may not be able to supply all these goods. There are a number of items which are very hard to get. I would request that authority be granted for local purchases to be made where and when available. The sooner we get this through the better, as we haven't much time to purchase these goods before the end of the year.\n\nI am returning herewith the specifications for the furnaces as it appears to me something is wrong. Will you take this up with the Department and see what is required there as two furnaces this size would not be needed. I have taken the matter up with the local tinsmith and he will be furnishing me with a price in the very near future of a suitable modern heating plant. This will go forward as soon as received.\n\nR. S.

Davis, together with requisitions for all materials according to the bill of materials which was forwarded with your letter referred to. These requisitions, of course, cover all materials other than lumber, which can be supplied from the Indian production on the Nut Lake Reserve, and which is now piled on the site of the school.\n\nIt should be borne in mind that the excavation for this building is now complete as well as all the forms for the concrete work. There is a slight possibility that there may be some caving during the winter which would require a small amount of extra labour in the spring before work is commenced on the erection of the building.\n\nPlease note the last paragraph of Mr. Davis' letter wherein he refers to the two furnaces shown on the specifications. It will be noted that the local tinsmith will furnish him with a price in the very near future on a suitable modern heating plant for this building. This will be forwarded as soon as received.\n\nAlso enclosed is a written tender from John Holterman and Son, of Quinton, Saskatchewan, on all labour on the buildings with the exception of the painting. This firm of builders have done some work for us and the work has been very satisfactory. If, as the result of advertising, a better offer is not received than that of Holterman and Son, and the other prices shown on the requisitions enclosed, I would recommend that Mr. Davis be instructed to make local purchases in accordance with the enclosed requisitions and that John Holterman and Son be given the work of erection.\n\nJ.P.B.

First set is for a school in \"A\" temperature range or from 0 to 70 degrees. The second is for \"B\" range or with temperature from minus 15 to 70 degrees. The third is for \"C\" range or with a temperature from minus 30 to 70 degrees.\n\nI am advised by our Lands and Development Services Branch that the Nut Lake School is considered to be in the \"C\" range and therefore, the bill of materials for this particular temperature range should be provided. You will find this information also on Hl of Index No. 837 of the drawings for a one room Indian Day School with teacher's residence. The requisition which you have submitted is for a furnace which will provide approximately (19,000 btu), about 10 percent more than the specifications require. I have consulted our heating Engineers and they advise that the furnace quoted on by Mr. Brockman will be quite satisfactory. Would you please discuss the above information with Mr. Brockman and advise whether his quotation includes registers, etc., as required for temperature range \"C\" (minus 30 to 70 degrees as per specifications and blueprints). If so could we please be advised so that these requisitions can also be sent over to the Departmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nBernard F.

The attached requisitions cover the supplies which are required at the school. Mr. Indian Agent Davis is supplying the rough lumber from the sawmill operated by the Welfare Division on the Nut Lake Reserve. You will note that he has submitted prices from various suppliers in Saskatchewan. You will also note that the original quantity of 415 bags of cement has been deleted and that we have prepared here a separate requisition for 1100 bags of cement of which 415 are to go to the Nut Lake school and 685 to the Poorman's school.\n\nDirector.\n\nEncl:\n\nBFN/HM.\nOttawa, February 27, 1948.\n\nMr. R.S.

Upon consulting with Mr. Ostrander we have asked that this be shipped to you at Punnichy, Saskatchewan. This will mean that one large carload of cement being shipped to you on or after April 20, 1948. You can then arrange truck transportation to the sites of the two schools.\n\n(c) With regard to the paint we have asked that six gallons of very pale green and two gallons of light green be provided for the interior classroom work. We have asked that four gallons of white paint for the kitchen and four gallons of pale blue paint for the teacher's living-room and bedroom be supplied. It is suggested that you mix two gallons of white with four gallons of pale blue to provide a very pale blue for these two rooms. We have also specified that the concrete paint be aluminum in colour as we have found that this gives a very light colour to the basement and also reflects light rays.\nI would also ask that we be advised when the school is about half completed so that we can arrange to order the blackboards and also the desks. Both of these items are in very short supply and will take approximately six to eight weeks for delivery.\n\nBernard F.

Some of the lumber is coming from a sawmill operated by the Indians of the reserve. The excavation for this building was carried out during last fall and is now ready for the concrete work. We are informed by Mr. J. P. B. Ostrander, Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies for Saskatchewan, that there may be some caving during the winter, which would require a small amount of extra labour in the spring before work is commenced on the erection of the building. Mr. Indian Agent Davis has obtained a written tender from John Holterman and Son, of Quinton, Sask., for all labour on the buildings with the exception of the painting. This tender is for $4,000.00 and is attached hereto. Mr. Ostrander recently visited this Branch and recommended the acceptance of this labour tender. In a recent letter he advised as follows: \"This firm of builders have done some work for us and the work has been very satisfactory\".\n\nIn order to give the Minister information as to the labour costs of constructing this one-room Indian day school and attached teachersage, we obtained the following details from our files with regard to three day schools now nearing completion. These schools are identical with the one which is planned for Nut Lake and for which the attached tender is submitted:\n\n......

I understand that this is a very reputable firm and that they will carry out the work in a satisfactory manner. In view of this, I would suggest that approval be given to Mr. Hoey's recommendation.\n\nW. J. F. Pratt,\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6299, file 634-5, part 1)\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nNut Lake Indian Day School\n\nThe above Indian Day School is one for which the necessary materials are being ordered now by the Departmental Purchasing Agent. Some of the lumber is coming from a sawmill operated by the Indians of the reserve. The excavation for this building was carried out during last fall and is now ready for the concrete work. We are informed by Mr. J. P. B. Ostrander, Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies for Saskatchewan, that there may be some saving during the winter, which would require a small amount of extra labour in the spring before work is commenced on the erection of the building. Mr. Indian Agent Davis has obtained a written tender from John Holterman and Son, of Quinton, Sask., for all labour on the buildings with the exception of the painting. This tender is for $4,000.00 and is attached hereto. Mr. Ostrander recently visited this Branch and recommended the acceptance of this labour tender. In a recent letter he advised as follows: \"This firm of builders have done some work for us and the work has been very satisfactory\".\n\nIn order to give the Minister information as to the labour costs of constructing this one-room Indian day school and attached teacherage, we obtained the following details from our files with regard to three day schools now nearing completion. These schools are identical with the one which is planned for Nut Lake and for which the attached tender is submitted;\nLabour Costs on standard one-room school with teacher's residence:\n\n| School                                      | To date   | Estimate to complete |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------|----------------------|\n| (a) Stony Plain, Edmonton Agency            | $6,803.94 | $480.00              |\n| (b) Michel,                                 | 5,145.75  | 370.00               |\n| (c) Mississauga, Sault Ste. Marie Agency, Ontario. | 5,289.31  | ---                  |\n\nMr. Ostrander advised that he could have the painting done by Indians, under the supervision of the farming instructor. Therefore this tender of John Holterman and Son would seem to be fair and reasonable and is recommended for acceptance by the Minister.\n\nEncl.\nQuinton, Sask,\nFebruary 11, 1948.\n\nJ.F.B. Ostrander Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n413-414 Post Office Building.\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nwe wish to submit our tender for building\nthe day school, Nut Lake Reserve (teacher's residence\ncombined) according to plans supplied by Mr. Davis. This\nincludes all labor, including chimney, with the exception\nof painting.\n\nOur tender price is Four thousand dollars.\n\nThe forms and footings are already in.\nHowever for the basement standing through the winter may\ncause some cave-in. If this has to be repaired, we would\nrequire extra pay for this work, on an hourly basis.\n\nJohn Holterman & Son\n\nper Henry Holterman\nAIR MAIL.\n\nOttawa, April 3, 1948.\n\nMr. R.S. Davis, Indian Agent, Punnichy, Saskatchewan.\n\nWe have just been advised by the Minister's office that approval has been given to the tender of Mr. John Holterman and Sons for the erection of our standard one room Day School with teacher's residence on the Nut Lake Reserve. This tender includes all labour, including chimney, with the exception of painting for a price of $4,000.\n\nIt is also understood that the forms and footings are already in but if cave-ins occur this spring repairs will be carried out over and above the labour tender. This work would have to be paid for on an hourly basis and would be the subject of further correspondence from you if such is necessary when the snow clears. If additional sets of blue prints and specifications are required, we will gladly furnish these for use by the company.\n\nI also understand from Mr. Ostreider that John Holterman and Sons might be interested in the construction on a similar basis the Poorman's Indian Day School. If this is the case, it is presumed that we will be hearing from you concerning the materials needed for this building. I am enclosing a copy of our bill of materials for your reference in the instance of the Poorman's School.\n\nBernard F. Berry,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nEnclosure:\n\nIndian Affairs.

We have had some difficulty in obtaining prices. Below is our estimated costs.\n\n| Item                                      | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 1 - #30-25 Hecla furnace and double casing | 275.00 |\n| 900 lbs iron made up and erected          | 315.00 |\n| Registers and faces                       | 60.00  |\n| 200 sq ft of asbestos put on              | 15.00  |\n| Quadrant damper sets                      | 29.30  |\n| Labor in setting up furnace and registers | 40.00  |\n\n$ 734.30\n\nShould #24 gauge metal be not available, aluminum will be used at a slight extra cost. We cannot guarantee the above furnace will satisfactorily heat the building if the layout on the plans is followed. You will notice that the plans call for over a thousand square inches of hot air and only just over four hundred square inches of cold air. This is definitely going to starve the cold air and reduce the efficiency of the furnace. By installing more cold airs you will receive a great deal more economy from the unit. Ed. Tax is not included in the above estimate and will be extra.\n\nWe would not like to quote on the electrical work at this time as we will need more information. There were no exit lites shown on the plans and no fire alarm system. We believe that the Fire Commissioner will definitely want these installed and the plans for the wiring, fire alarm system will have to be O.K ed by his office. If this could be accomplished and the plans returned to us we would like to bid on the electrical work.\n\nTrusting that this is the information you require,\n\nYours truly,\n\nWynyard Heating & Electric,\n\nper (sgd) W.B. Martin.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nWith reference to Department letter #121-8-5 (E 1) dated May 3, 1948, I enclose herewith copy of a letter received from the Wynyard Heating and Electric, Wynyard, Sask., in which they tender on the furnace required for the Nut Lake Indian Day School.\n\nI would like to draw your attention to the third paragraph of this letter which states that in their opinion, the cold air provided for in the plan for heating, is inadequate.\n\nNo reply has been received to Mr. Davis' letter #G-4A (121) dated May 18, regarding the electrical work mentioned in the letter from the Wynyard Heating and Electric.\n\nS.H. Simpson,\nIndian Agent.\nJune 8, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nRe: Furnace for Nut Lake Indian Day School.\nYour file 79790-15-2 S.\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of May 26th, I enclose for your information a copy of an additional tender for the installation of the furnace.\n\nThis has just been forwarded to us by Indian Agent S.H. Simpson who has succeeded Mr. Davis as Indian Agent in the Touchwood Agency. Mr. Simpson did not forward us the original copy of the tender.\n\nWith reference to the comments of the company regarding the plans, I may say that these were prepared by the Lands and Development Services Branch and should be correct.\n\nBernard F.

Simpson, Indian Agent,\nPunnichy, Saskatchewan.\n\nWe have your letter of the 30th ultimo and will submit the tender of Wynyard Heating and Electric Company to the Departmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nWith regard to the last paragraph of your letter, we wrote Regional Supervisor Ostrander on May 27th and I enclose a copy of this letter for your information.\n\nBernard F.
