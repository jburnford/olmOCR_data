Expenses were to be cut down to the utmost and the rate of taxation reduced, but no sooner does the council meet and get to work than those pledges seem to have been forgotten. Instead of reducing salaries, which in some instances were too high, new offices must be created which must necessarily entail increased expense and could very well have been done away with. From the report of the last council meeting we note that most of the members were in favor of saddling the town with a debt in order to place a ferry on the river. A ferry we believe to be a pressing necessity, and we agree that it should be established at once if possible, but we do not consider that there is any necessity for raising the necessary funds by the issue of debentures. There was more money raised by taxation last year to send a delegation to Ottawa than was required for the ferry, and the rate was what must be considered low, and need be no higher this year to raise all the money necessary for the ferry, which is a public purpose. It was argued that those who come in later on should bear part of the expense of the ferry. The same argument might have been applied to the delegation money. The sum required was larger and we must be sure that no more money is being raised by the yearly rate. It is a great thing to burden the town with a debt, however small, as long as it can be avoided, and we hope that our councillors will have their good sense enough to see this so. It is not economy to rush into debt. It is good policy to pay as you go and go not beyond your income, even when in adversity.\n\nAmple provision has been made by the Government for educating and training Indian children at all other Indian centres in the Territories. They have established Industrial Schools which are doing good work, but far more has been done in that direction for the Indians in the Prince Albert and Carlton Agencies. There are numbers of Indian youths who are growing up ignorant and totally unacquainted with the white man's civilization, none provision should be made for these. An Industrial School similar to those at other centres should be established at Prince Albert or vicinity. We bring this matter to the notice of the Government and assure our readers and hope that it will receive the favorable consideration to which we believe it entitled.\nA Dead Drop!\n\nON PRICES AT J.

Col. Irvine has been sent twice to the North-West, with the Indians, and has visited all parts of the country north of here; the Indians themselves being disposed of in various ways, treacherously and cruelly. At the banquet Mr. Mair responded to the toast of \"The Land We Live In,\" and, in his usual laconic manner, remarks refering to Col. Irvine's long experience in the North-west, came back to the Transfer and the First Expedition, and spoke of the difficulties which he had experienced, both as an outsider, and old and new, not only for his gentlemanly character, but for his happy relations with the Indians, whom he knew well during many a trying circumstance in the latter day history of our country.\n\nIn speaking to the toast assigned to him by the committee, Mr. Mair said that no Canadian heart could fail to respond to the call to the land of our fathers, and the energy and courage of brave men and high-minded women. It was in fact, he said, that the French Canadians, united with British principles, were laid, and now, and he hoped, would ever continue to be, the bulwark of the Empire.\n\nW. R.
