Put into the eyes, in fine powder, it takes away their dimness, and heals them being bloodshot; it cleanses old sores, being strewed gently on them.\" Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des Drogues, Lib. II. cap. 38, anno 1694.\n\nLemery gives nearly a similar account of sugar; but says it is hurtful to the teeth, and causes vapours. Trait\u00e9 Universel des Drogues Simples, anno 1693.\n\nHermann says, \"Sugar consists of a sweet soft mucilage, and an agreeable sharpness; from whence it becomes an aliment as well as a medicine. The Indians boil it in water with a small quantity of flower for nourishment. It promotes urine, and is specific in coughs, hoarseness, sharp humours, and other diseases of the lungs.\"", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-03", "created": "2025-10-03", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_jacob/Moseley and Moseley - 1799 - A treatise on sugar_page_103.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1292, "total-output-tokens": 312, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 1064, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
