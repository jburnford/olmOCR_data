Inconveniences will arise from Frosts in this scheme, as admitted in my observations on the other. But the Dock proposed will affect the navigable part of the the Frome only, leaving the Avon open to the tide; and why should we be at so heavy an expense to deprive ourselves of the advantage", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-03", "created": "2025-10-03", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_jacob/Thomas - 1800 - Different plans for improving the Habour of Bristol_page_27.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1338, "total-output-tokens": 296, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 1087, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
