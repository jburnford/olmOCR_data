As for Cloths, Houses, or whatever else a man may be suppos'd to want, it is provided by their Superiors, though not without some labour, but yet so easy as if they did it for pleasure; Again their Females are all absolute Beauties, and by a secret disposition of nature, a man there having once known a Woman never desires any other; Rather was never heard of amongst them, neither is it hardly possible to be committed, for there can be no wound made but what is cureable; yea they assured me, and for my part I believe it, that though a mans head be cut off, yet if within three Moons it be joined to the Carcass again, and the Juice of a certain Herb there growing applied, it will be so consolidated as the wounded party shall be perfectly cured. But the chief cause of their good government is an excellent disposition in the nature of the People, so that all both Old and Young hate all manner of vice and live in such love, peace, and amity as it seems to be another Paradise; Though it is true likewise that some are of a better disposition than others, which they discern immediately at their Birth; And because it is an inviolable Law amongst them that none shall be put to death, therefore perceiving by their Stature or some other signs who are like to be of a wicked and debauched humor, they send them, I know not by what means, into the Earth, and change them for other Children, before they have either opportunity or ability to do amiss among them; but first, they say, they are fain to keep them there for some time till the Air of the Earth alters their colour like ours. Their ordinary vent for them is a certain high Hill in the North of America, whose people, I am apt to believe, are wholly descended from them, both in regard of their colour, and their continual use of Tobacco, which the Lunars or Moon Men smoke exceedingly, the place abounding much with moisture, together with the pleasure they take therein, and some other respects too long to rehearse: Sometimes, though but seldom, they mistake their aim and fall upon Europe, Asia, or Africa. I remember some years since I read certain stories tending to confirm what is related by these Lunars, and especially one Chapter of Neubrigensis. Inigo Mondejar in his description of Nova Granata. Also Joseph De la Carana in his History of Mexico if my memory fail not, recount what will make my report more credible; but I value not testimonies.\n\nIf you inquire how Justice is executed, alas what need is there of exemplary punishment where no offences are committed; neither need they any Lawyers, or there is no contention, the seeds whereof when they begin to sprout are by the wisdom of the next Superior pluckt up by the Roots. And as little want is there of Physicians, they never surfeit themselves; the Air is always pure and temperate, neither is there any cause of sickness, I could never hear of any that were distempered. But the time assign'd them by nature being spent, they dye without the least pain, or rather cease to live, as a Candle does to give light when what nourishes it is consumed. I was once at the departure of one of them, and was much surpriz'd that notwithstanding the happy life he liv'd, and the multitude of Friends and Children he should forsake, yet as soon as he understood his end to approach, he prepar'd a great Feast, and inviting all whom he esteem'd, exhorts them, To be merry and rejoice with him, since the time was come he should now leave the counterfeit Pleasures of that World, and be made partaker of all true Joy and perfect happiness; I did not so much admire his", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-03", "created": "2025-10-03", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_jacob/Anonymous - 1700 - The English acquisitions in Guinea and East-India_page_50.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 2074, "total-output-tokens": 868, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 3814, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
