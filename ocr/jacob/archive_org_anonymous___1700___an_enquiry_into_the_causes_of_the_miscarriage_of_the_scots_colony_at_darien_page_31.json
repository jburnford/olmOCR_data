Dedication, pag. 9.\n\nBut if H\u2014\u2014s and his Suborners exclaim against our Privileges as immense; they are resolv'd to diminish the Authority by which they were granted, and call it only by the name of an Octroy, which signifies no more than a Patent; whereas our Privileges were granted us by an Act of Parliament, which are greater and more sacred than all the Octroys in Europe. Thus thro Ignorance or Malice they think fit to vilify his Majesty's Conduct and Authority, which they pretend to defend.\n\nTheir Malice is further demonstrated by the Parenthesis (to be presum'd) in the 2d page of the Dedication, where they speak of his Majesty's Promise to interpose his Royal Authority to do us right in case of disturbance, and that at the publick Charge (to be presum'd) of his antient Kingdom. There might possibly have been some need of their presumption, had all Mankind been induc'd with as little Sense and Honesty as H\u2014\u2014s and his Suborners; for no other Body could ever presume it to mean anything else, since our Acts do not oblige England: tho' if they had presumed that our Enemies would take care that the said Promise should not be kept, the refusal of lending our Company the 3 Men of War built at the Charge of our own Nation, would soon have convinced the World that they had presum'd too true.\n\nWe have accounted for rejecting Mr. Douglas's Proposal elsewhere; nor shall we take notice of H\u2014\u2014s's scurrilous Reflections on Mr. Paterson, which only discover his own Temper, but do that honest Man no hurt. As to his charging us with squandering away 5000l. on 6 Hulks at Amsterdam and Hamburgh, purely to make a noise of our Proceedings, &c. we would desire him and his Suborners to reconcile it with what they say from p. 14, to 20, where they own themselves that the Dutch and Hamburgers were both mightily pleas'd with the Design, p. 14. That the Dutch were tickled with the Conceit that they should be Sharers in the Scots Trade; and p. 16, they say, That that which gave the dead stroke to the Scots Design, was the East and West-India Companies running open mouth'd to the Lords of Amsterdam, shewing what was hatching by the Scots Commissioners in their City to ruine the Trade of the United Provinces. P. 17, they tell us, That the Hamburgers thought it the more their Interest to embrace the Project, the more that the Dutch oppos'd it: P. 18, That our Affair was generally favour'd by the Burgers of Hamburg; and p. 21, That the Government of England sent the Senate of Hamburgh a Caution by Sir Paul Ricaut to take care how they suffer'd their Burgers to embark with us. So that here we condemn them from their own mouths: It being plain from those Concessions, that we did not idly squander away our Money at Hamburg and Amsterdam; but that both those trading Cities approv'd our Design, and would have engag'd in it, had not the Court of England and the Dutch oppos'd it; and therefore what los of Mony we sustain'd in those places, must be charg'd to their Account; so that H\u2014\u2014s hath verified the Proverb, That Liars have need of good Memories.\n\nThis is not the only Instance wherein those of H\u2014\u2014s and his Suborners have giv'n them the slip; for in the 4th page of the Dedication, they", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-03", "created": "2025-10-03", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_jacob/Anonymous - 1700 - An enquiry into the causes of the miscarriage of the scots colony at darien_page_31.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1936, "total-output-tokens": 871, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 3514, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
