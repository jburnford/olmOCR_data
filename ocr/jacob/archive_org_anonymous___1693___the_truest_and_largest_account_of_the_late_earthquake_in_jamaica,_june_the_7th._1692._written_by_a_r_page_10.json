I question not but there are many Petty-factors at Port Royal, who have stated their Accounts, and balanced their Books with the sole Answer of an Earthquake, whose Interest therefore it is to present it in the most dreadful manner possible, that they themselves may seem the more excusable to their Employers, as if the whole Island were destroyed thereby, which will discourage Merchants from Trafficking hither, and will be a means of further suffering thereby. Yet as I have done my best to give you a true Information hitherto, so I can assure you of the Truth of what I farther assert. That by the Blessing of God having hitherto reasonable good Weather, the Planters continue employed in making of Goods, Cottons, and Indigo's, &c. providing them for a Market; and such who have Sugar works, which is the staple of the Island, many of them had Timber buildings, which are either little or not at all prejudiced; and others who built with Brick, or Stone, have so much time between this and Crop-time, that they can, and doubtless will fit themselves in some measure in order to it: So that I am sufficiently convinced, and therefore would persuade any other, that whofoever Trades hither for any manner of Goods for Cloathing, Household-stuff, Arms and Ammunition, (which are generally spoiled) all manner of Provisions, Plantation Utensils, &c. will come by so much to the better Market, by how much they hasten to our Assistance, and need never fear the freighting of their Ships homeward, there being a present damp upon Trade, which I don't know how long it may continue, so that we shall have great quantities of Goods ready for them, to dispatch them the sooner away. God in his Displeasure remembered Mercy, and therefore this Calamity happened in the Day-time, to the safety of many hundred Souls; for though such Numbers perish'd at Port Royal, where they were thronged together in an Isthmus of Land, yet I cannot hear of fifty Persons, both Whites and Blacks, that perish'd throughout all the Island beside. \u2014 And though in the midst of our distress it pleas'd God to give us a signal Victory over our Enemies, the French, who happened at that time to make the sharpest Attack upon us since the War, having landed some say 200, some say 80 Men at the North-side, which is but weakly furnished with Men, where they intrench'd themselves, but were shamefully beaten out by a vigorous On-set in the Night, by a Party of about thirty Men, who flew 7 or 8 outright, and the rest flying to their Boats were 30 of them drowned, while in the mean time our Fleet which was set out on purpose pursuing theirs, we took one Shalop, and made them desperately blow up their great Ship; such as were saved remaining our Prisoners, and others fled home to give an Account of their Overthrow. What may be the effect of these sad times, God only knows: Our first Fears were concerning our Slaves, those Irreconcilable and yet Intestine Enemies of ours, who are no otherwise our Subjects than as the Whip makes them; who seeing our strongest Houses demolished, our Arms broken, and hearing of the destruction of our greatest Dependency,", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-03", "created": "2025-10-03", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_jacob/Anonymous - 1693 - The truest and largest account of the late earthquake in Jamaica, June the 7th. 1692. written by a r_page_10.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1522, "total-output-tokens": 798, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 3421, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
