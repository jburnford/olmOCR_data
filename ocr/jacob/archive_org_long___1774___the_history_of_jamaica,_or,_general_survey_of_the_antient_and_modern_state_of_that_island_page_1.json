The proclamation had restricted the delinquents to such fees alone, \"as had been established on proper authority.\" But they had no authority whatever, except their own will and pleasure, for establishing their exorbitancies; these were even founded neither on usage nor prescription; for I have shewn, that they had not existed above twenty-one years. They had originally arisen by trifling deviations from the act of 1711; so small at first, perhaps, as not to deserve opposition; or so modestly demanded, as not to provoke it: at length, they grew to surpass all limits, and were neither required, nor paid, without frequent altercation and dispute. Had this then any colour in it of legal usage? The only proper authority, on which their just fees could be established, was some known law: the law of 1711, which regulated and declared their fees, was this proper authority; there existed no other law for the purpose. With respect then to Jamaica, it follows, that, by the very terms of the proclamation, they were tied down to demand and take no other fees than what that law allowed them. Is it not strange, therefore, that, in less than a twelvemonth following this positive injunction, the opinion and judgement of things should, upon an interested misrepresentation, be so totally changed and perverted, as to suspend the effects of the proclamation; to concur with the parties in deeming the law obsolete; and, further, even to ratify such exactions, intemperate as they were beyond all bounds.\n\n\"moving from their offices, and directing the attorney-general to prosecute, all such officers, or their deputies, as should take or receive other than their legal fees.\" In July, 1765, his excellency informed the attorney-general, \"that he must not proceed to trial of the informations against the public officers, as a copy of the report of the lords of trade and plantations, to the lords committee of the privy-council, was come to his hands; and that he daily expected, in consequence thereof, an order from the king in council to himself, to put a stop to the prosecutions.\" Not long after this, the attorney-general received an official letter from his excellency, commanding him \"to enter noli prosequi on all the informations; his majesty's order in council for that purpose being then arrived.\"", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-03", "created": "2025-10-03", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_jacob/Long - 1774 - The history of Jamaica, or, general survey of the antient and modern state of that island_page_1.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1476, "total-output-tokens": 625, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 2780, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
