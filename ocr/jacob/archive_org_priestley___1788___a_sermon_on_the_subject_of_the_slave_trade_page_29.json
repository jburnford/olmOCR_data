Thus Christ may be said, in a literal sense, to have preached liberty to the captives, by his religion leading to the emancipation of slaves.\n\nChristianity teaches us to consider all mankind as brethren, equally the subjects of God's moral government here, and alike heirs of immortality hereafter. Now, whether it can be proved that these principles necessarily lead to the emancipation of slaves or not (any more than they lead to take away all inequalities among men, those of rich and poor, masters and servants, &c.) yet they will certainly lead us to give every individual of the human race equal, at least sufficient, advantages for improving his nature, and preparing for a future state.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-03", "created": "2025-10-03", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_jacob/Priestley - 1788 - A sermon on the subject of the slave trade_page_29.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1338, "total-output-tokens": 245, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 1037, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
