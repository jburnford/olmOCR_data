And if so, or if there should be found any other Motive to proceed so far, I cannot think it altogether impossible but that suitable Means and proper Regulations may be thought on. However, the Advantages that may arise from any Trade can never be fully known but by Experience: and this in particular, as it will be among a rich People, plenteous in Money, affords at present as fair a Prospect as any.\n\nIf then a License for this Spanish Trade should be deemed adviseable, as I hope it will, it may be no unprofitable Part to consider, upon what Terms our Merchants are like to stand, with relation to those of France, who do carry on, and will still continue the Trade against them.
