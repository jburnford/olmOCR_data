Plut.\n\nAs wee set vp meate from cats and dogges: so we must take heed, what we speake before newes mongers, and insinuating intelligencers. idem.\n\nAs our bodies are more indangered by the Spring, & in Autume, by reason of change: so all noveltie doth offend and hurt the common-wealth.\n\nAs change of meate, drinke and aire doth offend, albeit it be into like, or into better: so it is better still to retaine our old Princes and Magistrates, than to gape for new, because all insuation is full of danger and disturbance.\n\nAs Ajax called Homer from the dead, for some other cause, but to know from what parentage he was descended: so many take great pains, and bestow much cost, onely to heare newes, and knownovelties.
