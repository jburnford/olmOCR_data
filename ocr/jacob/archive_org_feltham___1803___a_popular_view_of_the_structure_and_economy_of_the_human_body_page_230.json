In a new-born infant the pulse is about 134 in a minute; in middle age from 60 to 80; in extreme old age from 50 to 24. In Greenland, the body is exposed, during long winters, to such cold, that the pulse is reduced to 40 or 50 strokes in a minute.\n\nTo the circulation of the blood, rightly and equally performed, we are indebted for life, health, and at last gradual decay. But if by any means the blood in its rotatory motion should be impeded or disturbed, it will become the fruitful cause of diseases and death. So long as the blood and humours of the body are in circulation, life\n\n* The pulse is not affected by electricity, unless by the impulse of shocks, or the irritation of sparks; yet Cavallo and others have asserted to the contrary; but later and more accurate experiments have decided that the pulse is not in the least influenced either by negative or positive electricity. Mr. Wilkinson, from repeated trials, never observed any increase in the circulation, See Note to page 199. on this subject.", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-03", "created": "2025-10-03", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_jacob/Feltham - 1803 - A popular view of the structure and economy of the human body_page_230.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1292, "total-output-tokens": 325, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 1307, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
