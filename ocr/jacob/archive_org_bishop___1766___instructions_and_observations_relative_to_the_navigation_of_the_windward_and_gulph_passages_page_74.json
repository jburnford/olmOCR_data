Within this Point, to the westward, his Majesty's ship *Raifonable* was lost, off Fort and Point Gardie; this Point therefore must be avoided. Here we were informed that the Admiral and Fleet were at anchor in *Diamond Cove* or *Road*.\n\nThe *Diamond Rock*, which lays more than a mile from the shore, bears from *Point Saline* W. N. W. distance 7 or 8 miles. The aforesaid Rock is high and round, and to the N. W. of it is *Diamond Cove* or *Bay*, where we found his Majesty's Fleet at anchor, the 16th of January 1762, under the command of Rear Admiral Rodney, and the next day we landed his Majesty's Troops in *Caf's Navire Bay*; but as the *Antigua* Brig. was ordered to the northward, I chose to go with her, in order to go to *Jamaica*, and so we proceeded to *Guadaloupe*, where we found a sloop from *Lisbon*, from Capt. Johnston of the *Hornet*, which gave us an account of a Spanish War, and the Captain gave me a Copy of the King of Spain's Declaration. As the Lieutenant Governor sent the Brigantine back to *Martinico*, I thought it my best way to go back with her; but as a ship then at *Guadaloupe* (the *Alexander*, Captain Atkinson) was ready, or would be in two or three days, I was determined to secure myself a passage, and agreed with him, in case I should be disappointed at *Martinico*, as it happened", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-03", "created": "2025-10-03", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_jacob/Bishop - 1766 - Instructions and observations relative to the navigation of the windward and gulph passages_page_74.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 1, "total-input-tokens": 1476, "total-output-tokens": 387, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 1331, 1]], "primary_language": ["en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true], "rotation_correction": [0], "is_table": [false], "is_diagram": [false]}}]
