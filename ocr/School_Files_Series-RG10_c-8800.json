Canon H.G. Cook, D.D.,\n102 Bank Street,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Canon Cook:\n\nMiss Katherine Gull - Waswanipi Band\n\nWe have a suggestion from Bishop Benson that this girl be assisted to train as a nurse or teacher.\n\nIt is suggested that this girl be sent to Moose Factory for a year's apprenticeship to be served in your hospital and residential school. If at the end of that time she shows the necessary progress, aptitude, and interest she will be considered for employment in the Government hospital there. As far as teaching is concerned it has yet to be demonstrated that Miss Gull's abilities lie in this field and she should not be entrusted with the usual duties of a teacher in a residential school.\n\nThe suggested arrangement between your administration and this Department is that you should provide room and board and training under qualified instructors and the Department will pay the girl's transportation from Waswanipi to Moose Factory and return and the sum of $30 a month to the hospital patron of which she shall pay to the girl $10 a month as pocket money. The monthly payments are to be claimed quarterly through our Superintendent at Aosee, Que. The agreement may be terminated by either party after a month's notice.\n\nWe are writing to the girl to determine whether she will accept this offer of room and board, training, and $10 a month.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Shelton,\nChief, Education Division.\nSeptember 16, 1949.\n\nMr. H. Lariviere,\nSupt. of Indian Agency,\nAmos, Que.\n\nKatherine Gull - Waswanipi Band\n\nEnclosed is a copy of the letter to this Indian girl.\n\nWhen you receive from her the answer that she is prepared to accept the proposal which is made in this letter, please make arrangements for her to proceed to Moose Factory.\n\nThere is, of course no guarantee that this experiment will be successful. A year from now the girl may not wish to continue at Moose Factory, but if she returns to our service at Waswanipi she will be better equipped to work there.\n\nThis arrangement is being made in accordance with the view that any Indians who are to be employed as assistants to nurses or teachers require more schooling and directed training.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\nOctober 6th, 1949\n\nTo The Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Your No. 42074-3 (E1)\n\nOctober 6th, 1949\n\nRe: Miss. Kathleen Gull, attached hereto copy of letter to Miss. Gull, which speaks for itself.\n\nI doubt letter will reach her now, before late December or later.\n\nH. Lariviere - Supt. Indian Agency\nOctober 13th, 1948\n\nTo Miss. Kathleen Gull (Katherine)\nWassanipi Post,\nc/o Hudson's Bay Company,\nvia Bennetboro, Que.\n\nPlease forward to Wassanipi lst. mail: (cover marked)\n\nDear Miss. Gull,\n\nI regret to say it is impossible for the Department to allow you, more than $10.00 per month, for class of work - training at an hospital or equal.\n\nThe offer, is the same as for the other girls, now at La Tigue.\n\nLet me know by first mail, if you accept or not. The $10.0 allowance, is for your sundry needs; you get your board, living free, as at La Tigue.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH. Lariviere - Supt.

My husband and I have talked and thought over everything most conscientiously, looking at it from all angles. We have come to the conclusion that we would rather send our children to the day school in Cardston, Building on the Reserve, adjacent to the school. It will not interfere with my husband working the farm. Please be good enough to take it up with the Department of Indian Affairs for me. The Dept. is doing its best to educate and civilize us. We have done our utmost to profit by what teaching we have received.\n\nAs a mother, I feel that I am capable of raising my children up.\nin a clean healthy home environment, which is so essential to the molding of their characters, enabling them to take their places in the world as useful men and women. We have outlived the state of depending on others to raise our children for us. Furthermore we are not asking the Dept. for any grant for the boys. Whereby their consent to send them to the day school realizing it is to be entirely at our own expense. Trusting you will do what is best in the matter.\n\nI am,\n\nYours Truly,\nEthel Phil Feathers\nBlood Indian Reserve,\nCardston, Alta.\nAug 16th 1938.\n\nThe Minister of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;-\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nI feel at liberty to ask a request of you, that is, may I be permitted to have my boy of six yrs. old go to school in town here at Cardston day school.\n\nMy reasons are, we live right next to town, and thought would be very convenient for a little child of six to go to a day school than to a boarding or Residential school.\n\nOur medical Doctor for the Indians on the Reserve estimated that there are 350 cases of tuberculosis and eye diseases.\nin those two Residential schools on the Blood Indian Reservation, therefore it is not safe to put a little child in.\n\nIt is in these schools that these contagious diseases spread. A child five or six years old cannot look after her or himself and don't get the necessary food such as eggs, butter, & milk sufficiently to grow strong. And also there is too much confinement in a boarding school.\n\nMy aim is to maintain the good health of my child and get good education.\n\nTrusting and hoping my sincere desire would be fulfilled promptly before the schools start again.\n\nI would promise to stand all necessary expenses, without\nyour aid.\n\nI am yours very sincerely,\n\nMrs. Emil Small Face.\nBlood Agency,\nCardston,\nAug. 26th\n\nMr. Pugh,\nIndian Agent:\nDear Sir:\n\nKindly forgive my imposing on your time and attention in this manner; my reason for doing so I may state as follows:\u2014 After reading Mr. Hoey's circular, stating that all residents of Indian schools are to be deprived of any holiday, other than the two months in the summer, I beg of you to be good enough to look it up with Mr. Hoey for me, asking for the privilege of sending my\nboys to St. Paul's Anglican School, as day pupils. I would like to remind you what you took it up with the Dept. before for me, and there was no objection. I thought that still stood good. And have been sending my boys for the day since! You know we live close to the school, and they are always on time.\n\nIt has always been the aim of the Indian Dept. to educate us and encourage each one to have homes of their own, and be capable of bettering our living conditions. I feel that some of us have realized that state of depending on the Dept. and Church to look after our children. We are prepared to shoulder the expense of educating\nfeeding and clothing our children. There by having the Govt. grant for some one else.\n\nThere are exceptions to every rule, and Mr. Pugh I don't feel I am asking for anything out-of-the-way. I want to raise my children in a good home atmosphere, which is so essential to the moulding of their characters. Furthermore I want to give my boys the encouragement I feel so important to their art. Mr. Holy has already seen not Gerald's work. If they had been home with me, that talent would never have been developed. As you know I had a very hard time getting lessons for them, and had to make head work to sell, to keep them...\nThey do not have any chance of practicing their art at school.\n\nThat being one of the reasons, I wish to keep them home. I am most anxious for my children, and I am hoping they will succeed and be able to make a living by their art in the future. Wishing you could give this your very earnest consideration.\n\nI am\n\nYour Truly\n\n& Tailfeathers\nBlood Reserve\nAug 20th 1948\n\nMr. J. Puck\nIndian Agent\nDear Sir,\n\nHaving learnt just lately of a circular letter to the Principal Canon Middleton of the new regulations about the Compulsory Commitment of our children to a three hundred and five day residence at St Paul's School, and having had your permission and Canon Middleton of the privilege of having my children home with us every week end, a privilege which we my wife & myself are very grateful and one which...\nWe have never failed in returning our children back to school each week at the appointed time.\n\nWe will feel very keenly being deprived of the company and presence of our children at our home on certain occasions such as Xmas, New Year and at Easter.\n\nWe very humbly ask the Government to take into their earnest consideration the reason why we do wish to have our children at home after school hours - to train them how to work and take interest in the farm, milking cows and raising pigs and gardens so that when they grow up they will be able to go ahead in their own homes to make successful farmers or stockmen and in the case of...\nthe girl successful housekeeper when they leave us to make homes of their own.\n\nWe are deeply grateful of the help the government has done for all of us in the matter of education, but we are deeply concerned over the matter of how they spend their time after school hours.\n\nWe therefore ask the government permission for our children to be able to attend public schools at our own expense so that we may have the happy company of our children each night.\n\nWe thank you.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nJames and Janie\n\nGladstone\nBlood Indian Agency,\nCarleton, Alta., September 1st, 1938.\n\nSir:\n\nAttention Mr. R.A. Hoey,\n\nI wish to acknowledge your file of the 25th ultimo, No. 103-105, together with enclosure of letter from Mrs. Emil Small Face of the Blood Indian Reserve, and having reference to the admission of a child to the Carleton Public School.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that this same subject matter has occupied considerable time and thought, and I enclose herewith letters also from Mrs. Fred Tail Feathers, No. 308, and James Gladstone, No. 142, of the Blood Band, together with a letter from the Secretary of the Carleton School District, No. 457.\n\nIt would appear that the School Regulations, No. 150-37, dated March 30th, 1937, with reference to holidays etc., has provoked the idea of children going to outside schools, and as a consequence the Indians referred to above approached me, except for Mrs. Small Face and Mrs. C. Davis, No. 100, and Chris Shade, No. 270. The Davis case was referred to the Department in letter No. 402-11B, dated February 10th, 1936.\n\nIt will be noted from the Carleton School Board District Secretary that both high and public schools at Carleton are congested, and therefore, any application of the Indians in this respect is useless for this school year.\n\nI am, however, of the opinion that a careful study of the letters sent into this office by the Indians might be made by the Department for future guidance.\n\nI am bound to make comment on the statement made by Mrs. Small Face that \"350 cases of T.B. and eye disease exist in our two residential schools. These figures can be taken from Dr. Wall's trachoma report and the Central Sanatorium Clinic report for T.B.\"\n\nAny further information in this connection will be gladly furnished if required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nJ.E.

It occurs to me that owing to the kindly interest the Department has already taken in this Student's ability, that an application for a grant of $75.00 be placed before the Department for his support & maintenance in order to benefit by the scholarship he has so meritoriously gained.\n\nMr. T. Hamilton, Inspector of School also endorses this request and recommends him as an artist of unusual ability.\n\nIn view of the policy now being inaugurated by the Department of additional Vocational Training, am rather inclined to believe they will be pleased to assist this worthy student towards this and still higher enterprises.\n\nEarnestly seeking your co-operation and recommendation.\"\n\nSgd S.H Middleton.\nPrincipal.\n\nI am also enclosing a cutting from the Lethbridge Herald showing a photograph of Gerald Tail Feathers and also a list of the other winners.\n\nIf the Department have funds available for the purpose as mentioned in the above letter, I would be glad to recommend that this allowance be granted so the student Gerald Tail Feathers may be able to take advantage of the Course which he has won.\n\nI will be glad to receive the Department's decision in this matter so that I may inform the Principal and Student as soon as possible.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nSecretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept of Mines & Resources\nOttawa.\n\nActing Indian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJuly 9, 1941.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn view of the contents of your letter of the 2nd instant it has been decided to allow a grant of $75.00 for Gerald Tail Feathers in order to enable him to attend the art school at Banff during the month of August.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. A.

Fethers is taking his scholarship course.\n\nAm strongly of the opinion that the student should be given the privilege of attending the Institute of Technology in Calgary during the coming school session.\n\nWould appreciate your continued recommendation to the department for at least a continuance of the School grant to be paid in his favour.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nS.H.M. / MJ.\nPrincipal.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6486, file 42103-3, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nBlood Indian Agency\nCardston.\nSeptember 15th 1941\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to advise that I have received the enclosed letter from Canon Middleton with a letter from Donald Cameron Director of the Banff Fine School of Arts, regarding the future education of Gerald Tail Feathers, along the course mentioned in Mr Cameron's letter.\n\nI find that the only request asked is for the school grant which would go to the St Paul's Indian Residential School be allowed to this boy to assist in the expenses necessary for him to attend the Institute of Technology in Calgary. This boy if he did not go there would still be drawing grant at the School on the Reserve.\n\nI would recommend that the grant which would be paid to St Paul's School for Gerald T Feathers be allowed to be used for the purpose mentioned above.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nSecretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept of Mines & Resources.\nOttawa,\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6486, file 42103-3, part 1)\nOttawa,\nSeptember 25, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 15th instant requesting further assistance for Gerald Tail Feathers.\n\nPlease let me have complete information regarding the course which he would follow if he attended the Institute of Technology in Calgary. You should also let me know the duration of the course. Is it only for one year or would it be for a longer period?\n\nI may say that some of this boy's work was shown to a representative of the Carnegie Foundation. He expressed the opinion that Gerald Tail Feathers required very little additional instruction. It was his opinion that all that was required would be to supply the boy with materials and allow him to choose his own subjects.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. A.

I took this up with Canon Middleton and the following extract from his reply covers the case, it is as follows.\n\n\"The course recommended for him to take was suggested by two eminent artists, Mr Glude and Mr Phillips who were Instructors at the Banff Art School during August. The course is of ten weeks duration. Cost of Tuition $35.00, materials $25.00 Board & Lodging $45.00 per month Personal expenses $25.00 making a total of $175.00 for the complete Course. His instructors strongly recommend that he takes this further instruction, and at the expiration of the term he would be able to assume full responsibility for his personal desire. As stated in my former letter the continuance of the School grant for one year would meet the need.\n\nI understand from the Canon that in the event of this student not taking this course that he would still be attending School as a pupil, and if this is so the Grant would be paid for him any way, the Canon has informed me that any expenses over and above the grant that would be allowed for this student will be taken care of by the School.\n\nIf this is satisfactory to you and the Department, I would recommend that this pupil be given the further Course as requested by Canon Middleton.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept of Mines & Resources\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nOctober 16, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 5th instant with reference to Gerald Tail Feathers.\n\nIt is noted that the Principal is willing to co-operate with the Department in regard to the expense of the boy taking a course at the Institute of Technology in Calgary. His name may be retained on the return of the Blood Residential School and grant will be paid for him to June 30, 1942.

The charge of $10.00 for school supplies should show the exact books, from whom they were secured and, of course, the account should be receipted by the person from whom the books were bought.

Hoey, Esq., Dept. of Welfare & Training, File No. 102-103, dated 16th October, 1941, where the boy's name was allowed to be carried on the returns of the Blood Indian Residential School (this should be St. Paul's Anglican Residential School) with the grant paid till June 30th, 1942, and that I could not feel like recommending his request after the instructions laid down in the above letter.\n\nCanon Middleton has asked me for a Departmental ruling in regard to further assistance to this boy and I am enclosing correspondence from him on this subject.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAnthony McMillan,\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nEnc.\n\nT.R.D.

I am enclosing also copy of a letter written by me to Canon Middleton. The subject matter of this letter you will note is self-explanatory.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hosy,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nAnthony McMillan, Esq.,\nClerk in Charge,\nCARDSTON,\nAlberta.\nOttawa, August 3, 1942.\n\nDear Canon Middleton:\n\nRE: Tuition Grant - Gerald Tail Feathers.\n\nActing Indian Agent Anthony McMillan has sent forward for Departmental consideration your letter to him dated April 25th and a copy of a letter received by you from J. Fowler, Principal of the Calgary Institute of Technology and Art.\n\nI find it somewhat difficult to reach a definite decision in respect to the Tuition Grant requested for Gerald Tail Feathers. It is, as you know, exceedingly difficult these days to secure the funds necessary to maintain our regular services and there are a great many promising Indian boys and girls throughout the Dominion for whose education we have made no provision whatever. These children must of necessity have very first claim on the funds available.\n\nI can readily understand the Principal of the Institute wanting Gerald Tail Feathers to continue with his studies. Our experience here is that when Indian pupils are sent to such Institutions the Principals in charge always put forth a supreme effort to keep them as long as they possibly can. I regret to state, however, that a number of the students who have completed a course of study, particularly in music, have not made an outstanding success of their lives. I should like to know, therefore, if Gerald Tail Feathers has any clearly defined educational objective in mind. Is it his intention to complete a course that will enable him to take up commercial art or does he intend to return to the Reserve with the object of doing a certain amount of art work from time to time by way of recreation? It so happens that I have one or two relatives engaged in commercial art and I know from their experience that up until a year or so ago it was exceedingly difficult to secure remunerative employment. Incidentally, when a representative of the Carnegie Institute or Rockefeller Foundation, I cannot state definitely, visited Ottawa a couple of years ago\n\nReverend Canon S. H. Middleton,\nPrincipal, St. Paul's Residential School,\nCARNSTON,\nAlberta.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6486, file 42103-3, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nand inspected the two paintings that Gerald Tail Feathers had sent forward to the Department; this man expressed the view that all Gerald Tail Feathers needed was the oils, canvas, etc., necessary for him to select his subjects and do a certain amount of painting. I was naturally surprised at this expression of opinion and questioned this representative more closely. His idea was that Gerald Tail Feathers was enough of an artist to select his own subjects and develop into a reasonably good Indian artist or portrait painter. His final statement was, \"I know of no school or institution at the moment to which I would send this boy\". Now it is just possible that this man did not have in mind commercial art. It is likely that it was his opinion that Tail Feathers would remain on the Reserve and do a certain amount of painting as a hobby from time to time. In view of these facts, I would like a more definite statement from you in respect to this boy's future. Would it be possible to learn from the Principal if, as a result of another year's instruction, this boy will be better equipped to secure a position or if he has simply completed one year of a long, drawn-out course?\n\nA great deal too depends upon this boy's temperament and his physical condition. I have nothing before me to indicate that this boy wants to become an artist. I have learned from experience, however, that so long as the Department is prepared to pay the costs, boys attending these high schools are prepared to remain at them almost indefinitely.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you could spare the time necessary to discuss this matter with the Indian Agent and let me have a definite recommendation just as soon as you can conveniently do so.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nAn Indian's Part in the War\n\nBy ALLEN TAIL FEATHERS.\n\nOne of the educational projects recently undertaken by the Jane Macary Chapter, I.O.D.E., was a prize offered to the student who would write an essay for the School on the Blood Reserve for an essay on an Indian's part in the war. The contest was named for Miss Jane Macary, so closely connected with St. Paul's Indian School.\n\nFirst prize in the contest was a $50 W.W.II Victory Bond, which was won by Allen Tail Feathers, aged 14 years, Grade 9, Dorchester School, 14 years old, in Grade 8, and was given to Chief Moon.\n\nOn Sept. 16, 1877, near Calgary, on the Blood Reserve, a treaty was in progress. You will wonder what it all about. It was between the Canadian government and the Blackfoot tribe. It was a treaty to banish all warfare between the Indians and the white men were to help them in every way. This treaty was signed by Chief Moon on Sept. 22, 1877.\n\nThen came September, 1938, the world was rudely awakened with the stunning news that war was once again in progress. Adolf Hitler, the dictator, had broken his promises and started another war because of it. He broke all promises and marched into Poland, which became Britain's ally. France declared war.\n\nEvery Canadian knew that it was a grave hour of danger, so they immediately started to launch Victory drives, and buy Victory Loans, Victory Bonds and War Savings Certificates.\n\nNow that the British Empire is in a critical position, even Canada has realized its duty to help win this war. Those who cannot go overseas are doing their bit in their own little way. How? By donating all they can to the Red Cross, War Savings Certificates, Bonds and War Savings Certificates, buying Victory Loans, luxuries and sacrificing some of the necessary articles that may serve by buying every scrap of rubber, tin, iron and paper.\n\nHere comes the time when Indian comes in. The Indians of the Dominion of Canada are doing everything possible to help win this war. They do not want to be seen as a separate race or a nationality. Many Indians, all over the Dominion, have joined and answered the Canadian Army Overseas. The women are trying to get in the women's army. From the Blood Reserve, Cardston, 12 boys have volunteered for the army. Four are now in the Officer Cadet Corps, four more in the first line defence of Britain. Many more have enlisted from other Indian Reserves in Canada.\n\nAt the same Blood Reserve, the children are doing their part, and as a result of this, two hundred dollars from the community funds were given to help buy munitions so vital to Britain's great cause. These Indians are doing willingly, sensing the danger of subjugation by the Axis Powers, if they do their part.\n\nAnother incident brings us to Nelson, B.C., where there are 1,000 Indians. They do not live on a Reserve but represent the residential movement. These Indians decided they would support their relief agency, the Red Cross, by selling stamps, under a ruthless dictator.\n\nThere are Indians working in factories, air plants, munition plants and lumber camps. These Indians, however, are very anxious, dreading the possibility of domination by the Japanese, who are now coming down the B.C. coast.\n\nThe Indians are collecting money for help towards the soldiers now fighting for their lives. On the Blood Reserve they collect money by having dances and sports. They are also buying stamps towards buying cigarettes for the Indians in the Army from St. Paul's school.\n\nThe women on the Reserves are sewing clothes, knitting garments for the people in Britain, who are being bombed and starved and having all their belongings ruined. There are many Indian women's societies, which, in turn, are helping the Red Cross.\n\nThere are many more incidents taking place all over the Dominion. The Indians of North America have always been loyal to the British Crown during the pioneer days and are proving it in these trying times.\n\nLet us realize that it is our duty to help, by enlisting, by buying stamps, by buying salvage, so that the Axis powers, who are killing our lives, the lives of every decent nation, with subjugation and dictatorship, will\nSt. Paul's Residential School\nRev.

Welfare Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nReference No. 103-103\n\nI appreciate very much your kindness in writing with regard to G.T. Fethers. Have discussed the whole question with Mr. McMillan.\n\nI have the same reaction to these cases as yourself, and for that reason have long since ceased to pass on recommendations wherever there was an issue of doubt.\n\nGerald is an exception to the general rule. Basically, he is an artist -- not one of the \"Slap-dash\" variety, but temperamentally ranks far higher than the average.\n\nHe has gained for himself many friends in and around the Art Schools he has attended, and all the Instructors remark about his native and acquired talent towards a successful career.\n\nThere is no danger of his \"returning to the Blankets\" idea. He is too fastidious in personality. I mean by that, his whole outlook on life is essentially \"White.\" His mother, (a very forceful character for good), was the best educated person amongst the Bloods, and she left an indelible impression for ambition in her children.\n\nI would say, with utter candour, that any interest, financial or otherwise, expended on Gerald at the present juncture, will ultimately rebound to the public at large.\nThe Principal of the Technical Institute, also two of the Faculty, assured me last Spring that if Gerald could have one more year's tuition, he would be qualified for any position in the realm of Art, commercial or otherwise.\n\nIt has been his desire and ambition for years past to qualify as an artist, chiefly because of his natural ability and general outlook. His health is the best possible.\n\nI would strongly recommend that the Grant be continued in his favour for the School Year 1942-43.\n\nIn order to convey to you a more comprehensive picture of the family, I have attached, herewith, an Essay written by Gerald's younger brother now here in School. A leading Barrister in Lethbridge acted as examiner of the Essays, and awarded the prizes accordingly. Much interest has been aroused by the excellence of the article. Feel sure you will be interested to read it.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSHM/PMH\n\nPrincipal.\n\nEnd.\nOttawa, August 13, 1942.\n\nRe: Tuition Grant - Gerald Tailfeathers.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMay I refer to your letter of July 27, 1942, in which you ask for a departmental ruling in respect to additional aid for the marginally noted pupil.\n\nThe Department has been in communication with Canon Middleton, Principal of the St. Paul's Anglican Residential School, with respect to the courses of study already completed by this pupil and the desirability of additional departmental help. Canon Middleton states that the Principal of the Technical Institute and also two of the Faculty have assured him that if Gerald Tail Feathers could have one more year's tuition he would be qualified for any position in the realm of Art, commercial or otherwise. Canon Middleton recommends that the grant be continued for the year 1942-43.\n\nIn view of the information contained in the Principal's letter, the grant will be allowed for the coming academic year, on the definite understanding that no further assistance by way of tuition grants will be extended to this pupil. Either you or the Principal, or both of you, therefore, should discuss this matter with Gerald Tail Feathers and acquaint him with the decision reached by the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

She is very neat, white appearing girl of good manners and morals and is highly recommended by Archdeacon Middleton for higher education.\n\nI have talked with the girl and her parents and have mentioned the possible need on this agency for an Indian girl stenographer; they are all very enthused over this possible position.\n\nMiss Davis should attend a good school for at least two more years, however, possibly specializing in commercial subjects. She wishes to attend Alberta College, Edmonton, this year and I have advised them to put in their application for room and admittance at once.\n\nThis letter is written to recommend that Miss Davis be given any assistance available from the Department for higher education; she deserves any help the Department may see fit to give and I am sure would, after schooling, make a very efficient stenographer. This girl wishes to begin school Sept. 1st and your immediate advice would be appreciated.\n\n(sgd.) R. D.

However, I know the young lady and her parents. She is mixed Blood with very little showing of Indian blood. Her parents are very well to do farmers on the Blood Reserve, but have had the misfortune in the past year of heavy losses in cattle during the winter and hailed out crop this summer. Though they might be capable of financing the higher education of their child, it will be much more of a struggle than under normal conditions. She is the type that would fit in very nicely at an agency.\n\nWould consideration be given to send her to the Alberta College? Preference to that institution is undoubtedly due to the fact that there are other Indian girls in attendance.\n\nG. H.

Mr. Laurie submitted a memo to show what Allan has already accomplished and to explain the University of Alberta's faculty of education system. Copy of this memo is attached hereto.\n\nIt is contended that Tail Feathers will get there by taking the 1 year normal school course.\n\nMr. Laurie does not think Allan would ever teach in a single room day school but has ambitions to get on the staff of a grade school.\n\nHis mother was a very intelligent mixed blood and Allan shows very little trace of Indian blood. His father is no help and in fact is a demoralizing influence. When on the reserve, Allan lives with an uncle, who has helped him materially while at high school.\n\nI believe this young man deserves some assistance now. He has more claims than are necessary to enter the first year course. His application has been submitted to the University in the hope that it will be accepted.\n\nAs stated in my letter of August 22, he asked for a grant of $300.00 (copy herewith). If you cannot see fit to give a larger grant, he may still find a way to finance the difference.\n\nI do recommend that he be assisted.\n\n[Signature]\n\nG. T.

Applicant's name: Allan Paul Leathers\n\n2. Age: 20\n   Weight: 158 lbs\n   Height: 5'6\"\n\n3. Has applicant any defect or deformity of body or limb? Yes\n\n4. Has applicant any defect of vision? Yes\n   Of hearing? Yes\n\n5. Applicant should be examined at nearest T.B. centre and report attached.\n\nDate: September 4th, 1947\n\nSignature: [Signature]\n\n44-7-502-2\nAllan came to the Crescent Heights High School as a student on probation. Coming from an Indian School, he naturally had no certificates for Junior High School leaving. His training was defective in Mathematics, Science, and Languages as basic work in these subjects is given in the Junior High School Program (Grades 7,8,9).\n\nAt my request the Department of Education granted him probationary standing in English, Social Studies, Health and P.E., Art, and General Shop of the first year of the Senior High School Program. These were confirmed at the end of his first year of Crescent Heights on the basis of work done in that year, 1944-45.\n\nIn 1944-45 Allan passed the maximum number of credits allowed by the Department of Education. The Alberta system does not permit a student to take 2 sciences or 2 mathematics in this year. He was able therefore to take English, Social Studies, Health, Physical Ed., and Art of the second year high school course but was still required to take 1 science, 1 math, and 1 language of the first year. This put him a year behind in those subjects.\n\nIn 1945-46 he was able to take third year English, Social Studies, and Algebra and Chemistry. He was required to take a second year math, Geometry 1 which is a prerequisite to Trig. He failed in Chemistry and repeated it in 1946-47.\n\nIn 1946-47 he still had to complete his Matriculation by completing Trig, Physics 2, Latin 3 and Chemistry 2.\n\nAlberta does not recognize any such standing as Junior Matriculation, as does B.C., but compels all students to complete 3 years of Senior High School. Alberta does not recognize a one-year Teacher Training Course except the emergency course necessary during the war when the shortage of teachers became acute. A temporary one year course is given the successful completion of which allows a person to teach for two years in a one-room school, with grades not exceeding grade 6. Students above that grade must take the correspondence course for grades 7 or 8, provided by the Department under supervision of the head teacher. Grade 9 is not permitted. This permit must be enlarged upon by attendance at two summer schools to permit the teacher to continue. The course is therefore valueless, as it lapses after 2 years.\n\nThere is a two-year course giving license to teach up to and including grades 8, 9, and 9, provided that the holder enlarges his certificate by attendance at summer schools. He must also take certificates of competency in the various optional subjects required by the Junior High School program (grades 7,8,9) in such subjects as Shop, Drama, Typing, Music and Art, and French. These certificates alone will require two summer schools.\n\nA 3-year course leading to a B.A. is provided by the University of Alberta. This also requires extension and enlargement for the optional subjects of the Senior High School program, much the same as those of the Junior High School program outlined above, but including P.T.\n\nA 4-year course leading to the degree of B.A., B. Educ. is provided by the University of Alberta. This qualifies the holder to teach any subject in any grade and implies specialists training. This is the only course worth taking if one intends to teach, and this is that we wish Allan to take.\n\nTeaching in one of the present Indian Schools is hardly an objective. The salary paid does not permit any saving and extremely poor training because of the half time system. The city of Calgary for example does not recognize as experience, time spent in an Indian school and will not employ such a teacher. (I can give examples)\n\nDiscrimination in the matter of salary is evident on the basis of training. A perusal of the Teachers Wanted advertisements will illustrate my point.

The Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, has authorized the payment of a tuition grant of $400.00 to assist this student through the academic year 1947/48. It is not known at the moment just how payment will be made, but I am writing Ottawa for this information today. Before a reply is received, Allan will, no doubt, be at the University.\n\nThis letter is written specifically to point out that all his fees, books, student union and other incidental costs will be met by this Department from his tuition grant. I trust that he may be supplied with these items as he needs them, on the understanding that they will be paid for as soon as the necessary instructions are received from our Branch.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG.

It is also possible that he might not find board and room, in which case he will have to take a room and eat his meals out.\n\nWill you please advise how this grant of $400.00 will be handled. It is presumed that all expenses covered in the attached letter will be met in full at the beginning, and that the balance of the grant will be issued on a monthly basis throughout the academic year. Will this be paid directly to Allan, or must other arrangements be made to account for it? Possibly a cheque could be mailed to Mr. Ryan at the Blood Agency and he could administer the funds on a monthly basis.\n\nYour advice by airmail would be appreciated.\n\nG. H.

It is a help, but certainly not nearly enough to cover the cost of one year at University. It is known that his friends are advancing him money. He is going to find it very difficult to get through even with their assistance. It is known here that no student can get by at less than $600.00. Could you not increase this assistance to $500.00, all of which would be required in the present fiscal year?\n\nAttached hereto is a clipping from the Calgary Herald of September 21st.

This means that for the current academic year the Department will pay an amount of $500 towards the cost of this boy's tuition.\n\nBernard F. Keary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MBD\nHarold Healy is a young blood Indian, who has shown considerable ability to do leathercraft work. During the past summer he saved sufficient harvest wages to pay for a course in leathercraft at the Alberta Institute of Technology and Art, Calgary. We were able to place him with the Great West Saddlery of Calgary, where he is serving an apprenticeship, and at the same time receiving night school instruction at the Tech.\n\nI am advised by the company that Harold is doing good work, that he is applying himself, and they are satisfied he intends to make it his career. He receives $60.00 per month during his apprenticeship period. This barely covers his board and room, clothing and incidentals, and he has no money with which to purchase the tools needed in his work.\n\nI am attaching a list of these tools. The prices quoted are subject to fluctuation, but the company will supply them at their laid down cost. It should be pointed out that the company does not supply tools to its workers. Most of them are employed on piece work and must supply their own tools just as a carpenter must supply his. They are imported from the United States, and unlike the amount asked for now in Canada, it is possible that they might run a few dollars in excess of this amount.\n\nHarold will likely require more tools later, but it is felt that if we can supply these now, he will soon be in a position where he will be earning more and he should be able to purchase his own tools then.\n\nI wish to recommend that this expenditure be made, and that we be advised as soon as possible as Harold has reached the stage where he cannot go on with some of the more intricate designs.\n\nG.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, December 11, 1947.\n\nMr. G. H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nRe Leathercraft Tools\n\nHarold Healy, Blood Indian Agency\n\nI have your letter of December 6, with list of stamping tools, etc., the cost of which would be in the neighborhood of $70.00. The name of the firm supplying these tools is not mentioned, but I believe the C.S. Osborne Company is the only firm from which such tools can be obtained.\n\nI am returning the list, together with an Osborne Catalogue, and it will be greatly appreciated if you will consult Mr. Douglas Hutchings as to the necessity of purchasing for a young man just starting out, the considerable number of tools listed. Unless there has been a change in personnel since the Toronto firm, Messrs. Adams and Adams, took over the Great West Saddlery, you will find that Mr. Hutchings is the Manager of that firm. I believe he is exceptionally well-informed on all matters pertaining to leather work, and it would be a great favour to us if he would be good enough to mark in the enclosed Catalogue the tools he considers are essential for young Healy at this time.\n\nTo a layman there would seem to be at least some duplication, and as an example I refer to Nos. 151 and 154. If No. 151 is supplied, it would not seem necessary to supply No. 154, and there may be other similar instances. I have made some inquiries, and as\na result am of the opinion that considerable time will elapse before all the tools listed are required. However, we are anxious to help Harold Healy, and if you can secure the assistance of Mr. Hutchings, the purchase of essential tools will doubtless be authorized either through the Departmental Purchasing Agent, or the Great West Saddlery.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nAttention: B. F. Neary\n\nRe: Leathercraft Tools - Harold Healy,\nBlood Indian Agency.\n\nIn reply to your 103-103 (W.T.6) of December 11th re the above, I might say that the firm through whom Great West Saddlery intend to purchase these tools is P. B. McMillan Tool Company of Kansas City, Missouri, and the catalogue numbers shown on the attached list, which I am returning, bear no relation whatsoever to the numbers shown in the Osborne catalogue.\n\nI am informed by the company that Mr. Douglas Hutchings is their General Manager, but he resides in Winnipeg. I asked Mr. Doyle, who is in charge of the Harness Department here, if there were any duplications in the list of tools he supplied. He said that from the point of view of a workman, there were no duplications; that some of the tools might appear to be duplications, but they stamped designs of different sizes, and that every tool listed is needed by Healy.\n\nWhen Mr. Doyle first went over the list, he estimated Healy's requirements at $138.00, but it was requested by this office that this figure be cut as much as possible. Mr. Doyle then arrived at the present list, representing the bare essentials required by Harold in his work.\n\nI am informed by Mr. Doyle that the boy is learning rapidly, and that his fellow workers are so much interested in his progress that they are temporarily loaning him their tools in order that he will not be unduly held up. The company officials are pleased with the boy's work. He is well liked by everyone at the plant, but somewhat reluctant to ask for the use of tools belonging to others.\n\nIt is recommended that the order be placed with the Great West Saddlery Company because they are in a position to obtain more rapid delivery on account of having had past dealings with the suppliers.\n\nI am returning your list of tools in accordance with your request.\n\nG.

Later they hoped to be able to take more children in the elementary classes as well as in the higher grades.

For a number of years efforts of a sort have been made to give these pupils the benefits and advantages of academic courses which our High School has to offer, but previously, something has always seemed to intervene to gum up negotiations and halt any real forward move. Apparently now the local and St. Mary's School Board, and the agencies that have to do with the Indians, have reached an amicable settlement and decision of all problems and the four young people, two young ladies, and two young men, are embarking on the path to higher and specialized education.\n\nWe feel that congratulations are due all around, that this achievement has been made. The local Board, under the Chairmanship of Art Landrigan, and the large Divisional Board, represented locally by John S. Smith, have made a real step forward. It would be too bad indeed not to share our facilities and advantages with our neighbors. The Indian population cannot justify a complete High School education, and in making our facilities available to the Indian students who desire to carry on in learning, we feel that a big step toward better understanding, greater confidence and closer friendship has been made.\n\nToo much cannot be said too, of the benefits of the two schools on the Reserve\u2014St. Paul's and St. Mary's\u2014for the fundamental training and teaching given to the Indian children, and we hope that as the students from the reserve come into our schools, that they will come with the encouragement and the benediction of their former teachers, who better than any others, understand and appreciate the true values of education in the life of individuals and nations.\n\nWhen these children finish their schooling, specialize for teachers in Agriculture, Manual Training, Domestic Science and the many other branches of specialized learning, there should be an invitation for them to return to their own people and through the use of this learning, enrich the lives of their relatives and neighbors, and thus build up and strengthen the standards we have reached today.\n\nMay we again express appreciation for the forward step taken and express the sincere hope that the lives of these students, pioneering as it were, in a new field, may find all of us, and our children, their companions in classes and recreation, ever ready to aid and assist in every way to make their days here pleasant, profitable and long remembered for kindness, thoughtfulness and consideration extended to them.\nDepartment of Mines and Resources, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Blood Indian Higher Education.\n\nWe are pleased to report that this office, in cooperation with the Cardston High School Board, enrolled four promising Blood Indian Students in the local High School as of the 1st of the month.\n\nTwo boys and two girls were enrolled as follows:\n\nRichard Fox, Age 15 (Anglican)\nTaking Agriculture, Science and English, Grade 9 and Math, Grade 8, with complete Shop work.\n\nWilfred Brave Rock, Age 16 (Anglican)\nTaking complete academic course, Grade 9.\n\nHazel Small Face, Age 15 (Anglican)\nTaking complete Academic Course, Grade 9.\n\nFrancis Eagle Child, Age 16 (R.C.)\nTaking complete Academic Course, Grade 9.\n\nWe were at the School yesterday and talked to the pupils and the teachers - after two weeks' perfect attendance the Principal tells me that the Indian pupils are doing very well and that the adjustment between the Indian and white pupil is progressing exceptionally well. The pupils, without exception, told me they found the work hard, but that they liked it and were very happy. Francis Eagle Child, in fact, has given a lecture on Indians before her Grade 9 class and the teacher tells me she won the respect of all pupils and that he was very proud of her. Needless to say, we are proud of the whole bunch and hope that this is only the beginning.\n\nNow as to costs. The Board has agreed to accept limited Indian pupils at a tuition cost of $85.00 per year not to exceed $100.00 per family. This means that tuition costs for the half year for our first pupils will be $42.50 each, or $170.00 - which is payable in advance. We are asking that the Department assume this cost for this year, and it is hoped that you can do so. A voucher, payable to the St. Mary's River School Division, No. 2, for this amount, is enclosed.\n\nMy big problem in starting these pupils was transportation. Hazel Small Face lives on the edge of the Reserve, next to town and she was no problem. The\nother three pupils however, live some miles away. Mr. Art Coady, senior teacher at the Blood Indian Residential School has children going into the Cardston School from eight miles out on the Reserve. We interviewed him and he agreed to transport Indian pupils to school and back, along with his own for $5 each per trip, providing we protected him with public liability insurance on his car. This I considered fair and have insured his car as a school bus for one year, Mr. Coady paying the fire and theft premium of $2.10 and the Indian parents, or Department to pay the balance of $58.90.\n\nRichard Fox and Francis Eagle Child are being transported by Mr. Coady each day at a cost of $5 each, or approximately $14.00 per month, or $70.00 for five months. If the parents assume this cost, we are requesting the Department to assume the $58.90 school bus insurance and enclose a voucher, with a copy of the policy, herewith.\n\nThe other pupil, Wilfred Brave Rock is traveling by train to and from school at a cost of $5 per trip; his father is bearing this cost.\n\nNext year, if all goes well, we hope to have enough students ready for higher education in the Cardston High School to require a School Bus, which we propose to ask the Department to furnish and maintain.\n\n(R.D.

Gooderham, Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies, CALGARY, Alta.\nFebruary 23, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nPlease note the attached correspondence dealing with Indian children attending the Cardston High School.\n\nThese are not the children mentioned by Archdeacon Middleton as he was objecting to pupils of grades seven and eight being sent to Cardston.\n\nWould you please return this correspondence here for our action when you have read it.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nMarch 1, 1949.\n\nMr. R.D. Regan,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nCardston, Alta.\n\nTuition Grants - Blood Agency\n\nThe tuition fees for the four Blood pupils at the Cardston High School have been passed to Treasury for action.\n\nI am pleased to read of the success which has met your negotiations with the Cardston High School Board and hope that the Indian children will attend regularly and do well in their studies.\n\nPlease find attached tuition grant forms for completion by each of these four students.\n\nWith regard to transportation expenses, it will be rather difficult to meet the Public Liability Insurance premium charges, and I would suggest that this payment be made from the parents' contributions towards tuition charges. We could meet a part of the daily transportation charges as this is a normal procedure in such cases.\n\nWe are not anxious to maintain school buses but would prefer to hire local contractors for this work. Therefore, I would suggest that you approach local bus operators when you are certain of the number of children who will be going to high school in Cardston next year.\n\nTo summarize, we approve entirely of the arrangements which you have made with regard to these children.\nbut would prefer that the premium charges be set out of the parents' contributions and that we, in turn, meet the transportation expenses. This is actually a reversal of the proposals in the third last paragraph of your letter.\n\nWhen you have the information regarding transportation, please communicate with us before making a final decision.\n\nBernard F. Legay,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n5th March, 1949.\n\nMr. R.D. Ragan,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nCardston, Alberta.\n\nIn view of the contents of my letter of\n1st March, 1949, I return herewith your Voucher\nNo. 122 covering the cost of the policy which you\nhave secured for public liability on school bus.\n\nYou should have waited for definite\nauthority before completing the arrangements for\nthe transportation of pupils. We will expect\nto receive an early reply to official letter of\n1st March, 1949.\n\nFr/ST\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nMarch 7, 1949.\n\nMr. R.D. Regan,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nCardston, Alberta.\n\nBlood Agency - Tuition Grants\n\nFor the purpose of inclusion in our Annual Report, we are endeavouring to ascertain the number of Indian children who are attending Provincial or Private Schools. A search of our files reveals the information shown on the attached list.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would supply the following information:\n\n(1) the age on September 1, 1948, of Rufus Good Striker and Agnes Shade;\n(2) the grade of Agnes Shade;\n(3) the age on September 1, 1948, the year and course of study being followed by Allan T. Fethers if he has returned to the University of Alberta.\n\nMoreover, if there are any other children in your agency who are attending Provincial or Private Schools during the current academic year and whose names do not appear on the list, would you please add their names together with the other data indicated in the headings.\n\nWhen the list has been thus completed, would you be kind enough to return it to this office, at your earliest convenience, so that our records will be accurate and complete.\n\nBernard F.

The Supt. stated that he had received a report from the School Superintendent to the effect that they were getting along fine and were adjusting themselves to their new surroundings in a highly satisfactory manner. They were also showing themselves to be very good students.\n\nSupt. stated that if he received enough applications for children to attend the Cardston High School next fall, he would ask the Department to supply a Van to take the children to and from school.\n\n(Ugd) A. D. Ragan,\nSuperintendent.\n\nCopied: V.S.\nExtract from the Minutes of a Meeting of the Blood Band Council held on March 8th, 1949.\n\nThe Supt. informed Council that the Department had agreed to supply transportation to and from the Carleton High School for any new pupils who wished to attend next fall. He urged the Council to see that any likely pupils who wished to attend High School, availed themselves of this opportunity next fall.\n\n(Sgd) R. D. Ragan\nSuperintendent.\n\nCopied: V.S.\nDepartment of Mines and Resources, Indian Affairs Branch, OTTAWA, Ont.\n\nRe: Higher Education - Blood Reserve.\n\nWe have your letter of the 1st instant, file 756-22 (E) regarding four pupils now attending Cardston High School; all on the Reserve are very pleased with the Department's decision.\n\nRegarding transportation expenses, I have talked with Pat Eagle Child, guardian of Francis, and he has agreed to pay the $58.90 insurance, providing the Department, as intimated in your letter, will pay the transportation of Francis to and from school.\n\nSince my letter of the 15th of February, Richard Fox has found board and room in the town of Cardston, and which is being looked after by his parents. This leaves only Francis Eagle Child to be transported by Mr. Coady, and, as he is only transporting the one pupil, he feels that he should have .50\u00a2 per trip instead of the .70\u00a2 per trip for two pupils; in this I agree.\n\nTherefore, if Pat Eagle Child contributes the Public Liability Insurance premiums, will the Department assume this .50\u00a2 per trip transportation charge? So that there will be no misunderstanding, Mr. Coady has agreed to transport up to three pupils at .35\u00a2 each, per trip, or if only one pupil is to be carried, the charge will be .50\u00a2 per trip. As the round trip each day is over 16 miles, we believe this a reasonable charge.\n\nTuition grant forms will be completed and forwarded for the four pupils concerned as soon as possible.\n\n(H.D. Ragan)\nSuperintendent\n\ncc to: G.H. Gooderham, Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies, CALGARY.\nMarch 30, 1949.\n\nMr. R. D.

You can submit a voucher at the end of every month, in favour of Mr. Coady, for this amount. I note that tuition grant forms will be forwarded in due course.\n\nBernard F.

You will see that the rate per pupil has been increased from $85.00 to $142.00. However, the parents of the three students will meet all other costs.\n\nWe are not completely familiar with the procedure required in such cases. For example, if an application for a tuition grant is submitted on behalf of an Indian student taking Grade 9 is it necessary to complete an application for a grant the following year if the student concerned made satisfactory progress in Grade 9 and wished to continue on with Grade 10?\n\nForwarded and recommended.\n\nG.

This year three of these pupils have returned to Cardston High School and are as follows:\n\n1. Hazel Small Face, age 16\n2. Francis Eagle Child, age 17\n3. Richard Fox, age 16\n\nApplication For Tuition Grant forms were forwarded for these pupils last year and we presume that it will not be necessary to again forward them this year and this letter is written to request that the Department assume the tuition costs at the Cardston High School for these three pupils. These costs this year amount to $142.00 each.\n\nThe St. Mary's River School Division, who levy the costs of tuition at the Cardston High School, raised these costs this year from $85.00 to $142.00 and their only explanation for such a terrific raise is that high education costs force them to do this.\n\nMay the Department be requested to allow a grant for the year 1949 of $142.00 each for the above three pupils, please, so that they may be able to continue their high school courses; parents of these three children will pay all other costs.\n\nWe have two other Blood pupils who are attending high school - one at Cardston and one at Glenwood and Application for Tuition Grants will be completed for these pupils as soon as possible and forwarded for your consideration.\n\nRDR/MR\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6486, file 42103-3, part 1)\nOctober 27th, 1949.\n\nMr. G.H.

PAUL'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nReference your 103-6-5 of November 28 -\n\nI am in agreement with your opinions concerning the St. Paul's Residential School and note that the pupils have not been a success at the Cardston High School.\n\nAs you are aware, the Department is experimenting this year with the payment of teachers in three of our Indian Residential Schools. It is felt that by offering them a proper salary schedule and superannuation benefits, we can improve the calibre of teaching in these schools.\n\nAt the present time the quality of residential school teachers is low and with the present shortage will probably continue to be so.\n\nIt is not only a question of salaries but of superannuation. The Roman Catholic Church has its own \"Pension Scheme\" but the other churches are unable to provide security for their working personnel in the schools, other than the ministers. It is only human nature that teachers will go to day schools or to provincial schools where pension benefits are available.\n\nTherefore we cannot be too critical of the Indian School Administration of the M.S.C.C., nor of the other church bodies. They have advertised widely and have done their best to recruit\nboth teachers and workers for these schools. I am sending this letter to you in duplicate so that the matter can be explained to your Indian Superintendents and I feel that by giving them an appreciation of the difficulties encountered by the churches, you will secure their cooperation in these difficult times and with residential school problems.\n\nBernard F.

VOLUME .........................\nDear Sir:\n\nAt the Council Meeting of October 31st, the Head Chief, on behalf of the Council asked that likely boys be sent to some school to attend classes in the operation and maintenance of tractors as it was the desire of the Council that members of the Band operate our tractors, as far as possible.\n\nI concurred entirely with the Council. During the last year, particularly, we tried to give practical instruction to the boys in the operation of ordinary gas tractors and a diesel tractor in use on the reserve. We found it was necessary to have a qualified white man with them most of the time, and this didn't look like the very best business. I, therefore, interviewed Dr. Carpenter, Principal of the Provincial Technical Institution, Calgary, and ascertained from him that they run 10 weeks courses on the use and theory of gasoline and diesel tractors. I also learned that there was at least one Indian attending the fall course.\n\nThe second course runs from January 15th to March 21st, 1940, and we would like to send two young men to attend this course. One of these boys, Gordon Yellow Fly, worked with the diesel tractor this past season, the other is Pat Bear Hat. I think they would both benefit by the course, as they have a mechanical turn of mind.\n\nThe fee for the course is $35.00 each, and I figure that $90.00 each should cover all expenses, making a total cost not exceeding $270.00. Would authority be granted to send these boys to the school, and an accountable cheque of $250.00, from the funds of the Band, be issued to meet cost and expenses, please?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH.H.

This cheque is an advance and should be accounted for by submitting the usual credit voucher supported by receipts.\n\nIt is considered, however, most desirable that this proposal should be approved by a formal resolution of the Band Council regularly moved, seconded and passed by a majority of the Council.

There was considerable discussion after which it was moved by Yellow Fly that the Council authorize the agent to make arrangements for any boy or girl who wished to further his/her education to attend white high schools, and if funds were not available from grant, the Band assume the responsibility for expenses, not to exceed $200.00 each, per year. This was passed unanimously.\n\n3. Toot Crowfoot:\n\nThis girl, who is 16 years of age, wished to go to a school in Saskatoon and her Principal, Mr. House, also wished it and advised that she be sent. The Agent stated the case fully and asked the Council what the Band would be prepared to do, if there were no public funds available for sending her. Yellow Fly stated that he thought this was a splendid investment, and suggested that hereafter we include an item for this higher education in each year's estimates, and in this case the Council ask that a sum of $200.00 be expended on Toot Crowfoot's schooling; this was unanimously passed.\n\nTed Yellow Fly then moved that a sum of 1% of our annual income, subject to change, be inserted in each year's estimates to cover the cost of higher education of promising pupils. This was passed.\n\nG.H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. PATRICK\n\nWith reference to the minutes of the Blackfoot Council held on the 19th instant I would point out that it was decided that all costs of Indian education would be paid from Parliamentary appropriation from April 1, 1928.\n\nOwing to lack of funds it will not be possible this year for us to consider payment of tuition grants from appropriation for pupils who desire to enter high school for the first time.\n\nOn the other hand, in view of the ruling regarding the payment of education costs from appropriation I feel it would be a mistake to approve payment of any tuition grant from band funds. We have had similar experience in connection with the Six Nations Agency and since April 1, 1928, have refused approval of payment of tuition fees from band funds.\n\nIf the practice of paying from band funds is again recognized it will mean that the Department will have no control over the expenditure as quite likely every Indian belonging to the band in question will desire to have his child receive a high school education -- at least that is our experience in connection with Six Nations.\n\nTaking everything into consideration I feel that you would be well advised to notify Indian Agent Gooderham that the Department is not prepared to consider approving the payment of tuition grants from band funds.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nJuly 3rd, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to refer you to the minutes of Blackfoot Council meeting, held on June 19th, and particularly to resolutions No. 2 and No. 3 under the heading of \"New Business\" dealing with the payment from Band Funds of fees for advanced education for certain Indians of the Band.\n\nIn this connection I have to advise you that since April 1st, 1938, it has been the policy of the Department to pay expenses of this nature from Parliamentary Appropriation; and that it is not desirable that this expenditure should be made from Band Funds. The resolutions referred to are, therefore, not approved.\n\nI might also add that, owing to lack of funds in Parliamentary Appropriation, it will not be possible to provide grants for pupils desiring to enter high school this year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nG. H. Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alberta.\nDear Sir:\n\nMay I refer to your letter of the 3rd instant, File 103-104, in which you state that the Department is not prepared to use Band funds to pay the fees for higher education; you were referring to the minutes of the Blackfoot Council of June 19th.\n\nI regret very much that I did not know of this before it was taken up at the Council meeting. I had talked it over some months ago with the principal of both schools. They had made inquiries and found out where it was possible to get certain pupils into high schools under good supervision, at the least possible expense. The pupils had been encouraged to work harder in order to qualify for higher grades. Then, along comes your letter which, to say the least, dampens the ardor of all concerned!\n\nYou do not say for what reason it became the policy of the Department not to pay fees from Band funds, but undoubtedly it was for a very good reason. However, cannot an exception be made in the case of the Blackfeet, who have such a large Band fund? The Council, on behalf of the Band, was unanimous in their desire to pay for this higher education and we have two boys and one girl who are all peppered up to attend a high school. We have been sending boys and girls to the Technical Institute, Calgary, and paying their expenses from Band funds and if it is not possible to send them to a high school, would it be possible to send them to the Technical school? It is sincerely hoped that you can find some way to allow these Blackfoot children to get away this fall.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nAugust 17, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 10th ultimo with reference to the use of funds of the Blackfoot Band to pay fees for higher education.\n\nThe whole question has been carefully reviewed and it has been decided to allow the Blackfoot Band to vote funds for purposes of higher education, provided that the pupils assisted in this manner attend either technical school or take one of the short courses in an agricultural college. The Department is not prepared to approve payment of tuition grants from Band funds for straight academic courses.\n\nIt should be further understood that in making grants the Band should only consider those pupils from the two Indian residential schools on the Reserve who have made the best showing and who are recommended by either of the Principals for further assistance.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.R.L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nMr. G. H. Cooderham,\nIndian Agent,\nGlenchen, Alta.\nDr. H.W. McGill,\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nI have recently received from the Principal of our Old Sun School (Rev. J.W.

The motion was passed unanimously.\"\n\nSecretary's reply of July 3rd, 1940:\n\nI wish to refer you to the minutes of Blackfoot Council meeting held on June 19th, and particularly to resolutions No. 2 and No. 3 under the heading of \"New Business\" dealing with the payment from Band funds of fees for advanced education for certain Indians of the Band.\nIn this connection I have to advise you that since April last, 1928, it has been the policy of the Department to pay expenses of this nature from Parliamentary Appropriation; and that it is not desirable that this expenditure should be made from Band Funds. The resolutions referred to are, therefore, not approved.\n\nI might also add that, owing to lack of funds in Parliamentary Appropriation, it will not be possible to provide grants for pupils desiring to enter high school this year.\"\n\nAs the decision set forth in the Secretary's reply must surely militate against the desire and policy of the Church Societies engaged in Indian educational work, as well as of your Department of Government, to encourage the Indians to help themselves, I trust that this important matter may receive further consideration.\n\nSo far as the Blackfoot Indians are concerned, they have ample funds to help any of their boys and girls who wish to do so, to take any higher education which may fit them for greater usefulness amongst their own people or elsewhere. That they themselves are willing to vote funds for this purpose, and have already done so, seems to me to be quite clear from the following information which I have just received from the Principal of our Old Sun School:\n\n\"The Indians have already spent band funds to finance Annie Royall in the Lacombe Home (R.C.) and later to take a dressmaking course in the technical School in Calgary. I think this was in 1938 and 1939.\n\nThey have also financed Gordon Yellowfly and Pat Bearhat through a Diesel course in the Calgary technical School. This was last winter.\n\nThe present resolution applies to any child of either school who is recommended by the Principal and accepted for further training by the Blackfoot Council.\"\n\nAs there are three pupils at our old Sun School who have been recommended for further training, the Blackfoot Band Council, according to the above Resolution, agreed to provide out of Band Funds a sum not exceeding $200.00 per year for each. According to the Principal this would be spent as follows:\n\nBoard and accommodation at the School $165. (which is the regular per capita grant): $30.00 for High School fees; $5.00 for books.\n\nOne of the pupils is Margaret Crowfoot, a descendant of the great Chief of the same name, the other two are boys, namely George Spotted Eagle and Andrew White Pup.\"\nWhile it is not altogether difficult, in view of prevailing war conditions, to understand why the usual Parliamentary appropriation cannot be made available for the further education of these pupils, I myself find it difficult to understand why it should be considered undesirable that the necessary expenditure be made from Band funds.\n\nAlthough a goodly number of the pupils from our Society's other Indian Schools have qualified as nurses, teachers, and for other useful positions in Canadian life, none from the Blackfoot Reserve have achieved the same distinction, and our Commission are, therefore, particularly interested in encouraging and helping any who have manifested a desire and shown the ability to transcend the ordinary and commonplace.\n\nAs the ruling given in the letter quoted above cannot but tend to discourage the generous motives so clearly evident in the Resolution of the Blackfoot Band Council and must be as great a disappointment to them and their children as it is to our Commission, I earnestly hope that the decision may be reconsidered, and authority given to the Indian Agent to allow the money voted to be used for the specific purpose indicated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nTERW/KH\nOttawa, August 29, 1940.\n\nRe: Payment of Tuition Grants from Blackfoot Band Funds.\n\nDear Doctor Westgate:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of August 26, in which you submit, for my personal consideration, the desirability of having tuition grants paid from the trust funds of the Blackfoot Band to pupils recommended for high school courses by the Indian agent and the principals of the residential schools on the reserve.\n\nI can readily appreciate the difficulty you must experience in fully understanding the refusal of the Department to authorize these grants when requested to do so from time to time.\n\nThe records here indicate that a number of Indian bands throughout the Dominion made provision for tuition grants to a limited number of pupils and that these grants were approved by the Department over a long period of years. About 8 years ago, however, certain abuses developed on one or two reserves and the practice was discontinued. In certain cases the least deserving and the least qualified pupils received tuition grants as the result of unfair influence exercised in the council of the band. On the other hand, a number of deserving Indian pupils, who had appealed for grants and who had been refused, were naturally disappointed from year to year and frequently appealed to the Department for redress.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nSecretary,\nIndian & Eskimo Res. School Commission, M.S.C.C.,\n38-48 The Bible House, Alexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nIn reviewing -\nIn reviewing conditions at that time it was felt by the officials that it would be unfair to ask either the principal of a residential school or the Indian agent to step in and refuse to recommend grants authorized unanimously by the band council. The Department was convinced at that time that the average Indian council was not equipped to create the safeguard that should surround the payment of these grants if band funds were to be conserved and abuses avoided.\n\nThe resolution referred to in your communication, received by the Department from the Blackfoot Council, was given very serious and very careful consideration by the officials of this Branch. It was felt, however, that it would be unfair to revert to the old practice and that an exception could not be made in the case of the Blackfoot Indians without creating a great deal of dissatisfaction amongst the members of other bands. You will be interested to learn, however, that the decision of the Department has been somewhat modified in response to an appeal received from Indian Agent Gooderham. The Secretary of this Branch, in a letter to the Indian Agent, dated August 17, 1940, stated in part as follows:\n\n\"The whole question has been carefully reviewed and it has been decided to allow the Blackfoot Band to vote funds for purposes of higher education, provided that the pupils assisted in this manner attend either technical schools or take one of the courses provided at an agricultural college. The Department is not prepared to approve payment of tuition grants from band funds for straight academic courses\".\n\nThis concession, I may state, is granted by way of experiment. There is an acute shortage of skilled labourers in a number of districts in the Dominion. It does not seem fair that Indian pupils should -\nshould be encouraged to proceed with straight academic courses at this time. In addition to this, we have learned from experience that the average Indian pupil possesses the skills necessary to proceed successfully with a vocational course of training. It is not likely, therefore, that the abuses to which I have already referred will creep into this arrangement.\n\nIt is my hope that the decision of the Department will prove reasonably satisfactory to you and to those on whose behalf you have written.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDirector.\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nI am very grateful to you for your letter of the 29th ultimo, in which you have explained the circumstances regarding grants for tuition of promising Indian pupils, out of Band funds. As I expect to leave here tomorrow to attend the Board Meetings of our mission in Stratford, Ont., on September 9 and 10, I will endeavour to return via Ottawa, sometime during the following week, so that I may have a further talk with you about this and some other matters.\n\nI do not know whether it will be possible or not for our General Secretary (Canon L.A. Dixon, M.A., D.D.) to visit Ottawa at the same time, but I purpose talking the matter over with him at our Meetings in Stratford, and we will then endeavour to arrange a date for our talk with you.\n\nI am particularly anxious that the Indian girl, Margaret Crowfoot of our Old Sun School, should be enabled to continue her studies as is her desire, and that of her parents, that she should eventually qualify as a nurse, and any help you may be able to give in the achievement of this desire will surely be appreciated by all concerned.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 506\n\nVoucher No.: \n\nDate: January 8, 1943\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nLetter No.\n\nOffice of the BLACKEFOOT Indian Agency,\n\nJANUARY 8, 1942\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos., amounting to $41.35 in favour of LACOMBE HOME MUNICIPAL ALTA for BOARD A.

The boy or girl must feed, water and care for this calf from the 1st of December until the early summer when it is hoped that some competition with other clubs can be arranged and a prize given to these boys. The main reason for this is to encourage and educate these young Indians in the care and feeding of stock. At least one other, outside the schools, will also care for a calf so that we will have a local competition at any rate. An ex-pupil of the Old Sun School was sent to Calgary to take the Dominion Provincial Youth Training course in mechanics; this boy is paying his own expenses. Four pupils of this school and nine ex-pupils of the two schools were started on a 6 weeks course in farm mechanics, carpentry, blacksmithing and agriculture under supervision of the Dominion Youth Training project. This school is held in Gleichen and arrangements were made for the boys to live at Crowfoot Community Hall where the wife of the Indian caretaker supplies the meals. An allowance is given by the Government for transportation and board, and this will be turned over to this woman. The boys are getting something out of this course at very little cost to their parents.\n\nx x x\n\nG.H.

My husband, Lawrence McKnight, is present overseas, with the Canadian Army, is filing suit for divorce, and I have been deprived of all allowance and my weekly rations of flour, meat & tea.\n\nHaving no means of support, and being destitute, I have been forced to place my children in school and go out and make a living.\n\nI am now employed at the Holy Cross\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6487, file 42104-3, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nReference yours of the 19th, file 103-104, herewith is the return of the letter of Mrs Victoria McHugh.\n\nAs this woman has stated, her husband is overseas and has filed suit for divorce. On his request the Dependents' Allowance Board discontinued a direct allowance to her but it is some time ago, and I was made guardian of the children; all the allowance cheques were sent to me.\n\nMrs McHugh does not tell the whole truth. She lived on the reserve for a long time after her allowance was cut out, but I gave her money to support herself and the children. She preferred to room in Calgary or on the Sarcee reserve, where her parents and relatives reside. The two older children were taken into the Crowfoot school and the youngest boarded out with a reliable Blackfoot woman until he was transferred to Mrs McHugh's sister, Mrs Big Plume, on the Sarcee reserve.\n\nThe Principle of the Crowfoot School is away at present and the Sister Superior has written to say that Mrs McHugh had asked her to reserve a place for her two girls at the Lacombe Home but she would not do this until she knew whether you would approve of the transfer. I would recommend that approval be given and that the grant allowed to the Residential School be turned over to the home. Mrs McHugh is living in Calgary and the children are under the guardianship of a Sarcee woman. Therefore, her request is reasonable.\n\nIndian Agent,\nG. H. Gooderham\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6487, file 42104-3, part 1)\nOttawa,\nAugust 4, 1943.\n\nMr. G.H. Gooderham, Indian Agent, Gleichen, Alta.\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, with reference to the request of Mrs. Victoria McHugh. Careful consideration has been given to the contents of your letter, but the Department does not see any great necessity for transferring these children from the Crowfoot Residential School where no doubt they are receiving every possible care and attention.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, January 3, 1944.\n\nMr. G. H. Gooderham, Indian Agent, Gleichen, Alberta.\n\nI have today discussed with the Superintendent of Reserves and Trusts the advisability of selecting, from year to year, a couple of promising Indian pupils, graduates of the Crowfoot and Old Sun Residential Schools, and have these pupils proceed with courses leading to their matriculation standing and later to diploma or degree courses at a recognized technical school or agricultural college. We are of the opinion that the cost in each case, of approximately $500.00 per annum, should be borne from band funds. Indians throughout the Dominion, including the Blackfoot band, are at present enjoying an unusual measure of prosperity. This being the case, we feel that the payment of approximately $1,000.00 a year would result in no hardship to the members of the Band.\n\nWe have, as you probably are aware, an item in our annual appropriations entitled \"Assistance to Ex-pupils\" and amounting to $23,000.00. This fund is used, however, for the institutional care of delinquent Indian boys and girls, for the payment of tuition fees for Indians in attendance at ordinary public schools and for tuition grants to promising Indian pupils proceeding with high school or vocational courses. I may state that during the last two year period there has been a great deal of delinquency, with the result that a steadily decreasing amount of this appropriation is being now used for higher education. You will realize at once that it would be exceedingly difficult to justify assistance from this appropriation for pupils of the Blackfoot schools.\n\nThe idea we have in mind is that you and the principals of the schools, R. C. and C. E., might select two promising boys with a creditable standing in their studies and also a creditable record from the\nstandpoint of moral stability. These pupils would be interviewed with respect to their outlook on life, their legitimate ambitions and their anxiousness to proceed with advanced courses. The greatest care should be exercised in their selection. They should be encouraged to proceed to either a high school in the district, capable of providing matriculation standing, or to Calgary. Upon completion of their high school course, their high school record would be reviewed and a decision reached there, with respect to whether or not they should proceed with a diploma course or a degree course at an agricultural college or a specialized mechanical course at the Calgary Institute of Technology. In view of the fact that the Department has been recently subjected to a great deal of criticism for our failure to provide advanced courses of study for our Indian pupils, it would be appreciated if you turned this matter over in your mind and discussed it, not only with the principals of the schools, but with the responsible members of the Band. The proposals submitted are wholly tentative. It is just possible that you may desire to modify them and that the modifications you may suggest will be equally acceptable to the Department. The only additional thought I want to express is that we are somewhat opposed, as the result of our experience, to straight academic or classical courses for Indian boys and girls. Boys and girls who have taken these courses in the past have been, with one or two notable exceptions, in no sense successful.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nP.S. - There is a feeling here that parents, as such, should be encouraged to bear part of the cost of these courses. You might comment on this suggestion.\nBLACKFOOT AGENCY MINUTES OF COUNCIL MEETING HELD JANUARY 12, 1944.\n\nNew Business\n\nEducation:\n\nThe Agent reported that the regulations prohibiting the payment for advanced education, even from Band funds, had now been rescinded.\n\nMoved by Teddy Yellow Fly seconded by Ben Calf Robe \"that 1\u00bd% of the income from Band funds be set aside to cover the cost of advanced education.\"\n\nCarried Unanimously.\n\nG.H.

I have to report that a survey of the situation was made at the end of the school year in June last.\n\nThe Old Suns School had two boys graduating from Grade 8; Crowfoot school had none above Grade 7, while a boy who had attended the Gleichen Public School passed his Grade 8 tests.\n\nThe three boys - Percy Yellowfly, Cecil Crowfoot and Norman Galf Child - are now attending the Gleichen High School.\n\nIt was hoped that they would have attended schools away from the reserve, but dormitory or boarding arrangements could not be made and it was only on opening day (Sept.) that the parents and the boy agreed on the Gleichen High School. The School trustees agreed to accept them provided a tuition fee of $60.00 each was guaranteed. Then board and lodging had to be secured. The Galf child boy lives at home; the cost for the others is $25.00 per month. The parents buy books and clothe them.\n\nAt the meeting of the 4th, the council passed a minute which read: \"Moved by Mr. Baker and seconded by Good Eagle that the sum of $120.00 be allocated from Band Funds to pay tuition and board of Norman Galf Child, Percy Yellowfly and Cecil Crowfoot while attending high school in Gleichen during the current school year.\"\n\nIf an accountable cheque for $700.00 is forwarded, monthly cheques will be issued for board and lodging, and tuition accounts paid as they are submitted by the Secretary of the School Board.\n\nThe Indians are very pleased to use their Band Funds for this higher education and all are enthusiastic about the venture.

At this school, the girls are receiving training in typewriting and music as well as domestic and sewing; the boys are not so fortunate; they receive good training in care of stock but no manual training. The Principal is anxious to supply this when a competent instructor can be found.\n\nDespite the fact that there are over 100 children in this school (30 over the grant) they are very comfortably housed and very well fed. The Principal and Sister Superior deserve all the credit.\n\nThe Old Suns School is also running smoothly; the Principal Rev. J.W. House, is a capable administrator. He secured the services of a qualified manual training instructor and the boys are now receiving regular training.\n\nThere is a need for trained carpenters and mechanics on this reserve and it is our hope and expectation that a few boys will graduate from year to year, who will make carpentry or allied trades their vocation after some apprenticeship.\n\nThe boys attending high School did very well this term. They proved one thing, that they can do well when made to apply themselves to this work.\n\nThe Old Suns School has a Cadet Company and good hockey teams.

They are healthy and happy. Vocational training has been improved and the calibre of the instructors satisfactory.\n\nClassroom work always appears to be lacking in something; possibly this is due to lack of interest by the pupil but it is so easy for a teacher to get in a rut and lack that spirit which the child needs so much to retain its interest and enthusiasm. Indian children love to sing and they are good singers. We need to practice a little more psychology to get nearer the desired results.\n\nAll children who were school age and physically fit at the beginning of the term are attending the schools.\n\nAt both institutions, the farms produced ample feed for stock. Good milch herds are retained while the flocks of fowl produced sufficient eggs. Some cattle and pigs are slaughtered for school consumption. The Crowfoot School has a splendid lot of pigs.

Percy Yellowfly - Grade 12, attending Gleichen High School.\n2. Ronald McHugh was attending Grade 9, Gleichen High School but had the misfortune to break his leg during the Christmas Holidays.\n3. Roslyn Big Snake attending Grade 9, attending Cluny High School, Cluny.\n4. Doreen Running Rabbit, do.\n5. Audrey Calf Child, do.\n\nThe pupils attending the Cluny High School are boarding at the Crowfoot Indian Residential School at a cost of $30.00 per month per pupil.\n\nW. P. F. Pugh,\nSuperintendent.\nFebruary 12, 1948.\n\nMr. W.P.E. Pugh, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Gleichen, Alberta.\n\nWe have your letter of the 6th instant giving the names of the Indian children of the Blackfoot Agency who are attending high school. It is noted in the latter part of your letter that some children who are attending high school are boarding at the Crowfoot residential school and the school management is being paid board at the rate of $30.00 per month and that the funds for this purpose are being provided from Band funds.\n\nThis is the first intimation we have received that such procedure has been adopted. Do these pupils receive better attention than the regular grant earning pupils? Are there other children of school age unable to secure admission to the Crowfoot School due to the fact that the accommodation available is being used in the purpose mentioned in your letter?\n\nPlease let me hear fully from you regarding the matter.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nReference to your letter of 13th Feb., of the above file and to the second paragraph of your letter, I beg to report that this procedure has gone on at this Agency for some time, for your information the High School pupils have now all left the Crowfoot School and are staying at an Indian Home\u2014Phil Running Rabbit\u2014it is a good home close to Cluny High School. There was a disagreement over discipline at the Crowfoot School and the High School girls.\n\nFor your information up to the time the High School girls left the Crowfoot School there had been no refusal of admission to the school. The better treatment the High school girls got consisted mainly of transportation via car from the Crowfoot School to Cluny High School and return each day.\n\nThe problem of Higher Education for any High School student is difficult, particularly in find them a place to board and attend the white high schools. Mr Gooderham is aware of this whole situation and has seen your letter referred to above. It would now be an opportunity to discuss the matter with him.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nW.P.B.

Pugh,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nGleichen, Alta.\n\nOld Sun Indian Residential School\nGrade IX Pupils\n\nThe report of the Alberta Superintendent of Schools concerning the classroom work at the Old Sun school has recently been received. It is stated therein that pupils in Grades five to eight inclusive received only half-time classroom instruction, and that this arrangement leaves much to be desired.\n\nIt is noted, moreover, that Grade nine classes were being conducted in the school. In the circumstances it appears advisable to arrange that no pupils above Grade eight should receive their classroom instruction in this school but should go to the nearest available Provincial, Intermediate and High School.\n\nWill you, therefore, make the necessary investigations at once and return answers to the following questions:\n\n(1) How many pupils in grades above Grade eight are enrolled at the Old Sun Residential School?\n\n(2) Are they Day pupils or boarders?\n\n(3) Is there accommodation for them in Gleichen High School?\n\n(4) What extra costs will their attendance at Gleichen High School entail?\n\nIt is the practice, wherever possible, to encourage the attendance of pupils above Grade eight at well organized...\nHigh Schools rather than to attempt their instruction in Residential schools which must necessarily be staffed and equipped with emphasis placed upon elementary education. Such High School pupils continue, if necessary, to be domiciled in the Residential school which receives for each such child the usual per capita grant. The Indian Superintendent by arrangement with the Department pays any additional amount involved to the parties concerned.\n\nYou may inform the Reverend Principal of the Department's wishes in this matter.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\nEXTRACT FROM THE\nMINUTES OF THE BLACKFOOT BAND COUNCIL MEETING HELD ON SEPTEMBER\n28, 1949.\n\nNEW BUSINESS\n\n5. Tractor Courses.\n\nSupt. stated he had inquired the possibility of young Indians taking tractor courses at the Calgary Technical School. There is a ten week tractor course available commencing October 31st. Tuition fees, approximately $25.00, board and room, current prices, possibly $40.00 or $50.00 per month. Council agreed to pay room and board together with tuition fees for desirable pupils. All agreed except Joe Good Eagle who stated he thought the Indian should pay tuition fees. Supt. further stated he had received application from Levitt McMaster for an automechanic course at the Technical School but grade ten was the minimum education requirement and McMaster did not qualify.\n\n(Sgd.)

Ostrander, Indian Agent, Battleford, Sask.\n\nRe: Tuition Grant - Jean Cuthand\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of August 31, in which you recommend that a tuition grant be allowed for the marginally-noted pupil.\n\nIn view of your recommendation, the Department is prepared to allow a grant amounting to $260.00. In view of the critical times in which we are living and the difficulty experienced in securing the money necessary to make these grants, it would be appreciated if we could have, in addition to your own recommendation, an expression of opinion from the public school inspector with respect to the general fitness of pupils seeking these grants, and a recommendation also on the particular type of course they should follow - academic or vocational. We are aware, of course, that it may not always be convenient to secure this expression of opinion, but where it can be secured without cost or inconvenience, it should be sent forward.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Mr. Hoag,\n\nThank you for the letter of 21st August. We are very grateful to the Dept. of the promised grant of Edna Constant or Team Curlews.

I think both girls will do their best.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMr. Paul\nOttawa, September 14, 1944.\n\nDear Mrs. Paul:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 8th instant, written by you on behalf of Edna Constant.\n\nI may state that immediately following receipt of your letter of August 8 we communicated with Indian Agent McLeod in respect to this girl, sending forward the standard application form and asking that it be filled in and returned in due course. A search of the records discloses that this form has not been returned, although the form signed on behalf of Jean Cuthand reached us a few days ago.\n\nThe Department, with the approval of the Indian Agent, will allow a tuition grant of $280.00 to enable this girl to proceed with a high school course of study during the academic year 1944-45.\n\nI have noticed from the records here that the grants requested on behalf of these girls have resulted in correspondence, not only with you, but with Indian Agent Ostrander and with Indian Agent McLeod. This duplication of correspondence is somewhat confusing at a time when our staff is limited and when hundreds of requests for tuition grants are reaching us from week to week. Would it be convenient for you, in future, to have all these requests made through the local Indian agents? If this procedure is followed it will enable us to avoid confusion and save a great deal of time.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMrs. W. E. J.

She was well above the class average in French & Maths 2, also in Composition at Christmas.\n\nBoth girls are very anxious to continue their work, and I think will do much better this year; going to a\n\nbig city school is a big jump from a little Reserve Day School & I wish them some time to adjust themselves.\n\nWill you kindly reply by air-mail so I shall have to go to Saskatoon to find boarding-places for them.\n\nThanking you in anticipation,\n\nYours truly,\nMr. Paul\n(P.S.: W.

Perhaps I was too quick in writing but the time was going on so I feared she would be late in coming so did not wait for Mr. McReynolds' letter. So now I want back of reconsider your decision of Jean. She is very anxious to go on and will make a very good teacher we think. We have an excellent home for her if she can have the grant but failing that, I fear she will have to\nGo home.

Under the circumstances we will allow the same grant for her during the current academic year as was allowed last year. However, I would like to have a report from the Principal, regarding her progress, at the end of December, 1945. I have no doubt that you have advised Miss Cuthand that the continuance of the grant depends wholly on the progress she makes at school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMrs. W.E.J.

However, Mrs. Paul notified us later that the Principal of the Bedford Collegiate, Saskatoon, had reviewed the case of Jean Cuthand and allowed her to be promoted to Grade XI. Under these circumstances we decided to again allow a grant of $200.00 a year or $20.00 a teaching month.\n\nI am not certain where Jean Cuthand is residing this year but no doubt you can obtain this information from Mrs. Paul and as soon as you do so you could issue a voucher for the amount due for the months of September and October and forward monthly accounts after that date.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**TREASURY ONLY**\n\nPay to: Mrs. R.

I can write:\n\n(25 Feb. 1948) \"Another cheque came yesterday to Anna Burrows of Mrs. Smith. So I had to sign it too. What puzzled us was that it said it was for Jan. Feb. & March or it amounts to \u00a36 only of the three months. I remember the first cheque was for union fees. The second one was for Sept. Oct. Nov. or something like that. Now I don't know whether that's the way it should be, that is only the second one she has received so far. I suppose she will expect more as it was \u00a36 a month.\"\n\nOwing to these mistakes Team has been working very hard, waxing floors, scrubbing, painting tables etc., & has developed plans in her work which have been treated by Dr. Broughlie at the San. She lost this boarding place.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6487, file 42105-3, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThrough the sickness and being paid, when she tried to get another brother's place was too cramped (for them all only one room) the lady at school Dr. Broughton with the newest her team is new in the town.\n\nShe has been a great little worker all through her varied great prairie in her boarding places, so she has had hard work her lessons though was more than once said in her letters that she was too tired when she other work was done to study as hard as she wanted to. I think if will agree with me that her breakdown is entirely due to careless work at the Battleford Office, or it does seem very hard on team. The doctor is telling her continue her studies so she hopes she may be able to take her exams, but it is going to be very difficult to find her a boarding place when she comes out of the town, seeing no one will take her if she will us help in the house.\n\nHoping that it will pass this night as soon as possible,\n\nYours Truly,\nP.

They state that they can handle up to fifteen children and are asking the sum of $50.00 per pupil, which sum covers cost of tuition and school supplies.\n\nThere would be approximately ten or eleven children from the Moosomin reserve who could attend this school if schooling facilities were not otherwise provided by the Department.\n\nI would ask that the Department approve the sending of these ten or eleven children to this school on the above noted cost basis.

This will give us the information required regarding the cost of the course. On the reverse side of the form you will find a medical report form; this should be completed by the Doctor at the sanatorium.

He is at present in my employ so I have had a good opportunity of observing him, and I have for him nothing but the highest commendations. He is not, however, a treaty Indian, his father having withdrawn some years ago.\n\nHis problem is that he has absolutely no funds. Local people are going to give him some help, which funds, by the way, are going to be handled in his interest by Canon Hives of the Church of England, to which this young man belongs, and Mr. Hock, president of the local Board of Trade. The amount locally subscribed however, will not be sufficient to see this lad through, and I wondered if through the Department of Indian Affairs there might not be some way of giving him financial assistance which will help him to complete his studies.\n\nIt is his intention to study law. It is not often that we find a young man of his type among the Indians, and it seems to me that when we do, something should be done where necessary, to give them reasonable assistance. I feel sure you will give this case all the consideration it deserves, and I will look forward to hearing from you at an early date.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd.) P.

James Nuttunnee was enfranchised, together with the members of his family, on November 24, 1944. Enfranchisement in the case of this Indian, as in the case of all other Indians, means that he now enjoys the full rights and privileges of Canadian citizenship. He is no longer a ward of the Federal Government. I deeply regret, therefore, that it would not be possible to pay out of the appropriations voted by Parliament for the education and welfare of Indians the amount necessary to pay any part of this boy's expenses while in attendance at McGill University.\n\nIt is just possible that the Provincial Department of Education may have a scholarship fund from which this boy might be helped.

In the letter Mr. Prince asks if there will be any possibility of assisting this young man.\n\nSince receiving your note, I have explored the situation and find that last year we employed several university students in connection with summer schools for Indians. As this young man will be attending McGill, I would suggest that he drop off at Ottawa on his way through and have a talk with Colonel Neary. If he is interested in this type of work I feel certain that it will be possible to place him, as Colonel Neary advises me that they have a summer school at Pelican Narrows, Sask. It might be possible as well to place him elsewhere in Canada.\n\nActing Director.\nTHE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY\n\nBattleford, Saskatchewan,\nSeptember 23, 1948.\n\nHon. James A. MacKinnon,\nMinister of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: William Wutunnee\n\nDear Mr. MacKinnon:\n\nI wish to thank you for your letter of the 17th instant, in which you state that the above mentioned could possibly be placed as instructor in one of your summer schools. In the event that he can not obtain employment in the East, and thereby save the cost of coming West, that would be an ideal arrangement. His big trouble will be, of course, to have enough funds for incidental expenses to carry him through the academic year. A certain amount was raised locally, which will of course be of considerable assistance. Since you are a westerner it will probably interest you to know that he left for the East on a cattle train last Saturday evening, thereby saving the cost of transportation, which is a considerable item when one has to travel that distance. He would not, therefore, on time receive your letter suggesting that he stop off at Ottawa.\n\nThanking you for your interest in this young man, and assuring you of the appreciation of all those interested in his welfare, I remain\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Signed) Paul Prince.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nTO: Deputy Minister\n\nATTENTION: Director of Indian Affairs\n\nUnder date of September 15th Mr. McKay passed a memorandum to the Deputy Minister in regard to a letter addressed to the Minister by Mr. Paul Prince, M.L.A., respecting Mr. William Wattumnee.

At present, we do not have a seasonal school open to students of your denomination. However, there is a vacancy for Clerk Grade 2 for temporary employment during the summer in our own Education Division here in Ottawa.\n\nWe have several applicants for this position, and yet if you so wish, I would be glad to consider you for it. I am sorry we were unable to contact you in Montreal this winter. One of our inspectors did endeavour to reach you, but you were at the University in classes when he called. The salary which I could offer you here is $125.00 a month, and the position will last until you return to university in the Fall. I feel that this would be even better for you than a seasonal school as your travelling expenses will naturally be much lower. Would you please write to me immediately if you are interested in this position, and I will send you an application form immediately.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nBFN/AM\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6487, file 42105-3, part 2)\nMay 2, 1949.\n\nMr. C.S.

Mr. Bell is given to understand that Andrew Swimmer mentioned this boy's case to Educational Officer Clark, and Mr. Clark intimated that the Department would be willing to assist.\n\nClarence is 18 years of age and went to grade 6 at Delmas Residential School. Mr. Bell states that he is quite mechanical minded, and shows excellent judgment in the care and operation of his father's machinery in addition to being a far steadier worker than most Indians.\n\nThis would be \"on the job training\" at Rorke Brothers at Battleford. They would charge $175.15 for the use of materials and equipment. His board in Battleford for a month would be $45.00 making a total expenditure of $215.15.\n\nMr. Bell recommends that this request be granted and in view of his recommendation I would add mine, as it is not a large outlay and a few cases will have to be tried out and the results surveyed to find out if Indians are ready for assistance in obtaining a skilled trade.\n\nMay I be immediately advised of the Department's wishes.\n\nJ.P.B.

Moore, teacher of the John Smith Indian Day School. Original on File 610-1:\n\n\"For the carrying on of the school we should have janitor service for the furnace and big stove. One of the school boys will act for the sum of ten dollars per month. He will do the sweeping and dusting as well for an extra five dollars. There is a good deal of work involved and I would suggest for twenty-five dollars per month the cleaning, scrubbing and fires could all be done.\"\n\nIn a letter dated September 23rd commenting on the above request, Supt. McLeod wrote as follows:\n\n\"Personally I see no reason why this work cannot be done by the older pupils free of charge to our Branch. Coal burning heating equipment has been installed in both classrooms with this type of equipment tending furnaces does not require any great amount of heavy work, in comparison with tending wood burning heating equipment. I will follow the matter closely and if I find that janitor services are necessary a recommendation will be forwarded at a later date.\"\nOctober 3rd, 1949.\n\nMr. N.J. McLeod,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\n\nRe: John Smith Indian Day School\n\nI desire to refer to that section of your letter of September 23rd which mentions the request you have received for janitor service at the above mentioned school.\n\nWe agree with the statements made in your letter, and no allowance will be made for janitor service at this school unless we receive a further communication from you.\n\nBernard F.

At present we have about two or three week's supply of seasoned cord wood and with the very cold winter such as we have we will need additional funds to purchase dry wood to carry us through till spring.\n\nIt costs us $6.50 per cord to lay it down on the yard and I expect we will need between 15 and 20 cords, and if the severe cold continues much longer we might need even more.\n\nIn making our estimates for 1946-47 we quoted wood cost at $5.00 per cord, which at that time was the actual cost. However, since the beginning of winter the Indians were able to get prices far above that in town and in order to compete with the market we had to raise our price in line with the town, which also means that our next year's wood supply may be on the short side. Would it not be possible for the Department to amend our estimates to allow an increase in view of this fact?\n\nJ. L. Bryant,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 18, 1946.\n\nMr. J. L. Bryant, Indian Agent,\nKamsack, Sask.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 12th instant, you may secure the additional wood required during the current winter at the Cote Indian Day School.\n\nI note the information contained in the last paragraph of your letter, regarding increased prices for wood. I realize that this is due to circumstances beyond your control, and you can purchase the quantity that you consider necessary, at the lowest price which you can obtain.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n|      | To 26 loads of wood supplied for Cote Bay |        |\n|      | School, at $5.00 per load | 100.00 |\n|      | Allotment 76-02-210 |        |\n|      | Auth.

As this must cover sawing, splitting, piling and putting in the basement for the Cote School, this amount will not be sufficient as wood is at least $2.00 per cord higher than last year. However, I think I could manage with a $1.00 per cord increase for this year and I would appreciate an accountable cheque for $900.00 with which to purchase wood from the Indians.

P. B. Ostrander, Esq.,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nP. O. Building,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nWhen making 1949-50 Estimates for fuel at the new Day School at Nut Lake Reserve, Mr. Simpson asked for $250 to buy wood. This money has been forwarded to our office, however, a new coal burning type furnace was installed at the Nut Lake school, and I find that the $250 wood money will not be sufficient to buy wood for the kitchen stove and sufficient coal for the furnace. I would suggest to buy 15\u00bd cords of stove wood, split and piled, at $6.00 per cord - $92.50. The remainder $157 left in this office will be sufficient to pay for 9 ton coal at $15.50 per ton at Rose Valley, and $2.00 delivery charges to the reserve.\n\n* I therefore, request authority to buy an additional 7 ton coal at the same price as already mentioned.\n\nThis same mistake was made when making up the 1950-51 Estimates. We regret this error and request that the estimates be changed in accordance with this letter.\n\nA. R. Mixon,\nActing Superintendent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of a letter from Mr. A.R. Nixon, Acting Indian Superintendent, Touchwood Agency, and requisition for fuel for the Nut Lake Indian Day School.\n\nAs the amount of $250.00 has been forwarded to Mr. Nixon to pay for wood, and coal would be much more satisfactory for the furnace, I would recommend approval of Mr. Nixon's suggestion in so far as substituting coal for wood is concerned. However, I presume it would be necessary to have Mr. Nixon return that part of the $250.00 which is not to be spent on wood, and have the necessary coal ordered by the Purchasing Agent. If it is possible for Mr. Nixon to use the money now on hand to pay for coal, I would so recommend, but I would appreciate receiving instructions in this connection.\n\nJ.P.B.

MOORE\n\nRe: Henriette Ross, Home of the Good Shepherd,\nForest Avenue and Scotia Street, West\nKildonan, Manitoba.\n\nThe above girl was admitted to the Cross Lake Indian Residential School in August, 1933. At that time she was stated to be 5 years of age. Her father was living, being No. 344 of the Cross Lake Band, but her mother was dead. In March, 1942, we received the following letter from the Principal of the Cross Lake School:\n\n\"We have two girls in the school: Therese keeper and Henriette Ross who continually upset the discipline. They are both fourteen years old though you would think that they are sixteen. We don't know what to do with them and they won't listen to anyone. We tried everything to make them understand better but it seems useless. We certainly cannot keep them any longer in the school as they corrupt the morals of the young girls and are spreading bad spirit in the school. I cannot send them to the reserve as they are orphans and nobody wants to keep them. We found a place in Winnipeg where they keep girls of that temper. They would accept these two girls under the same conditions that the Department pays for the children here and they would be ready to take them before the end of this month. Could you give us permission to send them right away and would the Department be prepared to pay for them while they would be at the Good Shepherd until they reach the age of sixteen or eighteen.\"\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6487, file 42123-3, part 1)\nHenriette Ross was placed in the Home of the Good Shepherd on July 4, 1942. Recently we have been advised that it will be impossible for this institution to keep her longer, due to her conduct. They consider her actions are due to some mental condition.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you could arrange to have her examined immediately, with a view to determining what action should be taken regarding her.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nJanuary 11, 1944.\n\nEnclosed are copies of a memorandum from the Schools Branch regarding Henriette Ross. It would be appreciated if you, or Doctor Maclay, would arrange to have this girl examined and reported on.

Hamilton,  \nInspector of Indian Agencies, Manitoba,  \nWinnipeg, Manitoba,\n\nDear Inspector Hamilton:  \n\nRe: Henrietta Ross,  \nHome of the Good Shepherd.\n\nI visited the above named Institution and made inquiries about this girl. It seems that Dr. Bird of the Psychopathic Hospital examined her and I read a report dated March 8th, 1947, in which he stated \"her intelligence is definitely below normal and she can be classified as a mental defective, high grade moron. If it is the wish of those responsible for her care, they can sign an application to have her taken into custody and she would be considered for admission to the Institution at Portage la Prairie, etc.\"\n\nI telephoned Dr. Bingock, superintendent of Mental Hospitals for the Province, with the view of having her admitted to Portage la Prairie. He informed me that they have had to close one wing of the hospital owing to their inability to secure nurses and that at the present time it was impossible to take her, nor could he promise to consider her application for some time.\n\nIn view of the above, I am uncertain what should be the next step. I understand from the Sister whom I talked to that she was very undesirable, in fact a menace to the other girls. I would think it might become necessary to lay a charge and have her dealt with in Juvenile Court and taken off their hands in this way.\n\nOf course this is only a suggestion which might be considered by those in whose custody she is at present.\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"M. MacKay\"\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Henrietta Ross,\nDept. letter 103-123,\nJanuary 21st, 1944.\n\nI now enclose a report submitted by Dr. MacKey.\n\nTwo difficulties exist; namely, hospital accommodation and lack of staff to care for those committed. I understand there are long waiting lists and apparently the only way to surmount this difficulty is to follow the suggestion given by Dr. MacKey. If the girl is brought into court and committed to the Portage Institution, no doubt in some way accommodation could be found.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nfor Manitoba.\n\nEnc.\nOttawa, Ontario  \nFebruary 3, 1944\n\nre: Henrietta Ross.\n\nMr. Hoey and I have discussed this case and have decided that you should take steps immediately to have a charge laid against this girl in Juvenile Court. It will probably be necessary to have the Sisters from the Home of the Good Shepherd appear in court to give evidence regarding her behaviour. They will have to state in court why they have been unable to manage this girl. It may be necessary to have Doctor MacKay and Doctor Bird also give evidence.\n\nPlease attend to this matter without delay as we are having considerable pressure put on us here to have the case removed from the Home of the Good Shepherd and we know of no alternative way of disposing of her other than having the Court commit her to the Portage Institution.\n\nF.

This girl has been at the Home about one year and seven months. She was examined by Doctor Brian Bird of this hospital on March 3rd, 1943. He found her to be a High Grade Moron, with an intelligence quotient of .65.\n\nThe Sisters report her to be bad tempered, occasionally noisy and profane, and repeatedly in conflict with her environment.\n\nShe is now 15 years of age, a fine looking well developed adolescent. She does hand work such as fancy needle work, knitting and sewing.\n\nIt is recommended that you, or her legal guardian, sign the necessary papers requesting her admission to the Manitoba School for Mental Defectives, and she will then be placed on our urgent waiting list.\n\nWe have the necessary room for a limited number of urgent cases of this type, but unfortunately due to shortage of ward personnel, we are unable to use it. We have many worse cases in the community demanding attention for whom prior application has been made, and who should receive first choice.\n\nThe situation is such that we are not able to promise immediate admission of this girl to the institution at Portage la Prairie.\n\nThe first step is to have the application formally filed.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[T.A.

Our main trouble now is to establish a \"guardian\". The Sister Superior of the Home is willing to sign but I doubt if that will meet the requirements. The papers may have to go to the Principal of Cross Lake School who legally is in the position to sign.\n\nI telephoned the Sister today and explained that I expected the forms tomorrow and that I would take them out for her to sign. She appeared quite satisfied; but expressed the hope that the girl would be taken out soon. The Sister stated she asked to have this done eleven months ago and feels that she has been quite patient.\n\nDr. Pincock in his capacity as Provincial Psychiatrist has the powers of a Magistrate and so can commit Henrietta, which you will note he is prepared to do as soon as room becomes available.\n\nDr. Ridge knows Dr. Pincock, having worked with him at Brandon; consequently he has been a great help, and I feel certain the case has been handled in the best way to maintain good working relations between all concerned. I will advise you later concerning the outcome.\n\nA.G.

Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant,\nwith reference to Henrietta Ross. I trust you\nwill keep in close touch with the doctors\nconcerned in this case, as it is quite evident\nthat this girl should be placed in the Portage\nla Prairie institution as soon as accommodation\ncan be secured.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAttention of Mr. P.E. Hooper,\n\nRE: Henriette Ross - Cross Lake,\nYour file 102-125.\n\nSince my previous letter dated February 14th I visited the Home of the Good Shepherd with Dr. Ridge, who examined Henriette. Dr. Ridge filled out the medical form and I filled out the others. These were sent to Dr. Pincock under cover of the following letter:\n\n\"As suggested in your letter of February 11th, I am enclosing Form Numbers 1, 2 and 3, in connection with the above girl.\n\n\"Dr. Ridge suggests that in view of the fact that this girl has already been examined by Dr. Brian Bird, he would be willing to complete Form Number 1.\"\n\nDr. Ridge referred to Henriette as a high grade moron. To me she appeared similar to many Indian girls who lead quite a normal life on their respective reserves.\n\nThe girls at the Home of the Good Shepherd are a mixed lot. I understand about forty have been committed there by the Juvenile Court for various offenses, while the balance, about twenty, are victims of various ratings. Henriette, as noted, is a high grade moron, and I fear her association with the Juvenile Court cases has been to her disadvantage. I am sure she has seen and heard things she never dreamed of while in the school at Cross Lake.\n\nI feel sure Dr. Pincock will make the transfer as soon as he can be obtained; however, a letter from you requesting his special consideration might hasten things along.\n\nA.A. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 22, 1944.\n\nMr. A.G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant,\nwith further reference to Henriette Ross. With\nreference to the last paragraph of your letter,\nthe Department desires you to keep in touch\nwith Doctor Pincock in order to make certain\nthat this girl will be admitted to the Portage\nla Prairie institution at the earliest possible\ndate. The same instructions were contained in\nofficial letter of the 17th instant.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Henriette Ross,\nFile 103-123.\n\nOn February 16th I examined this girl at Inspector Hamilton's request. My impression is that she is a high grade moron, neither better nor worse than probably about 7,500 people who are considered normal citizens of the City of Winnipeg. She has been for two years in a home for criminal and immoral girls and if she is any worse it can reasonably be attributed to that confinement.\n\nIt is my considered opinion that in permitting a girl to be placed in such an environment without appointing some person or persons to take a personal interest in her welfare, the department has placed itself in an unfortunate if not actually illegal position. I would strongly recommend that a review be made of all wards of this Department at present in institutions to determine whether or not they are being looked after by interested persons.\n\nWith regard to the disposal of this particular case, I would recommend that if any person could be found on her own or any other reserve willing to act as guardian for a short time, that this girl be returned to a home environment.\n\nJ.M. Ridge, M.D.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 26, 1944.\n\nMr. A.G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nI desire to refer you to official letter of the 22nd instant and previous correspondence, with reference to Henriette Ross. We are today in receipt of a letter dated February 22 from Doctor Ridge in which he suggests that, if any person could be found on her own or any other reserve willing to act as guardian, he feels she should be returned to her home environment.\n\nThe Department feels that this suggestion is one that would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to put into effect. We are willing to agree to it if you know of any Indian who will take her. However, in view of the previous reports received regarding her condition, the Department still feels that she should be placed in the Portage la Prairie institution as soon as there is a vacancy and her admission to that school should not be delayed on the off chance that at some future date we might locate an Indian who would care for her.\n\nR.A.

Mr. Flanagan's memorandum to me is on the file hereunder. On receipt of his memorandum the Medical Division communicated with Inspector Hamilton asking him to have a psychiatrist examine Henrietta Ross and recommend their treatment. Inspector Hamilton had considerable difficulty in arranging to have her seen by the Provincial Psychiatrist, but on January 25 Doctor MacKay reported that this girl had been examined by Doctor Bird of the Psychiatric Hospital on March 8, 1943 and was classified as a high grade moron. On February 11 Doctor Finck, Provincial Psychiatrist examined the girl again and reports her \"in fairly looking well developed adolescent of 15 years of age, she does good work such as fancy needle work, knitting and sewing.\" He states that Doctor Bird would have rated her as a high grade moron with an Intelligence quotient of .65. The Sisters report her to be a bad tempered, occasionally noisy and profane girl, repeatedly in conflict with her environment. Doctor Bird stated, in connection with her proposed admission to the Home for Mental Defectives at Portage la Prairie, that there were many worse cases in the community demanding attention for whom prior application had been made, and who would receive first choice. On Inspector Hamilton's request Dr. J. V. Hodge examined this girl and reported as follows:\n\n\"My impression is that she is a high grade moron, neither better nor worse than probably about 7,500 people who are considered normal citizens of the City of Winnipeg. She has been for two years in a home for criminal and immoral girls and if she is any worse it can reasonably be attributed to that confinement.\"\n\n\"It is my considered opinion that in permitting a child to be placed in such an environment without appointing some person or persons to take personal interest in her behalf the Department has placed itself in an unfortunate if not actually illegal position. I would strongly recommend a review be made of all wards of this Department at or in institutions to determine whether or not they are looked after by interested persons.\"\n\nWith regard to the disposal of this particular case I recommend that if any person could be found outside other reserve willing to set as guardian for her that this girl be returned to a home environment.\n\nThen I visited Winnipeg at the request of Mr. Flan-\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6437, file 42123-3, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nthese two girls. Doctor Simes was in the city so he accompanied us. After careful questioning of both these girls by Doctor Simes and myself, we were of the opinion that neither of these girls were very much different from normal Indian girls of their age and coming from similar environment. It is my own opinion that the diagnosis of high grade moron would be used by any psychiatrists not familiar with Indians were they to examine 50% of the Indian girls on any reserve.\n\nThese girls are both determined to get out of the place where they are now being detained. This institution is a place where immoral women are sent by the courts often for treatment of venereal disease and I very much doubt the wisdom of sending these Indian girls into these associations. I would also question our local position in allowing these girls to be kept locked up in such an institution. I found one of the girls under lock and key in a tiny room and heard reports of handcuffs having been placed on one of them. In attempting to get out of the institution I think the girls show a perfectly normal reaction.\n\nHenrietta Ross stated that she had no relatives at Cross Lake Reserve who would be willing to keep her and she thought that if she could get a job she could make her own way. She told me that she had heard that there were some Indian girls employed at St. Boniface Hospital. As a result of this information I interviewed Doctor Sinclair, medical Director of St. Boniface Sanatorium and he arranged for Inspector Hamilton and I to see the Sister Superior. I explained the situation to the Sister Superior and she took the girl on her staff that day, at the regular salary she was paying her other aides. I understand she is to work in their sewing room.\n\nAs regards Teresa Keeper this girl is extremely anxious to return home. She says that she has relatives, I forget whether it was an uncle or a sister, at Cross Lake Reserve, where she could make her home. I would recommend that the Department communicate with Indian Agent Lazenby and arrange to send this girl to Norway House on the first boat after open water so that I can arrange to have her sent to Cross Lake.\n\nP.

Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building, Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nRe: Henrietta Ross and Teresa Keeper,\nCross Lake Indian Reserve.\n\nThe Director has sent on to me copy of a memorandum received by him from Dr. Moore on the above-noted girls. This memorandum was submitted to the Director by Dr. Moore, immediately following his return from Winnipeg.\n\nThese girls, as you are no doubt aware, have been confined during the last couple of years in the Home of the Good Shepherd, Winnipeg. It would appear from Dr. Moore's memorandum that a position has been secured for Henrietta Ross at the St. Boniface Sanatorium. We can only express the hope that she will be reasonably satisfied with this position. In regard to Teresa Keeper Dr. Moore states: \"This girl is extremely anxious to return home. She says that she has relatives - I forget whether it was an uncle or a sister - at Cross Lake Reserve, where she could make her home. I would recommend that the Department communicate with Indian Agent Lazenby and arrange to send this girl to Norway House on the first boat after open water, so that he can have her sent to Cross Lake\".\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would take the steps necessary to have this girl returned to the Cross Lake Reserve at the earliest possible date, providing you can secure from Indian Agent Lazenby assurance that a home can be provided for her amongst her people. If you can secure this assurance, would it be possible to obtain a position for this girl also in Winnipeg?\n\nI have carefully reviewed the correspondence.\nL. J.

I am afraid a change is inevitable.\n\nDr. Simes, of Fort Qu'Appelle, saw Henrietta when he was in Winnipeg and thought she might be used at the Hospital. It would no doubt be necessary to send her with an escort because I doubt if she will wish to go. Her main desire now seems to be to get work in the city where she can be her own boss and of course be on the streets most of the night.

I also interviewed Dr. Pincock and he felt this was our best move. He pointed out that Henrietta would be under the constant supervision of a Doctor who no doubt could gain important information which would be useful should it become necessary to confine her to a mental institution.\n\nMrs. Matheson accompanied Henrietta on Friday, May 5th, to Indian Head, Sask., where she was met by some of the Hospital staff.\n\nHenrietta is a good worker but undoubtedly has a bad temper. She appears to take violent likes and dislikes and if she doesn't like certain girls she becomes very disagreeable. I do, however, feel she is trying to improve.\n\nA.G.

It is impractical to return this girl to Cross Lake or Norway House. If she is unmanageable in the hospital and is of no further use to you, could you arrange to have her kept by an Indian family? The department would pay a moderate sum for her maintenance. Failing that, you might try to arrange to have her committed to a Saskatchewan institution.

Moore\n\nRe: Henrietta Ross\n\nReplying to your letter 103-125 dated August 4th, 1944 regarding the above named girl.\n\nThis girl with another of the maids, Elizabeth Wapack, beat it off for Regina Fair, on or about July 20th. Apparently they solicited a ride to the city from Fort Qu'Appelle with Oil Truck Drivers. These big hearted gentlemen, very kindly gave them One Dollar to secure breakfast on arriving in Regina about 5 a.m. These girls had left without any money and only the clothes, which they were wearing. They visited the Indian Encampment after they had dined. Elizabeth Wapack was taken care of by Tom Chicoose of Pasqua Reserve. She was brought back to Pasqua Reserve on Sunday, July 23rd. On Monday she was brought to the hospital. We arranged for her return to Pelly Agency the following day by train.\n\nRegina office was asked to have Henrietta picked up and returned to the hospital. When she was located she was washing dishes in one of the Cafes. One of the staff of the General Superintendent of Indian Agencies office, was of the opinion that she could not be returned to Fort Qu'Appelle, as she had done nothing contrary to law. This was satisfactory to me. I assured them they were assuming the responsibility for her welfare and behavior. For no reason they phoned the hospital to say that she would be on the bus the following evening and to arrange to have her met on her arrival in Fort Qu'Appelle.\n\nWhen Henrietta first arrived from Winnipeg we had difficulty in getting her free from Scabies and Impetigo. She was almost as bad when she returned from Regina, as when she first arrived here. While she has been helping some of the time in the hospital, if allowed out at night, any regulations about returning at 10 o'clock were absolutely ignored. She would drift in anywhere from 1 to 5 a.m. The following day she is absolutely useless. At present she is confined to bed following an acute attack of tonsillitis.\n\nThere is absolutely no grounds, no matter how long she may reside in the Province, on which to commit her to any institution. If you were going to commit similar cases as hers to institutions, you would have to make provision for 90% of the Indian Girls on Reserves.\n\nThe suggestion of paying somebody to keep this girl is not a practical one. This girl will not stay on any reserve away from the bright lights and crowds.\n\nWhen she recovers we will give her another chance. The unfortunate part is if she ignores the regulations and remains out as late as she pleases it upsets the rest of the staff. The only solution to the problem that I can hope for is that some young Indian boy will come along and take her legally for Better or Worse.\n\nM.D.\nMedical Superintendent\nQu'Appelle Indian Health Unit.\nJuly 17, 1945.\n\nINSPECTOR'S REPORT ON NORWAY HOUSE INDIAN AGENCY\n\nThe Indians complained about the education the children obtain from the boarding schools. They feel it does not go far enough and their children cannot qualify for teachers' office help or to in any way compete with the white people. They feel the young people cannot always remain on the reserve, and looking to the future the Government should make it possible for the children to get advanced education or vocational training to fit them for different occupations. They are short of public school accommodation. Certainly another school is needed and I would refer to Mr. Lazenby's letter concerning the location dated November 28th, 1944, in reply to Departmental letter dated June 23rd, 1944, file 123-2-5.\n\nA.G.

HAMILTON\n\nAS/AS\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6487, file 42123-3, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nThe Hustons have happily assumed responsibility for the care of Betty Carol Monias (Indian) since the death of her father five years ago. The father Swart Monias was from Island Lake and belonged to the Norway House Agency. Betty will be seven years old this coming January. During the past year at Miami she took grades one and two and passed into grade three with a mark of eighty seven percent. Under ordinary circumstances it was our intention that Betty should continue her schooling at Miami.\n\nHowever circumstances are not to be what one might term normal for us this year. Phyllis our own daughter has completed grade eleven at Riverbend School for Girls in Winnipeg. She goes back for grade twelve at the end of this month. Next June she will enter the hospital to train as a nurse. The reason for this year being other than normal for us arises because of the high cost of our daughter's schooling for this her final year.\n\nIn order to help meet this cost Mrs. Huston has taken employment at the school as House Manager. This involves the temporary disruption of our home life. It also means that I shall live alone as a bachelor in the Manse for the next ten months.\n\nThis disruption raises the question of what to do for Betty. She is not our adopted child but our own child could not be nearer our heart. She is clever, sensitive and loving and for her sake we must not have it appear that she is but a secondary consideration. It would I believe affect her whole personality.\n\nOur thought is that she should go to Riverbend since it is to be for but a single year. There she would be close to Mrs. Huston and our own daughter. The cost would be in the neighbourhood of six hundred dollars. I can do on behalf of Betty what I could not do for my own daughter. I can go to my friends for financial aid. I do not anticipate any great difficulty.\n\nIn the meantime my purpose in writing to you is to request on behalf of Betty's welfare a grant equivalent to that paid by your department on behalf of an Indian child in the average Residential school. Her real father is dead and her mother has remarried. I would also request that the amount go forward from the department payable to \"The Riverbend School for Girls\" on behalf of Betty. I believe the board of Managers will give a certain discount in view of the circumstances which will help my problem in raising the sum required.\n\nBetty if she is permitted to live will be a remarkable child. She has been taking music lessons and can pick up a tune in a few minutes. Since she was five she has on occasions sung before audiences of three hundred or more. She has qualities for leadership. Mr. Bucat has seen her several times. I think perhaps Mr. Hoey is quite familiar with the circumstances surrounding her life. I do feel that if the Indian Department will give evidence of a desire to help that it will greatly encourage other sources from whom I hope to get help. This may be an out-of-the-ordinary request but I trust the circumstances may reasonably warrant you granting it. I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nA.C.

I would, therefore, recommend that a grant equivalent to a boarding school grant be made available. The Department's decision concerning this matter would be appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nfor Manitoba.\nRIVERBEND\nSCHOOL FOR GIRLS\n\nWinnipeg\nOct. 2/47.\n\nMr. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Mr. Hamilton;\n\nRe-Betty Carol Monias,\n\nBetty Carol Monias as you know has been our responsibility for the past five years. During that time you as well as other officials in the department of Indian Affairs have seen her. You will confirm what I may say regarding her mental ability and our personal interest in her welfare. Betty, to make a long story short has been accepted in our hearts equally with our own daughter Phyllis.\n\nPhyllis has been in attendance at the Riverbend School for Girls for the past three years. She is now in her last year; her fees, board and tuition costs us seven hundred dollars. This explains my reason for having to accept work on the staff as business manager. My husband under these circumstances is having to carry on his duties as minister at Miami without my support in the home. You will understand our daughter was unable to get tuition in grade XII studies at Miami.\n\nThis having to break-up the order of our home in order to help our daughter through her final year raised the question of what to do for Betty. She will soon be seven years old and is so exceptionally clever and sensitive. She is so much ours in every sense of the word that we felt we could not cast her off as a solution to our problem. We felt she had to get the fullest consideration so I have brought her along with me to the Riverbend School.\n\nHer fees tuition and board are in the neighbourhood of six hundred dollars. The girl's alumnae of the school donated $75.00. We are seeking to raise what we can through personal friends. We did feel that the Indian Department might be willing to contribute the equivalent of that paid by them on behalf of any Indian child in the average Indian Residential School. This request is just for this year and it is made under pressure of circumstances described above.\n\nIt certainly seems to me that my request is most reasonable. It is also made on behalf of a child that shows exceptional ability. A child who can pass with high standing through two grades in a single year. She is also being given training in music and dancing. I would appreciate you presenting our request on behalf of Betty to the Department. I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6487, file 42123-3, part 1)\nMiami, Man., Box IO,\nOct. 16/47.\n\nCol. F.B.

The grant if given was to be forwarded to \"The River bend school for Girls where she is at present a pupil in residence.\n\nThis little girl has been in our home since she was a year old and it is our intention to see her educated and established in life. In my letter I tried to explain adequately the circumstances that necessitated us having to make the request for a grant from the Department. The little girl is a treaty Indian from the Norway House Agency and our request was that the department pay to the school mentioned a sum of money on her behalf equivalent to what they would pay to the average Indian Residential school on behalf of an Indian child in attendance.\n\nThe letter I wrote you must have been laid aside. I am still hoping for a reply. About two weeks ago we interviewed Mr. Hamilton regarding the same matter. He was not told that I had written you. His letter will perhaps be in your hands by now. I trust you will appreciate my long wait for word from you and my need for action and that you will give the request made through you and also through Mr. Hamilton your sympathetic interest.

SINCLAIR, GAME GUARDIAN\n\nEDUCATION\n\nOf all the needs that present themselves before the would-be student of the overall aspects of a Registered Trapping area, there is always one that resolves itself as the key-point of departure, and upon which all others are dependent.\n\nSuch a one in the Oxford House area is Education.\n\nWhilst education may be but a minor need in other areas, it is an acute need in the Oxford House area.\n\nThere is a reason for this, and it is the following:\n\nThe Oxford House area is composed of one hundred and fifty-one active trappers. All of these but two are Treaty Indians. When the Game Branch officials decided to place an officer in this area in 1945, these trappers did not know the basic rudiments of conservation. Being an isolated group, cut off from most contacts, even those of commercial activity, they had no way of learning at first hand, the benefits nor the results of conservation, therefore their outlook mentally was more or less the same as it was a hundred or so years ago. Viz: \"Kill, kill and kill\" game. A report was brought in to me by one of my converts to the effect that, his Chief told him the following: \"Why should you worry about the enactments of the Government when you have the enactments of God, who put the animals upon earth for your use and benefit. Your choice lies between one or the other\".\n\nIn this case I had to take urgent measures to correct this distorted viewpoint by calling a general meeting of all the head men and trappers, in which, happily, the Chief was present. I proceeded as follows in part: \"It has come to my knowledge that some of your outstanding men, to whom the government looks up to for leadership, have on occasion, let slip some ideas that would tend to confuse and bewilder the minds of those of you who are willing to cooperate in the conservation scheme instituted by the Government. To be explicit, I will quote one of these; (quote) why should you worry about the enactments of the Government, when you have the enactments of God, who Himself put the animals upon this earth for your use and benefit. Your choice lies between the one or the other (Unquote). These are ponderous words indeed, but not necessarily right, and it is my duty to declare them wrong, in that they do not include the fundamental principle involved, which principle is based on the natural law of propagation and survival, also divinely instituted.\n\nIt is true that God did put the animals and natural...\nresources upon earth for the use and benefit of mankind, but He also put natural laws to govern these benefits. \"If wisely used, they will propagate; if misused, they can be reduced even unto extermination.\n\nAll those of you who are familiar with the Holy Scriptures, will remember how God in His wisdom has provided the means of governing and protecting every benefit He has set upon earth. For instance, The Church. He has provided leaders to govern this holy institution. Without them, or by their abuse, the church would deteriorate or fall to universal abuse, to be no more, even though it was a divine institution dedicated for the use and the benefit of mankind.\n\nIn the same way He has placed upon earth, Anointed Herds, Kings and Government to govern the country, its assets, and its people, with power to legislate on matters concerning the benefits He has placed at the disposal of mankind, well knowing that not all mankind would treat these benefits wisely, and that sometime or other, would deplete them even to the extent of extermination.\n\nAsking the herdsmen what views they had in the matter at hand, each one in turn, gravely condemned the attitude quoted and advised ill presented himself upon the words and explanation presented to them this day, and charging upon matters of conserving the resources for their children, and saying that all should abide by the wise enactments of the Government, I thanked them for this and dismissed the meeting for other important work.\n\nI will now give a second example that will bring out the need for an applied policy of education for these peoples. An old patriarch came for an interview and didn't take up the following matter stating, \"I think the Government made a wrong move in expecting that no damage could be done one year in case. If we do not kill it, the wolf will before the snow is gone. If the Government had made an enactment rather to prevent the wolf from getting it, well I'd say there was some wisdom to this enactment\".\n\nThis is the kind of reasoning which the officer in the field often comes across and brings out the important fact that the officer must ever be on the alert to give the right answer, without offending the reasoning he is trying to correct.\n\nI have reserved to the last, the most important reason why an active campaign should be instituted for the re-education of the populations similar to that of Oxford House.\n\nIndian Element\n\nThe Indian element carries with it a number of peculiarities in outlook, mentality etc., some of which are traditional and therefore harder to accept or change to new viewpoints and on top of this, one is confronted with the bewildered state of mind of a race once noble but now fallen to a lower level.\nHe has been shorn of all initiative and responsibility and in search for a medium, he has come to the press where he expects the rest of society to shoulder his responsibilities for him whilst he shirks duty in almost all walks of life. Indian parenthood lording all responsibility of education for its children to the white teachers without an effort on its part to co-operate in the home and behavior respect, very often with disastrous results. The final result being that the young element is now on the highroad to revolt.\n\nMost of these have come to the press where they refuse to assume any responsibility whatever. Two councillors of the Band came to me one day wanting to know if I could give them any suggestions to a problem they had. \"We can not understand our young people today. They have lost all respect for anyone, and even for themselves. They sleep away the best hours of the day and when they get up, they are of no use to anybody.\" I could only suggest an examination into the parent-control angle.\n\nEven the one redeeming factor that has come to the rescue of the juvenile element which is, that of subjecting the family allowance to compulsory attendance in school, is being turned to naught by the bad example set before them by the grown element cited above.\n\nFacts such as these (and there are others) have a direct bearing on any attempt at their betterment. Take for instance, the rehabilitation scheme undertaken in their behalf. At once the fundamental question asserts itself. Should this ten year plan attain success, and they become well-to-do, then what?\n\nTo what extent has their responsibility been nurtured in the meantime that would enable them to assume serious responsibility to funds, liabilities, and other functions of an ordered society.\n\nAt once the logical conclusion asserts itself that unless an intensive educational program is formulated and followed up in an energetic manner, there can be but little hope of attaining satisfactory results in any undertaking for their betterment.\n\nThis also applies and has bearing to all organizations concerned.\n\nThe several elements ought to be overruled:\n\n1. Parenthood must assume its measure of responsibility for the proper education of the children. To attain this, there should be an adult educational system that would deal with subjects of sanitation, knowledge of the relative value of time and things, clean recreation, and a well ordered social life etc. And all elements belonging to the supervision of the several branches, such as the Game and Fisheries, Forestry Branch, Church and School etc., should entertain a sense of duty towards this behavior.\n2. The young element could be brought to line by the institution of some kind of drilled life such as a boy or girl scout organization could give, and which would gradually instill and bring to life those early responsibilities that are so important and essential to any community. These clubs should not be subject to any church or guild but rather based on the standards of a sound Canadian Society.\n\n3. Another aspect of this need for an intensive programme of education for the Indian element is this: The Indian is a good copyist naturally. He has copied the mode of life of the white race in respect to housing himself, but he totally disregarded the rules of sanitation to the utter detriment of his health. Pole floors in lieu of the habitable brush floors which could formerly be renewed periodically. Closed in and airless shocks in lieu of the open skylight of the hunting trail, has not contributed any to his stamina so needed to his rigorous life.\nARMY MESSAGE\n\nOttawa, Ontario,\nJuly 7th, 1948.\n\nFILE: 103-123 (E.1)\n\nMr. R.S.

B. F. Neary.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter handed to me by Mrs. Sherry, of the Department of National Health and welfare, regarding Betty Monias. Apparently this child was taken by the Reverend Mr. and Mrs. Huston of Pine Falls, when she was a baby.\n\nBetty, who is eight years of age, was left by her mother in the care of Mrs. Huston, so she could go to work when Betty's father died. The child is in a good home and it would be to her advantage to leave her with Mr. and Mrs. Huston until such time as she is educated.\n\nApparently Betty was put in Riverbend School last year, and while $180.00 has been paid on the account, an amount of $160.44 is still owing. Can anything be done to pay this account; also could an allowance be made for the care and education of Betty?\n\nPlease advise me in this matter.\n\nR. S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nEncl.\nRSD/ES\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6427, file 42123-3, part\nPine Falls, Man.\nFeb. 8, 1949.\n\nMrs. Helen Snary,\nIndian Health Dept.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Mrs. Snary:\n\nRe: Betty Monias\n\nA letter has just been received from Mrs. R.J. Ross, matron of the Indian Residential school at Fortage la Prairie in which she states that she had spoken to you on our behalf concerning our little girl Betty. She also stated that I might write to you direct.\n\nBetty was accepted into our family circle following the death of her father (Ewart Monias). She was eight years old in January and has been our responsibility since she was a baby of eighteen months. Our association with her parents through the work has been intimate and of long duration. It seemed only natural that both parents should desire that we take care of Betty. This left the mother free to earn without an encumbrance her own living. We have not tried to seek legal adoption of Betty because we felt it was better for her to grow to maturity all the time realizing she had worthy parents. We correspond with her mother who has since re-married and we retain for Betty pictures and letters sent by her father to us before his death.\n\nYou will realize that through the years from babyhood Betty has become an established fact in our family. Our own daughter Phyllis is now eighteen so Betty in a sense is our only child. Here at Pine Falls our manse is beside the school. Betty attends regularly. She is in grade three. Twice weekly she takes piano lessons from a Winnipeg teacher. Frequently she sings in public.\n\nBetty attended public school in Miami for almost a year. Last year I was on the staff of the Riverbend school for girls in Winnipeg. Betty was registered there as a pupil with our own daughter Phyllis. Betty has been exceedingly popular everywhere she has gone. Her disposition, personality and mental ability makes her outstanding. Last year at Riverbend she won the award for heading her grade throughout the year.\nBetty's fees at Riverbend amounted to more than $600. The department paid $180 toward this amount. We still owe $160.44. I took a position as business manager on the staff so we could finance Phyllis through grade twelve. The fees for both girls was more than my salary. You might check with Miss J.M. Carter the principal regarding the above figures, also as to what she thought of Betty and her prospects for the future.\n\nMy present purpose in writing is to request that the department accept responsibility toward paying off the balance still owing on Betty's fees at the Riverbend School. I am not taking the position of one who would dare to point out a duty. The Indian department is under no obligation to send a ward to a residential school for white girls. I merely request that in view of what we have tried to do for Betty that all the facts be taken into consideration. Betty you will agree when the records are checked has cost the department practically nothing while all the time she has been privileged to enjoy opportunities unsurpassed even by white children. We hope that we may be able to demonstrate what such opportunities can do for a child of Betty's ability when she is allowed to mature entirely detached from the Indian environment.\n\nBetty at the present time requires to have her eyes tested and I believe from my own experience as nurse she will require glasses. Her hearing has never been good. Specialists have said she would grow out of that defect. We have seen to it that she has had the regular annual T.B. test and her teeth have been cared for by the local dentist. Right at the present time she should be taken to an eye and ear specialist and in view of her need I would like to request the department to make an appointment and to assume responsibility for the cost. I could take Betty into Winnipeg at the time appointed. Immediately following the noon day luncheon would be most suitable for us who have to reckon with a bus schedule.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Mrs. A.C.) Marjorie Huston.\n28th March, 1949.\n\nMr. R.S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of\nIndian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nWe have your letter of the 3rd instant\nwith reference to Betty Monias. In view of your\nrecommendation we are prepared to allow an amount\nof $160.44 which is still owing in connection with\nher tuition for the current academic year.\n\nWe feel that the situation with regard\nto this girl should be very carefully reviewed\nbetween now and the end of June. Possibly, you\nwill have an opportunity to visit Pine Falls within\nthe next few months, and you could interview Mrs.\nHuston at that time. For your information, I may\nsay that we have paid some expenses for this girl\nin previous years.\n\nEvidently she is being educated as a white\ngirl and consequently, is in an entirely different\nenvironment from her original home. Mr. and Mrs.\nHuston seem to be quite interested in her and took\nthe girl without making any arrangements with the\nDepartment for payment for her education.\n\nWith the above thoughts in mind, we are,\ntherefore, suggesting that you interview Mrs. Huston.\nPossibly the present situation is the best for\nall parties concerned, but at the same time, it is\napparent that our responsibility has not ceased,\nbecause when foster parents experience financial\nreverses they apply to us for assistance.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6487, file 42123-3, part\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nWe will look forward to receiving your comments on the whole matter following your interview.\n\nBernard F.

The expenditure amounts to $75.65 and is charged against his Agency Trust Account. One item on it was paid by cheque No. 67701 and was for 86\u00bd hours at 60 cents per hour for a stenographer. Apparently the person employed was Mr. Sheane's wife.\n\nI have searched our files and have been unable to find that there was any authorization for such employment. I know, of course, that Mr. Sheane must have been almost buried with work during the last few months.\n\nHowever, the reason I am writing at this time is to inform you that such action should not be taken in future without the proper authority. I am also afraid that the new Superintendent might take this as a precedent and continue such employment without authority. As you know, we are having difficulty - and rightly so - with the Treasury Office in paying accounts of this nature. They point out to us that if such employment is necessary it should be handled by the creating of a position for a limited length of time. It might be, of course, that this employment was authorized by you. Please drop me a line concerning the matter on receipt of this letter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. G. F.

The former, Duncan M'Kee, who intends to build his first house next summer is in need of building paper, windows, doors and nails. The latter one, Mary Blacksmith, wife of Joseph M'Kee, is asking for a kitchen and dinner set as teapot, plates, cups, etc.\n\nIn this hard time of depression, all Indians, but especially here, in this season wherein...\nfurs are so scarce, these two Indians are in pretty bad condition, and certainly deserve some little help if possible from Indian Department.\n\nHoping you will favourably hear their humble request,\n\nI am dear Sir, Yours very sincerely,\n\nRev. Henry Boettler\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, March 4, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Rev. Henry Boissin, O.M.I., requesting assistance for two ex-pupils of the Cross Lake Residential School. One of these is Duncan McKay, who, it is stated, intends to build a house next summer and is in need of building paper, windows, door and nails. The other is Mrs. Joachim McKay (formerly Mary Blacksmith), who requests a supply of dishes.\n\nAs the Department is prepared to consider granting some assistance to ex-pupils when they settle down on a reserve and start housekeeping on their own account, I would request that you investigate both the above cases and advise if you consider they are deserving of assistance. If so, you should give an estimate of the approximate cost of the articles which you would recommend be supplied.\n\nI wish also to refer you to official letter of October 13th, last, to which you have not replied. Please let me have the information requested in that letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nP. G. Lazenby, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nRef: 1-A\n\nNorway House, Man:\n19th March 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter No; 34-123 of the 13th October 1934, regarding the Rev: Henry Boissaint's recommendation that Alexis Masson of Cross Lake be granted ex-pupil assistance, being an ex-pupil of the Cross Lake R.C. Residential School.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that I was at the Cross Lake Reserve during last week, and find that Alexis Masson is a man of about 30 years of age; married and has three children, and, with the fair catch of fur obtained this winter, this man should be quite able to complete his house without Departmental assistance. I did not see Alexis Masson himself, at the reserve, as he was away, but this information was given me by Indians, the Manager of the Hudson's Bay post, and the United Church Missionary.\n\nMoreover, it is apparently about 12 years since this man left the school, and if this man is to be considered as an ex-pupil, and be given ex-pupil assistance, after being out of school for so long, there are scores of others who will undoubtedly want the same consideration shown them also. My understanding of an 'ex-pupil', based on instructions sent out some years ago by the Indian Commissioner's office & Regina, is a boy or girl who has not been out of a school for more than two years.\n\nI do not recommend that the assistance asked for in the above case be granted.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6487, file 42123-7, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nRef: l-4\n\nNorway House, Man:\n20th March 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter No; 34-123 of the 4th instant in reference to the Rev. Henry Boissin's request that ex-pupil assistance be granted to Duncan McKay and Mrs Joachim McKay (formerly Mary Blacksmith), of the Cross Lake Reserve, as being ex-pupils of the Cross Lake R.C. Residential School.\n\nOn my visit to the Cross Lake Reserve last week, neither of the above Indians were at home, and I did not see them personally. However, I made inquiries regarding them both, of the Chief of the band, and other Indians, as well the United Church missionary, and find that Duncan McKay is an unmarried man; has no intention of getting married and settling down, so far as I could discover; he has been about six or seven years out of school, and is working a good deal of his time for one of the nearby traders. He has made no definite move as yet, with regard to the building of a house for himself on the reserve.\n\nRegarding Mrs Joachim McKay (formerly Mary Blacksmith), I am informed that this woman left the school 7 or 8 years ago, and now has two children. Her husband is a good trapper and provides for his wife and family fairly well.\n\nIn neither of the above two cases is the individual concerned settling down on the reserve and starting housekeeping on their own account, as per the second paragraph of your letter; neither do either of them really qualify as 'ex-pupils' in my understanding of the term, and I do not consider that the assistance asked for is necessary.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.,\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6487, file 42123-7, part 2)\n\nF.G.

Lajeunesse, O.M.I.,\nBishop of Keewatin,\nThe Pas, Man.\n\nPP/O'M.\nNorway House, Man.,\n25th March, 1937.\n\nDear Chief:\n\nI am sending you herewith a number of copies of the Resolutions you brought in some time ago, as you requested, and I am forwarding copies also to the proper officials of the Indian Department.\n\nWith reference to the balance of the clauses, relating to the proposal to Colonize the graduates of the different schools on the reserve, and provide them with Horses, Implements, Bulls and Cows, and Pigs and Poultry, I may say that in my own opinion, this would not be in the best interest of such graduates. What would be good for them, would be to discharge from the school healthy boys when they reached the age of 14 years, and let their fathers take them out on the trap lines and teach them to hunt and trap and fish. For generations past the Indians of this northern district have known no other way of earning their living, and it is therefore the natural thing for them to do. To go into stock raising in this country except for local consumption, would certainly not be wise, owing to the high cost of transportation to market, and for various other reasons. You will possibly argue that the invasion of the Indians' natural trapping grounds by white people from outside has so depleted the fur bearers that there are not many left. However, for your information, I may say that negotiations are now in progress on foot between the Department and the Government of Manitoba, to greatly improve matters in this connection, and with good hopes of success, so that in the near future, the fur bearing animals, will be more available to Indians than to the white population.\n\nP. G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\nRESOLUTIONS passed by the Chief, Councillors and Members of the Cross Lake Band assembled in Councils held on the Cross Lake Reserve on 25th December 1936 and 18th January 1937.\n\n15. Whereas the schooling of our children in most cases has not been sufficient to enable them to successfully compete with the white element of the population, and whereas this fact makes it imperative that they be thrown back upon their band, and whereas this latter fact again inevitably brings them often to a lower level than the old standard through inactivity.\n\n16. Be it Resolved therefore, to bring before the Department the following suggestions:\n\n17. That an honest effort be made by all parties concerned, to colonize on their reserve the graduates of the different schools.\n\n18. That suitable and sufficient areas on the reserve be apportioned to them.\n\n19. That every reasonable help be extended to them by the authorities of Government, Church, and Reserve, for clearing and tilling, and carrying on of a scale of gardening and stock raising, commensurate to a decent living, thereby continuing, and bringing to a logical completion, their civilization.\n\n20. That the Government give them a grant of Horses, Implements Bulls, and Cows, Pigs and Poultry.\n\n21. That the Department give a certain appropriation for the procuring of Roofing, Windows and doors.\n\n22. That the Department institute a joint Departmental and Band jurisdiction on such colonization, exclusive of party of Church affiliations.\n\n23. That the graduates hereon affixing their signatures are willing to abide by all reasonable decisions and rulings of the Board controlling the Colonization.\n\n24. Whereas the present deplorable state of our Indians is a direct reflection on certain parts of the administration.\n\n25. Resolved: That the Colonization of the graduating element, and the institution of a Rat Farm jointly put into effect, will set our Band on a footing of resource that will not only be of immense benefit to us, but will also not be detrimental to the administration in years to come.\n\nSigned\n\nA.

A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nP. G. Lazenby, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nSt. Joseph Residential School,\nCross Lake, March 15th, 1936.\n\nTo M. R.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nI feel confident that as your present condition enables you to help and encourage our ex-pupils, you may be interested in what has consisted, what may be called our Follow-up System for girls who graduated both in the Residential School before and even after the fire of 1930 and also from the Day School.\n\nBeing in Cross Lake, as a teacher both in the Residential and Day Schools, since 1920, I have seen our girls getting married and settled. So in 1933, we have started a Society composed of ex-pupils, either single or married, who came more or less regularly to sew at school to their convenience. We started with seven members and are now up to thirty. At times we have from three to nineteen members at a meeting.\n\nThis year we have, with the agreement of R.F. Chamberland, principal of the Residential School, started another branch of sewing for which we are in need and thus apply for a sewing machine and also a certain quantity of material such as cotton, flannelette, print or gingham. Till now, the members have been working, either at home or at meetings, mostly from charity clothes they ripped and made into children and baby clothes; but the material is not sufficient. The women could even prepare for the mothers to be a very simple baby layette.\n\nThe Sister Superior, a graduated Home Nurse of the St. John Ambulance Association, who visits our ex-pupils when sick, do all what is in her power for the sanitary living condition, though she is not the Field Matron.\n\nWe even have from Remailing Departments, a circulating\nLibrary for ex-pupils.\n\nNow as to Indian Handicraft, the material being so expensive in the locality, we would only try to encourage the few ones who would excel on that line, for it will be very seldom one could make a revenue from it.\n\nWe have spoken the project over with Mr. P.G. Lazenby from our Norway House Agency on his visit this week. He seemed interested and even encouraged us. I then made it my duty to interest you to our Girls Follow-up System and trust our requisition will receive a particular and favorable attention.\n\nYour very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6487, file 42123-7, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSt. Joseph Indian Residential School,\nCross Lake, March 15th., 1936.\n\nTo Mr. A.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am greatly in favor of the Ex-Pupils Society I found here established on my arrival as Principal of the St. Joseph Indian Residential School. I encourage it more than ever and would be very much in favor that the acquisition be granted to help to keep on with its plan.\n\nVery sincerely,\n\nA. Chamberland, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 15th instant and was very much interested in the letter of Sister St. Luke outlining the work that she has been doing with ex-pupils of the Cross Lake Indian Residential School. The Department is quite prepared to supply a sewing machine but this cannot be shipped until navigation opens on Lake Winnipeg. Arrangements will then be made to forward the machine.\n\nWould the Reverend Sister consider it advisable to encourage hand loom weaving? If so the Department would favourably consider supplying a loom.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. A. Chamberland, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nSt. Joseph Indian Residential School,\nCross Lake,\nvia Norway House, Man.\nIndian School, Cross-Lake, Man.\n\nRe: Ex-Pupils' after school training.\n\nJuly the 6th, 1938\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe different works undertaken by the Indian Department for the Indians' Welfare convince me of the staff's ability and care. Particularly I have been taking great interest in your directions regarding the Indians' questions, and I should admit you seem to meet the different problems with a true understanding.\n\nI feel then encouraged and confident in addressing you the present, dealing with the question of the \"ex-pupil's after school training\".\n\nIt is now generally admitted that the Residential Schools' Graduates' conditions have to be improved. Their standing does not contrast, as it should, with the one of those who haven't received any education.\n\nThe Indians' present living conditions are at worst as everyone knows. If the ex-pupils problem has always been difficult to meet with, during prosperity, it is at the present very much harder and more than ever requires a prompt and practical solution.\n\nAt the prospect of what they have to do with the scarcity of their means, they are overwhelmed, and keep still, thinking simply their position is hopeless.\n\nThis situation has been put to study by the officials of this school, and they have thought to stimulate the ex-pupils by organizing them in a society.\n\nRight Rev. Bishop Lejeunesse has given his approbation, and strongly encouraged the scheme.\n\nThe Principal, is the General Director of this society, while Bros. M\u00e9nard is the acting Director. Bros. M\u00e9nard is pretty well qualified to head this work to success; he has a long experience amongst the Indians, has a clear understanding of their needs and of their weaknesses and has the qualities of a leader.\n\nThe main object of the society is to give them confidence and promote personal ambition and prove to them the possibility of improvements with their own resources. It is by no means to make farmers with them, but to initiate them to work and make them realize the results of work.\n\nIt has been well inculcated into their minds that they have to depend first of all on their personal efforts and not to expect help from the Indian Department or from elsewhere.\nat least before they have given proofs of their good will and perseverance.\n\nThis Society has been in action for three years and has twenty graduates as members. The number increases every year.\n\nThe first undertaking has been a community garden for themselves. It has proven to be a success. All the members have worked steadily and have proven themselves really to be well minded and willing to better themselves. This spring two acres of potatoes and different vegetables have been sown, what will certainly help to solve the food proposition. This work is a success and it will be easy to put it on a larger stand.\n\nThis has enabled us to see the results. It has influenced them. Their ambition has been whetted and they certainly have made noticeable improvements in their own gardens and in their general way of living. Of course it is only a beginning and one's could not expect thorough changes. Nevertheless it is a step forward and I am sure that with a prudent direction we should have better results still.\n\nI have to notice this was done by their own means. They have been supplied practically nothing in food or tools and this purposely so they will make their mind from the very start and realize that with their own efforts they can do things if they only try.\n\nHowever I will ask to point out that they have needed encouragements, and most of all examples. Bros. M\u00e9nard has not spared himself. He has joined them in their work and this without expecting any remuneration of any kind, what he will do in the future.\n\nThis summer they have undertaken the building of a roothouse for which you have been asked a small quantity of lime and cement. I think the work will be completed this fall if we receive the requested material. This will enable them to keep their vegetables and save their seeds for their own end for the community gardens.\n\nThe next thing to promote is proper housing. Very few of the ex-pupils have their own houses and they can not practically meet with these needs in their present conditions. We are at the point now to depend on some help. It is in this mind I have asked you through the Indian Agent some help and building material for a couple houses, which will be erected this summer. It is the only requisition we want to put in this year. It is undoubtedly needed if we want to keep the progress going.\n\nFor next year what will be asked for will be building material for four or five houses, the same quantity and quality for each house as we have requested this year. If a smaller quantity of food could be available it would be in many circumstances of great importance. As much as possible we insist that they provide food for themselves when they work. As you are aware of it is not always available and hinder the work. However if the Indian Department is not prepared to assist them in this regard we will try to strive without it, but again it would be of great help.\nRe: Girls' Society:\n\nI was very thankful for being promised a sewing machine. Unfortunately I am still waiting for same which I hope will be sent in before closing of the navigation season.\n\nNaturally, if you are interested in obtaining more particulars and full informations concerning both \"Boys' and Girls' Societies\", I would be just too pleased to fully inform you on their organisation as well as on their management.\n\nHoping this will meet with your approval and devoted patronage I beg to remain\n\nYours very sincerely:\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. R.

I greatly appreciate this donation as it meets their needs and will certainly promote their ambition. Your interest in the ex-pupils' societies is a welcome help.\n\nRe: Boys' Society.\n\nThe extraordinary work we had to carry on last fall, has hindered, to a certain extent, the progress of this society. However, the proposed roothouse (16'x20') has been built. As we had none of the requested materials, we had to build up with logs! It can remain so for a couple years, when a good masonry work could be made. In the meanwhile the stones will be brought on the site.\n\nThis year's crop has shown important improvements on last year's: 130 bushels of potatoes, 42 sacks of turnips, 15 sacks of carrots, and also onions, lettuce, radishes, peas, beans, corn in rather small quantities, mostly for experimentation purposes. We are very well satisfied with the results and confident to have greater success still as the field will improve.\n\nThe total production may not seem very important. Nevertheless, it is progress, and it provides only seeds for the community and the \"farm gardens\" that it will make noticeable change, as many as the past years could not seed their own plots for lack of seeds. However, everyone of the members get from this source an appreciable help for food. At the present, it does not correspond yet to the needs, but will in the future, gradually, be carried out so the whole production will be proportionated to the consumption. Also, by the fact they will get familiar with these vegetables on the community garden, they will urge more to raise them on their own. This point alone merits consideration. It would help considerably to solve the food question to their health's benefit.\n\nWe look forward, as I mentioned to you in my last July letter. The good housing proposition has to be dealt with. We can't expect any progress as long as they migrate from one house to another, crowd two or three families in one place. Besides all the inconveniences for hygiene, education of children, etc., it kills personal ambition. They simply will not improve their homes, their gardens and get interested in something than they have nothing. There is a great deal of time lost to the prejudice of their general welfare.\n\nThe handicap, to overcome this situation, is their poverty. They need more than encouragement for this work; they need help. In this view, I am enclosing a list of building material, I will be thankful to be granted with. I also give you the names...\nof those who intend to erect a living house next summer. I want to point out, however, that this material is asked for the society and will be handed only to those who will build the walls of their houses and show an intention to finish the work. These buildings will be put up in an united effort of all members. The necessary logs for the walls and for the lumber, will be cut this winter and as our sawmill is operating now, it makes our plans easier.\n\nI trust you will be prepared for such an action. I realize that the amount of money required is important, but the realization of this plan should prove effective for our graduates' welfare.\n\nThe tools requested are needed for the erection of these houses and will prove very handy for the different carpentry work they have to do for themselves. I just requisition the essential tools for the present. Last year, I had given this list to the Indian agent and never got any answer.\n\nIn a couple years of time, the different works undertaken should have assured the necessary vegetables and the proper houses. We ought then to have them interested in carpentry work and homemade furnitures, the building of scaffolds etc., etc., can be an action of course, needs preparation and for this purpose has to be done next summer. However, we have to do something in this regard. Times have changed. Practically nobody can afford to procure himself a canoe. The same applies for furnitures. It is this intention that brings me to ask for pitch and sugar. We are going to make a couple adits for the very necessities. The possibility and utility of such a work is a sure thing. Time is the main factor required. At the present we are not ready to meet with these necessities.\n\nLet Girls' Society.\n\nThe progress of this society is satisfactory. Themselves, they have not so much to be taught about housekeeping, and all other household works. If they only had the necessary things and a more determined will, the situation will be improved at once by a great deal. The attention given to them, the encouragements they receive have caused some changes.\n\nLet us add as conclusion that to head this work to success, patience, perseverance, effective help at the right moment, united action are required. We should never imagine to hang an easy or immediate success. The past experiments should make away every delusion. However, I am convinced that a careful, intelligent and persevering action has to bring out some improvements. This should encourage us to give ourselves up and do what is within our reach.\n\nYou will be favoured with Mr. G. Lazenby's visit.

Indian Day School\nCROSS LAKE,\nMan.,\nFebruary 10, 1939.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nIndian Affairs Branch.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nOn account of a certain misunderstanding, the sewing machine granted so generously by the Department for our Ex-pupils Sewing Circle came in late last fall.\n\nI take it a part of my duty to acknowledge its reception and to thank you heartily for it. It will help us to elaborate the plan of our girls Follow-up System I took the liberty to inform you about last year.\n\nWe would be glad to forward you any piece of sewing you would specify, in order to show how our ex-pupils have profited by the Sewing Course given at school. I take this same opportunity to tell you that some of these girls find a way of earning a little by knitting, at which they excel; others by cutting out and sewing garments for their recite, while others can dress their children very neatly out of second hand or charity clothes we receive for them. What is missing, is the material for babies layettes now that our girls are married. I would be glad to know how you and other officials consider this project and I am waiting for your advice.\n\nWe had the pleasure of speaking to Hon. Crerar when he came for the school last summer and we were glad to offer him a few samples of Indian beading and embroidery. We heard that the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa intends to help so as to encourage Indian handicraft. I would be very much obliged to know how help is to be sent and how we may collaborate to have this effectively accomplished with our ex-pupils.\n\nHoping to hear from you\n\nI remain sincerely yours\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6487, file 42123-7, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nFebruary 21, 1938.\n\nReverend Medea:\n\nI have your letter of February 10th, and I am glad to know that you are pleased with the sewing machine which has been provided.\n\nI am interested in what you say about your ex-pupils earning a little now and then by knitting. I believe there is a possibility of opening a market for well-made socks, and I shall be pleased if you will send a sample pair of men's white cotton socks. The wool should not be very heavy, as the call for these socks is from men who work them in connection with various sports, such as skating, and badminton. When I see a sample I will be able to let you know what we can do in this connection. We have had socks knit of heavy wool for $1.50 a pair, and I presume that for socks knit of finer wool, payment would be at any $3.50 a pair.\n\nWe have found that the Indian women need a great deal of supervision, as their tendency is to make the socks too short and too wide. They will need to be instructed to make them of a size and shape suitable for white persons. We find it necessary to make the same criticism regarding the beaded mocassins, for which there could be excellent sale if the shapes were suitable.\n\nSeveral years ago in a number of reserves the department supplied materials for making layettes for babies, and I regret to say that the result was that even those families which could well afford to provide these layettes refused to do so because others were receiving them free.\n\nReverend Sister St. Luke,\nSt. Joseph Residential School,\nCross Lake,\nvia Norway House, Man.\nI think it is a wise policy to adopt that Indians should learn to give something in exchange for what they receive. For instance, if an Indian woman can knit, it should be possible to arrange with her to make two or three pairs of socks (with the wool provided for her), and instead of receiving money, give her the necessary flannelette. Or if she can do bead work, take something of that sort in exchange. These, of course, are details of negotiation best worked out locally, but if you have a group of good knitters who will knit according to a good pattern and produce standard quality socks, I think we would not have any difficulty in supplying you with enough wool to start this project. You might be surprised at the way this sort of thing develops, and we are ready to give every possible assistance in marketing, providing the women are willing to work under supervision, and if persons like yourself will arrange to give careful inspection before any payment is made.\n\nWith best wishes, I am\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

I am enclosing the invoices and will be very obliged if you would attend this matter.\n\nYou will remark that we have changed a couple articles for bits and auger, which we thought afterwards, will be more needed.\n\nI have to thank you again and heartily for your well appreciated co-operation. The results of our work are very encouraging. The ex-pupils have seeded their community garden and have increased it. This has influenced them to have one of their own, and this year practically every one of them has his home garden.\n\nThe example set by the ex-pupils has had good effect on the whole reserve. I think that never yet have the Cross Lake Indians made so many and so large gardens. Of course, it could be still better, but I am sure that the more progress that this association will do, the more also will the Indians on the reserve improve.\n\nThe erection of the proposed living houses will soon be started. We are so much busy this summer that we can not give as much time as we would desire. However we try to have the plan going on.\n\nNext fall I hope to be able to give you an interesting report on the activities of this society.\n\nYour very obliged,\n\n[Signature]\n\nM.R.A.

Pupils' Society. No doubt you understand that the reconstruction and opening of the Residential School has surcharged us and hinder all other activities to a great extent.\n\nThe Ex. Pupils' Community garden has given satisfactory results, not so good, however, as we could have expected. We had too much moisture and cold during the first part of the summer. I have to say also that without having been neglected, it was not look after with all the care it should have been. Brother \u00c9dard who always takes a great part in that work as supervisor and as exciter and who puts even lot of his time, was held up by freighting over whiskey. Jack Forage the whole summer long. Many of the seeds belonging to this club were being steam on the construction. All this together has prevented to give to the garden the proper care. The crop is not so good as it should have been and the members admit it is partly their fault. However, we look forward with confidence hoping that this small failure will convince them that we have to help Providence and nature.\n\nThe scheme for the erection of living houses has been successful. Four new buildings were put up and are quite decent for Indians. Two others that had been started previously were completed. It makes a total of six inhabited houses that were not last winter. With one more that could not be finished last fall, you have all what was done in this regard last summer.\n\nMr. Horace Halcrow, who made an economic investigation last month, has noticed the progress of our ex. pupils and will certainly recommend this work. I am very openly that it is not perfect yet, and that there is still lots to be done. However, I think that it is a good start and that we should be satisfied and encouraged to go on with this scheme.\n\nI am enclosing a list of building material and of tools, with the confidence you would be able to meet with these needs. We had mails left over. The tools have proven very helpful and are in good shape. Brother \u00c9dard give his special attention and you may rest assure that they will be well looked after.\nSt. Joseph's Indian Residential School\nCross Lake, Man. February 24th, 1940.\n\n-2-\n\nYou may wonder about the amount of roofing paper I am asking for. A certain number of our ex-pupils' houses need new roofing. It is to meet with this need I am asking for extra paper and I would be thankful if you could do it. The Indians' actual economic stand puts them in the absolute impossibility of securing for themselves anything else than food. If we neglect to keep their houses, it will mean afterwards heavy expenses at one time.\n\nI am including a certain amount of paint, I think necessary and important to protect the windows. I believe it is worth the expenditure.\n\nI feel very obliged to you for the effective co-operation you have given us. I understand that the Department will have to face severe conditions. However I sincerely wish that you will be still in the position to continue us your help.\n\nYour very obliged,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. R.-A.

W. McGill\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa,\nOntario.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nWhen I visited Norway House recently I was interviewed by members of the Cross Lake Band who asked whether provision was made for the establishment of a boy who graduates from the Residential School. They told me that it was the policy of the Department to provide a small amount of money so that the young fellow could purchase hardware, windows, and a door for the log house which he would erect. I did not gather that the erection was done by the Department.\n\nFurther, I was told that it was the policy of the Department to assist in breaking a small amount of land surrounding the house so that he could grow a garden.\n\nI was delighted to have this information, which I trust is authentic. May I ask if this is the policy of the Department, and just how graduates from the Norway House Residential School and the Brandon Residential School who may belong to the Cross Lake Band are to go about it to secure this very necessary assistance? Is it necessary for the Principal to report the boys who have been discharged for whom this provision is required?\n\nI shall be glad to hear from you on these points as soon as possible.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGD:BJ\nOttawa,\nJuly 30, 1940.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nWith reference to your letter of July 24 provision is made in the current year's appropriation for a small amount to be used as assistance to ex-pupils of Indian residential schools.\n\nThe funds at our disposal are so limited that they only permit making individual grants of $100.00 to $150.00. Such grants are only made to ex-pupils who are recommended by the Principal of the residential school concerned and the Indian Agent as being likely to make good use of the equipment provided for them.\n\nIn the case of boys we allow grant for the purchase of material to build a house or for farming machinery. As regards the girls we allow either a sewing machine or some articles of household furniture if they are married. Grants are only allowed to those ex-pupils who have settled down within three or four years of the date of their graduation from a residential school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. Geo.

Instead of making that trip he went to bed and the Doctor says he must touch no business for at least a month. I therefore would recommend and ask that the following grants be made this summer.\n\nRe Ross Hardy (boy) graduate from this school in 1936 at 18 years of age.

With his own proceeds he has bought materials for a house which he wants to establish his own house this coming year. He plans a building 21 x 22 and already has purchased doors, windows, shingles (in part), nails, paint, tar and building paper, burlap for inside finish, curtains, blinds and curtains. He has the rough lumber ready for the work and 60 logs ready for building the walls. He needs the following and I would recommend that these be shipped to him this spring c/o the Indian Agent here:\n\n- 1 Sheet Beaverboard 4 x 6\n- 10 Rolls Shingles\n- 100 lbs shingle nails (for shingles & beaverboard)\n- 575 ft. fir flooring\n- 1 Cook stove\n- 1 Heater\n\nRe Fred McKay, graduate from this school in 1937 at 18 years of age.

In the winter he looks after the cattle and household at home while his father and brother are away trapping. He is quite handy with a saw and plane and makes a little income through carpenter work.

Ex-pupil assistance.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have just returned from visiting the inland reserves at the treaty time and I am submitting again the list of material for assistance to certain Cross Lake pupils, grant for which has been sanctioned by your letter of June 12th.\n\nI have personally investigated the boys mentioned as meritng assistance and I am satisfied that they are in positions to make good and immediate use of the materials.\n\nI regret that, owing to my absence, and also to the fact that I wished to satisfy myself that the assistance given would not be wasted, the season has now advanced so far that we in the North are already thinking in terms of the close of navigation. I would appreciate, therefore, if these materials could be shipped immediately. They would require to be sent:\n\nCross Lake,\nc/o The Selkirk Navigation Co.,\nWhisky Jack Portage,\nvia Warren's Landing.\n\nI received some time ago an application through our Cross Lake Missionary for assistance in building to Robert Ross, a graduate who left the school a year ago. He was in school 5 years, leaving at graduating age with a grade 6 standing. I examined the dwelling house which this boy with the assistance of his father, is erecting, when I was at Cross Lake a week ago. The log house foundation, planks, beams, and rafters are completed for a house of really excellent type, the type that we have been urging for construction on the reserves. It is 28'x18', with partitions for four rooms. In addition there is a lean-to kitchen. It is unfortunate that this building was inspected so late in the season, as it should be finished before the winter. I am enclosing a list of material which this building requires and if you can do anything about the supplying of at least a part of this material, such as the shingles, doors and windows, before the close of the season, it would be an undoubted incentive to the construction of good buildings. Unfortunately, the summer season is so short here that, combined with the difficulty of inspecting construction of buildings at distant reserves, the requisitioning of the material is necessarily late, and it is certainly not...\nMr. H.A. Hoey, (2)\n\nadvisable to make any application for building assistance until we are assured that the construction is so far advanced as to be ready for the material requested.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nAugust 25, 1941.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith list of material for four ex-pupils of the Norway House Residential School who are seeking to establish themselves on the Cross Lake Indian Reserve.\n\nIn view of the fact that these supplies should be shipped early in September you are authorized to purchase them from a firm or firms on the approved list. You will note that these goods are to be shipped to Cross Lake, c/o The Selkirk Navigation Co., Winnipeg, to Whisky Jack Portage, via Warren's Landing, Man.\n\nYour immediate attention to this matter will be very much appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Hoey,\nSupv. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have yours of August 25th advising me of the instructions to ship from Winnipeg materials for the assistance of certain Cross Lake ex-pupils in house building.\n\nI wish to express my appreciation of your prompt attention to this matter. Receipt of this material this year will give much encouragement to the ex-pupils who have spent the summer in the erection of the \"block\" part of their buildings.\n\nI feel that this assistance will meet a definite need on those of our Indian reserves where the houses are occupied during all, or the greater part, of the year. This does not apply to all our reserves as yet, as some live in their tents and trapping cabins much more than in reserve houses. However, where we have opportunity to assist in the erection of comfortable and houses to replace the small all-contained one-room variety now common in use, I feel that we can do more to advance the living and health conditions by giving such assistance (properly supervised) than by any other means. It is notable among the Indians, but, I think, very natural, that improvement in living conditions inculcates a spirit of independence, a more practical appreciation of the value of industry, and a sincere desire to stand on their own feet.\n\nI trust that this assistance will be continued in those cases where industrious habits would warrant it. To assist indiscriminately, and not solely as a reward for effort, would merely defeat the objective of fostering industry and independence.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\"Principal.\"\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6487, file 42123-7, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n**MARSHALL-WELLS COMPANY LIMITED**\n\n**WHOLESALE HARDWARE**\n\n**WINNIPEG, MANITOBA**\n\n**SOLD TO**\n\nDept. of Mines & Resources\nIndian Affairs Branch,\n536 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nRev.

Indian Residential School to establish themselves on the Cross Lake Reserve.\n\nBefore authorizing this expenditure the necessity for supplying this material was very carefully investigated and was personally recommended by the Principal of the Norway House School. Owing to the fact that this report did not reach this office until the end of August it was necessary to place the order immediately so that the material could be shipped before navigation closed and Inspector Hamilton was, therefore, authorized to make the purchase. It would be appreciated if you would issue purchase order so that the account may be paid. The coding is as follows: 950-76-15-307.\n\nR.A.

The logs will be sawed at the school mill. The dimension lumber and boards so provided will be used to build homes for all these ex-pupils.\n\nAll the window and door frames, the sash and doors will also be made at the school by the ex-pupils in their own workshop and under the direction of Brother Menard who is acting as manual instructor at the school.\n\nAs these ex-pupils have absolutely nothing of their own, it will be appreciated if the Department will supply ten axes, six spades, one cross-cut saw, the glass and hardware for the doors and windows. Nails in sufficient quantity must also be included in this bill of goods.\n\nWith this help, we intend to establish in their own homes between 10 and 15 ex-pupils. We hope that, when this building programme has been completed, you will be good enough to send an inspector from the Department in order that prove may be had of the use made of all materials supplied.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6487, file 42123-7, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, November 2, 1942.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 28th ultimo, the Department will allow the timber dues required to cut 25,000 feet of lumber to be used in the erection of houses for ex-pupils of the Cross Lake Residential School. I understand these dues will be at the rate of $2.00 a thousand feet.\n\nThe Department is also prepared to provide the axes, spades, cross-cut saw, nails and hardware for the doors and windows.

If this land could be secured for the purpose mentioned from the Provincial Government of Manitoba, Brother Menard's idea is that a muskrat farm could be handled under the direction of the management of the Cross Lake School and would provide an opportunity not only for the ex-pupils of the school, but also would enable the school management to train the older male pupils of the Cross Lake School in the proper handling of muskrat.\n\nFather Plourde understood from Brother Menard that the latter was in Winnipeg recently at which time he had an opportunity of interviewing Mr. Stevens of the Lands & Forests Department of Manitoba. He outlined his proposal to Mr. Stevens who appeared to be very favourable to it. Owing to the condition of his health Father Plourde is obliged to leave Ottawa immediately and will be absent for about two months.

Father Plourde discussed with me the possibility of supplying to the Cross Lake Residential School a machine to make shingles. We are not certain if we will have funds available for this purpose, but in order that we may have the necessary information I wrote to the Plessisville Foundry and I enclose pages 70, 71 and 72 of their catalogue. The Dunbar Type of machine shown on pages 70 and 71 is at present retailing for $495.00, f.o.b. Plessisville. Machine No. 321, shown on page 72, is now retailing at $395.00. This firm is stated to have had 70 years' experience as sawmill makers. It would be appreciated if you would let me know if either of these machines would meet your requirements. When replying the attached pages from the catalogue should be returned.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. G.E. Trudeau, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nCross Lake,\nvia Norway House, Man.\nFORANO LATH BUNDLER AND TRIMMER\n\nHEAVY TYPE\n\nThis machine is simple, rapid and reliable. It is well made in every respect and will give the best of service.\n\nTHE FRAME is made of seasoned hard wood, strongly bolted together.\n\nTHE BUNDLER is constructed entirely of grey iron castings, operated by a wrought steel foot treadle making very uniform bundles consisting of ten laths each which are easy to bind. The device is easily tilted to bring the bundle to the saw that trim the ends squarely and smoothly. A counterweight promptly releases the clamping lever when the bundle may be quickly removed.\n\nTHE SAW ARBOR is 1-1/2\" in diameter and runs in long and well lined, adjustable bearings.\n\nWe supply two 30\" saws.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\n| Pulley | 7 x 7\" | Floor space | 4' x 3' x 8\" |\n|--------|--------|-------------|-------------|\n| Pulley speed | 1200 R.P.M. | Weight | 510 lbs |\n\nLIGHT TYPE\n\nThis is a simple, cheap and reliable machine. It is made from seasoned hard wood, strongly bolted together. The operator can bundle, bind and trim laths rapidly and easily.\n\nThe chain is drawn around the bundle until it is tight and secured firmly by the operator's hand. One end of the bundle is held in the operator's hand and the other in the operator's hand. Then, with both hands, the cradle is lowered and both ends of the bundle are trimmed at once. Contrary to the illustration, the pulleys and the weight are placed outside the main frame in order to hold the laths very close to the saw.\n\nWe supply two 30\" saws.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\n| Arbor diameter | 1-1/2\" | Pulley speed | 1200 R.P.M. |\n|----------------|--------|--------------|-------------|\n| Pulley | 7\" x 7\" | Floor space | 4' x 5' |\n| Weight | 390 lbs. |\nThe Forano Shingle Mill (Dunbar type) is the product of an organization with over sixty years' experience in the design, manufacturing and testing, (under actual working conditions) of machines of all kinds, including Saw Mill Machinery.\n\nThis unit is the result of a request by the management, to the Company engineers, to make a detailed study of all Shingle machines on the market, interview all of large operators and, from the resulting information, produce a machine which would embody the best and most practical improvements to produce quality shingles at low cost.\n\nHaving proceeded with the foregoing in mind, the trade will not think it is unusual when we say that we are prepared to offer an unqualified guarantee to the most exacting customer. The fact that such large operators as Price Brothers specified the FORANO (Dunbar type) Shingle Mill as we believe, absolute proof of superiority actually found in operation by \"men who know\".\n\nWe have a large number of FORANO (Dunbar Type) Shingle Mills in operation, and we are pleased to say that we have yet to hear of any dissatisfaction.\nSt. Joseph's Indian Residential School\nCross Lake, Man.\n19 April, 1943\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of April the 8th received three days ago re: machine for making shingles, I am pleased to let you know that either of the machines shown on pages 70, 71 and 72 would meet our requirements. However the machine Dunbar type shown on page 71 might be more handy to us as it is more compact and take less room for installation. Our mill being very small there is not much vacant space left, this is why we think that the machine shown on page 71 would fit better.\n\nWe shall certainly appreciate to get either of the machines and will be able to make good use of it this summer as we have already 600 logs at the mill for the ex-pupils.\n\nHoping that you will be in a position to secure one of these shingle machines for us, I need not say that it would greatly appreciated by the ex-pupils and by us.\n\nThanking you sincerely for the utmost attention you are always showing for the welfare of the ex-pupils, I am,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nG.B.

The ex-pupils have cut these logs themselves, without cost to the Department, and they are now engaged in structuring homes for the members of the society. A request has been received for us to supply a shingle-making machine. For your information I enclose a page from the catalogue of the Plessisville Foundry, Plessisville, Que. The machine shown on page 7 can be secured for $465.00, f.o.b. Plessisville. In view of the good work this society has been doing, I believe that they should be encouraged by supplying the machine mentioned. It would be operated without cost to the Department. Provision is made in the current year's appropriation for assistance to ex-pupils and I feel that this is a justifiable charge against this particular item.\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and Departmental purposes only.

We have been successful in securing a shingle machine and enclose copy of purchase order. You will note that this will not be shipped for about three weeks. We are shipping this machine c/o Selkirk Navigation Co., Redwood Dock, Winnipeg, Man. This means that they will take the machine to Norway House and the Department expects that you will be responsible for its transportation from that point to Cross Lake.\n\nIn view of supplying this machine I understand it will not be necessary for us to supply the roofing paper, building paper and tarred paper requested in your letter of April 24.\n\nCan you have the windows and doors made locally at Cross Lake? If so, you might let me know their approximate cost. If they cannot be made at Cross Lake, it will be necessary to give more details regarding the size of the window panes. You may arrange for purchase of the 4 kegs of nails. These were also requested in your letter of April 24.\n\nWhen the new shingle machine arrives and has been put in operation, I should appreciate a report from you regarding its usefulness.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. G.E. Trudeau, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nCross Lake, Man.\n\nR.A.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare Training,\nDept. of Mines & Natural Resources,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am just in receipt of your letter of June the 30th and as our next mail will leave here only on the 29th I am sending you an answer by a special occasion.\n\nFirst I wish to express you in the name of the ex-pupils and in my name our sincere gratitude for securing us a shingle machine. It will contribute a great deal to make the houses of the ex-pupils more comfortable and of better appearance.\n\nAs far as I can see by your letter and by the copy of purchase order this machine will not reach us before the end of August so it means that before it could be put in operation it will be already late in September; so it will be impossible for some of the ex-pupils to have their houses completed before freeze up. In fact some of them would have already completed their houses if they had roofing and doors.\n\nAs for the windows and doors they could not be made locally this year. Next year we could make the doors here if we were supplied some 3/8 inch veneer for the panels of the doors. As for the windows we don't think we could make them here, but the doors we could make them at the cost of $5.50 each.\n\nIn my letter of April 24th I had also asked for some building and barred paper. These items could not be replaced by shingles and I asked you could send some soon with the windows and at least 4 doors for this year. As we are not sure if we will be in a position to make some shingles before fall it would take at least 20 rolls of roofing paper to finish some of the houses before fall.\n\nThe size of the window panes ordered in my letter of April is 8\" x 10\" as it is a standard one in this country.\nAs mentioned in your letter I am purchasing the 4 kegs of nails from the J.H Ashdown Hardware Co Ltd., and will have them send you the invoices directly for payment.\n\nI hope you will be able to order the other materials immediately so we could receive them in August and have some of the houses completed for the fall.\n\nAs soon as we will have the shingle machine in operation I will be glad to send you a report on it.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG.E.Trudeau, C.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nAugust 8, 1943.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd ultimo, with further reference to the requirements of the ex-pupil colony at Cross Lake. I am not certain from the fourth paragraph of your letter if you could make the doors. In the first part of this particular paragraph you state that they cannot be made and in the latter part you say that you could make them at a cost of $3.50 each. If this work can be done locally, the department approves making 7 doors. It has been decided to allow you to secure the 21 windows. These should be purchased as reasonably as possible. You may also secure 20 rolls of roofing paper.\n\nI attach account covering the cost of the shingle machine.

So as requested in your letter of the 6th of August I am returning herewith the two copies certified.\n\nAs all the boys have gone out west harvesting I fear that we won't be in a position to make some shingles this fall. However if we can I will be pleased to send you a report on the results.\n\nOnce more I wish to thank you in the name of the boys of the Society and in mine as this will mean a great help and a great encouragement for the boys in the erecting of their buildings.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nG.E. Trudeau, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\n\nP.S. In my letter of July the 23rd I meant that we could not make any doors this year, but next year we could make some at the cost of $3.50 each provide that the Dept. would supply us some veneer for the panels.\n\nG.E.T.\nTHE PLESSISVILLE FOUNDRY\nDESIGNERS - FOUNDERS - FABRICATORS\n\nManufacturers of FORANO Machines since 1873\n\nPlessisville, Que.\n\nSold to Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nShipped to St Joseph's Ex-Pupils Society, Cross Lake, Man., c/o Selkirk Navigation Co., Redwood Dock, Winnipeg, Man.\n\nDate 19 July 1943\nYour Order No.: 18994\nYour Req'n No.: \nOur Invoice No.: 56102-5366\nTerms Net Cash\nF.O.B.

JOSEPH'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL,\nCROSS LAKE, Man., dated March 3, 1945.\n\nOne of our best seamstresses and best girls at school and ever since out of school will soon get married, and wishes to make application for a sewing machine, hoping to get one as a means of earning for their new home which is built already for she is to marry an ex-pupil.\nOttawa, March 23, 1945.\n\nMr. P. G. Lazenby, Indian Agent,\nNorway House, Manitoba.\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Sister St. Luke, of the Cross Lake Residential School, in which she states that one of their girls, who has been discharged from the school, is being married shortly. She states this girl was a very good pupil and has conducted herself very well since leaving school. I am sending the Sister a copy of this letter in order that she can advise you regarding the girl's name. When you receive this information you should write to us, as it is our intention to supply her with a sewing machine.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nCOPY SENT TO SISTER M. ST. LUKE\nEv\u00each\u00e9 - Bishop's House\nLe Pas, Man., Canada.\n\nle 19 mars, 1945.\n\nRev. P\u00e8re O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\nUniversit\u00e9,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nR\u00e9v\u00e9rend et bien cher P\u00e8re,\n\nEtant de passage pour quelques jours chez Son Excellence Monseigneur Lajeunesse, j'en profite pour vous envoyer quelques notes sur le Cercle St. Joseph des Anciens \u00e9l\u00e8ves de Cross Lake.\n\nDepuis la convention de St. Boniface, je ne crois pas que vous ayez re\u00e7u de rapport sur le Cercle St. Joseph. Fond\u00e9 d\u00e9j\u00e0 depuis sept ans, le cercle ou soci\u00e9t\u00e9 St. Joseph fonctionne toujours malgr\u00e9 toutes les difficult\u00e9s du commencement.\n\nPour \u00eatre bref, je vous fais ici une liste des principales \u0153uvres de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9: Elle a aid\u00e9 \u00e0 la construction de 17 maisons nouvelles et \u00e0 la r\u00e9paration de plusieurs autres.\n\nIl y a trois ans un chantier de 10,000 pieds de bois \u00e9tait sci\u00e9 pour eux. En 1944, 12,000 pieds et cette ann\u00e9e encore un chantier de 400 billots a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait il y a deux semaines.\n\nUne boutique a \u00e9t\u00e9 am\u00e9nag\u00e9e depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es avec des outils fournis par le D\u00e9partement, l'\u00e9cole et la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 elle-m\u00eame. Beaucoup d'anciens en ont profit\u00e9 pour r\u00e9parer canot, traines, traveaux, etc., et pour faire aussi des raquettes, armoires, bancs, tables de toutes grandeurs, etc.\n\nL'ann\u00e9e derni\u00e8re, une belle barge de 34' x 6' a \u00e9t\u00e9 construite avec les anciens pour le transport pour les compagnies de fourrures et surtout pour leur approvisionnement de bois sec pour l'hiver. Cette barge est \u00e9valu\u00e9e \u00e0 $200.00. Chacun s'en sert \u00e0 tour de r\u00f4le en payant une piastre ou plus et cet argent est mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 pour les r\u00e9parations futures.\n\nPour les jardins coop\u00e9ratifs, c'est assez difficile dans le moment. Depuis trois ans les jeunes gens s'en vont travailler un peu partout en dehors, nous avons donc d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'en encourager les jardins particuliers et au printemps on va faire un grand mouvement coop\u00e9ratif pour les labourer et les ensemencer de patates et l\u00e9gumes et chaque famille verra \u00e0 l'entretien de son propre jardin. Ce sera le seul moyen d'y\nint\u00e9resser aussi les femmes et les enfants, le temps ne leur manque pas.\n\nMaintenant quelques mots sur les besoins de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pour l'ann\u00e9e courante.\n\nPour le travail de coop\u00e9ration, nous manquons de tout, je me demande si vous ne pourriez pas nous obtenir de l'Arm\u00e9e par l'entremise du D\u00e9partement des Indiens, plusieurs tentes de diff\u00e9rentes grandeurs pour 3 ou 5 ou 8 hommes; des toiles imperm\u00e9ables, batteries compl\u00e8tes de cuisines et m\u00eames po\u00eales. On form\u00e9 plusieurs \u00e9coles militaires et camps, peut-\u00eatre pourrait-on avoir aussi d'autres outils, pelles, haches, etc., enfin tout ce qui peut servir, ces gens sont d\u00e9pourvus de tout pour travailler.\n\nSur toute la r\u00e9serve il n'y a que deux charrues pour 150 familles et plus. Il en faudrait une sp\u00e9cialement pour la soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\n\nNous voudrions faire au moins 20 portes mais pas moyen d'avoir de veneer ou Masonite de 4 ou 3/8 pouces. On nous le refuse pour la guerre, je pense que le D\u00e9partement pourrait nous obtenir pr\u00e8s de 300 pds. carr\u00e9s de l'un ou de l'autre.\n\nMonsieur Doucet avait promis aussi des livres pour m\u00e9tiers: menuiserie, forge, m\u00e9canique, peinture, jardins, nous avons encore rien re\u00e7u.\n\nBien cher P\u00e8re, nous avons bien des jeunes de bonne volont\u00e9, nous comptons sur vous afin qu'ils ne se d\u00e9couragent pas. J'esp\u00e8re que ces quelques notes seront suffisantes pour vous faire conna\u00eetre nos activit\u00e9s et nos besoins et nous avons esp\u00e9rer par votre entremise d'\u00eatre aussi bien compris aupr\u00e8s du D\u00e9partement des Indiens.\n\nJe vous remercie donc d'avance pour votre aide g\u00e9n\u00e9reuse, vous assurant aussi le concours de nos faibles pri\u00e8res pour l'am\u00e9lioration constante de votre sant\u00e9. Je demeure votre tout d\u00e9vou\u00e9 en Notre-Seigneur et Marie immacul\u00e9e.\n\n(Sign\u00e9e) Fr\u00e8re T.R.

We will also purchase a quantity of glass if you let me know exactly how much is needed.\n\nOur principal difficulty is regarding the manner in which these supplies could be shipped. Is it possible to forward by winter freight? If so, let me have full particulars. If winter freight is not available from some point in Manitoba to Cross Lake, it will be necessary to delay shipment until navigation opens next Spring.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend G.

Plourde, O.M.I.\nUniversity of Ottawa,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nReverend Father,\n\nOn March 19, 1945, Brother M\u00e9nard sent you a report concerning the activities of the Saint Joseph Club of the older pupils of Cross Lake, and, according to news received from Cross Lake, Brother M\u00e9nard has received your reply in December last. He has also received in good order the requested supplies, for which he thanks you very much.\n\nActivities of the Saint Joseph Club in 1945.\n\nLast year, as in the past, the Saint Joseph Club of older pupils has improved or enlarged approximately 10 private gardens; it helped to the construction of four houses and several improvements were made in other residences, such as flooring, cupboards, tables; moreover, about ten outside toilets were constructed since the visit of Mr. Moriss in 1944, without taking into account those which had already been constructed thanks to the initiative of the Saint Joseph Club. The Saint Joseph Club has been granted this year a permit to cut 20,000 feet of lumber to provide for the needs of the members to the making of over a thousand fish boxes, and the Club even foresees the sale of several thousand feet of lumber because that business seems to be more promising.\n\nSaint Joseph Co-operative Society.\n\nNow that lumber will be cut on a co-operative basis, because the Saint Joseph Club will be organized as a co-operative to teach the Indians to protect their rights and their gains against the invasion of outside business. From now on, that Club of older pupils will operate under the name of Saint Joseph Co-operative Society.\nUntil now the Saint Joseph Club has done its best to improve the social condition of the Indians, and thanks to the initiative of the school and to the relative help from the Government it has been successful. But civilization progresses towards the North and threatens to invade the Indians' mode of living; it is certain that if the latter do not organize, the people from outside will take hold of any business which could be a financial help for our older pupils unless they are taught to organize to protect themselves against the invasion by outside business. For example, Brother M\u00e9nard wants to teach them, during the Summer, the transportation of goods which arrive from Cross Lake through Wiskey Jack portage, and, during the Winter, the transportation of the fish caught commercially; he also wishes to teach them to act according to co-operative principles in the lumber manufactured by them and in (kinds of) all other business, such as the manufacture of furniture, fish boxes, etc.\n\nThe School Share.\n\nIn order to help our older pupils, the school is ready to do its share, but it also requests Government help. For example, it is ready to put the saw-mill at the disposal of the Society provided a slight compensation for the depreciation of machinery is granted; or else, it wants to abandon in their favour the Summer transportation on Wiskey Jack portage, that is, it is willing to put at their disposal the truck and storage places.\n\nGovernment Help (shop)\n\nThirdly the School wishes to build and furnish a shop which could be used for the manufacture of toboggans, cupboards, tables, boats, and to the repair of canoes, etc. According to our plans, it will have a basement which will be used as a garage and storage by the co-operative. We want a modern shop, which is impossible to get unless Government help is granted, such as cement, building paper, interior furniture, including necessary machinery: motor, universal machine, wood-lathe, ribbon-saw, sander, forge, etc. The older pupils would be prepared at the saw-mill.\nGovernment Help (Tractor)\n\nAs the transportation of fish caught during commercial fishing operations is a fairly big problem and as everything indicates that more extensive fishing will take place in the future, certain outside initiatives show the desire to take over that transportation; should this be done, they would take away ipso facto from the Indians a considerable financial income, so say the least, $4,000, which would deprive several families of their only means of livelihood during the Winter due to the fact that fur-bearing animals become scarcer around Cross Lake.\n\nWe have thought that the older pupils, under the direction of Saint Joseph Co-operative Society, could organize themselves for the transportation of fish caught during commercial fishing operations if the Government were willing to supply a tractor, with trailer.\n\nQuestionnaire.\n\nI have on hand a questionnaire about the various activities of the residential school which are in operation or which are to become in operation at the school and on the Reserve. One of these questions is as follows: Has any attempt been made to organize some form of cooperatives on the Reserve? In order to reply to it, we declare that we intend to organize a kind of co-operative society with the older pupils who are ready to establish that form of society since, during the past 10 years, they have joined the Saint Joseph Club for older pupils, which has been very successful with the little means they have at their disposal. Now that the social conditions of the Indians are improving steadily....the Saint Joseph Club is no longer in a position to operate alone, the requirements of their standard of living, which is becoming modern little by little, even in the North. For example the Indians are unanimous to say that within a few years, hunting and fishing will be insufficient to provide for themselves. This is why we believe that the cooperative is the best social form which could meet their present needs. We will help that way our older pupils to improve their social condition and we will thus meet a wish which the Government has mentioned in the questionnaire which was sent to us.\nBut, once more, we cannot comply with the Government's wish if it does not agree to make the necessary sacrifices to start that movement. The Government should therefore help us in the construction and installation of the shop which is mentioned above and in the purchase of the tractor. This would enable the older pupils to make the transportation of goods during the winter and of the fish caught during commercial fishing operations. The tractor would also be a big help in the cartage of logs, which becomes more and more important every year.\n\nThe Episcopal Corporation has already bought a farm tractor (Farmall A) for the Cross Lake School, and two other tractors for the schools of Sturgeon Landing and Beauval; we believe that the Government, now, should supply the tractor to the co-operative society of the Older pupils of Cross Lake School.\n\nShare of Brother M\u00e9nard in the Society.\n\nThis Society is under the direction of the school. We are ready to free Brother M\u00e9nard from all other occupations and to give him the responsibility of that movement, for which he possesses the necessary qualities. Thanks to the experience he has acquired in the course of the past 10 years while directing the Saint Joseph Club for the older pupils. More than anyone else he has hopes of success in view of the ascendancy he has over the older pupils whom he has known when they were boys at school.\n\nMitigated Co-operation.\n\nUntil now we have spoken of co-operative movements, but this must be explained. There is no question here of mitigated co-operation which could become, by degrees, a real co-operative. The Indians do not possess an exact notion of co-operation. They need a chief (Brother M\u00e9nard) who, by degrees, will make them understand all that is expected from them by the co-operative. The sum of $25.00, as share, will be asked from each member, in one lump sum or by instalments. This will be a means of uniting them more closely, and the sum received, including the $150.00 presently in our reserve, will constitute the initial necessary capital of the society towards its activities.\nIn all the said activities, the members employed will be paid salaries. Out of the receipts, a dividend will be paid at the pro-rata of the number of hours of work, and another dividend will be paid at the pro-rata of shares; it is understood that Brother M\u00e9nard will receive no compensation. However, as the Indians lack perseverance, we wish that a certain part of the receipts be set aside in the name of the society, which will make up the capital required to pay the wages or the purchases which the society will necessarily have to make. It is because of that that we will say that we can only at the present time indulge into mitigated co-operation. The co-operative promises to give detailed reports either to the Government or to the Agent, according to their wish.\n\nExceptional opportunities.\n\nWe recognize that this is an exceptional opportunity to try the experience of a co-operative society among the Indians. Indeed, Cross Lake is the only school in the Vicariate where favourable conditions presently exist to do something for the Indians.\n\nKindly reply as soon as possible in order that we may know your point of view in regard to the points mentioned in our letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMartin Lajeunesse, Q.M.\nVicar Apostolic of Keewatin.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: Cross Lake Indian Residential School.\nAttention: Mr. Philip Phelan.\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI am enclosing for your consideration, a rather long letter addressed to me by His Excellency Bishop Lajeunesse, on the activities of the St-Joseph Club and the St-Joseph Co-Operative Society of the above school.\n\nYou will notice that the school is offering to place their sawmill at the disposal of the former pupils to help them in building their homes. It is also offering to give up, in favour of these boys, the summer transportation on the Wiskey Jack Portage, all this to help them in establishing themselves.\n\nTo further help the activities of the club, a shop and implements are asked for. Moreover, the services of a member of the Order, with a great deal of experience in Indian work, are offered for this project.\n\nMay we expect the Department to look carefully into this whole project and cooperate with the church authorities and management of the school, in providing a living for these far-away Indians.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.O.

P. PHILAN.\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan:\n\nMay I call your attention to my letter dated May 3rd, 1946, re above matter.

Phelan.\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI have had on my desk for several months past a letter from Reverend Father Trudeau, principal of the Cross Lake Indian Residential School, in which he insists on the Department supplying six sewing machines for ex girl pupils of the Cross Lake School.\n\nHis reason for making this request is that these girls are now married, have growing families, are good seamstresses and well able to take care of a machine.\n\nIf you wish to be supplied with the name of each individual girl, Father Trudeau will very willingly do so. Personally I believe that if these machines were sent to him, he could give them to the most deserving pupils and forward to the Department a receipt from each one of them acknowledging the gift.\n\nPlease let me know what may be expected in this matter.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ.O. Flourde, O.M.I.\nOttawa, December 27, 1946.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 19th instant, requesting sewing machines for ex-pupils of the Cross Lake School, on the occasion of your next visit to the Department I would like to discuss this matter with you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

Henry,\n\nRe: Purchase Order No. 19976,\nMay 27, 1947.\n\nThis will acknowledge your letter of December 10th, reference 34-123 (WT-1). In reply we wish to state that when the rototiller was dispatched to Father Trudeau at Cross Lake on June 5th last, through a misunderstanding, the statement of account was sent to the Purchasing Agent, Department of Mines and Natural Resources, marked for the attention of Mr. Vincent.\n\nWhat we fail to understand is the length of time that has elapsed since the statement was first sent out to Mr. Vincent, until we received your letter of December 10th. We presume that Mr. Vincent forwarded the statement to Father Trudeau for his certification, and owing to the fact that all the attachments ordered by your Department for the rototiller have not gone forward, Father Trudeau is holding the statement until he has received these attachments.\n\nThe order is still short the planter and seeder; also the furrower attachments. We received a shipment of planters last week and can supply Father Trudeau with one now, but we are still waiting for the furrower attachments to come in. Now that the Winter season has set in there is no apparent hurry to ship the planter to Cross Lake. Therefore, we may as well hold it until the furrower attachment is available, which we expect shortly.\n\nIn the meantime, we are sending Father Trudeau, in quadruplicate, copies of the statement in question, for his certification.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE.

Neary,\n\nRe: Rototiller 52502, Shipped to\nRev. Father Trudeau, Cross Lake,\nManitoba, June 5, 1947.\n\nWith further reference to correspondence herein, we are in receipt of a letter from Rev. Father Trudeau, Cross Lake, which reads, in part, as follows:\n\n\"I am just in receipt of yours of December the 15th, Re: Rototiller that was shipped to us last June. When I received it I also received the Invoices and a letter from the Dept. of Mines and Natural Resources asking me to receipt the Invoices only when I will have received all the attachments. By the first mail of the Winter I received another letter of the Dept. asking me to receipt the Invoices, so I did it and sent them to Ottawa in the first week of December. So I hope you have been paid off now. As you see, the delay was not due to Agency from my part but I was just following the instructions I had received from the Dept. of Mines & Resources.\n\nAs you have now in stock the planter and seeder would you please send it to C.M.R. Station, Wabowden, Man., where I could get it during the winter as it is our nearest railway station. I would also like to get the furrower.\"\n\nIn accordance with Father Trudeau's instructions, we despatched to him on January 7th, the planter and seeder attachment, but not the furrower, as we have none in stock at present. As already advised, as soon as a shipment comes in we will despatch one to him at once.\n\nFRAZER TRACTORS  ROTOTILLERS  FARM EQUIPMENT\nEnclosed, in quadruplicate, is our Invoice No. 1306, amounting to $3.20, covering freight on the planter and seeder, together with our statement in the amount of $508.36. In view of the fact that this account has now been outstanding for over six months, we would appreciate receiving your cheque at an early date, for the amount thereon.\n\nRather than withhold payment any longer, for the present, if you consider it necessary to deduct the amount charged for the furrower, this will be quite satisfactory to us. This attachment can be sent forward to Father Trudeau at a later date, when we have it in stock.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Mrs.) E. M.

He has requested us to forward this Invoice to your Department for payment.\n\nWhen we received your cheque for the Rototiller, the amount of $51.30 was deducted for the Planter and Seeder, and as this attachment has now gone forward and been received by Father Trudeau, we would appreciate you including this amount with your remittance for the Rototiller replacement parts sent to Father Trudeau.\n\nWe are also enclosing receipted Freight Bill for $3.20 which Father Trudeau paid to the Canadian National Railways for freight on above shipment.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Mrs.) E. M. Millilage\nSecretary-Treasurer.\n\nM/w.,\nencls.\n\nFRAZER TRACTORS :: ROTOTILLERS :: FARM EQUIPMENT\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**TREASURY ONLY**\n\n**Form No. I.A. 506A**\n\n**R. 292**\n\n**34-123**\n\n**Pay to:** Rev.

Later a credit memo for $3.20 had been issued by you. We are, therefore, deducting the sum of $3.20 from this invoice and will reimburse Reverend Father Trudeau in that respect, and you should be getting the cheque for $11.40 shortly.\n\nIn reference to the Planter and Seeder being forwarded to Reverend Father Trudeau, I have not heard from him about receiving it, but as soon as word is received, necessary arrangements will be made to pay the account.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nM. Einarsson Motors Limited,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nBFN/HH.\nFebruary 19, 1948.\n\nDear Father Trudeau:\n\nWe understand from Kinarsson Motors Limited, that they have now forwarded to you the planter and seeder attachment about which I wrote you on February 13th. If this has been received, please certify the account and return immediately so that payment can be made.\n\nWe are also advised by the company that you ordered from them one 20\" hood and one 20\" holder, at a net cost of $44.60.\n\nI regret that you ordered this additional equipment without receiving our authority. I think you will realize that it is impossible for us to control our appropriation if principals incur expenditures which they expect the Department to pay, without first obtaining authority to do so.\n\nWe understand that you have paid $3.20 for freight and we are deducting this amount from the Kinarsson Motors Limited account and forwarding it to you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

I found on my desk your letters of February the 5th & the 13th and also the one of Mr. Phelan re equipment from Einarson Motors Ltd. I have already signed the invoices in January and send them back to Einarson Motors noting that the furrower attachments had not been received yet. The rest of the additional equipment has been received in good condition. I am enclosing a letter just received from Einarson showing that the furrower might not be sent before summer.\n\nI regret very much that this deal has cost you so much trouble but the Einarson Motors seem to have been the cause as they took so much time to deliver the additional equipment.\n\nI am also enclosing a copy of my letter to Einarsson so you will know I have paid for the Hood 20\" and the holder I had ordered in December. In order to make a good use of the rototiller in the gardens we had to have the narrow hood as the one sent with the machine was too wide for the different works in the garden.\n\nIf I receive the furrower before the end of March I shall notify you as soon as received.\n\nThanking you once again, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nG.E.

Father Trudeau at Cross Lake Indian Mission.\n\nThe reason there may be some confusion in your mind about this account is that on January 6, 1948, Father Trudeau ordered Rototiller parts and accessories in the amount of $44.60, and requested us to bill your department for same. On January 12, we received your cheque for $25.00, leaving balance due of $109.40. Your reason for not settling the full amount of $258.96 was because you had not shipped the planter and furrower to Father Trudeau along with the Rototiller and some other attachments, as per your letter of February 19, in which you stated you would not pay for these items until they were received at Cross Lake. However, on March we received payment of the parts account from Father Trudeau, which amount we credited to your account in the sum of $44.60, leaving the balance due us of $64.80. On February 26, we received a further payment from you of $41.40, leaving the balance due us of $23.40.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Mrs.) E.M.

It is absolutely necessary that this sum be paid again. I am unable to do the janitor work, as I have too many other duties to perform. I must preach, teach school, dispense medicines, keep vital statistics records, visit the sick, dispense relief rations and do the necessary buying and chores. My wife performs the schoolwork.\n\nThe Indians refuse to do any work unless they get cash.\n\nIn the agreement that I signed with the Department I was hired to teach school. Janitor work was not mentioned. Janitor work is not my duty. I have been forced to do it since school started and I expect to get paid for it. In the future the work must be done by someone else. I have written to Mr. McPherson, Selkirk, Man., but have received no reply.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nEdward Shankle, D.A.\nOttawa,\nDecember 8, 1942.\n\nMemorandum for file:\n\nWith reference to letter of November 19, see letter of December 8, on file 125-14-1, in which we agreed to allow $3.00 a teaching month for janitor services.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nPay to: Rev.

Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI wish to advise that the caretaking of the schools, Fairford Reserve, is being done by Francis Hall No. 145 Fairford land. The cost previously allowed by the Department was $20.00 per month. Hall is asking that $25.00 be allowed for this work. The work consists of lighting the fires in the morning at both schools, which are 1\u00bd miles apart, sweeping the floors after school hours, scrubbing the floors every two weeks, setting in sufficient wood and water for the day. The work takes up the greater part of the day and leaves the caretaker little time for other work of a remunerative character. Hall is doing satisfactory work, is not particularly well, and is the only Indian on the reserve who will do this work. The other Indians can make more money at other work and will not consider the caretaking job under the present prosperous conditions. Hall requests an additional $5 for the months of September and October and $25 per month for November and future months.\n\nThe allowance is no doubt very small under present conditions and I would recommend that the Indian be allowed his requests. I am certain that no other Indian on the reserve would do the work for the amount Hall is asking.\n\nWill you please advise in this matter as soon as possible as it is Hall's intention to quit if his wage is not raised.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nNovember 27, 1943.\n\nMr. J. Waite, Indian Agent, Portage la Prairie, Man.\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of the 24th instant, the Department will allow a total of $25.00 a month to Francois Hall for the janitor work at the two Fairford schools.\n\nR.A.
