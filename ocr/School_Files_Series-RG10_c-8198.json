Nathan Dwyer he told me that the coke-oil system of heating was most unsatisfactory in schools. He had tried it out last year. He strongly advised hard coal as being cheaper and more convenient than wood.\n\nThe coal stoves would cost about twenty-four dollars each and one for the living room would cost about twelve dollars. The kitchen stove is made to burn wood or coal. He estimated about two or at most three tons of hard coal would be sufficient for the year. This would eliminate all the splitting, piling, cutting etc., that goes along with the wood system. I do hope you will give it every consideration. I have not spoken the agent yet. He gave me a telephone call.\nYesterday but I was away and I believe he is out of town now. I would be obliged if you could send me some forms for the monthly report re. absences and some forms for application to enter Spanish School.\n\nThe scout movement has certainly been successful. The boys are intensely interested. They have their scout kit and softball diamond and teams chosen. Today the Blessed Sacrament Sacred Heart Parish came to visit us and they just announced that the score was 17-18 in favour of the South, but the King's Scout told me our boys were good players. They seem to favour softball. Later they had a boxing match in Miss MacNeil's class-room. Fortunately for them they are in the South, but I feel they have everything cleaned in scout fashion.\n\nIf you see Mr. Smith I could speak of this matter but I trust we may be able to procure the coal.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Marie, Ontario.\n\nSince writing to you on the 6th instant, with reference to the possibility of using oil heating in the Garden River R.C. School, it occurred to me that it might be preferable to use coal. Coal stoves would be cheaper and the cost of operation would probably be about the same as the oil. You might also obtain quotations on the coal stoves that would be needed and let me have an estimate of the number of tons of coal that would be required.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n| Date | DESCRIPTION                                      | No. | Material | Labor | Total   |\n|------|-------------------------------------------------|-----|----------|-------|---------|\n| Apr. 1 | Re - Catholic School, Garden River.             |     |          |       |         |\n|      | 1 star glass 6 x 20                             |     |          |       | 1.5     |\n|      | 2 lox on mantles and postage                     |     |          |       | 1.05    |\n|      | 8 doz. screws 1 x 8                              |     |          |       | 40      |\n|      | 4 doz. screws brass 1 x 6                        |     |          |       | 32      |\n|      | 2 oz. screws brass 1 x 7                         |     |          |       | 16      |\n|      | \u00bd doz. stove bolts 3/16 x 1                      |     |          |       | 12      |\n|      | 6 rolls paper towels                             |     |          |       | 1.05    |\n|      | sandpaper                                       |     |          |       | 30      |\n|      | 1 mirror                                        |     |          |       | .95     |\n|      | \u00bd pt. varnish stain                              |     |          |       | 60      |\n|      | \u00bd pt. ground                                     |     |          |       | 45      |\n|      | 1 lb. 3\" nails                                  |     |          |       | .08     |\n|      | 2 mop cloths                                     |     |          |       | 80      |\n|      | 2 sash fast                                      |     |          |       | 30      |\n|      | 1 star glass 6 7/8 x 9 5/8 points                |     |          |       | .10     |\n|      | 94 ft. rubber weatherstripping and tacks        |     |          |       | 2.55    |\n|      | 25 rolls paper towels                            |     |          |       | 4.20    |\n|      | 1 furnace cement                                 |     |          |       | .45     |\n|      | 1 right hand stove lining for Crusader           |     |          |       | 2.25    |\n\n$ 16.33\n\nPLEASE NOTE: THIS ACCOUNT IS NOW DUE\n| DATE   | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| April  | To Miscellaneous items supplied the Garden River                        |        |\n|        | R.C.

I presume that you do not wish to begin the repairs until the summer holidays, but in any case we would like more complete information regarding the following:\n\nItem 1: Re-shingling school - Please state the name and address of the person from whom you obtained the quotation, and if you can obtain more than one tender we would appreciate your doing so, and forwarding same for our consideration.\n\nItem 6: Hardware floors for school rooms and living quarters - Similar information should be given regarding this item as requested above.\n\nIt will not be possible to consider Item 5 during the fiscal year 1949-50.\n\nBernard F.

The suggested improvements were approved, with the exception of some form of central heating.\n\nWe use five stoves\u2014one in each classroom and three in the teacherage. Two bedrooms and the bathroom have no heat. Last fall we had a grate put in the hallways outside these rooms to permit heat from the kitchen to reach them and although it was not too uncomfortable due to mild winter weather, it is not conducive to good health.\n\nThe classrooms are not fully heated by the stoves which we light ourselves in the morning as no person is available for such work in the winter time.\n\nI am aware of the difficulty of planning for a furnace since the building is on swampy ground, but perhaps someone can devise a more efficient and less laborious heating system.\n\nSister Alice Marie\n\nIndian Affairs.

On reconsidering the contents of your letter of April 8th, we would like to have an estimate of the cost of placing a furnace in this school. This matter was mentioned under item 5 of your letter.\n\nMr. Hargreaves is extremely busy at the present time and expects to make a trip to British Columbia in the very near future. Under these circumstances, his services will not be available for several weeks.

School in the past, and they can still do so, provided they are supplied with transportation.\n\nI have taken the matter of transportation up with Mr. F.J. Redmond, manager of the Algoma Steel Corporation Bus System, and am enclosing for your information correspondence regarding same.\n\nYou will note that Mr. Redmond states that they could extend the present bus service to Garden River, provided there will be at least ten passengers to be picked up. That would be a minimum charge of $2.00 per school day. Although there are only eight children at present, this number is sure to increase in the near future, as more members of the Batchewana Band move off the Garden River Reserve to the Rankin Location, and the present pre-school children on the Location reach school age.\n\nWe have a two room school (R.C.) at the Garden River Reserve, and by transporting these children back to the school they previously attended, would keep the attendance of this Indian day school up. Kindly advise me regarding this matter at your earliest convenience.\n\nR.P.G. Laurence\nSupt. Indian Agency\nSault Ste. Marie Ontario\nAugust 1, 1949.\n\nMr. F. J.

School at Garden River this fall.\n\nI understand you have a school bus that runs as far as Bell's Point each school day transporting white children to the City schools and returning them in the evening. Could an arrangement be made to have this bus continue along Highway 17 to the R.C. School on the Garden River Reserve picking up Indian children on its way east and taking them to this school? On its return trip in the evening with the white children, it could again continue as far as the Garden River School and bring the Indian children back to the Rankin Location.\n\nThere would be at this time about 10 children to pick up at the Rankin, but I expect this number will increase in the near future.\n\nWould you kindly advise me, at your earliest convenience, how much you would charge for this service, as I wish to take this matter up with the Indian Affairs Branch at Ottawa and have some arrangement made before the opening of the coming school term.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

This building was originally given for this purpose by the Church, and Mr. McNabb urges the erection of a residence to accommodate the two lady teachers that we have employed at this point, as soon as possible.\n\nR.F.T.\nGarden River July 2nd, 1923\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI hope that this summer and during vacation if possible, that the house for the use of the teachers here, will be removed farther away from the church, and repaired, as it needs it badly.\n\nIn the mean time allow me Sir, to ask you to see that\u2014\n\na new fence near the school, be put up, some forty yards in length.\n\nThe Indians are constantly destroying the old fence, please to have the new one built strong.\n\nI have no doubt that the Indian Department will agree with us in this matter.\n\nYours very truly, S. Dufresne\n\nS. L.\nSir,\n\nI beg to inclose letter received from the Rev S Dufres in reference to the House occupied by the Teachers at the Garden River R, C, School.\n\nIn this matter I would say that we need a new House. It will cost more to move and repair the old one than it would to build a new one. The walls are rotten and the Foundation is gone. The Roof is bad and would have to have new sheeting, new shingles and very likely new Rafters; it is a total wreck. About the fence I suppose the children did tear some of it down; it was only a poor make shift in the first place.\n\nAwaiting your further instructions in this matter.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.

S. Dufrane with reference to the house occupied as a teachers' residence in connection with the Garden River R.C. Indian Day School. In reply I beg to say it is noted that you would not recommend any repairs to this building, as its present condition is such that it would not warrant the cost of having it repaired.\n\nRegarding the erection of a new residence for the teachers' use, I beg to say that the funds at our disposal are limited, and it will hardly be possible to provide the amount required from the present year's appropriation. Mr. Ferrier, Superintendent of Indian Education, will be at Sault Ste. Marie on the 14th of August next, and the following day will visit Garden River, and enquire into the question of putting up a new building. It is hoped that it may be possible, if a few minor repairs are made, to place the old building in a satisfactory condition for the teachers' use for next year. Mr. Ferrier will enquire as to this when he is at Garden River.\n\nWith reference to the fencing, you should state, as soon as possible, the quantity of material required to build a new fence, and the probable cost of the same, also the cost of the labour. As soon as we have this information we will be in a position to decide as to whether we can approve of a new fence being erected or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

I interviewed both councils and they agree to give as follows.

C. Indian Day School. I wish to confirm official telegram of the 29th ultimo, which was directed to you in reply, as follows:\n\n\"Reference your letter 27th relative erection teacher's residence Garden River Roman Catholic School. Please secure resolutions from Batchewana and Garden River Bands for $1500 and $500 respectively and submit to Department without delay. An Order in Council will be requested and you will be authorized to build as soon as possible.\"\n\nIt is necessary that an Order in Council be passed before we can use a band's capital funds for the purpose of erecting a school or teacher's residence. As soon as the resolutions referred to in official telegram are at hand, we will endeavour to secure the authority of His Excellency in Council, and you will be advised forthwith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Keller\n\nMark\nSir,\n\nI beg to send you resolution passed by the Council of the Garden River Band, authorising that $500.00 be taken out of the Capital Funds of their Band towards erecting a House for the Teachers at the R.C. School on the Reserve.\n\nI have endeavored to get a like resolution from the Batchewana Band but so far on account of petty jealousy I have not been able to get it. The Chief and one Councilor on the reserve is agreeable, the other 2 councilmen are living at Coulais Bay; they both sent me word that they are willing, but there is one Councilman here Wm A. Boyer who will not sign, he has no children of School age and there is a click of Sayers who side in with him, Tom Sayers run for Chief and was defeated and ever since he has been opposed to everything that we tried to do, he has a certain following that will do as he says.\n\nIf there is any legal way that the $1500.00 could be taken out of their Interest money and let them go for a couple of pays without Interest I think it would be a great lesson to them, they want something that will hurt their pockets to bring them to time. DO THIS IF YOU POSSIBLY CAN.\n\nI met the Separate School Inspector down there on Monday last and he is of the same opinion as Mr Ferrier & myself that a new house is badly needed and needed right away.\n\nI am satisfied that the majority of the Batchewana Band is in favor of granting the $1500.00.\n\nI told them that if they did not get any Interest money for a year or so they might blame the Councilman Boyer and his Click.

Indian Day School. I instructed Mr. Agent McNabb to secure resolutions from the Batchawana and Garden River Bands, authorizing us to expend $1500 and $500, respectively, from their capital funds, for the purpose of providing the moneys to erect a four-roomed cottage for the use of the teachers. The resolution from the Garden River Band is hereunder, but there is a small clique at the Batchawana Band, who obstruct the expenditure of $1500 from their capital funds in this connection.

C. Indian Day School, I have to inform you that the Department has now received the authority of His Excellency in Council to take $1500 and $500 from the Garden River and Batchawana Capital Accounts, respectively. Mr. Separate School Inspector Bennett has strongly advised that the new building be a combined school and residence and on a new site, a mile north of the present school. Mr. Bennett states that a new location, near the C. P. R. station on the main road, would result in materially increasing the attendance.\n\nWill you please recommend, first, whether or not the Department should take action along the lines suggested by Mr. Bennett, and, second, if an effort should be made to erect the building immediately. Your immediate attention and a recommendation by telegram is requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nA. D. McNabb, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie,\nOnt.\nOttawa, Oct. 27, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th ultimo, with reference to the urgent need of a teacher's residence for the Garden River Indian Day School.\n\nThe Superintendent of Indian Education visited the Garden River Reserve this summer, and he has intimated that provision for the teachers must be made at the earliest possible date. The effort to have the two Indian Bands interested vote, from their capital funds, some $2000 for this purpose was only partially successful; and the Department asked His Excellency in Council for authority to take the necessary moneys. The Order in Council has now been passed, and Mr. Indian Agent McNabb is being asked to recommend whether or not building activity should commence at once.\n\nYour recommendation that the new building include classrooms and be placed on a more central site is also being referred to our representative for his recommendation.\n\nIn answer to that portion of your letter referring to the report forms, it is the Department's wish that a separate statement be prepared for each classroom and teacher. Additional remuneration will, of course, be allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. M. Bennett, Esq., B.

I fully agree with Mr Bennett that the School would be much more central if it was moved to the Trunk Road near Eddy's Store.\n\nThere are over 60 pupils of School age and some of them have to walk about 2\u00bd miles to the present school on the other hand some of the pupils living near the present school would not have to walk more than a mile to the proposed site.\n\nWe must make some arrangement for the Teachers this winter as they cannot stay in their present quarters. If we could use the Lumber in the present building or if we could get the present building moved to the new site location it would be cheaper than building a new one.\n\nThere is a man named COUSINS who moves buildings with the people living in them and I think he could move this building without bothering the School work.\n\nThere is not a house in the vicinity of the present school that we can get for the Teachers, and it is impossible to fix up their present quarters to make them habitable.\n\nI will try and get you a price from Mr Cousins for moving the building to a location near Eddy's Store and wire you this evening if possible.\n\nThe Foundation of the present Building may require strengthening it will only take a few 6x6 Or 6x5 pieces to do that.\n\nAm wiring this morning, Am writing fully in re-\n\nR, C, School,\n\nAwaiting your further instructions.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nJ, D, Mc Lean Esq,\nAsst, Deputy & Secretary.\nDept, of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt,\n\nIndian Affairs.

He claims that there will only be 3 or 4 days lost in Teaching. If you decide to move the School I will have to make arrangements with the Bell Estate for a piece of Land for a School site and PIs ground.\n\nIf you decide to build the Teachers Quarters adjoining the School at the new site, I could get started building as soon as you send me a plan.\n\nAwaiting your further instructions.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nJ.

Please make recommendation.\"\n\nThe Department has given this matter serious consideration, and, before taking any action, it was decided to have your recommendation, relative to the advisability of establishing two schools. The present school building could be used for one classroom and teacher's residence for one teacher, and a new building could be erected, two miles north of the railroad, on a suitable site, and would provide classroom accommodation and residence facilities for one teacher. This would obviate the long walks on the part of the children, which are a serious handicap to the attendance in the winter.\n\nIf your recommendation has not been directed to the Department, upon receipt of this letter, please telegraph and intimate whether or not you can secure a contractor, who would erect the new building this fall on a day labour basis if we send you plans for his guidance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The cost of labour would be about ten dollars. This would include a partition of gyp rock, a...\na window and a door. The bedd\ning, room furniture, and smaller\ndetails I would be willing to\nsupply\u2014approximately $15.00.\n\nOther years the teacher boarded\nout so the housekeeper was from\nthe reserve and went home to\nsleep.

He asked me to suggest the names of several reputable construction men and send them on to you. I have talked with Sister St Andrew of the Sisters of St. Joseph and have the following names to submit to you.\n\nMr. Carl Fitzpatrick ....780 Wellington E. Sault Ste. Marie  \nMr. J.J. Fitzpatrick & Son 27 Towers S.S. Marie  \nMcLarty Bros. and Brodie .... ll Gouin S.S.

(Pastor, Catholic Church)\nOttawa, August 2nd, 1947.\n\nMr. R.P.G. Laurence, Indian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ontario.\n\nAs you have already been advised, it is our intention to engage two Sisters of St. Joseph to take charge of the Garden River R.C. School for the coming academic year.\n\nThe Sisters desire to have the living quarters enlarged and we are prepared to have this done. We have been informed that the following firms might be interested in building an addition:\n\nMr. Carl Fitzpatrick, 780 Wellington E., Sault Ste. Marie.\n\nMr. J.J. Fitzpatrick, & Son, 27 Towers,\n\nMcLarty Bros. & Brodie, 11 Gouin,\n\nWe would appreciate it if you would give the matter your immediate attention and let us know what can be done to enlarge the living quarters.\n\nIs there a hydro line passing the school and would it cost to install electricity?\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MOD\nMr. R.P.G. Laurence, Indian Agent, Sault Ste. Marie, Ont.,\n\nAs promised you last week, enclosed please find a sketch of the suggested changes to be made at the Garden River H.C., Indian Day School.\n\nThis addition should be well insulated and be excavated. The window in the foundation that would be covered by this addition should be knocked out and a door installed. In the floor, provision should be made for a sump pump. I would suggest that ducts for a central heating be put in the walls at the time of construction.\n\nThe division between the present kitchen and the new one could be left as is or could be changed into an archway. The Contractor will give you his opinion of this part of the work.\n\nThe windows on the south bedroom will have to be moved to the west and east wall.\n\nShould the Contractor suggest any other changes you will kindly advise us.\n\nThe Department intends to have the portion below the teacher's living-room excavated and have a central heating system installed. You might get an estimate of the cost of this improvement and notify us at your earliest convenience.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nEncl:\n\nAJD/HM.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI wish to acknowledge your letter of August 23rd, file 13-3-5 (W.T.4) enclosing a sketch of the suggested changes to be made at the Garden River R.C. Indian Day School.\n\nThe only change suggested which is not outlined in your letter is that the division between the present kitchen and the new one be carried 3 feet further south; this would make the new dining room 3 feet larger than at present, and allow for a small window on each side of the dining room to give the necessary fresh air.\n\nThis would make the new extension 15 x 15 instead of 12 x 15 as the size of the new kitchen would remain the same as per your sketch.\n\nTrusting this change meets with your approval.\n\nRPGI/MY\n\nR.

My Certificate is a first Class and highest obtainable in the Province of Quebec, and permanent, dated 1891.\n\nII. Attached to it are two statements from the Minister of Education for Ontario establishing its validity for Ontario, 1886-1896.\n\nIII.

D. McLean,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. Le Tonturier, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nSturgeon Falls, Ont.\nTo the Department of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI wish to bring to your notice that I am very much surprised that my salary has not been increased, while the price of living has raised enormously, and that teachers' salaries had a great raise throughout Ontario for the last two years. At that rate, a First Class qualified teacher with a large family of small children, has no better prospects in a school than one with an Inspector's Permit who is always single. And, moreover, that the former receives all the disadvantages inherent to one who doesn't board.\n\nPeople here think they can have a qualified teacher dismissed for a whistle so as to get a boarder; and, therefore, very damaging annoyances are cunningly heaped upon him and his school by all possible means within their reach, and with very little protection to the teacher. And it takes a very skilful and discreet teacher to prevent their exterior influence and insinuations from breaking the discipline of the school and to keep up with the programme of studies.\n\nThe Inspector's Permits are too highly paid, and the qualified Teacher too little. It is only reasonable that I should ask that my salary be put on the basis of a reasonable living, and that protection be fully accorded me and my school against the evil tactics of the Indians and those who have influence over them. Please consider.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\nTeacher.\n\nMarch 31st 1908.\nOttawa, April 4, 1908.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nMr. F. Le Tonturier, teacher of the Garden Indian Village school, is surprised that he has not received an increase in salary to meet the advanced prices of the necessaries of life.\n\nHe has been in charge of this school since January 1, 1905, at a salary of $300 a year. He holds a first-class certificate and is a married man, with a family of small children. Mr. Inspector Prendergast says that he is possessed of good scholarship and is an effective teacher, with long experience. Mr. Cockburn when here suggested the advisability of giving him an increase, if possible.\n\nHis salary is paid by the band and I think their funds could stand an advance of $50, and I would recommend that he be paid at the rate of $350 for the current fiscal year.\n\n[Signature]\n\nFunds available.

E. Carter, and have asked that a new teacher be engaged for the school. We have discussed these matters and decided to change our only teacher.\n\nThe teacher whom we had charge of the school two years ago, moved his family into a better residence elsewhere. Peter Whapmagoosing was next asked to fill the teacher's place, but he refused at the rate of $1.00 per month. We have advised the teacher to settle with Mr. Carter in some way, but the latter says he will not take the trouble of doing so.\n\nWe respectfully recommend that the amount be paid to Whapmagoosing either to the Board or the teacher, as all his demands shall remain and his brother's children continue here. Half of the balance have left the school, and it is urgent that they be returned to their homes.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJno. Abelinh [signature]\nClerk\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Senator School Inspector for Ontario in his last report on this school says that Mr. Le Tonturier is possessed of good scholarship and is an effective teacher with long experience.\n\nThe trouble, if any, would appear to be that he does not get along well with the Indians, who are capricious and hard to please, and he has been officially informed that he should endeavour to make himself more agreeable to them; and it would be well if you would advise the Indians to cultivate harmonious relations with the teacher.

I have been very agreeable to them as much as any honest man can be. This I can solemnly swear.\n\nLike that ability does not count with you. I didn't know that.\n\nThe work will be nullified whether the teacher is good or not.

Fonturier has First Class Teacher's Certificate and skill and thirty years experience of successful and faithful work as certified by all his school inspectors; and the Indian Agent Geo. P. Cockburn has the powers of two Justices of the Peace; and the Indians are extremely obedient to him.\n\nAnd Whereas, to the teacher's belief, the agent seems, as everything points, to have encouraged said Indians to carry false complaints to him to the detriment of the teacher, fixing up trumped up cases to dismiss him, and have it passed as being the Department of Indian Affairs' work. Thereby, fomenting school disturbance in the teacher's work and freedom of action by the large pupils over school age, which was never quashed right out when reported to Agent who nevertheless forced him to keep them. Those big pupils, at the instance of one Indian urging them, lavish disrespect and insults on said teacher and damages other ways.\n\nAnd Whereas, the school having nevertheless been well managed, they now put in all force of malice to throw into misery a large family of young children and the crowding the fathers. The ultimate object being to get board money from unwedded teacher and dismemberment of family.\nSaid Teacher has applied to the Department of Indian Affairs to have those abuses stopped or looked into, but he does not know what has been done. The Agent is as busy as before beating about the bush, which means new School disturbances on resuming work, or dismissal forthwith.\n\nTherefore, in the interest of country as well as of one who has devoted with great sacrifice all his life to raise and afford the souls of Canadian youths from the very moment he stepped into this land from Europe's shores, F. L. Fonturier respectfully beseeches the Dominion of Canada to have a stop put to such abuses to enable him to keep his position without being disturbed or molested by the Indians, to provide him with another with living salary in Western Canada beyond.

The request was made anew, and the new school was accepted. It was the intention of the former council to meet the needs of the band by adopting a new school system. However, the new school has not been approved by the band members, who prefer to continue with their current school.\n\nEnclosed herewith is a list of the members of the band who have signed the petition.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs Officer\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, October 23, 1908.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nMr. Agent Cockburn forwards a letter from Chief Goulais, of the Nipissing band, with the names of other Indians attached, asking for the removal of Mr. Le Tenturier, teacher of the Garden Indian Village school. The Indians state that unless they get a new teacher they will not send their children to school.\n\nSince last July some of the Indians have been dissatisfied with the teacher, complaining that he has made himself disagreeable to them as a resident on the reserve. The Department has never been able to find out in what way Mr. Le Tenturier has antagonized the Indians, but he was warned to try to get along with them as harmoniously as possible and he wrote assuring the Department that he would do all in his power to carry out its wishes. There is nothing on file to show that the Chief and Indians have been willing to meet him half way and they seem bent to get rid of him.\n\nThere is no doubt about his being a competent teacher, judging from the Inspector's reports and as he is\nis a married man with a very large family it would be a hardship to dismiss him summarily to meet the whims of the Indians. Mr. Le Tonturier's letters show that he is somewhat of a \"crank\", but there is some excuse for a man with a wife and twelve children who has to support them on $350.00 a year.\n\nIt might be well to give them a new teacher but the present one should have ample time given him to look out for other employment, and I would recommend that Mr. Agent Cockburn be instructed to advise the Indians that no change can be made until the end of the present school year and that if they take their children away from school they will be proceeded against under the regulations for the compulsory attendance of Indian children. He should also advise Mr. Le Tonturier that the Department has decided in the interests of all concerned to make a change of teacher in this school after June 30, next, but if he can better himself in the meantime he will be at liberty to do so upon giving reasonable notice.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

He has written the Department on the subject but has thrown no further light on the case. The Indians have apparently taken a personal dislike to the teacher. That is all that Mr. Cockburn has reported. He has tried to arrange matters amicably and has failed and as long as Mr. Le Tonturier remains in charge the difficulty is likely to continue. The only thing that I see that can be done is, as suggested in my memorandum of the 22nd ult., to let Mr. Le Tonturier go at the end of the school year, June 30, next. This would give him ample time to obtain another position.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I could furnish good testimonials if required, besides, I have had a little experience in dealing with Indian children, as last year I taught the Catholic Indian School, on the Goulais Bay Reserve, Ontario.

It is too bad that the Department cannot get a young active teacher for this school. The pupils are well disposed and would do well if they were placed under a good teacher who understood the work of the Indian schools.

Lamoureux, Thessalon, Ont., previously teacher at Garden Village School, Nipissing Reserve, would accept teaching in any school. She mentions the Sagamook School, Spanish River Res., in case that school would reopen. She has been a successful teacher at Garden Village. She had some trouble with a few Indians of the reserve, but it was a matter of board. I heard no complain against her teaching.\nOttawa, August 4, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from Rev. T. A. Desautels, Sudbury, in which he states that Mrs. Alex.

But the Chief is a very bad man; he said he wanted to get rid of me so he went to every house with a petition asking for a new teacher. I do not know how many signed it; he sent it to the Dept. He then came and ordered me out and forbid me to come back. I did not mind him because he has been acting that way all the year. But when I saw Mr. Cockburn I told him about this petition he said well...\nI might not have the school another year and if I was notified come back so I considered what he said and felt my position was very uncertain.\n\nPlease pardon me for writing directly to you but you understand I would like to be sure of a school for next year.\n\nI can manage Garden Village School because I win the children by kindness but if you open Sagamook School please give it to me.\n\nI am\nRespectfully yours\nMrs. Alex Fadouce\n\nadd Thessalon Ont.\nOttawa, Aug. 17, 1917.\n\nMadam,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 10th instant I beg to say that the Department has decided to allow you the position as teacher at the Garden Village School for the coming year.

He considers that a two roomed frame bungalow, painted would be suitable. Mr. Cockburn states that there is room on the school lot for such a building and that there are Indians on the reserve who could put up a suitable house, which should not cost more than $500.00.\n\nA frame building, 12' by 16' to be divided by a wooden partition into a bedroom 7' by 12' and a living room 9' by 12' would give ample accommodation. Mr. Cockburn informed me that the furniture in the teacher's residence at the Nipissing School, which has been closed for some time would be available.\n\nThe Nipissing Band have $117,248.93 to the credit of their capital account and could easily stand the expenditure.\n\nIf you approved of Mr. Cockburn's recommendation he is prepared to furnish an estimate of the necessary material.\n\nMartin Benson.\nOTTAWA, March 13, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to your verbal suggestions that Mrs. Ladoucer, teacher of the Garden Village School, be notified that her services will not be required after the 30th of June, next, as the Indians are dissatisfied with her and she is not a successful teacher, and that living quarters for the teacher be provided in connection with this school, I have to ask you to be good enough to inform Mrs. Ladoucer that her services will not be required after the date above mentioned.\n\nKindly furnish the Department with a detailed estimate of the cost of erecting a small frame bungalow for a teacher's residence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

There is an enrolment at this school of 35 pupils, with an average attendance of 20.\n\nHer salary is entirely paid from band funds (Nipissing Band), and I would recommend that, as this band has sufficient funds, she be granted an increase of $100.00 from the first of January, next.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Goulais' brother complained that Paul Goulais was remaining at the teacher's residence over night. I took the matter up with the teacher at the time and informed her as well as Goulais that his visits upon the School property cease; this advice was disregarded, and the gossip is yet going on. Miss Fitzpatrick has been very successful with the School and this appears to be the only complaint and which is largely centred amongst Goulais relatives; the Rev Father Percheron has informed me that if Miss Fitzpatrick continues as teacher of this School there might be trouble on the Reserve.\n\nI cannot think that there was any impropriety on the part of the teacher and only sorry that my advice to her was disregarded in regard to keeping Goulais from off the School property.\n\nWill you kindly advise.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa,\n\nIndian Affairs.

Bennett, Separate School Inspector, in a report to the Department on his recent inspection of the Garden Village Indian Day School, states that the school building at this point needs a coat of paint in the worst way and that the floor is full of ruts and needs attention. He states that a new floor is necessary.\n\nThe Inspector also states that every other desk is broken and the seats are in such a condition that any person would condemn them. He states that thirty-five single desks should be furnished as soon as possible.\n\nHe also states that there is no pump and no source of drinking water, except the lake, and it is a question whether such water is safe.\n\nI have to request that you will be good enough to furnish an estimate of the cost of painting the school building and laying a new floor. If funds can be provided, this work might be carried out during the next summer holidays.\n\nWith reference to the desks I have to request that you will furnish a list of the sizes required and the number of each size, or, if it is not possible to do this, you should give the ages of the children and the number of each age. Kindly give this information regarding the desks as soon as possible.\n\nYou should also look into the question of providing a pump for the use of the school and state whether, in your opinion, it would be possible to obtain water within a reasonable depth and the probable cost of boring a well.\n\nKindly give all the above matters your prompt attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeo.

I do not think this could be accomplished with success, as I have found that under about four feet of surface ground upon this lot there is a flat rock and it would require drilling below this depth to be free from the surface water which would entail considerable expense.\n\nWith regard to the thirty-six single desks I beg to say that the sizes required would be 12 large, 12 medium and 12 of small size.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa,\n\n[Handwritten note]\n\nIndian Affairs.

He states that the Beaucage building will not likely be required again for school purposes, and, as new seats are required at Garden Village, it is considered advisable to utilize the seats at the Beaucage School, which are new and in good condition.\n\nHe was also authorized to have the closets at the Garden Village School, which were put out of condition by the frost, placed in good repair.\n\nHe states that he had an Indian dig a drain to run the water out of the cellar of the teacher's residence. This was also approved.\n\nHe will obtain tenders for the work of having a new floor placed in the Garden Village School building and will forward them for the consideration of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Bennett, in his report on the Garden Village School, February 6, 1930, states that the school building is badly in need of paint, also that the floor is full of ruts and a new floor is necessary.\n\nWith reference to the above repairs, Indian Agent Cockburn was requested to obtain prices and submit the same to the Department. He has sent in three prices for the painting of the school and the laying of a hardwood floor in the class-room and porch. The lowest price obtained is that of J.K. McConnell for $875.00. This is a fair and reasonable price for the work contemplated, and I would recommend that this work be carried out during the coming summer holidays.\nMemorandum:\n\nHonourable Mr. Meighen,\n\nEarly in the year Mr. J.M. Bennett, Separate School Inspector, visited the Garden Village Indian day school, which is located in the Nipissing reserve, Ont., for the purpose of making an inspection, and in his report he states that the school is badly in need of being painted, and a new floor should be laid.\n\nWe instructed the Indian Agent to obtain prices from different firms and submit them to the Department. He has done so, and the lowest tender is $875.00.\n\nThis appears to be a fair and reasonable price for the work contemplated, and as it is desirable that the school should be painted and the repairs made during the summer holidays, I would recommend that the order be given.

A well should be dug.\n\nV. U. Quarry,\nInsp.\nOTTAWA, December 12th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Separate School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Garden Village Indian Day School, states that in order to secure water in the winter the pupils have to go out on the lake for over a mile and that, at times, this is very dangerous. He recommends that a well be dug in order that a supply of water can be obtained near the school.\n\nI will be pleased if you will furnish a report regarding this matter, stating whether you would advise that a well be dug at this school, and, if so, the approximate cost involved in having the work done.\n\nI will be pleased to have a report from you regarding this matter at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nGeo. P. Cockburn, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSturgeon Falls, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter No - 43-3-5 of the 12th instant with reference to The Separate School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Garden Village Indian Day School, states that in order to secure water in the winter the pupils have to go out on the lake for over a mile.\n\nIn connection I beg to report that owing to the situation it is doubtful whether a well can be secured at this place at a reasonable cost owing to a bed of flat rock which appears about four feet from the surface and which was contended with when excavating the cellar for the teacher's residence, some of the Indians have tried digging wells but without success, in some cases it was owing to swamp water. I would recommend that a test for a well be made early next spring after the frost disappears, this can be done at a small expense, and if a place can be located free from rock the cost of well would not be expensive, the approximate cost involved would be about $50.00.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Agent\n\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa,\n\nIndian Affairs.

From examination I am under the opinion that the fire started at the base of the air ventilation upon the floor of the class room from soot and sparks blowing down same from heavy winds. A portion of the floor and petition had to be chopped out in order to extinguish the fire. It will not be necessary to close the school to make the necessary repairs which will not be expensive.\n\nI will have the air ventilator closed up with cement immediately and the repairs done to the building by one of the Indians who is competent.

When the work of the repairs has been completed, you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred. If considered necessary, you should have the present chimney thoroughly cleaned and built higher. No undue expenditure should be incurred for any repairs that it may be necessary to make.\n\nI have to thank you for the prompt action taken in attending to the repairs, as well as the Indian who, by his promptness, was able to extinguish the fire.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

It is too late, however, for this work to be done this fall but provision should be made for having it done in the spring. Indian labor can be used. The shingles on the school roof are in bad condition especially on the north side.\n\nNew pipes were urgently needed for the school stove and I instructed the agent to attend to that immediately.\n\nThe teacher's residence is very much in need of a heating stove. All that the teacher has at present is a small cook stove with a very small fire box and drafts which cannot be closed tightly. The result is that it is impossible to keep a fire in for even an hour at a time without putting in more fuel. If a small Quebec heater were supplied it could be set beside the cook stove and the same flue used by joining the pipes with a T joint. I consider this very necessary and would be pleased if you could authorize the agent to have one purchased.\n\nThe floor of the teacher's residence requires painting and if the paint is supplied I think the teacher will do the work.\n\nThere are a number of boys at this school who would like very much to have a football and I promised to mention it to the Department.\nOttawa, September 27, 1924.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nPlease deliver to Room 503, Booth Building, one football complete for the use of the Garden Village Indian Day School.\n\nThis football should be of the same type and at the price usually charged.\n\nYour account, in duplicate, should be forwarded for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nKetchum and Company, Ltd.,\nSparks Street,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, September 27, 1924.\n\nMr. Inspector Parker, who recently visited the Sturgeon Falls Agency, has brought to the attention of the Department certain requirements at the Garden Village Indian Day School. New pipes are urgently needed for the stove in the classroom. The teacher's residence is very much in need of a heating stove and the floor of the teacher's residence requires painting.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase and installation of the new pipes required for the school. You may also purchase a small Quebec heater for the teacher's residence. Mr. Parker states that this heater could be placed beside the cook stove and the same flue used by joining the pipes with \"T\" joint. You may also purchase the paint required to paint the floor of the teacher's residence. We understand that if this paint is supplied, the teacher will perform the work of painting the floor. Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred in the above purchase.\n\nMr. Parker further states that he found the school building and teacher's residence to be very much in need of paint. As it is too late this fall to have this work done, you should draw the matter to the attention of the Department early next spring, at the same time stating definitely the amount of painting that should be done and the approximate cost of the material and labour required.\n\nThe shingles on the school roof, especially on the north side, are in a bad condition. If it is necessary that they be repaired this fall, you may arrange to have any work required carried out in order to prevent the roof from leaking. If the roof requires to be re-shingled, it might be best to leave this until next spring, when any shingling and the painting of the buildings will receive attention.\n\nPlease attend to the purchase of the pipes for the school stove and the heating stove and paint for the floor of the teacher's residence.\n\nWe are ordering a football and when received will be sent to the teacher.

It is a fair job but will need another coat next year in order to last. All openings on teacher's residence, windows, screens and storm windows for both school and house should also be painted but the men have all gone guiding for the summer.\n\nThe two outdoor toilets will need some minor repairs and be painted at first opportunity. They would also need to be emptied or removed farther.\n\nAll buildings, that is the school house, teacher's residence, garage and outhouses are covered with red asphalt shingles, which, in this vicinity, reduces the cost of fire insurance by 5%.\n\nJ.

At present we have but two applicants for the position; but as one of these has no certificate, and only taught a short time under a Permit from an Inspector, I do not think it necessary to report further particulars. The other applicant is Mr C.B. Oakley, a native of Newfoundland, and for some years a teacher on that Island, where he held a third class certificate with honors. As some years have passed since Mr Oakley taught in Newfoundland, I am not in possession of testimonials as to his ability as a teacher, and there is scarcely time to obtain them before making an appointment to Georgina Island. In regard to general character and ability, I have ample testimonials from several ministers, who speak of him in very high terms, and judging from what I have seen in one or two interviews, I have every confidence that he would make a useful and intelligent worker among the Indians. If considered advisable by the Department, we might at least give him a trial, so that the school may not be left vacant when Mr Hoddge removes.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary.\nOTTAWA, 23rd February, 1900\n\nRev.

There are two members of the same family on Georgina Island who are going the downward road. Their father does not seem to care, as he goes off camping and leaves them home alone. The best members of the Band would like to have them sent to some place where they would have to conduct themselves properly; if there is any such place in connection with Indian Affairs, the preacher and myself would like very much to have something done with them as their conduct will have a bad effect on others.\n\nI have the honor to remain your obedient servant,\n\nJohn Yates,\nAgent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Since the school became vacant we have been trying in every direction to find a suitable one and although we have corresponded with several, and had interviews in some cases, we have not yet found a man that we would confidently recommend. The circumstances at Georgina Island are somewhat peculiar; the place is isolated, and it is of the utmost importance that the teacher who is appointed should be a man who will be interested in the moral and spiritual welfare as well as the educational development of the people. To appoint a man of a different type would be disastrous. I am still in correspondence with one or two men, and will advise the Department further at the earliest possible date.\n\nI am, Sir,\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nA.

I also taught public school in the township of Ryde last year for thirteen weeks and can produce a letter of recommendation from the Secretary Treasurer Mr. Laverner of Lewisham.

But our teacher here has not reported since holidays at his school room.\n\nI went away again today for another two weeks on other business. He is helping a dairy here this summer & keeps cows so the young stock & has about 300 hogs running at large, destroying our crops & gardens. Is this what this man is claimed here for? Isn't he in places rented & kept borders here this summer (tourist) & last fall he was fishing with full nets, anything but his duty. Chief has notified the Methodist Society of how little value Mr. Rossier has for his position. But it seems they have no sympathy for our poor Indian children who are kept back in ignorance of learning. This man is not a qualified teacher.\n\nI have called to prove this statement.

It is stated that up to that date he had not reopened the school after the holidays and that he had again gone away for two weeks.\n\nIt is further stated that he allows his pigs, of which he has a large number, to run at large and destroy the crops and gardens and that he allows his farming operations to interfere with his school work.\n\nYou will be good enough to let the Department have a full report regarding these complaints at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJohn Yates, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVirginia, Ont.\nTo the Indian Department\n\nOttawa 31510\n\nIn view of the charges preferred against me by some of the Indians, I would say that concerning the opening of the school that I wanted to start, my two boys were home and I had not been away myself scarcely all summer but I had been informed that the if less than five pupils went on the Reserve I was not supposed to teach. This is a fact. I did not consider that I was under any obligation to open the school with the number present. I went to camp meeting, Christian Island where I met several teachers at least three, one of which had not opened his school since the holidays for the same reason as myself for the want of pupils.\n\nAs to the farming operations I have none except moving hay on the lot or Mission grounds and some elsewhere in the holidays.\n\nI have a number of small pigs that have not done any body any harm, the old ones were kept quite closely on the Mission grounds since the hay was cut previously they were well confined in a large run of pasture.\n\nPlease allow me to say that I have not lost School time over my stock we rise early and do our Chores and are not aiming to be an example.\nof kindness to the Indians. I have not thrown away the valuable school hours, as any person may say. Nor have I neglected Divine service either in the Sunday School or Church, my wife assisting me in the Sunday School. If it is deemed an error she not having opened the school with the number of pupils present, only two of which might have come, I believe, and one of them went to the doctor yesterday for examination. Regretting very much and in future I intend to keep school open at the number of pupils be ever so small. Please advise me in case my duties as Teacher and as Missionary conflict which should I attend to first? On the greater part of the Indians on the Reserve are perfectly satisfied. But I am aware a few are dissatisfied I claim without cause.\n\nI remain your obedient servant,\n\nJ. H. Procter\n\nP.S.

I heard very little complaints about the way the school was taught until the holidays. I was on the reserve all day on the 13th of August and heard some complaints about some small pigs and a breach owned by the teacher. Although I had got the matter settled, the teacher agreeing to sell or take care of the animals complained of. During the rest of August I seen the old chief and other Indians frequently and heard fresh complaints and supposed the school was reopened at the proper time, as the teacher told me he would do. On the second of September I went away from home for one week, when I came home I found the school had not been opened since the holidays and the teacher away at camp meeting at Christian Island. I find that at the time school should have been opened there was three children away and most of the time four that usually attend school on the reserve. The rest being on the main shore with their parents camping till about the time the teacher went to the camp meeting when they all came home. School was reopened on the 16th inst. With regard to the teachers pigs. When I spoke to him in August...\nHe did dispose of eight or ten but he has fourteen yet, that some of the Indians say did damage to the crops and gardens but Mr. Prosser denies the charge and says they done no damage to any body. As to farming operations the teacher has none except the mission grounds of two acres most of which is in meadow.\n\nI enclose a statement made by Mr. Prosser by his request also one signed by a number of the Indians. Chief Big Canoe is sending a long list of complaints to the head of the Methodist Church with reference to Mr. Prosser's conduct but declines to make any further statement at present to the Department except that he claims that Mr. Prosser should not be paid in full for this quarter as he can only teach school 13 days till the quarter expires.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJohn Gates,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary of\nthe Dept. of\nIndian Affairs.\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 33, 1907.\n\nSir\u2014\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th inst., regarding certain complaints made against the teacher of the Georgina Island school, together with an explanatory communication from the teacher himself a document signed by certain of the Indians of the band expressing their satisfaction with Mr. Prosser; and in reply I beg to say that, from your report, it would appear that Mr. Prosser is taking necessary precautions to prevent his stock from doing damage to the property of the Indians.\n\nHowever, with regard to his not reopening the school at the proper time, he should be informed that the Department expects him to attend to his duties as teacher first, and if it is necessary for him to attend to missionary work he should regulate his vacation so that it will not conflict with his official duty. The regulations of the Department call for 316 teaching days in the year, and if he wishes to draw his full salary, it will be necessary for him to have school open during that period.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.

Sir,\n\nFrom a report just received from the Public school Inspector for the county of York on his inspection of the Georgina Indian school it is evident that the present teacher, Mr. Presser, will never make a success of the school. He has no training as a teacher and does not know how to teach any subject as it should be taught. The Inspector found it a most difficult matter to tell anything about the classes or the attendance from the register, which was very badly kept. He says he was told that the school was very carelessly managed and that Mr. Presser does not give proper attention to it and he says that he has no doubt of the truth of this statement, as there were too many proofs of neglect to form any other conclusion. The teacher complained that the pupils do not attend regularly. The Inspector remarks that the wonder is that they attend at all. He found the pupils deficient in almost every subject, although they were intelligent and obedient and under better teaching and management would make clever and useful citizens.\n\nHe recommends that a regularly qualified teacher should\n\nRev.

He seemed very much reserved and demanded what certificate or qualification I held.

I invited, persuaded and almost compelled some to come that they might receive some benefit from the Inspector.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Duncan McPhee McQuade any best boy seemed able to answer all his questions. He asked me where this boy was working I told him to ask him any question he chose in simple numbers up to cube or square root. He placed 4 questions on the board. I believe Duncan did 50% correctly and showed evidence of knowing something of the others. The Inspector said \"I thought you were out on Duncan\" because he did not answer every question.\nThis was the first class he had yet had with Duncan. When other children being diffident would not answer I told him at once they knew that work had been over it. He found fault with the agent, maps, school material and teacher, refused to have a meal with me and hurried to the Chiefs. I failed to make any impression on him during the whole day that I was doing my duty. I challenged fault to be found with any house and style of teaching.\nI volunteered to row across the water in order to have a visit and be understood. He was biased against me; a threat was made one a few days before that if I came over to vote I would lose my position as teacher.\n\nThe Inspector in his conduct reminded me of the threat I would ask the Department to demand any explanation they choose but don't then go down without a hearing.\n\nVery Truly Yours,\n\nC.

For some months past I have been aware of the condition of affairs, and have been endeavoring to secure a teacher of a very different stamp from Mr. Prosser, but have not yet succeeded in finding one whom I could confidently recommend. I will continue the search with all possible diligence, and hope to succeed in the not distant future.\n\nI understand it to be the wish of the Superintendent General to improve the character of Indian Day Schools partly by improved buildings and plant, and partly by securing a better grade of teachers. I am heartily in sympathy with this policy, but venture to point out that it would be very difficult to secure thoroughly qualified teachers willing to take charge of an Indian School, unless they can be promised a better salary than is paid at present.

Please allow me to say that I have abundant education for the work in which I am now engaged. I received a thorough education in the public school before attending Newmarket High School after which I attended Port Perry High.\nschool and returned to Newmarket School it being more convenient to my own home. Some time after I attended McMaster Hall, Baptist College, Toronto after returning from this school I accepted a situation as teacher in S.S.

If you know what solid work is forthcoming I have a recommendation from the leading Trustee of a school I taught at near Lewisham. Until you have never been troubled with news from me nor faithfinding\nAs to my pupils here they have progressed well. I believe Duncan Ashquah would pass the entrance Ex this summer if he would attend regularly. Gladys Ash his sister could recite from memory Goldsmith's Desultory Village, Burns' How Gently Sweet Afton, Lochinvar by Scott and other pieces from The Fourth Reader. Agnes Ashquah with others who have come at all regularly have progressed favorably. I have no truant officer. They come as they like here, some sleep a delightful place when there is work at school.\nThe Inspector having been previously notified came on this Reserve to be my social and political enemy. He inquired if the Government Grant came from the Government treasury or the Indian fund. He would like to know if the Methodist Church would not increase my salary and make me independent of school teaching. He carried a very disrespectful lying report from the Indians' Chief to me. He meddled in everything that he could get his hands on. This was his first and only call the last school day before the Provincial...\nelection. Behold he's come again, this time bringing a little Tory school teacher with him from Virginia, one whose third class certificate is worn threadbare and who may need the Inspector's sympathy in the near future.\n\nThanking you for past favors and expecting your generous consideration during the coming month.\n\nRemain\n\nVery Respectfully,\n\nJ.

He said there had been some complaints in 1907 such as the teacher being absent attending some religious convention, but that he believed since then everything had been satisfactory. I also interviewed the Rev. Mr. Laidlaw, who is the Methodist Minister in charge of this circuit, and he was of the opinion that Mr. Prosser was a very conscientious man and attended to his duties as missionary to his entire satisfaction. He also stated that the Rev. Mr. Moore, who is District Superintendent, Church was also satisfied with Mr. Prosser's work.\n\nI then visited the Reserve and in conversation with a number of the members of the Band I found practically no complaints in reference to Mr. Prosser, then I discussed the\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of\n\nNo.\n\n(2)\n\nmatter with Chief Big Canoe who seemed determined to have Mr. Prosser dismissed. I asked him if it would not be wiser to allow him to finish this year and see if he would not give satisfaction during that time, but he insisted on a public investigation being held, which I held yesterday; I invited and had present practically the whole male membership of the Band, I invited them to state their grievances and there was no one in the Band with the exception of the Chief who would say they had any fault to find with the teacher. The Chief, however, was not satisfied and desired that I should take a vote of the members of the Band which I did; Big Chief Canoe moved and James Charles seconded -\n\nResolution: \"That we the members of this Band assembled do hereby place on record our dis-satisfaction with our present teacher.\" I then took a vote of the Band and twenty-five per cent. only supported the Chief's resolution, seventy-five per cent. voting that they were satisfied with their present teacher. I, therefore, take it that there is no general dis-satisfaction in the Band, and on the contrary according to the vote and all information I was able to obtain, I think that Mr. Prosser is giving as good a satisfaction as any teacher that possibly would reside for any considerable length of time on the Island. I do not desire to discuss School Inspector Mulloy's report, but I am of the opinion he might have tempered his judgement with mercy, as the course I generally pursue in matters of this kind, if there is a subordinate\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of\n\nNo.\n\nofficer who it is believed is not performing his duties to the entire satisfaction of the Department, is to point out to that officer wherein he is derelict in duty, and if there is a further complaint, I would have no hesitation in recommending his removal. This was the first time Mr. Mulloy had ever visited this Indian School, and perhaps the only Indian School he had ever visited, and I might say the former Inspector's report is entirely at variance with the more recent report of Mr. Mulloy.\n\nAfter the decision of the Band I informed them that the Chief was perfectly right in making complaint if the school was not properly conducted, but had advised them since the band had voted in favor of retaining the teacher, to offer him any assistance they could in maintaining a good attendance and to work in harmony together. I also told Mr. Prosser to conduct the school at all times so that his work would always bear scrutiny.\n\nIf the Department in its wisdom decides to continue the teacher in office, I think he will conduct himself in a satisfactory manner. I would suggest and think it only fair that he be retained in his present position, owing to the expression of opinion as presented herein by the Band and others.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

They tried it again Thursday Feb 18th but they were still behind. They have a social this evening. In the interval I kept school each day. Today\u2014Friday\u2014the Inspector visited our school. The place was in great disorder owing to nuts, candies, tobacco and other dirt on the school house floor. The candy stand was still standing in the school house. He asked a gentleman in button if the Pow wow would interfere with...\nthe Indian School he told he thought it would be done over and found us all in a mess. It had been understood the night before with the caretaker that he clean the school house on Friday consequently there would be no school. Whenupon the Inspector on the absence of children proposed to base his examination upon the Register so at it he went in a great fervor of criticism and I sat quite made up my mind that it would be impossible to please him so I declined.\nany further examination except when I had no children. He told the Indians present that neither the agent nor the Missionary had invited him to come here but the Chief had done so perhaps meaning his first visit. After some considerable controversy he drove away and I knew he proposed to send in a desperate report although he did not examine the school. I believe he intimated to me that he did not think he would ever come back to the school again. How fair play is what I seek for and expect from the Department especially after any visit with Mr. Borden who so well understood the enemies I had to contend with here.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nJ. H.

The Inspector takes exception to the manner in which he was received and the scant courtesy accorded him by Mr. Prosser.

The father Mr. Rosser paid $2.00 for same. John & Benjamin lost one sheep in April which afterward was found in David Rosser's possession when accused of the theft he owned up to it. The sheep was sold by the local trader.\n\nThe boys to be sent by the teacher, 15 years old.\n\nThe children of school age don't attend school except many times there is only one or two among them. The parents will not send their children because they do not learn anything when they do go. The school house is nearly all the time kept unlocked and the school property not properly taken care of.\n\nWe have always had good reports from our school from the Inspector until Mr. Rosser came. The teacher's two boys are in the teacher's room playing and using a lamp. To such an extent that the parents declare they will not send their children while the Rosser boys are going to school.\nThe Rosser boys, closest to the church, had set aside a park or picnic ground, and peeled the bark off 8 good sized elm trees all around about 5 feet up from the ground. Took the bark house to use in building a summerhouse. The trees are permanently destroyed. He also cut from the same park 15 cedar poles without asking for obtaining any liberty to do so.\n\nThe Rosser boys are in the habit of doing many things that are not authorized by the residents of the Island.\n\nCharles Big canoe Chief\n\nJohn Ford, Councilor\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your communication of the 19th instant, #152197, referring to the teacher of the Indian School at Georgina Island, and what is reported to be his lack of courtesy toward the Inspector when visiting that school. From correspondence which reached me shortly after the Inspector's visit, and from information that came through other sources, I have reason to think that some political feeling, as between the Inspector and Mr. Prosser, was at the bottom of the difficulty. At the same time that is no reason why the Inspector should not be treated courteously, and all necessary information given him respecting the school. I will therefore write to Mr. Prosser on the subject and trust there will be no cause of complaint in the future.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of\n\nwith regard to the complaints put in to the Department with reference to John Provenor Georgia Island I have to report that a settlement has been made between Mr. Provenor and the Band to the effect that Mr. Provenor is to stay and teach until the first of January next his Resignation is already signed to take effect January first 19010 and Chief Bigrowan requests me to ask the Department to take no action on the charges sent in against Mr. Provenor.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJohn Yates\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary of\nThe Dept. of Indian Affairs Ottawa\nOttawa, July 8, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ult., advising the Department that Mr. Presser, teacher of the Georgina Island Indian school, has resigned the position, the resignation to take effect on January 1, 1910.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Mr. Presser's resignation is accepted and it should be forwarded to the Department in writing.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.D.

Prosser, teacher of the Georgina Island school, which takes effect on January 1st, next, the Department would like to have him appointed to a similar position at some other school conducted under the auspices of your Church. Although Mr. Prosser's usefulness at Georgina is undoubtedly owing to the strained relations between him and certain members of the Band, there is reason to believe that in a new field his services would be productive of good results, and the Department considers his case worthy of consideration.\n\nAs you are aware the Saugeen Village school will be vacant at the close of the current quarter, and Mr. Prosser might be appointed to fill that vacancy. He has expressed his willingness to go to the Gibson reserve, and as an alternative to the above mentioned proposal Mrs. Yarwood might be transferred to Saugeen and Mr. Prosser to Gibson. This would not, in the opinion of the Department, be prejudicial to Mrs. Yarwood's interests.\n\nThe Department is confident you will appreciate the motive actuating it in endeavoring to make suitable provision for Mr. Prosser and that it will have your concurrence in carrying out either of propositions above mentioned; whichever may be deemed the more expedient.\n\nAs it is urgent that this matter be dealt with at\n\nRev. A. Sutherland, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMethodist Missionary Society,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6131, File 392-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nthe earliest possible date I should esteem it a favour to have a reply from you by return mail, in order that a decision may be arrived at and Mr. Prosser advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nOttawa, December 15th, 1909.\n\nRe. Georgina Island School.\n\nI was on the Island from the evening of the 9th to the morning of the 12th instant and arranged a truce between the teacher and the chief, the latter agreeing to Mr. Prosser's remaining until the first of April. This would give him an opportunity to secure another position and I suggested to him that he might try and arrange a transfer with Mr. Cork, who is at present teaching at Chemong. He would be well pleased if such an exchange could be arranged and I do not see that there should be any difficulty about it.\n\nMr. Cork, who is a superannuated Public School teacher, told me that his wife did not care to go to live at Chemong permanently, and as his family all live in Toronto he could easily get home from Sutton by the trolley car which makes the trip in less than three hours, whereas it is more than a day's journey from Chemong to his home.\n\nMr. Prosser is a personal friend of Chief Wetung, who is an easy man to get along with, while Chief Bekannew is the reverse. The difficulty between him and Mr. Prosser being that they are both local preachers and neither one wished to give way to the other. While Mr. Cork is a member of the Methodist Church he would raise no objection to Chief Bekannew holding services as frequently as he liked, which is his ambition and the chief cause of trouble between him and Mr. Prosser. I think if this exchange could be arranged it would be agreeable to all parties.\n\nI met Mr. Milley, the Inspector who sent in the adverse\nadverse report on Mr. Presser and from a conversation I had with him I concluded that it was more a question of offended dignity than a lack of teaching ability on Mr. Presser's part that led him to make the report he did. He admitted to me that Mr. Presser was competent to teach in an Indian school. While Mr. Prooser has his peculiarities he is a earnest, good man and well thought of in the community, and I am sure would do better at Shemong. It would be time enough to make an exchange after the holidays as it is impossible for him to leave the Island till the ice is formed, in fact I think the end of March would be the most suitable time for him to get off the Island.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

He has explained the situation and the Department considers that it would be in the interests of both schools that this transfer should be made and it would like you to take the necessary action to have it carried out as soon after the Christmas holidays as possible. Mr. Cork would be paid at the same rate as he receives at Chemong, and it would be much nearer to Toronto where his family reside.\n\nA temporary arrangement has been made with the Chief on Georgina Island who has agreed to refrain from interfering with Mr. Presser until his transfer takes place, and the appointment of Mr. Cork would be satisfactory to him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

Toronto, December 20, 1909.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 14th instant #52197/1 referring to the resignation of Mr. J.H.Prosser from the Georgina Island Indian School, and other matters in this connection. If there were any opening where Mr. Prosser's services could be utilized I would willingly give him every chance. One of the difficulties I see in connection with some of your suggestions is that neither at Saugesen nor Gibson is there a house which Mr. Prosser could occupy. However, I will ascertain as quickly as possible what arrangements are practicable and will write the Department again.\n\nI may add that in a letter from Chief Big Canoe, of Georgina Island, he mentions that arrangements were made by an agent of the Department to allow Mr. Prosser to remain at Georgina Island until the first of April. If this is the case, and the Department has agreed thereto, it would give time to adjust matters more satisfactorily.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nThe Methodist Church,\nMISSIONARY DEPARTMENT,\n\nDictated - Dr. S. Toronto, December 21, 1909.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nReferring to your letter of the 15th instant #152197 I beg to say that I do not know at present how Mr. Cork would regard the proposed transfer from Chemong to Georgina Island, and I would be sorry to lose the services of so experienced and competent a teacher. Nevertheless I will ascertain as soon as possible whether such an exchange will be practicable. I am also finding out the possibility of an exchange between Mr. Prosser and some other teacher in an Indian School that might possibly be satisfactory, and will write again when I receive some additional information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, December 29th, 1909.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st instant in reference to the proposed change of positions between Mr. Cork and Mr. Prosser.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that I would suggest that you should have a personal interview with Mr. Cork and see if this arrangement can be carried out before the end of the next school quarter. It is thought, for the reasons already stated, that Mr. Cork would raise no objection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. E. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. A. Sutherland, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMethodist Missionary Society,\nToronto, Ont.\nOn the following morning I again saw Mr. Yates and he told me that Mr. Prosser, teacher of the Georgina Island school, had been in town the day previous, and, after telephoning to his relatives and calling on the Methodist Missionary, I found him and, as he was anxious to get back to the Island, he volunteered to take me over. We walked down to Jackson's Point and, after a most exciting trip, arrived safely.\nsafely on the other side late that night. On Thursday morning I called on Chief Bigcanoe who had asked for the removal of Mr. Prosser from the school and made temporary arrangements about Mr. Prosser, both agreeing that he should give up the school by the 1st of April. This was satisfactory to both the Chief and the Teacher and was the best way out of the difficulty that I could see, as the Chief was insistent that Mr. Prosser should leave and was backed up by Dr. Sutherland and the Public School Inspector, and, in fact, Mr. Prosser had already sent in his resignation.\n\nI inspected the school and found 5 Indian boys present, no girls. There was a heavy snow storm, the first of the season, which may have accounted for the small attendance although they knew I was on the Island for the purpose of visiting the school and a better showing might have been expected. The children were backward and considering that Mr. Prosser has had charge of the school for four years better results should have been apparent. He has experienced opposition from the Chief, who wishes to be at the head of affairs on the Island, both spiritual and temporal, and as Mr. Prosser was not willing to recognize the Chief as his head or take directions from him trouble began, and the only solution of the difficulty will be the removal or transfer of Mr. Prosser to some other field. While Mr. Prosser has his peculiarities he is an earnest, good man and well thought of in the community, and, although teaching school is not his strong point or his proper vocation, he has sufficient education to conduct an Indian school if surroundings were more congenial.\nOttawa, February 21st, 1910.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn reference to previous correspondence regarding the position of teacher for the Georgina Island school I beg to say that the Department has been patiently awaiting a definite reply to its letter of the 15th December, last, in which it was suggested that Mr. Cork and Mr. Prosser should exchange schools.\n\nWhile Mr. Prosser has not been successful on Georgina Island owing to the opposition of Chief Big Canoe, it is thought he would do better at Chemong, where he would have the support of Chief Whetung. Chief Big Canoe is known to be anxious to have Mr. Cork placed in charge of the Georgina Island school and there is an excellent field for his abilities there.\n\nThe proposed change, if arranged, should be made before the ice breaks up, as it would be a difficult matter for Mr. Prosser to remove his household effects and stock later than the middle of March.\n\nThe Department would like to have an early and favourable reply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. A. Sutherland, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMethodist Missionary Society,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6131, File 392-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to your letter of February 21st, #152179/1 re a change of teachers between Chemong and Georgina Island, I beg to say that I wrote promptly to Mr. Cork bringing the matter to his attention, and advising the change that had been proposed. I did not receive his reply till within the last three days. Reading between the lines I infer that he would like to stay at Chemong, but as he puts it; \"If the great Methodist Church and the Dominion Government put their heads together there is no use of saying no.\" The only reason Mr. Cork has not answered more definitely is that he is waiting for a communication from members of his family. I quite recognize the importance of a speedy settlement of the question, and will press the matter to a decision as quickly as possible. I may say further that Mr. Cork has recently met with Chief Big Canoe of Georgina Island, and seems to have established quite friendly relations with him. This may help to solve the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. Butterland\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nOttawa, February 28th, 1910.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 24th instant regarding the proposed exchange of positions between Mr. Cork and Mr. Prosser I beg to say that the Department would be glad if you would arrange for Mr. Cork to proceed to Georgina Island by the 1st of April, next. The Department will pay the cost of his transport. It would like you to instruct Mr. Cork to this effect as soon as possible, and also to notify Mr. Prosser of the intended exchange, so that he may have time to remove his personal belongings before the ice breaks up.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. A.

Mr. Agent McFarlane, of Keene, has been instructed to have the parsonage put in repair so that it may be fit for occupation by yourself and family. You will have the use of the house free of charge.\n\nThe Department trusts that you will devote your time and energies to the school and cultivate harmonious relations with the Chief and Indians of the band, as the success of the school depends on the good feeling existing between the teacher and the Indians.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nJohn H.

We are joined to do all that we can to make the work at Chemong a success.\nWe would be very much pleased to be visited by as many members of the Department as could make it convenient to do so. Many thanks for the kind attention concerning the Mission house. Some time ago it was occupied by an Indian.

McLean Esq.,\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of Dec. 31, 1910, I may say that as the pupils of this school are such active players of games I thought a systematic calisthenic drill to be quite superfluous. In the summer the boys play base ball, wrestle and have racing contests. I also taught them to play leap-frog in which they never saw before. The girls play \"it\" or \"tag\" and other running games. In winter the boys play hockey or \"shinny\" on the ground, wrestle, \"pull away\" or \"take out jack\", while both boys and girls join in the game of \"it\" or \"tag\", blind man's buff, etc. The children never stay in the school house except during school hours. They always come in from recess refreshed and breathing hard. However, I shall be subject to the powers\nthat be and if it is imperative I shall take it up according to instructions.\n\nYour most obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTeacher\nOttawa, January 18, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department must insist that systematic drill in calisthenics be given to the pupils of your school as provided for in the manual recently sent you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAss't Deputy and Secretary.\n\nGeo.

I was told that sickness had broken out among the children. On my return, I notified Dr. Smith (the medical attendant) who at once arranged to go to the island the next morning. On his return last night he stated that the children were suffering from a mild type of chicken pox and he promised to issue remedies.

Bouchier, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSutton West, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI am informed by Chief Charles that the school teacher (name not visible) is rather seriously ill, but will seek medical care soon. It appears that he was called in. It appears that he was called in two weeks ago today, he fell very sick and caught a severe cold. He was unable to attend the school for a week, but opened the school again last Monday and continued to teach through the week.

Bouchier, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSutton West, Ont.\nAfter doing good service here for over four years at a ridiculously low salary for a man of my standing I hereby respectfully enquire whether there is any prospect of my salary being increased. In my last Public School in the Town of Waterloo where I was principal for nearly 30 years I received a salary of $100 but as in some other places (Toronto for example) some of the trustees (not the public) put it into their heads, but wrongly, that I had passed my usefulness on account of my age while I was doing as good work as any teacher in the country having placed 34 out of 38 candidates at the last entrance examination in 1967. I am just as able to teach now as I was 40 years ago, being in perfect health both physically.\nand mentally. I have as good testimonials from trustees and inspectors as any teacher in Ont. I have done good work here and the people are well pleased; in fact there has never been a man of my standing as a teacher here before.\n\nNow if the salary allowed for this reserve is not an unchangeable sum, I would respectfully ask that my salary be increased by $100, the said increase to count from the beginning of the present term or quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGeo.

As you are aware, previous to the appointment of Mr. Cork, considerable dissatisfaction existed with the teachers supplied this school and I trust that you will be able to secure a teacher who will be as satisfactory to the Indians as Mr. Cork has been.

This offer has our hearty endorsation, and if it should prove acceptable to the Department I hope that it will be possible to pay Mr. Cork on the same basis as if his resignation had not been presented. During the months when the school will be open his period of service will have been continuous and as the remuneration is on a per annum basis, his request seems reasonable that no deduction should be made for the holiday season on account of the fact that he contemplated severing his relations with the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nJ.

Since that time, the Committee of our Church who are in touch with conditions at Georgina Island, have sent us a resolution strongly advocating securing a married man for this position, on the ground that a Christian home is very much needed as an influence both upon the school children, and throughout the community.\n\nAs the Department is probably aware, the Missionary Society have a fairly comfortable, furnished house at this place which was formerly occupied by a married teacher.\nI am carrying on correspondence on the matter, and it would seem advisable to defer any definite appointment until some consensus of opinion has been reached as to the best arrangement.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJHA/M.\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nJ.

Arnup,\nAssistant Secretary,\nForeign Missions,\nMethodist Missionary Society,\nWesley Building,\n299 Queen St., West,\nToronto, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nRepeated advertisement both in our church papers and in the daily press has brought only one inquiry concerning the Indian Day School at Georgina Island. If the man who answered becomes an applicant he will not be immediately available.\n\nBy personal effort I have secured the prospect of a suitable supply whose name I beg to submit is Mr. W. L. Leeson, an undergraduate of Toronto University who for financial reasons is willing to go out teaching for the balance of the school year, if necessary.

E. Jones, of 23 Toronto Street, Toronto.\n\nMr. Jones is an Englishman of about forty years of age, who was engaged in several forms of mission work before coming to Canada some five years ago. In addition to a common school education in the old land, he carried on courses of study in preparation for and in connection with his mission work. Last winter he took courses of lectures in several subjects at Victoria College, Toronto, and secured creditable standings in his examinations. He is married but has no children. His wife shares his desire to take up such a form of work as is open to the missionary-teacher at Georgina Island.\n\nFrom the standpoint of the Missionary Society I believe that Mr. Jones would be an acceptable worker at this point. His English education and further experience leads me to believe that inspite of the lack of provincial academic and pedagogical standing, he will be able to carry on the school with general helpfulness and increasing efficiency as he becomes accustomed to the work. In the\nlight of all the information which is to hand, including\nthe fact that no other applicant has appeared for this\nposition, I beg to recommend that Mr. Jones be appointed\nto the position as a supply, at the regular rate of salary.\nIf his services prove satisfactory to the Department, the\nappointment can be continued indefinitely. In any case, the\nwork will be carried on until such time as we are able to\nsecure a qualified teacher.\n\nI shall gladly share with the Department,\nif necessary, the responsibility of ascertaining whether\nhis services as teacher of the school prove to be\nsatisfactory from an academic standpoint.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJHA/M.\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nJ.

Abraham, B.S.A.\n\nSCHOOL.\n\nThe teacher, Mr. Jones, is an Englishman who has never taught school before. He is, I think, qualified to take up all the lessons but he has no idea what to teach each class. He should be supplied with the Ont. Dept. of Education's school manuals for 1915, which takes up each subject and outlines the lessons that should be taught to each class. There is a separate manual for each subject, eleven in all and they can be bought for about $2.00 per set. I can secure them and mail them to him if so instructed. These manuals will be a great assistance to teachers who have not had normal training.\n\nThere are 22 pupils on the roll, 28 of school age on the Island. The average attendance is 16. They have no truant officer at present. One should be appointed at a salary of about $12.00 a year, to be paid when the attendance is 75% or better of the total number of children on school age and no pay when the attendance falls below this.\n\nThe closets should be moved as they are too close together. The girl's closet is good but the boy's is small poor, too small with no shile. A new one should be constructed.\n\nAGRICULTURE IN THE SCHOOL.\n\nFor next year the Chief has promised to prepare a school garden and to organize a school fair.

It might be that he would listen to a communication from you relative to keeping such a dog.

Crozier, threatening action against the missionary for damages done by his dog.\n\nBy unexpected good fortune I was able to have an immediate interview with Rev. J. W. Arnott, of Sutton, who is Superintendent of this mission and has been closely in touch with the whole situation. As usual there are two sides to the story. In the main, however, the allegations against the missionary's dog are admitted. The charge of being abusive to the aged chief, or more correctly, the ex-chief Charles Big Canoe, is explained by the fact that the old gentleman and the missionary had a rather serious altercation in a public place. According to my information neither of them recall the argument with any special pride or pleasure.\n\nRev. Mr. Arnott has interviewed the missionary, the lawyer, the Indian Agent, Mr. Boucher, the ex-chief Charles Big Canoe, his son Albert, with whom the old gentleman makes his home, and other members of his family. He assures me that there is a disposition all round to settle the matter without legal procedure, and at least a possibility of restoring reasonably good relations between the missionary and the Big Canoe family.\n\nIn view of the obvious advantage of such a course, I beg to recommend that the matter be placed for settlement in the hands of Rev. J. W. Arnott and the Indian Agent, Mr. Boucher, and that all parties be advised to accept their settlement. Mr. Arnott has expressed his willingness to undertake this work in cooperation with Mr. Boucher if it is the wish of the Indian Department.\n\nIn the meantime, I shall very strongly urge upon\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esquire,\nAss't Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6131, File 392-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nthe missionary the necessity of adopting a reasonable and gracious attitude toward the other parties in the difficulty. If he fails to do this and thereby makes a settlement impossible, I will at once cooperate with the Department in his removal or transfer to some other school. My information from all sources is to the effect that he has done excellent work both in the school and on the mission, and on this account I should like to avoid the closing of a successful term in such an unfortunate manner. I feel sure that the Department will be equally anxious to assist in securing the acceptance of a reasonable arrangement by the other parties to the controversy.\n\nIf a settlement should be effected, then we shall be able to judge whether it is still necessary to contemplate the transfer of Mr. Jones, say at the end of the present school year.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJHA/M\n\nAssistant Secretary.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 152, dated March 3rd, in reply to his first charge of keeping a dog. I think it is not correct that the dog was young and in particular not under any control. A flock of cattle came into Mr. Jones' pasture and when Mr. Jones was driving them out, the dog naturally took a hand in and the result was the death of one of the little fellows before Mr. Jones could call the dog off; this happened in the early part of last summer.\n\nMr. Jones gave the dog away but it came back again. I think in the early part of the winter Mr. Jones was very anxious to keep it so he had made a pet of it. However, after the complaint was made about the dog chasing the cattle, they had the dog shot. I have tried to have the difference kept the matter, but do not know yet if I have been successful. Mr. Jones declares that he had not the slightest intention of being abusive, either to the old chief or Mr. Albert Johnson. Mr. Jones may be a little excitable but very anxious to lead the people into a right way of living.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nJ. M.

Crozier, Esq., B.A., LL.B.,\nBarrister, etc.,\nSutton West, Ont.\nRev J H Arney P.O.\nWesley Rd Toronto\n\nDear Sir,\n\nToday I received a letter from Mr. John Ames of Maberly, Ont., asking for a testimonial.\n\nDuring May and June 1916, I was doing supply work on Newtonville Circuit, Bay Conference, and it was there I met Mr. Ames; he was teaching in one of the schools in that district. At that time Mr. Ames was quite active in church work. He did very acceptable work in the Sabbath School and preached for me one Sunday when I was absent and his effort was well received by the friends of the church.\n\nMy acquaintance with Mr. Ames is quite limited, but I can testify to his reputation so far as I have known of him; everyone on the circuit seemed to respect him, and he impressed me as being very earnest and sincere. I don't know much of Mr. Ames but what I know is good.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ.R.G. Carruthers\n\nP.S. You might mention to Mr. Ames that I responded to his request and wrote to you.\nTuesday, Dec. 27, 1909\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nMr. John Ross taught the Reabord Public School during the year now closing, and brought it up from a very low condition to a state of great efficiency. His pupils that wrote for Entrance were exceptionally successful, and not only did they excel in their studies but the moral tone of the school also improved very much under his care. I have therefore no hesitancy in stating that no Public School Board can make a mistake that honors him with its confidence.\n\nJ. H. Knight\n\nV. P. S for Victoria Co. (East)\nBarrie Dec. 26, 1912\n\nThis certificate that Mr. John Evans taught the Public School in S.S. No. 7, Simcoe during the years 1910, 1911, and 1912, and gave most excellent satisfaction to parents, trustees, and Inspector for the entire period. His discipline and methods of teaching are of a very high order, and it affords me very much pleasure to recommend him to any Public School Board as a conscientious, hardworking, painstaking teacher and a gentleman in the widest sense of the word.\n\nThos. W. McCauley\nInspector of Public Schools\nTo the Trustees of Christian Island Pub. School\n\nGentlemen,\n\nHaving noticed your ad. for a teacher in the Daily M & E of March 1st, I beg leave respectfully to offer myself as an applicant for the position. I hold a Permanent 3rd Class Certificate with Honours as a Public School Teacher in Ontario, an Art Certificate for various branches of Drawing, a Gold Medal for General Proficiency from a Toronto Business College, and am an Honour Graduate in Elocution. For information relative to success in teaching, character or otherwise I would refer you to the accompanying testimonials. If my application meets with your approval I will require a salary $400.00 per annum and will spare no pains to acquit myself to your entire satisfaction.\n\nTrusting to receive a favourable reply at your early convenience.\n\nBelieve me, Gentlemen,\n\nI am now teaching the Maberly Village School, County of Lanark, Ont., on a salary of $650.00. I am a Methodist, and have held a Local Preacher's license. My certificate was obtained by writing for a 2nd Class, and only failed by a few marks in Grammar. I am a teacher.\n\nYours most truly,\n\nJohn Owens\nMaberly, Ont. (Teacher)\nLanark Co., Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

He is 19 years of age, of good family, a member of the Methodist Church, and with such recommendations as to Christian character that the Missionary Society would be willing to commit to him such duties as are usually expected of the teacher in connection with the religious welfare of the people. He is in negotiation with other school boards and naturally the question of salary has arisen.\n\nI beg to recommend his appointment to this position and hope that the Department will find it possible to fix the salary at a figure which, including the war bonus if it is to be continued, will amount to a total of $700 for the year.\n\nJHA/M\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

I may say that this is the same salary as she received as teacher of the No. 6 School. She has no professional qualifications, and it is considered that, with salary at the above rate and bonus at the rate of $150.00 per annum, the amount she receives will compare favourably with that paid teachers in the rural schools having the qualifications which she possesses.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Bourchier, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSutton West, Ont.\nJuly 29th, 1921.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of July 7th, No. 2-1-8, addressed to Rev. Arthur Barnor, I note from the last paragraph that the Department approves of the present teacher at Georgina Island remaining for another year.\n\nMiss Martin was in our office yesterday and says that she feels that she cannot carry the work on for another year at the limited salary she has been receiving. She says the work is hard and there is much of it; also, she has been informed that the teacher at Parry Island, where the circumstances are much similar, is receiving a considerably larger salary. You are, of course, in possession of information through your Inspector as to how satisfactory Miss Martin's work is. I am writing on her behalf, as well as on our own, to know whether there is any likelihood that an increase in her salary will be considered if she returns to her work for another year. I should appreciate a reply on this point in the near future.\n\nI am,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nALS.MT\nAugust 2nd, 1921.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nRev. A. Lloyd Smith, Assistant Secretary, Board of Home Missions of the Methodist Church, requests that an increase in salary be granted to Miss Grace Martin, teacher of the Georgina Island Indian Day School, which school is conducted under the auspices of the above named church. After an interview with Miss Martin he states that she will not go back to this school another year unless she receives an increase in salary.\n\nMiss Martin is an Indian, 27 years of age. She has had three years' experience as teacher in Indian schools, two of which were on the Six Nations' Reserve, and last year at Georgina Island. She has no professional qualifications, having had only a high school training. Salary allowed is at the rate of $600 per annum, together with bonus at the rate of $150. She also receives $50.00 for mission work from the Methodist Church. Favourable reports have been received regarding her work, and that she is making a success at this school.\n\nRev. Mr. Smith points out that the teachers at Parry Island, where the circumstances are similar, are receiving a considerably larger salary than Miss Martin. Miss Huffman who taught the Ryerson School was paid $800 per annum and bonus of $150. She has had normal training and a 3rd class certificate. Mrs. English, who taught the Shawanaga, received a salary of $750 per annum and bonus at the rate of $150. She also had a 3rd class professional certificate, with model training.\n\nOwing to the isolation of Georgina Island it is difficult to obtain a good teacher, and as Miss Martin has done good work it would be advisable to retain her services, and I would recommend that she be granted an increase of $100 from the beginning of the new school year. The Band Funds contribute $250 towards the salary and the balance is paid from the general vote for Indian education.\nOTTAWA, August 6th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in communication with the authorities of the Methodist Church regarding the appointment of Miss Grace Martin as teacher of the Georgina Island Indian Day School for another year. The church authorities are being informed that if Miss Martin will return when this school reopens after the present holidays an increase of $100 per annum will be allowed her in her salary. This will provide a salary at the rate of $700 per annum, and she will also be entitled to the bonus allowed teachers of Indian schools during the present fiscal year at the rate of $150 per annum.\n\nIt is hoped that she will assume duties for another year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. J. Kay, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSutton West, Ont.\nOTTAWA, August 6th, 1921.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo regarding the retaining of the services of Miss Grace Martin for another year as teacher of the Georgina Island Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that, if Miss Martin will return and take charge of this school for another year, the Department will grant her an increase of $100 in salary, which will make her salary at the rate of $700 per annum, and she will also be entitled to receive the bonus for the present fiscal year at the rate of $150, making a combined salary and bonus of $850. She has no professional qualifications, and it is considered the salary that will be allowed her is equal to that paid the teachers in the surrounding white schools having normal training.\n\nYou are, no doubt, aware of Miss Martin's address, and I will be pleased if you will inform her of the increase in salary granted, and ascertain from her definitely whether she will return when the school reopens after the present holidays or not. I will be pleased to be informed as to her decision in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. A.

In case this letter has not reached you, a copy is enclosed herewith, which will inform you of the increase in salary allowed.\n\nIt is hoped that Miss Martin will consent to remain and assume duties when the school reopens after the holidays, and I will be pleased to hear her decision in the matter at an early date. If she does not accept, it will be necessary to secure another teacher. The salary allowed for a qualified teacher will be at the same rate as granted Miss Martin for the new school year, together with the bonus granted to teachers in Indian Day Schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Asst.

The nomination of Miss Sumners for some other Indian school conducted under the auspices of the Methodist Church will receive consideration.\n\nWe have no teacher in view for the Georgina Island Indian Day School. Miss Grace Martin, who taught this school last year, is taking charge of the New Credit school after the summer holidays. It will be necessary to secure the services of a teacher to replace her at Georgina Island, and I shall be pleased if you will nominate a teacher for this school. The name, qualifications and experience of the teacher nominated should be forwarded for the consideration of the Department.\n\nRegarding the Gibson Indian Day School, I beg to say that insofar as we are aware Miss Black will again resume duties when the school re-opens after the holidays. We have had no intimation that she intends to resign.\n\nRegarding a teacher for the Chemong (Mad Lake) Indian Day School, I beg to say that the services of Miss Brown will be satisfactory, and the Department will approve of her re-engagement for another year.\n\nWe have not yet appointed a teacher for the Christian Island school. This matter has been left in the hands of the Band in Council, and we hope that they will very shortly succeed in obtaining the services of a qualified teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

I have written for a statement of his qualifications for such a position; also, for testimonials as to his character, etc. In the meanwhile, I am wondering whether you have any knowledge of this young man which would lead you to favor, or otherwise, his appointment to this position. I am not sure whether he has ever taught school; in fact, I know nothing about him other than that one of the Indians on Christian Island, who was opposed to the Council nominating the teacher, wrote me that he had heard that the Council was going to nominate Lorenzo Big Canoe for Christian Island, and, if so, it would be satisfactory to those who were opposed to the Council having this matter in charge.\n\nI will report to you immediately that I have definite information from any source about Mr. Big Canoe.\n\nI am,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nC.E.M.\n\nMr. J.

He was highly spoken of by the college authorities and others. We are satisfied that he would be successful as a teacher in an Indian school. It was expected that the Indian Council, Chippewa Island, would give him the position as teacher there, but as you have already been informed they have failed to nominate him. The Department will approve of his appointment as teacher at Georgina Island; his retention in the position to depend upon the success with which he meets in the work. The salary allowed him will be at the rate of $700 per annum, plus any bonus provided by law.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will communicate with Mr. Big Canoe, or your minister at Sutton West, and inform him of the Department's approval being granted for the appointment of Lorenzo Big Canoe, and arrangements should be made with him to take up his duties as soon after the 5th of September, next, as possible.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will inform me at a later date as to whether he accepts this position, in order that we can inform our Agent of the terms of his engagement.\n\nWe note that you have informed Miss Browne that approval has been granted for her re-appointment as teacher of the Chemong Indian Day School, and that it is expected she will resume her duties about September 5th, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I would be very sorry if Mr. Rosser was given the position or appointed to teach school here again, as his previous record here is very bad. As a teacher, the people had considerable trouble with him. Parents of children are much concerned over the report that this man is coming back as a teacher, we would rather wait longer until a competent teacher is secured. I hope this man does not come here.

His services then were unsatisfactory, and the Department could not approve of his appointment at the present time. The Chief states that the Indians would rather have the school remain closed than conducted under the management of Mr. Prosser.\n\nIn your letter of the 9th instant, you stated that a young man of splendid qualifications had applied for this position, and that you expected him to call to see you. If you consider this young man would be satisfactory, we would be pleased if you would forward his name, qualifications and experience, as we are anxious to obtain a teacher for Georgina Island at as early a date as possible, and one who has the necessary qualifications to make a success of the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I believe his friends have been using influence to have him appointed as Teacher, but I have made it a rule, since the Indian Work came under my supervision, to recommend no one for any position whom I did not think was fully qualified and would meet requirements.\n\nI am sorry to say that the young man who had applied for this position is not immediately available. I am doing my best to secure a competent teacher but think it better to wait a few weeks rather than recommend anyone whom I would not feel confident would give satisfaction.\n\nI will let you know at the earliest possible moment of any recommendation I have to make. In the meanwhile, if you know of anyone who would meet requirements at this place, I would like you to feel at liberty to engage him. Mr. Ferrier is in Toronto now and I expect the Rev. Arthur Barner, Superintendent of our Indian Missions, will be in the city in a few days.

He has been ill recently and will not be able to undertake the duties of teacher for five or six weeks yet.\n\nMr. Barner suggests that, in the meanwhile, we engage a Miss Z. F. Legate, who is available to open the school and keep it open until Mr. Ward has sufficiently recovered to undertake the duties of Missionary Teacher. We would pay her out of the salary allowed Mr. Ward. Will you sanction Mr. Ward's appointment, and also the arrangement we propose to make, if agreeable to you, to have Miss Legate open the school without delay.\n\nFurther, in a previous communication from the Department of Indian Affairs we were told that the salary of the teacher at Georgina Island would be $700.

I have noted Mr. Ward's qualifications, and in reply I beg to state that the Department approves of his appointment.\n\nAs the teacher nominated by you will be unable to undertake the duties for a few weeks, and as it is desirable that the school be opened without delay, you are authorized to arrange for a temporary supply. I note that Miss Z. F. Legate is available until Mr. Ward has sufficiently recovered to take up the work.\n\nThe salary offered will be at the rate of $700 per annum, plus any bonus allowed by law.

You might inform Chief Big Canoe of this action and enlist his cooperation in the matter of securing a good attendance when the school is opened.\n\nIf there are any repairs to the school absolutely necessary, you should inform the Department.

I reached the third form at Albert College, Belleville but was forced to leave owing to financial difficulties. I am nineteen years of age and could come here at any time.\n\nYours truly,\nGeorge Campbell\nP.O. Box 528\nMidland, Ont.\nOTTAWA, November 13th, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant, applying for the position as teacher of the Georgina Island Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the authorities of the Methodist Church, under whose auspices this school is conducted, have nominated the services of the Rev. J. A. Ward as teacher, and his appointment has been approved. As Mr. Ward will be unable to undertake duties for a few weeks on account of ill health, the services of Miss Z. F. Legate have been secured as a substitute until Mr. Ward is able to begin duties. There is, therefore, no vacancy in this school to which you could be appointed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nGeorge Campbell, Esq.,\nP. O. Box 528,\nMidland, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nI write to notify you that the Rev. J. A. Ward entered upon his duties of Missionary Teacher on Georgina Island on Sunday, November 12th, and opened the Day School there on Monday, November the 13th. You will, doubtless, wish this information as a matter of record in your office.\n\nI will be pleased to learn at your earliest convenience what salary you finally decide to pay to Mr. Ward. In a letter received from Mr. A. F. MacKenzie, dated October 27th, we were advised that for the present the salary would be $700 per annum, plus any bonus allowed by law, and that after Mr. Ward has proven his worth at Georgina Island, the Department would give favorable consideration to an increase in the grant.\n\nI am,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. J. D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOTTAWA, November 21st, 1922.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th instant, informing the Department that Rev. J. A. Ward entered upon his duties as missionary teacher at Georgina Island on the 12th instant. We are pleased to have this information for record on our files.\n\nRegarding salary, I beg to say that for the present Mr. Ward will be paid at the rate of $700 per annum plus any bonus allowed by law. We are not prepared to make any decision at present as to the amount of the increase we would be prepared to make, as this will depend entirely upon the success with which Mr. Ward meets in his work at this school and the attendance he is able to maintain. As soon as a report has been received from the Public School Inspector regarding his services, we will then consider an increase in salary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAsst.

Scott,\nOttawa, (Legislative buildings)\n\n578256\n\nI am the mission teacher at Georgina Indian Reserve and on opening school here a few weeks ago I find there are some things much needed. It is possible for you to kindness furnish us with the following; it would assist greatly in the work here.\n\nBelow is a list of needed equipment:\n\n1. A school clock.\n2. 5 window shades.\n3. 6 new histories and 6 new geographies when the new editions come out.\n4. 20 pointers.\n5. One pencil machine sharpener.\n6. Two dozen writing books for pen and ink.\nIn relation to a school garden what assistance would the government give? They had none here last year and I believe such would be of special help and encouragement to the Indian children in farm and garden work.\n\nAlso along boy scout work what assistance could the government give towards the equipment and maintenance of a scout club among the Indian boys here.\n\nI hold a certificate on music, singing and theory. Does the department give any special grant to teachers who are able and hold special certificates in music to teach this subject in school.\n\nSome form of entertainment for the Indians here, especially in the winter is much needed. They are somewhat isolated here from the mainland and a magic lantern or a moderate priced moving picture machine could be used here to great advantage, also\nit could be used in the school\nin teaching subjects such as\ngeography and other subjects.\nI hope that wherever you\ncan assist us in the above\nmatters of interest to the reserve,\nhere will be very much\nappreciated by the Indians\non the reserve.\n\nAwaiting your reply\n\nRemain Truly\nYours Truly\nJohn A Ward.\nOttawa, Dec. 6, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received a communication from Rev. John A. Ward, who was recently appointed Teacher of the Georgina Island Indian Day School. He asks that a school clock and five window shades be supplied.\n\nI have to request, therefore, that you will arrange for the purchase and delivery to the school of a cheap wall clock and five window shades of the width and length required. You will please incur no undue expenditure and furnish properly certified vouchers in duplicate covering the cost of these articles.\n\nThe teacher asks for permission to conduct a school garden next spring, and we are instructing him to bring this matter to your attention in due time. You may arrange to have the garden plowed and the necessary manure procured. We will also be prepared to furnish a small quantity of garden seeds; but a requisition should be made out by the teacher and forwarded to the Department through your office before the purchase is made. This garden is to be conducted by the pupils and for their instruction.\n\nThe teacher has also requested that some equipment be supplied for boy scout work. He has been asked to prepare a list of the articles required, showing their probable cost. This list is to be forwarded to the Department through your office.\n\nThe Department desires to grant every possible encouragement and assistance to the teacher, in order to make the work at this school successful, and I shall be pleased if you will do all in your power to help Mr. Ward.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. J. Kay, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSutton West, Ont.\nOttawa, Dec. 6, 1922.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, applying for certain material for the use of the Georgina Island Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that we are ordering from the Government Stationery Office here, to be forward to your address, the Histories, Geographies, pointers, exercise books and pencil sharpeners asked for. Mr. Agent Kay will be requested to purchase a school clock and the five window shades.\n\nRegarding the conducting of a school garden next spring, I beg to say that the Department will be favourably disposed to having this done, in order to teach the children gardening. You should make application to the agent, in due time to have any ploughing, manuring, etc., done.\n\nWith regard to equipment for boy scout work, I have to request that you will make out a requisition for the supplies that would be necessary for the purpose, stating their cost. You should hand this requisition to the local agent, as his approval is required. He will forward it to the Department.\n\nWe do not make special grants in the way of salaries to teachers holding certificates in music. I may also say that we do not supply Indian day schools with magic lanterns, projection lanterns, or moving picture machines. If you would apply to the Methodist Mission Rooms in Toronto, they might be able to loan you equipment of this nature, as well as the slides or views required.\n\nIn future, I have to request that you will be good enough to forward all applications for supplies for schools, or correspondence in connection therewith, to the Department through the office of the local Indian Agent. It is necessary to have the agent's recommendation regarding all applications for supplies, repairs or other matters involving any expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. John A. Ward,\nTeacher, Indian Day School,\nGeorgina Island, Ont.\nSir,\n\nRe your letter #10-1-1 Dec 62.\n\nAs to furnishing supplies for School gardens Boy Scouts, etc. What ever money that would be expended in this manner come out of their annuity.\n\nFor as I am sure in many other things some of the Indians without children start to put up a kick if they think one of the others was getting the benefit at their expense kindly advise me along these lines.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nW.J. Kay\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, Jan. 10, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, regarding the conducting of a school garden next spring at the Georgina Island Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department desires to have gardening operations carried on, in order that the children may receive some instruction in the growing of vegetables, etc. You should draw this matter to the attention of the Department early in the spring, so that arrangements can be made to have the garden manured and ploughed. A requisition should also be made out by the teacher and forwarded, through your office, for the garden seeds required.\n\nWe cannot consider the objection of the Indians who have no children attending school as to the cost of carrying out the above work. The instruction received by the pupils will be of future benefit to the whole band.\n\nThe Department will expect that you will bear this matter in mind and report, early in the spring, as to what is necessary to be done to assist the teacher in starting gardening.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I regret that he is somewhat disappointed in connection with their schooling. I examined the quarterly reports and pointed out that the irregular attendance of the past year\u2014which, he says, was caused by sickness\u2014has, no doubt, militated against their success. Mr. Big Canoe applied for assistance so that he could send his two girls to the Sutton Public School. He was informed that favourable consideration could not be given.\n\nI should be pleased to have a special report concerning these two children and you should add suggestions concerning what help the Department could give.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. John A. Ward,\nTeacher, Indian Day School,\nGeorgina Island, Ont.\nOttawa, December 4, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to inform you that Albert Big Canoe, one of the most progressive Indians of the Georgina Island Band, visited the Department this week and expressed himself as dissatisfied with the progress of the children in the day school on that reserve. Because of the difficulties of transportation, the Public School Inspector has not visited this school of late and we have, therefore, no report concerning the success of the teacher, the Rev. Mr. Ward. I should be grateful if you would give me your impressions concerning this incumbent and make suggestions concerning remedial measures, if such are necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. Arthur Bernier,\nMission Rooms,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto, (2) Ont.\nSir,\n\nRe your letter No.10-1-1 dated Dec 4th also copy of letter sent to Mr. John R. Wood rather hard to give an accurate report on some only what I really see for myself and hear from others. In the first place Albert Bigeau and his family feel above any of the other people on the Island and he himself sometimes tries to make himself a big man then when in trouble comes to me to help him out. In other causes no more trouble than anyone else on the Reserve. Never feels satisfied no matter what is done for him or his family and no matter what question comes up he will never stand up or come up to the front of the Hall and discuss anything but will sit around the door with a bunch of young boys and find fault with the Council and others who try to do any business I say but very little attention to his remarks. Regards Mr. Wood's teaching I never thought he was a past master still hard to get a teacher and teacher in one person very fluent speaker.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6131, File 392-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPoor Copy\nSir,\n\nBut my experience with children was if the parents uphold their children in everything rather hard for the teacher to control them and then when the children are not taught to look up to the teacher they do not take the same interest and do not get results. Bigcanoe's oldest boy fit along very well so you know then the second boy was altogether different went to school for some years with poor progress Miss Martin was teaching at the time he causing considerable trouble she told him if he did not come to school to learn and obey he could stay home which he did. This caused considerable hard feeling against Miss Martin with the Bigcanoe family. Now regards the two girls that are attending school at present Bigcanoe have often told me of the poor progress they are making and as for sickness keeping them out of school this is the first information to me and if such had been the case I certainly would have known.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6131, File 392-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPoor copy\nSir,\n\nAs far as my own opinion a lot of Indians children can get along very well to the age of fourteen and in the fourth book but hard for them to go much farther (This is only my version of matters) Complaints came to me a few days ago from the Constable Wellington Charles that on Sundays in the Parish of the Church a few of the boys would gather causing considerable trouble slamming the door and laughing at some of the people as they went into the Church. And that Lorenzo Bigeau the oldest boy of Albert Bigeau was as bad as any of them trying to cause a disturbance to those inside also. Mr. Ward this is just as the complaint came to me. In conclusion may say Mr. Ward may not be an expert but does not get the assistance that he should from this family. Any thing else further that I can convey to you will only be too pleased to do so.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nW. J. Kay\nAgent.\nOttawa, December 10, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to the success of the teacher at the Georgina Island Indian Day School. I note that you are not convinced that the children of Albert Big Canoe are doing the best they can in connection with their studies.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. J. Kay, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSutton West, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have received a letter, dated December 4th, in which you say that Albert Big Cane - one of the most progressive Indians of the Georgina Island Band - visited the Department this week and expressed himself as \"dis-satisfied with the progress of the children in the day school on that reserve.\"\n\nIn response to your request for a report on this matter, I beg to state that I have not been able to visit Georgina Island this fall. I expect to be there early in April next. When I visited this school last fall, I found everything in good condition and I was quite pleased with the progress of the pupils. Mr. Ward seemed to have the work well in hand. I would advise that you do not take this complaint seriously, until either your Inspector or I shall be able to visit the school again.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nExtract from report of Inspector Mulloy on the Georgina Island Indian Day School, dated Oct. 2, 1925.\n\nOriginal on file 10-1-6.\n\n\"The preacher-teacher combination fairly works well. Mr. Ward may preach acceptably to adults (I don't know) but he is a poor teacher for children. He talks and talks and most of the time goes over the heads of the pupils. He wastes time in wordy explanations that are lost on the pupils.\n\nFor some years no pupil has reached the H.S. Entrance although several could have done so under proper guidance and teaching. Pupils with few exceptions have good ability, attend pretty regularly until about 16 years of age. Now that a thousand teachers are without schools, it should be easily possible to obtain a qualified teacher. No change can however be made immediately or possibly before next June.\n\nAs a free house is provided a married teacher or one with a relative for companion and housekeeper might be secured. Many male teachers are without schools.\n\nTeacher does not get best work from his pupils. Reading is expressionless. Answers to questions asked, poor, never in correct form. Teacher does not teach how answers should be given, accepts wrong and poor answers.\n\nArithmetic seems to be in better condition. Grammar poorly taught. Conclusion: some progress is being made, but more, much more could be possible.\n\nI believe Mr. Ward has as a man and a preacher been fairly acceptable to the people but he is not a clear or effective teacher for children. I shall try and assist him while he remains.\"\nOttawa, December 17, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of recent date, with reference to the progress of the children of Mr. Albert Big Canoe at the Georgina Island Indian Day School.

I have now to inform you that the Department and the Church authorities are not prepared to make any change in the teaching services at the present time.

(RG 10, Volume 6131, File 392-3, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, July 8, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant enclosing the June quarter return of the Georgina Island Day School, as well as a voucher for the teacher's salary for that period.\n\nIn reply I beg to inform you that cheques to the amount of $125.00, being the amount of salary due Mr. Cork, the teacher, are being sent you. This is payment in full for his services at this school to June 30th, last.\n\nThe school year begins after the summer holidays, September 1st, and ends June 30th, during which period the Department requires that the school be taught 200 days. Mr. Cork began duties at the Mud Lake School in September, 1909, and was transferred to Georgina Island April 1st, 1910, where he has taught continuously up to June 30th, last, a period of six years, which he has been in the employ of the Department and for which he has received six years' salary. There is, therefore, no further amount due him for his services.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. R. Bouchier, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSutton West, Ont.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nDear Sir:\n\nMr. Bouchier, the Indian Agent at Sutton has sent me a copy of your letter to him re my claim for salary for a portion of the holidays. Now, I respectfully submit that your statement of the case is not in accordance with the paragraphs in your \"regulations\" referring to the payment of teachers for \"broken time\". I have not a copy of the regulations at hand as it is hanging in the school house. The Ont. Public School law contains the same regulations as to teachers' salaries for \"broken time\". According to your statement of the case if I were to commence teaching on Sept 1st at a salary of $500 per annum, and quit on June 30th the following year, I would only be entitled to $496.66 while I have taught the whole\nSchool year. I have taught six full school years but have received payment for only five years' holidays; why not for the sixth? According to your view of the matter no one will be paid for the holidays and the Dept. will be that much ahead because of a change of teachers. I am sure that if you will reconsider the matter you cannot but come to the conclusion that I am right and that my claim is a just one.\n\nIf you will allow me to withdraw my resignation till the end of the year, why that would put everything right. When I resigned I supposed that my claim would be allowed without any doubt.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nGeo. Cook.\nOttawa, August 13, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant in reference to your claim for salary for a portion of the holidays as teacher of the Georgina Island School and stating that if the Department would allow you to withdraw your resignation till the end of the year that would put everything right.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Rev. Mr. Arnup, Assistant Secretary of the Methodist Missionary Society, has been informed that you may continue in charge of the Georgina Island School till the end of the year. At the end of the September quarter you will be paid a full quarter's salary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nGeo.

I did not send word in advance, as on my first visit, as I wished to know the usual condition of the school. But unfortunately, I found on arriving that the school had been closed for two or three days on account of a Church Tea-meeting.\n\nThe teacher\u2014Mr. Crosser\u2014came with me to the school, but was extremely independent in his manner. I found names of nine pupils entered in his register. On my asking for their ages and classes, and the average attendance (none of which information could be found from the register) he became angry and grew insolent, and in effect told me to mind my own business as he knew how to manage the school better than I could tell him, &c., &c. In fact, it was impossible to talk to him or get any information from him as to the school.\nI understand the Department sent an inspector some time ago, to inspect the school and as a result of this inspection and report Mr. Crosser resents any visit from me.\n\nI appreciate the difficulty of obtaining a suitable person for this position, and know that great allowance must be made for lack of scholarship and teaching ability; but the great lack in this case is of common sense. Mr. P. is a poor, weak-minded man\u2014quite unfit for the position. I find that only a few are sending their children, the average being perhaps 3 or 4 pupils. In justice to the Indians I recommend the Department to secure a more sensible man for this position.\n\nIf it were possible to combine the positions of Indian Agent, and Teacher, a better salary could be given and a better man secured.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nC.W.

The old school house was condemned by the public school inspector several years ago and he ordered about $600 dollars repairs made but undecided to use it as long as it would do and then build a new one. It is now in bad state, the old council hall is also in a bad state its super posts over a shed and the posts are quite rotten if both the old buildings were to be repaired and put in proper condition the expense would be nearly as much as the one new one, about twelve hundred dollars will complete a good cement building. If the Department approves of the new building I could ask for tenders that will show the exact cost. I think it will be much better to build new than to repair the two old buildings.\n\nThere is plenty sand and gravel near by there is a good school on the reserve near Mr. Cork the new teacher is doing good work.\n\nThe Secretary of\nThe Dept of Indian Affairs Ottawa\n\n[Signature]\n\nJohn [Last Name]\nAgent\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 17th ultimo I beg to say that the capital of the Georgina Island Band will not stand the expenditure for the erection of a combined school and Council House on the reserve at present.

The building is 24 ft. wide and 28 ft. long, quite large enough for the number of pupils that are likely to attend school on the reserve. The roof is very leaky and has caused quite a lot of the plaster to fall off the ceiling; the outside of the building is in very good condition, but needs painting; the walls which rest on posts is quite sound; the building is near the ground it would require raising one foot and a cement foundation; the lobby or entrance is too small, it would need a new one, the laths and plaster on the ceiling would have to be taken off and replastered or a metallic ceiling put on. To put the school house in a comfortable and sanitary condition, it would need shingling and ceiling and painting and a foundation and a new lobby. If these repairs were made the school building would answer quite as well as a new one for many years to come. I enclose Estimates.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Gates\nAgent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

You are correct in saying that charges are excessive, material costing $4.90 costs $3.50 to cart it to the school-house.\n\nCharles is charging 25 cents for carting and so are you. Please explain why the double charge is made. Chief Bigano will be allowed $2.00 for transporting of material, which is considered ample remuneration for services rendered.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nActing Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. R. Bouchier Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSutton West, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of letter No. 152, dated 17th and I was to enclose the receipt asked for. I paid the 25\u00a2 for carting the 1 ton of materials from the storehouse to the boat landing as I think I stated in the account. The other charge of 25\u00a2 was for carting from boat to school house a distance of about \u00bd mile.\n\nAs to the charge of 30\u00a2 by the Chief although it looks excessive, I doubt if he will accept anything less. In such cases I make objections to the charge, he said it would be thick or nothing. Now there is no man on the island as fitted for the position of Chief as J. B. Bignell, he is clever and progressive and is continually trying to improve the appearance of the public grounds and buildings and spends a good deal of time in looking after matters without any pecuniary benefit; for these reasons I wish the Department would approve of the charge.\n\nJ.

The school house is a frame structure & different places you can see the light through the walls there is a foundation under the walls and I think if it was cemented all around would make a good job. It would be a warm job and one that would last & should not cost too much. It certainly needs something regards making same warmer & this would do away with having to paint it which it needs very shortly, also they are very short of school books. Hoping to hear from you shortly regards school for if I were going to cement this building should be done before the first coming.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. J.

You should purchase any material required, and, if the cost exceeds $10.00, you should, if possible, obtain competitive prices and make the purchase from the firm quoting the lowest price. The labour should be obtained at the lowest possible cost. While a good serviceable job should be done in order to make the building as comfortable as possible, the expenditure should be kept down to as low a point as possible.\n\nThe Department will leave this matter in your hands to make all arrangements, and you should have the work completed before the cold weather sets in.\n\nProperly certified vouchers should be forwarded showing the cost of the material and the labour as soon as the work is completed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

One suggestion that is if we had money which be to take down both buildings. Build a basement that would be warm for a school and a hall above this would be a permanent job for both purposes. If we had Snake Island sold some might look brighter. The school could be cemented say five inches thick all around from the foundation to the roof which would make a good job.\n\nMy idea what ever is done would be to employ a good mechanic to go ahead with the work hiring the Indians to help in different forms. As carpenters a number of them are fairly handy. If I could oversee the work I think this plan would work out in this way, the Indians would all have opportunity of earning some of their own money. By getting a contract the work would all leave the Island.\n\nKindly advise all your opinion of the matter as it may seem from correspondence before we come to a decision on the best.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nW.J. Kay\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of the 11th instant, reporting the advanced state of disrepair in which the council house and the school-house on Georgina Island are, and in reply I beg to say that apparently the school-house is not so bad as the school Inspector has not reported against it, but if small repairs are required you will please look into the matter and inform me just what is necessary with an estimate of the cost and the repairs can be made during the summer vacation.\n\nWith reference to the council hall I think it is considered inadvisable to spend very much money on the building, as it is considered a better policy to get along with the present council hall and also the school-house until such time the Band funds are replenished from the sale of Snake Island. In the meantime small repairs should be made to the council hall and you should have the building jacked up and a new sill put under it which will make the building in shape for a short time at least. You should also report if it is absolutely necessary to shingle the council hall this summer, or, can this matter be left in abeyance for this year at least.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A.S.

The salary allowed is at the rate of $700 per annum plus any bonus provided by law. You might inform Chief Big Canoe of this action and enlist his cooperation in the matter of securing a good attendance when the school is opened.\n\nIf there are any repairs to the school absolutely necessary, you should inform the Department.

This expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No./O-1-1 dated ......... Your obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir:\n\nWhile at Georgian Is. recently I visited the school and found it in a very bad shape. A foundation was put under the school and this foundation was provided for brick veneer over the school. The outside of the school is in a very dilapidated condition and the wind can blow right through into the building. You can see daylight from the inside in a number of places and there is not storm windows of any kind on the windows. This is a very cold district and I consider it is absolutely essential for the health of the children that the school should be repaired. It is 25 x 35 with 11' walls. It would not require a very large expenditure to put the school in shape. It should be papered first with a heavy paper over the outside of the siding and then veneered.\n\nI also learned that there is no wood provided for the coming winter at the school. The Agent stated that the Indians would not work unless he had the money already to pay them. I think it would be very important indeed to have a supply of wood cut and piled in the shed as soon as possible. It would cost approximately $2.00 per cord to have this wood cut and hauled to the wood shed. It will require about 25 cords. I would recommend that an accountable cheque for $50 be forwarded to the Indian Agent and he be instructed to have the wood cut immediately.\n\nThe laboratories are also in very poor condition there being no door whatever on the girls and no shield. The boys laboratory is also out of repair. The teacher of the school, Mr. Jones, asked me if there was no way we could have the library of the school traded with some other school. He states that the children have read all the books and it is, therefore, of no use any more.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. McLean, Secy.,\nDept. of Ind. Aff.,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nR. H. ABRAHAM,\nAgr. Rep. Dept. of Ind. Aff.\nOttawa, Sept. 12, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, with reference to conditions at the Georgina Island Indian Day School. I have noted your recommendation, regarding the outside walls of the building, and I have to inform you that Mr. Indian Agent Kay is being instructed to submit an estimate of the cost of having them either veneered or cemented.\n\nWith reference to the supply of wood for the coming academic year, our representative is being instructed to secure 25 cords. He is also receiving authority, with reference to the repairs required to the outside lavatories.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. H. Abraham, Esq.,\nAgricultural Representative,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nChatham, Ont.\nOttawa, Sept. 12, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that Mr. R. H. Abraham, Agricultural Representative for the Department, has drawn our attention to certain requirements at the Georgina Island Indian Day School.\n\nI should be pleased if you would estimate the cost of having the outside walls veneered, or cemented, and intimate whether, or not, you could secure a competent man and undertake the work by day labour.\n\nYou are authorized to put the outside lavatories in good condition. Please incur no unnecessary expense.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy Secretary.\n\nW. J. Kay, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSutton West,\nOnt.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nWhen answer received, look into possibilities, having cold water, I think.\nRe your letter as to Mr. Abraham's report on school house on Georgia Island this building certainly should be repaired. I saw our best cement man this morning got here to look at same. The school is 24 x 28 this man wants $335.00 to do the job & furnish everything putting a wall four inches all around.\n\nAnother plan would be try and get a man that understands the work thoroughly & hire the Indians by the day in so doing the money would be spent on the Indians. This way myself or some one would need to oversee the job every day but I believe I could get this work done all O.K. and as I said before give the Indians the benefit of the money.\n\nKindly advise me return email as I would like to get started at once and as I have had several jobs done for my self I know they should be done before the frost comes.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nW.J. Kay\nOttawa, Sept. 27, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 24th instant, regarding the repairs required to be made at the Georgina Island Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the arrangement which you recommend for having the above work done is approved. You may therefore engage the services of a competent man who understands the work, and hire Indian labour in carrying it out. The outside walls of the building should be covered with a heavy building paper and then veneered, or cemented. You will purchase and have delivered all material needed. If possible, secure competitive prices, and obtain the goods from the firm quoting the lowest price.\n\nIt will be necessary for you to personally oversee the work and keep proper time sheets of the labour employed. These should be signed, in the column for that purpose, by the men when payment is made them. A supply of the forms is enclosed herewith.\n\nIf you require an advance to pay wages, you should requisition for the amount you consider necessary. The Department will leave the matter of these repairs in your hands, but you will please incur no unnecessary expenditure. Please attend to the matter at once, in order that the work can be finished before the extreme cold weather sets in.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

May say was at the school the day previous to receiving letter Mr. Ward the teacher did not draw my attention to this in any way although I was not inside the school. However will look it over in a few days. The well at the school is not in very good shape. Needs part of new platform also the pump has been out of order the most of the time of late. I find at present they remove part of platform and dig the water out with a spade not a very safe way for the children. I would say get a new iron pump at a cost of around \u00a325.00 then replace the platform much more sanitary & safer.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nW.J. Kay\nAgent\nOttawa, April 16th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 14th instant, I beg to say that you may arrange for the purchase and installation of a new iron pump in the well at the Georgina Island Indian Day School. You should also arrange to have the platform repaired and placed in good condition. If possible, you should obtain competitive prices for the pump, taking care to see that a good serviceable pump is installed, and that the work of the repairs is completed to your satisfaction. Please forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the cost of the pump and the repairs to the platform. These matters should receive your early attention.\n\nWe note that you will report regarding the cleaning and painting of the walls and ceiling of the school building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

He recommends that the interior of the school building be painted, the ceiling light cream and the walls light fawn and the wainscoting light oak. He states that if this is done it will make the classroom bright and pleasant for the pupils. He further states that the closets require painting, and that hooks for clothing are required in the school.\n\nI shall be pleased to have a report from you concerning the Inspector's recommendation. You should state the cost of repairing the plaster on the outside of the building, the painting of the interior, as suggested by the Inspector, and also the painting of the toilets. Please state whether you could arrange to have the painting of the interior of the schoolroom carried out during the coming Christmas holidays, and if you would advise that the work be done at that time.\n\nYou may arrange to have the number of hooks required for the clothing installed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. J. Kay, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSutton West, Ont.\nSir,\n\nRe Your Letter No. 1015 dated Dec 14th. As Report of School Inspector. The school was repaired on the outside a couple of years ago and sorry to say was not satisfactory. I watched the same kind of jobs being done here in town which certainly look well and as solid as need be. Rather hard sometimes to get men to go to the Island to do much work only country this time going & coming and you have to be on the job all the time to get results. The latter job I got and old Mason who had worked on the job some forty years to do the work. Then in order to help the Indians get them to do all the rough work carrying, whipping etc. The old Mason complained afterwards he could not get the Indians to mix according to his instructions but he never mentioned it to me when the work was being done. Some of it is dropping off. Also it has not had the best of care they tell me the School Teacher who I know is not too particular allows the boys to throw...\nSir,\n\nballs etc against the school which started some of it to crack. Also I do know I went there one day and to my surprise they had piled the seasons wood against the back end of school. Certainly this left its marks to date. I do not just know how to repair will find out next spring. As for painting I was talking to the Inspector in the School while he was there colors etc. would not advise painting this Xmas holidays unless we got extra good weather. However I will see a painter and if he recommends the job may change my mind. Re the Closets they are built of rough lumber painting would improve their appearance and possibly a coat of stain would answer the purpose just as well. However they are 90% better shape now than they have been for years.\n\nI certainly would like to see these buildings kept in good repair and will do my best any authority you may give me. I have always favored the Indian trying to give him the work.\nSir,\n\nIf possible but the best of them only make good helps should have some one to go ahead with the work. The interior certainly needs painting and I was glad we got the walls all done over with metal siding before the inspectors visit. Also the new seats that I got and put in helps the whole surroundings look much better than they did a couple of years ago only room for a few improvements yet if funds will allow.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nW.J. Kay\n\nAdjut.\nOttawa, December 18th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, relative to the repairs and painting required to the Georgina Island Indian Day School building.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that owing to weather conditions it is considered that it would be advisable to allow the repairs and painting to the school building and closets to remain over until early next spring. You should bear this matter in mind and forward a request in due time for the necessary authority to have the work undertaken. At that time you should state definitely the work you would recommend be done, the approximate cost of same, and how you would advise that the work be performed. It would, no doubt, be advisable to place the work under the charge of a competent white foreman, employing Indian labour as far as possible, you to arrange for the purchase and supplying of all materials required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

E. Bigonos,\nChief.\n\nSutton West, October 5, 1928.\n\nNo-2.\n\nIt is going to be necessary next year to have some repairs done the outside of the day school building and to save the lobby further destruction thought it advisable to have it covered with inch lumber which would be necessary in the event of the coming repairs.\n\nO. J. Silver,\nIndian Agent.\nGEORGINA ISLAND MINUTES OF COUNCIL HELD MARCH 29, 1929.\n\nMoved by O. Lorenzo Bigcance seconded by T. Albert Ashquabe that James Ashquabe Sr. be given the work to repair the school fence and be paid $4.00 for the work from Band funds.\n\nCarried.\n\nWith present condition of the fence the stock is able to get in on the school grounds. I think it would be well to have it repaired and there is no one that would do it better for $4.00 than James Ashquabe, Sr.\n\nO. J. Silver.\nAgent.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF MR. INSPECTOR FERGUSON,\nDATED OCTOBER 6TH, 1930, ON HIS INSPECTION OF\nTHE GEORGINA ISLAND INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on File 10-1-6.\n\nAs I have suggested, the classroom should be swept daily. The stove pipes smoke. The pipes should be taken down and cleaned and also the opening into the chimney to see whether this can be prevented. School cannot be kept open in cold weather under these conditions.\n\nThe girls' closet seat has only one small hole in it. The large girls are bound to either wet the front of it or dirty the back part. The seat is dirty now and the closet is dirty. These conditions should be changed before cold weather sets in. I have had a talk with the agent and he is going over to see what can be done.\n\nThe rough-cast has fallen off the outside of the school building in many places. This also should be looked after.\n\nThere is nothing in the classroom that can be locked to hold registers or other supplies. The teacher has to carry these home and back to school. This should be remedied at once.\nGEORGINA ISLAND COUNCIL MEETING HELD MARCH 3rd, 1931.\n\nMoved by T. A. Ashquabe Sec., by Thos. Bigcanoe that the old plaster and lath on the school be removed and replaced by new paper as interlining and a good quality of white pine shiplap siding material to be delivered at once.\n\nSutton West, March 6th, 1931.\n\nResolution No. 1 is referring to getting the school house on the reserve in a condition favorable to have it sided in accordance with Departmental letter 10-1-5 of 7th November 1930. This work is to be undertaken during the Easter holidays,\n\nO. J. Silver,\nIndian Agent\nGEORGINA ISLAND COUNCIL MEETING HELD MARCH 31st, 1931.\n\nSealed tenders that were asked for for work on the school were received. Six were received. The tender of Thos. Bigcanoe was accepted, his tender being $30.00.\n\nResolution No. 2.\n\nTenders were asked for preparing the school house for siding and putting same on, only skilled labor to be employed. The tender of Thos. Bigcanoe being the lowest was accepted ($30.00). He is qualified to do a good job and the work is going to be completed during Easter holidays.\n\nO. J. Silver.\nIndian Agent.\nGEORGINA ISLAND MINUTES OF COUNCIL MEETING, AUG. 9th, 1932.\n\nMoved by James R. Ashquabe Secd. by Albert Ashquabe that the school yard be levelled, gravel drawn etc. payable from the Education fund, Educational Dept.\n\nCarried.\n\nResolution No. 4.\n\nThe levelling of the school grounds may cost approximately $25.00 and I think it should be done. This was ordered done by Mr. McGookin on one of his visits to the reserve in 1929 or 1930, When he instructed Arthur Saleby to do the work. I recommend it being done and paid from Indian educational funds.\n\nO. J. Silver,\nIndian Agent.\nResolution No.2.\n\nJ.R. Ashquabe moved, T. Albert Ashquabe Sec'd.\nthat Geo. Vernon and Sam York be appointed foremen in charge\nof school yard grading and levelling etc.\n\nCarried.\n\nAppointing Geo, Vernon foreman in levelling\nschool grounds. The Council meeting of August 9th took\nthis matter up which was approved in Department letter\n10-1-5 dated August 25th last.\n\nO.J. Silver. Agent.\nGEORGINA ISLD. COUNCIL MEETING HELD DEC. 2nd, 1932.\n\nMoved by Jas. R. Ashquabe Sec'd. by Albert Ashquabe that Wellington Charles be paid three dollars from the Educational funds for building a cabinet for the school.\n\nCarried.\n\nThe cabinet referred to is a nice and good piece of furniture, book case in the upper part and a place under to keep the school pupils lunches in. The $3.00 voted Wellington Charles for building it is very much less than its value and I would approve of it being paid from Educational funds.\n\nO. J. Silver,\nIndian Agent.\nSutton West, May 10th, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nPlease find herewith a copy of the minutes of Georgina Island Council meeting held April 28th last.\n\nMoved by T. Albert Ashquabe, seconded by James R. Ashquabe that grass seed be sown in the school yard immediately, preferably timothy seed, amount 5 lbs.\n\nCarried.\n\nResolution No. 5.\n\nWhen the school grounds were being levelled last fall the grass was destroyed. The grass seed 5 lbs referred to may be charged to band funds and probably a charge for sowing it, which I would consider necessary.\n\nO. J. Silver.\nIndian Agent.\nGEORGINA ISLD. MINUTES OF COUNCIL MEETING HELD DEC.27, 1935.\n& Jan. 29, 1936.\n\nNo. 3.\n\nTom BigCanoe, J.R.Ashquabe moved in view of\nthe dangerous condition of the school house stove it is\nstrongly recommended that a new stove and pipes be purchased,\nalso a new floor laid. The Indian Agent is hereby instructed\nto notify the Board of Education to take immediate action\nin the matter.\n\nCarried.\n\nResolution No. 3 refers to the condition of the stove and\nfloor in the school house. I asked the Inspector, Mr.\nFerguson to recommend the purchase of a new stove and a\nnew floor laid some time ago. The stove is not safe to\nuse, and the floor is worn through in many places.\n\nO. J. Silver.\nIndian Agent.\nThe Council did not deal with the subject of a new pump or probably considerable repairs to the present one at the school on the reserve. I would suggest it being always kept in good working order and at least six tin pails always available and under the care of the teacher for it is the only protection we have in case of a fire.\n\nO.J. Silver.\nIndian Agent.\nRes. No. 3.\n\nMoved by Leslie McCue and seconded by Tom Porte and resolved that we paint the school and that we request the educational Dept. to purchase necessary paint and material, and also pay labour, it was further resolved that tenders for labour be received by the Indian Agent and Chief within one week.\n\nCarried.\n\nLast year when the Hall and Church were painted I suggested painting the school house as it has been some time since it was done and needs it badly.\n\nTenders have been received and awarded Tom Porte at $18.00 for labour only. 2\u00bd gallons of paint at $4.00 per gal. $10.00; two brushes and sand paper about $1.25 - an approximate cost in all $30.00.\n\nDepartment letter 10-1-9 dated April 21st gave permission to repair the school fence at a cost of $20.50 - we got the caretaker to do some repairs and if other requests are expending too much educational funds the school fence with present repairs might be left over for another year if necessary.\n\nO.J. Silver,\nIndian Agent.\nNo. 2.\n\nMoved by Tom Porte and seconded by Leslie McCue and resolved that we repair the school roof immediately and that we request the Educational Dept to grant us the sum of one hundred dollars estimated cost of material and labour the material being lumber for sheeting, shingles and nails. It was further resolved that tenders for this labour be received by the Indian Agent and Chief within one week.\n\nCarried.\n\nThe school house roof leaks in many places, on enquiry I learn that it will require about 9 M shingles and good cedar shingles are $5.60 per M. - $$50.40 requiring about 30 lbs nails, galvanized nails are 12\u00a2 a lb.- $3.60. Ridge boards about $2.50. The delivery to the school will likely cost $5.00 and the tender received and accepted for the labour is $18.00- putting them on in all approximately $80.00. The cleaning up and piling them inside for kindling may cost a little more.\n\nO.J. Silver,\nIndian Agent.\nGEORGINA ISLD. MINUTES OF COUNCIL MEETING HELD JUNE 12, 1939.\n\nNo. 4.\n\nMoved by Tom Porte and seconded by Leslie McCue that we purchase an iron gate 3 feet 4 inches x 4 feet to be used on the fence at the public grounds.\n\nSutton West, June 16, 1939.\n\nThere is a gate needed at the school entrance as there is nothing left but part of the frame of the one there at present.\n\nO.J. Silver,\nIndian Agent.\nGEORGIA ISLD. MINUTES OF COUNCIL MEETING HELD SEPTEMBER 18, 1939.\n\nRes. No. 8.\n\nMoved by Leslie McCue and seconded by Tom Porte and resolved that this council request the educational dept. to pay the sum of three dollars to Arthur Saleby for putting the school seats in and two dollars to Stewart McCue for the transportation from the beach to the school.\n\nCarried.\n\nSutton West, Sept. 22, 1939.\n\nThe new school seats were taken to the Island on the 12th inst. The old seats removed and the new ones placed and fastened down by Arthur Saleby. The Council recommend him being paid $3.00 for his work and Stewart McCue being paid $2.00 for taking the seats from the beach to the school.\n\nO. J. Silver,\nIndian Agent.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nTHE DIRECTOR\n\nI beg to submit the following report on my inspection of the Georgina and Snake Island Agency.\n\nThe one Day school on the reserve was visited on the 6th of September. There were 18 pupils present. Some families had not returned to the reserve for school opening.\n\nThe school building is in good condition, with the exception of the entrance steps which are badly worn and should be replaced. This could be done by an Indian for about $10.00.\n\nThe interior walls and ceiling should be painted; they are very dingy and depressing. The ceiling and walls three-quarter way up are metal-sheeted. The cost of material and labour would not exceed $75.00.\n\nThos. McGookin,\nInspector of Indian Agencies Ontario.\nGEORGINA ISLD.

Within the past few days a mixed breed of the St Regis band, Thomas Whitebear by name, whose address is Hogansburg, N.Y., has been recommended to me as a person well qualified to take charge of the Gibson school. Whitebear spent five years at the Mohawk Indian Institute, and another year at the French Institute in Montreal. He does not hold a Certificate, but is said to be well grounded in those branches that would need to be taught in a school like that at Gibson. He is also recommended as a man of unblemished character, and as the Iroquois is his mother tongue, it is thought that would recommend him to the people at Gibson. If the Department approves, the experiment might be tried for the remainder of this year. I understand that in certain cases the Department allows an examination before an Indian Agent or School Inspector on the strength of which, if successful, the party may obtain a Permit to teach an Indian school. Doubtless the Department can obtain direct information from the St Regis Reserve concerning this man.

But the majority of the children now on the roll, and nearly all of those of younger years, come from a settlement about two miles away. In rough weather or bad roads, it is impossible for these little ones to come to school.\n\nIn the midst of the latter settlement is the Methodist church, which the church authorities are open to the Department if they will use it for school purposes. The present request is that you will grant permission to the teacher to teach part of his time in the church and part of the time in the school, alternating, say half a day, a week or half a year, in each place, whichever is thought best.\n\nThe teacher agrees to this and thinks it...\nit will enable him to have larger or more regular attendance.\n\nThe parents of the little children near the church are so earnest in the matter that they agree to bear part of not all of the expense of the extra supplies that the change will require.\n\nPlease let us settle in brief.\n\nWe do not wish present school building touched.\n\nWe want to see all the children, especially the little ones, have a chance.\n\nThe church is open to us, let us use it.\n\nThe teacher is ready, yes, wishes to alternate his teaching.\n\nThen let us have some teaching at each place, time and amount settled by yourself.\n\nTrusting that you will give this matter your considerate attention, we are, dear sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nChief Napoleon Commandant\n\nE. Ferguson Young, Sup't, North Church\n\nThomas Whitebear, Teacher\nOttawa, February 5, 1906.\n\nChief,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of a petition signed by yourself and also by the Superintendent of the Methodist Church and the Teacher of your school, asking that your school be conducted for part of each year in the Methodist Church building on the reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that enquiry will be made into this matter, and you will be advised of the Department's decision.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nChief Napoleon Commandant,\nSahanatien, Ont.\nOttawa, February 5, 1906.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inclose herewith a copy of a letter received by the Department from Chief Napoleon Commandant, of the Gibson band, and signed also by the Superintendent of the Methodist Church and the Teacher of the school on the reserve, and I have to request that you will be good enough to report fully on the matter dealt with in this letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nW.

Commandant and several other head men of the band and have come to the conclusion that it would be advisable to make the change above referred to. I informed them, however, that I would not be in favor of making any change until after July 1st next. In making the proposed change I would suggest that the school be held in the Methodist Church from July 1st next to December 31st after which school would re-open at the schoolhouse for six months; in this way the winter weather would be about evenly divided between the two sections of the reserve. I informed the chief that the continuance of the proposed change would entirely depend upon the manner in which the children attended.\n\nIf my suggestion meets with your approval in this matter I will be pleased to receive your instructions and inform Chief Commandant that it has been decided to hold the school in the Methodist Church from July 1st to December 31st and from January 2nd to June 30th in the Schoolhouse.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nIndian Supt.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Second, any changes that have been made in regard to the school, such as holding the sessions half a year in the church and the other half in the schoolhouse, have been made without any reference, as far as I am aware, to this office, either by the missionary in charge or the Department.\n\nUnder existing arrangements between us and the Department it is our understanding that both school buildings and school furnishings are supplied by the Department. If the Rev. E. R. Young or Mr. Kendall undertook that the Indians should supply the necessary apparatus, it was done on their own initiative without any instructions from or correspondence with us.\n\nI would gladly help to straighten out the matter, but Mr. Young is no longer in that part of the country, having been moved, in accordance with the usual custom of our Church, to another charge. However, I will write to the Rev. C. W. Watch, Chairman of the District, resident at Huntsville, and will call his attention to the matter.\n\nHoping that everything may be satisfactorily arranged, I am, Your obedient servant,\n\nSecretary, Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sirs\u2014\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th inst., with reference to the arrangement for holding the school on the Gibson reserve alternately, for six months, in the school-house and in the church on the reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that on March 29, last, you were advised that the Department had agreed to this arrangement. Since writing you on the 5th inst., the Department has been advised by its Superintendent, Mr. Maclean, that he had instructed the Chief to have the desks and blackboards removed to the church in order that school might be held there, which probably has been done before this.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.

Sutherland, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMethodist Mission Rooms,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, September 19, 1906.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 3rd inst., I beg to say that the Department, as so far advised, is of opinion that the arrangement for holding the school alternately in the church and school-house is the most suitable that can be made, and, unless some good reasons can be shown to the contrary, this arrangement will have to stand.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nSimon Corinthe,\nand other Indians,\nSahaniation P. O.,\nOnt.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of Sep.19.1906.152195/1, we desire to lay before you the following reasons why the school at Gibson should be held in the school-house as heretofore:\n\n1. In 1884, month of December, we held a Council and examined the Reserve and found that the middle of the Reserve would be the place where the school-house is now built, and the nature of the Reserve has not changed since. The Government gave money to build the school there.\n\n2. As pupils have to walk to the school-house where it stands none have to walk more than 2\u00bd miles, and only one family that much.\n\n3. Now that the school is moved to the Church some have 3\u00bd miles to walk. Indians are not much interested in sending their children to school, and will not send them when they have to go long distances.\n\n4. Children who have not attended school for half a year owing to distance, will forget what they learned during the half-year they attended.\n\n5. We still ask that the Government Agent may attend our Council on Monday, Oct. 1st to speak mouth to mouth with us, as this alteration in school arrangements took place without consulting the Band.\n\nSigned on behalf of the petitioners of Aug.16.1906.\n\n[Signature]\nSimon Corinthe\nFran\u00e7ois Decaire\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6132, File 393-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nOttawa, September 28, 1906.\n\nThe Acting Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nWith reference to the matter referred to by Mr. Arnold, Barrister, in his letter addressed to the Hon. A. B. Amesworth, I beg to say that on January 26, last, a request was received, signed on behalf of many of the parents on the Gibson reserve by the Chief, Napoleon Commandant, N. Ryerson Young, Superintendent of the Methodist Church and Thomas Whitebeans, the teacher, asking that school be held for part of the year in the school-house, which is situated on lot 11, in the 5th concession, and for the balance of the year in the church on lot 13, in the 6th concession, the distance between these two points being a little over a mile and a-half.\n\nThis matter was referred to the local superintendent for report, who, after making enquiries, recommended that the request be granted and that the school be held in the church from July 1 to Dec. 31, and from Jan. 2 to June 30 in the school-house, and this recommendation was approved, conditional on the manner in which the children attended.\n\nOn the 16th ult. a petition was received from certain Indians of the reserve, protesting against the new arrangement. These Indians were informed that, in view of the facts as presented to the Department, the arrangement would have to stand. Further protest was received on the 6th inst. from Simon Corinthe and Francis Decaire, asking for an investigation into this matter.\nThey were told in reply that, unless some good reasons could be shown to the contrary, no change in the present arrangement could be made. On the 24th inst., these same Indians gave their reasons for their protest, which was based on the distance that some of the children would have to walk to attend school in the church, and they asked that a government official be authorized to attend the council to be held on the 1st prox. to discuss the situation.\n\nI find on referring to the old files in connection with the school on this reserve that, as far back as in 1892, the Indians petitioned to have the change made which has just been inaugurated, and Mr. Walton, who was then Indian Superintendent, reported that, while he was not sure that it would be advantageous to hold school for six months in the year in two different localities, he was of opinion that the church was the most centrally located place on the reserve for holding the school. The matter was allowed to stay in abeyance until the present time.\n\nUpon referring to the plan of the Indian reserve in the township of Gibson, I find that locations have been issued for certain lots from the 1st to the 11th concessions, the bulk of which locations are taken up north of the 6th concession. The number of children of school age on the reserve is given as about 40, and if the children are in proportion to the locations tickets issued, more than half that number would come from above the 6th concession. The enrolment for last year varied from 18 to 22, with an average attendance of 10. Upon referring to the accompanying blue print you will see that no matter in which place the school is held some of the children will have a considerable distance to walk.\nand as most of them come from north of the 6th concession\nthe larger number will benefit by having the school in\nthe church. For this reason I would suggest that the\npresent arrangement be given a fair trial.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Aylesworth,\nMinister of Justice,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\n\nDear Mr. Aylesworth:\n\nI have been consulted by some of the residents of the Gibson Indian Reserve respecting the Removal of the school House to the Methodist Church on the opposite end of the Reserve. The school House is located on lot number 10 between concessions 4 and 5 and as I am informed and believe from my knowledge of the locality, located in about the centre of the reserve. The residence of the teacher is on the opposite side of the road and near by the School House. The fartherest that any pupils have to walk to reach the School House is 2\u00bd miles and the average about 1\u00bc miles. On the other hand a few of the pupils have only about 1\u00bc mile to attend the School at the Methodist Church while the teacher has to travel two miles and some of the pupils as far as four miles. These being the facts it looks as if there had been some error of judgment or information by some person in authority authorizing the change. The matter has caused a great deal of discontent on the Reserve. The Indian Council Meets on the first Monday in October and they contemplate passing a resolution to transfer the School back again, which will no doubt make further friction. Will you kindly transfer this complaint to the proper Department of Indian affairs whereby it may be investigated and oblige?\n\nThanking you in anticipation,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

A. D.\nOttawa, September 29, 1906.\n\nDear Mr. Arnold,\n\nYour letter of the 21st inst., addressed to the Honourable Mr. Ayleworth, Minister of Justice, respecting the removal of the Gibson school from the school-house to the Methodist church has been transferred to this Department.\n\nIn connection with this matter I beg to say that the present arrangement for holding school six months in the year in the Methodist church and six months in the school-house was arrived at on representations made to the Department that a number of the younger children on the roll came from a settlement near the church and too far away to attend at the school-house, and that it would be only fair to give them an opportunity of obtaining some education.\n\nThere are about forty children of school age on this reserve, and, owing to the way the Indians\n\nO. M. Arnold, Esq.,\nBarrister, etc.,\nBracebridge, Ont.\nlocations are scattered over the reserve, it would not be possible to place a school-house where they could all be within a reasonable walking distance. This being the fact, the Department decided to accede to the request of certain Indians to try the experiment of having the school conducted from July to January in the church and from January to June in the school-house. The school-house will have the longest school term, as the holidays will come out of the church end.\n\nThe Indians have been pressing for this change for the last fifteen years, and as it was impracticable to have two separate schools on the reserve, the Department sanctioned this arrangement, which should work successfully, if it received the co-operation of all the Indians. Nearly all the Indians protesting against this arrangement are Indians who have no children of school age. Out of seventy-four locators on the reserve, forty have taken up land north of the fourth concession.\n\nTrusting these explanations will prove satisfactory, I remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nActing Deputy Supt.

As you are aware many of the Indians have been pressing for this change for a number of years, and as it is impracticable to have two schools on the reserve, the Department sanctioned this arrangement, which should work successfully if it receives the co-operation of the Indians.\n\nIt is noticed that nearly all the Indians protesting have no children of school age.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.D.

Permit me to say that the Indian Dept. has misunderstood to some extent in regard to those who are protesting against the new arrangement by virtue of their invalid presentations, owing to the so-called very scattered locations, and also in considering your letter I find that we had never applied in our requests for two schools but want only one school at the nearest to be the centre which will be at the school house.\n\nI hope you will fully satisfy or else have satisfied the statement, and nature which I have made through my friend Mr. O.M. Arnold, Barrie, Bradford, which I have no doubt he had recommended them to you and hope we will obtain satisfactory and generous answer.\n\nI remain\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrancis Decarie\n\nP.S. In your reply address to Bala P.O.\nSir,\n\nI take this opportunity to draw these few lines to you and to ask you a small favor, and trust that you are the officers appointed to look and consider after the interest and welfare of the Indians, especially in the line of education, and was indeed very surprised that the Indian Dept have so arranged to have the school held alternately in this Reserve without any investigating as to the nature of the Reserve neither consulting the majority of the Indians who have the most children of school age. I live on Lot No. 16 Con. 5 which is \u00bd mile from my place to the school house, and then from my place to the church are 3\u00bd miles, and have no satisfaction reason why the school should be removed to that distance. I had four children of school age, which the Indian have hindered to make little advance in the line of education, owing that the children cannot go to school all year round, on account of bad roads part in the winter, so they have only chance again to school while in good season, and in that consequence permit me to advise the Indian Dept to some step in more intelligent careful consideration, as it is the only way to relieve this complaint not only from me, but the majority of the Indians here.\n\nI am your obedient servant,\n\nPeter Stocks & White.\nSchool\n2 letters\nOttawa, October 23, 1906.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th inst., protesting, for the reasons stated therein, against the removal of the Gibson school from the old school-house to the church, and in reply I beg to say that, as it is only intended to hold the school alternately in the church and school-house, half the year at each place, the Department is not now prepared to disturb the present arrangement, as it considers it should be given a fair trial.\n\nUpon examining the map of the reserve and from information obtainable in the Department, it is considered that your children will not be inconvenienced by the change, as they are, if anything, nearer the church than the old school-house. We understand that there is a road leading almost directly from your lot to the church. Judging from the returns, which have been carefully examined, for the past two years, you have evidenced no anxiety for the education of your children, as their attendance has been most irregular at the old school-house. For some quarters none of your children attended at all, while for others the average was exceedingly small, and it is a question whether the Department will not be compelled to enforce the regulations in the case of your children.\n\nMr. Peter Stock,\ngahaniation P.

Hoping that the Indian Dept. will take steps in some way to change the arrangement.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\nPeter Stock\nD.A. McLean,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. McLean:\n\nReverting to your kind letter of September the 29th last respecting the complaint of certain Indians about removal of the School from the School House to the Methodist Church on the Gibson Reserve, I beg to say that I delayed acknowledging owing to waiting report from the Indians complaining. Enclosed herewith you will please receive an accurate statement of the children of school age as I was able to obtain. It shows where they reside and the distance each location is from the School House and from the Church. One child, daughter of Peter Stock, mentioned in the list has been sent to the Bala school by her father on account of it being too far from the Church. I am advised that the school-house is built on lot 11, concession 5 and that the Church is built on lot 13, concession 6. Louis White used to live on lot 12, concession 8 but now resides on lot 14, concession 6, having left his old place about ten years ago. I also enclose you a copy of the resolution passed by the Gibson Council on October the 6th, 1906. The change of the school has engendered a considerable amount of bad feeling between the Indians on the reserve that perhaps should be investigated by the Department before it leads to further trouble. I also enclose you a list of the Indians favorable to the School House and names of those favorable to the Church. Although outside of two or three families a comparison of the names submitted does not appear to show any considerable amount of injustice at the present arrangement I consider that the present state of feeling existing between the Indians over the matter warrants the Department in holding some further investigation with a view of terminating the dispute. The Indians opposing the Change are still pressing their point and in consequence I would be much pleased if you will kindly advise and say what steps, if any, the Department will take looking towards a better adjustment or at all events an amicable settlement of the dispute.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The school is ostensibly under the charge of the Rev. Mr. Kendall, the Missionary, but is actually taught by Miss Lucinda Jamieson, who, the Indians claim, is a failure.\n\nWhen the Rev. Mr. Perrier was in Ottawa lately, the inefficiency of this teacher was brought to his notice, and he suggested that, as he had not had an opportunity of visiting this reserve, you should be communicated with on the subject. The Department considers that Mr. Kendall should either teach the school himself or engage a competent teacher with higher qualifications than a High School Entrance certificate, which is all that Miss Jamieson holds, and would like you to take the necessary action to secure the services of a competent teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Dr. Sutherland, General Secretary of the Methodist Missionary Society, has been requested to secure the services of a competent teacher for this school.\n\nThe letter addressed to you by Ex-chief Desire is returned herewith.

Dr. Sutherland, General Secretary of the Methodist Missionary Society, in which he states that immediate steps will be taken to remedy the difficulty complained of at the Gibson school in regard to the inefficiency of the teacher.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean,\nSecretary.\n\nW. Wright, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\nBala, Ontario.\nJanuary 20, 1908.\n\nDear Dr. Sutherland,-\n\nI duly received your letter of the 17th instant. The Department appear to be under a misapprehension with regard to this school. Miss Jamieson has not been teaching since the end of last school year. The present teacher is Miss Margaret Smellie of Fergus, Ont., an excellent and superior young woman, (English Canadian) who holds a second class, non-professional certificate. I do not suppose the school has had a better teacher for many years.\n\nI consider that Miss Jamieson taught as well as a teacher holding a High School Entrance Certificate was likely to teach. The conclusion came to that the school was inefficient because certain Indians thought so seems a little open to objection. The Inspector did not visit the School during the school year 1906-7, and the opinion as to inefficiency does not appear to have been expressed by any person very competent to judge. Miss Jamieson was teaching at a time when there was considerable party feeling among the Indians regarding the removal of the school to and from the church, and the adverse reports arose out of this.\n\nThe Department should recognize that it is very difficult to secure a high class teacher for such a lonely place.\n\nThe Department would probably ascertain from the Inspector's last Report that the school equipment was poor, and they know from my Reports that the...\nbuilding is out of repair.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.) Wm. Kendall.\n\nThe Rev. Dr. Sutherland.\nDear Sir,\n\nOn receipt of your letter referring to the unsatisfactory state of the school on the Gibson Reserve, I wrote at once to the Rev. Mr. Kendall, missionary in charge, and have received his reply, a copy of which I enclose.\n\nTrusting that the information contained therein will be considered satisfactory,\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

A. Sutherland, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMethodist Missionary Society,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, July 29, 1906.\n\nRev. Sirs,\n\nIn connection with previous correspondence relative to the school on the Gibson reserve, I beg to say that the Department understands that Miss Smellie, who has successfully taught this school for some time, is leaving and that the Indians are sorry to lose her services.\n\nIf this information is correct, the Department would like to know if it would not be possible to retain Miss Smellie's services, as it is a difficult matter to secure a competent teacher for such an isolated locality. As Mr. Kendall is not actually teaching this school, the Department considers it should at least be consulted in regard to the appointment or dismissal of teachers.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev.

In so small a Reserve as that of Gibson we expect the missionary to teach the school as well as conduct the various religious services. Mr. Kendall was aware of this, but desiring to devote all his time to the religious side of the work, and being a man of some means, he engaged a competent teacher who received the salary paid by the Department, and Mr. Kendall's income was reduced by that amount.\n\nAt the present time Mr. Kendall is on the ocean, having been called to England by the serious illness of his mother, but I will communicate at once with the Chairman of the District and will do the best I can to have Miss Smellie continue in charge of the school.

Sutherland, D.D.,\nToronto.\n\nDear Dr. -\n\nI am enclosing with this the application of Miss Robbins for the position of teacher at Gibson, also her testimonials I have wired her not to report for work until September 15th as the doctor has had all services withdrawn now for some time owing to diptheria on the Reserve and he has notified me that the school must not open until the 15th.\n\nI understand the difficulties re appointment of teachers but the securing of a second-class professional is out of the question. In fact I would be pleased to be freed from all responsibility re the engagement. Miss Robbins is the only teacher in view who has had any experience, and the Inspector who called on me to-day in relation to the school, was pleased she had accepted, but said he was very much surprised she was willing to go into the Reserve. There are no scholars in advance of the Third Book, and the isolation is trying on any person. Mr. Powell, the Inspector, said, A Second-class teacher was certainly out of the question. No such teacher could be secured for less than $450.00, and they had never had such a teacher. Miss Smellie had no certificate at all, simply a permit. This is the same as Miss Robbins. I might say Miss Robbins has proceed in High School very near to Junior leaving standard.\n\nI should like very much to know if I am to retain Miss Robbins. If not, I suppose I shall have to compensate her in some way, for I have really engaged her knowing to difficulty of securing teachers. To have waited to have forwarded the application would have prevented the engagement.\n\nIn our town school after much advertising and offering $400.00 salary upon the receipt of the first application, the person was wired an engagement for fear she would accept another position.\n\nPlease let me hear early.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd.)

Toronto, September 1st, 1908.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe Teacher Gibson Indian School.\n\nI have been advertising in several papers and corresponding in different directions with a view to securing a competent teacher for the above school, and the most promising application I have received is that of Miss Mary E. Robbins of Fairholm, Ontario, whose testimonials I enclose, and also a letter from the Rev. C. W. Watch, of Huntsville, Ontario, commending her case to favorable consideration. I also received a letter from Mr. Watch mentioning various reasons why he did not think it advisable that the former teacher should be continued. As to qualifications the former teacher and the present applicant are upon an exact equality; that is to say, neither of them hold a certificate from any recognized institution, and as Miss Smellie taught under a permit, the same authority would have to be given in Miss Robbins' case should she be appointed. You will notice in the letter from the Rev. Mr. Watch, a statement of his conviction that it is simply impossible to secure a teacher holding a second-class professional certificate for the salary which is now paid. It is evident from Miss Robbins' testimonials that she has given good satisfaction to the trustees of schools where she has taught, and I trust the Department will consent to her employment at Gibson, at least for the time being until we can reach some arrangement whereby it will be possible to secure teachers of a higher grade.\n\nTrusting that this result may be reached in the not distant future, I am,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nGeneral Secty.\n\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 8, 1908.\n\nRev.

I may also remind you that in the appointment of the new teacher at Saugeen, whose case as regards qualifications is precisely parallel with that of Miss Robins, has been promised a salary of $375 (Three Hundred and Seventy-Five Dollars).

In the meantime a Miss Antoine, a member of one of the families on the Reserve, has been put in charge of the school. She is not a qualified teacher but it appears to have been the only arrangement practicable at the time. In view of this fresh outbreak of the disease you may deem it advisable to close the school for a time; if so I will communicate at once with the missionary in charge on receiving instructions from the Department.\n\nI am your obedient servant,\n\nA.

A.

C. W. Watch of Huntsville, Ontario, conveying the information that Miss Robbins, who had been for some little time teacher of the Indian School had suddenly made up her mind to give up the post. I enclose a copy of her letter to Mr. Watch from which you will see that the ostensible reason for deserting her post so suddenly is a report which had reached her to the effect that Chief Commandant had written to the Missionary Society accusing her of faults, with the object, she believes, of securing her dismissal, and the re-appointment of Miss Smellie. No communication from Chief Commandant has reached the Mission Rooms, though for aught I know he may have written to the Department on some such line as Miss Robbins supposes. It is evident, however, that she is influenced by other reasons, some of which are not specifically mentioned, and it would be useless to retain the services of a teacher who is so completely dissatisfied with her position.\n\nI also enclose a letter from Miss Mary L. Decaire, a daughter, I believe, of the former chief, applying for the position of teacher. I have no information respecting her qualifications except what is supplied by Miss Robbins and by Miss Decaire's own letter. The latter indicates that her knowledge of English is very defective, and if it is deemed advisable to employ her at all, I think it should be only as a temporary supply until we can make better arrangements.\n\nI will be glad to be informed what you think of this suggestion, and in the meantime will do my best to find a fully qualified teacher who may be sent with the approval of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, Ont.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Watch,\nHuntsville, Musk.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI scarcely know how to begin this letter but I may as well tell you at once that I am leaving the Gibson Reserve School on Friday prox. I am sorry I could not let you know sooner but I did not make up my mind until to-day, but as there was no agreement to stay a stated time after giving my resignation, I am not breaking my word. I sincerely hope that you will have no trouble in getting a teacher at once to take my place, Miss Decaire, who has a fair education besides a business College course, and who has had a little experience in teaching is willing to take the school till Easter providing you are willing. I think I can recommend her to be a good substitute. She is writing you by this mail and I think she would take the school at once if it is agreeable to you and all concerned. I came back here to teach at the New Year and thought I could content myself till 1st of July. Just this week I heard that Mr. Commandant, the Chief had written to the Missionary Society accusing me of faults of which I am not cognizant, in order to get Miss Smellie, (their former teacher) here again. I have conscientiously tried to do my best since coming here and I feel that I could not put up with unjust accusations from anyone, not even the chief. Then another \"con\" is that I am boarding too far from the school and could not walk that distance in the winter. Decaires, (where I board) have been as kind to me as I could wish them to be, but I thought I was going to board at the Parsonage, or I believe\nI would not have come at all. I understood my salary would be $300 a year at the rate of $30 a month for ten months. Well I only receive $25 a month, and, as yet have not received my salary for the last three months' tuition. I would not mind waiting a week for it but I do not like to wait a month. I had no idea that circumstance would be as they are, when I decided to return in Jan. I am not blaming you for anything Mr. Watch for you have been very kind to me, but I have written all this just to let you know how I feel about it for I thought an explanation was due you.\n\nI just feel that I cannot stay longer than this week, and I will try to get a school among white people as soon as possible, but never among Indians again.\n\nWith many thanks for past kindness, I will close.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n(Sdg.)

George Albert Snider.\n\nDate March 1st, 1909.\nDear Sir,\n\nOn the 21st of January last I wrote you respecting the resignation of the teacher of the Indian School on the Gibson Reserve, and suggested the temporary employment of Miss Mary L. Decaire, until we could find a competent teacher. In due course I received your reply, dated January 27th, No. 152195/1 requesting me to use my own judgment as to the temporary filling of the vacancy. I communicated these facts to the Rev. C. W. Watch, of Huntsville, who has oversight of the work in that District, and subsequently sent him an application from Mr. George Snider, of Napanee, enquiring, at the same time, if he considered the qualifications of this teacher as suitable for the Gibson School.\n\nI have a letter from Mr. Watch this morning in which the following occurs:\n\nMr. Snider's standing appears to be all right, but you may judge of my surprise when I reached Gibson to find that the Indian Agent had sent in a teacher on the Friday before. He had been advertising in the \"Globe\" and had secured a Miss Maud C. Forrest, aged nineteen, holding a district permit, had never attended even a model-school. I saw his letter appointing her at $300 (Three Hundred Dollars) a year. I judged it best not to say anything but report the matter to you.\"\n\nMr. Watch is of the opinion that a married teacher would be best for Gibson, and I quite concur in that opinion if one can be found possessing suitable qualifications. In the meantime I enclose a copy of Mr. George Snider's (of Napanee) application from which you may judge of his qualifications. In view of Miss Forrest's age and want of training I can hardly suppose that she will be regarded as permanent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6132, File 393-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nMemo.\n\nThe teacher of the Gibson Indian school resigned in the early part of January, last, and on the 27th of that month Dr. Sutherland was written to and asked to try to secure the services of a competent teacher.\n\nHe received an application from Mr. Snider, who, judging from his certificates and experience, should be a capable teacher. He is also a married man.\n\nIn the meantime the Superintendent, Mr. Macdonald, advertised in the Globe for a teacher and subsequently engaged Miss Forrest. She is young, nineteen years of age, and inexperienced. This action was taken by the Supt. without any authority. He is evidently unaware that the nomination of a teacher for this school rests with the Methodist Church, and in any event he exceeded his powers.\n\nThe last paragraph of Dr. Sutherland's letter intimates that the Department will probably consider Miss Forrest's appointment as only temporary. The question arises as to what extent the action of the Supt. has compromised the Department. I think we could hardly dispense with her services before, say, June 30, next. I would suggest that Dr. Sutherland be written to and asked to ascertain whether Mr. Snider's services would be available to take charge of the school after the summer holidays and, if so, notice then then be given Miss Forrest.\n\nAffairs at this school have not been satisfactory for\nsome time and it would appear a pity to lose the opportunity of getting an experienced male teacher, who, being a married man, would in all probability be more permanent.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department regrets that he made this appointment without consulting with you but it does not propose to be bound by his action only in so far as may be necessary to deal justly with Miss Forrest.\n\nIt would appear that Mr. Snider is a suitable man for the position and the Department would like to know when it was intended that he should take charge of the school, as some satisfactory arrangement can no doubt be made with Miss Forrest to give up the school when he is ready to take charge.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev.

Forrest as teacher of the Gibson Indian school.\n\nIn this connection I beg to say that action ought not to have been taken by you without consulting the Department. As you are aware this school is conducted under the auspices of the Methodist Church and the prerogative of nominating a teacher rests with that body.\n\nRev. Dr. Sutherland has received an application from a Mr. Snider, who is a qualified and experienced teacher and a married man, and the Department is favourable to his appointment.

In the evening the young people wanted a dance but Mrs. Kendall, the minister's wife, would not allow it; So they engaged a house nearby. I was the chief's daughter and all the young people on the road to go when Mrs. Kendall ran out and told me if I danced she would report me to Mr. Watch. I could not go back in the\nhouse after she called out in that way. So we went to the dance and enjoyed ourselves. This morning she wrote to Mr. Watch telling him that I can't stay any longer. I know he will do all he can to put me away, for he did not seem pleased to think you engaged a teacher without his consent.\n\nThe chief is going to write to you about this, Mrs. Kendall is always causing trouble with the teachers. She wants to run the school, and besides she is not a truthful woman as I have found out.\n\nI hope you will do all you can to help me, and I don't think you will consider my error of much account. I am a Presbyterian and am fond of dancing.\n\nYou will please excuse my hurry, as this has to go with Mrs. Kendall's letter to Mr. Watch. I am with the chief just now. They are determined to defeat Mrs. Kendall in this. I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\nMaude E. Forrest.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of March 26th.\n\nI beg to inform you that I am in receipt of a letter from Miss Hannah Forrest, teacher of the Gibson School. She states that she holds no Provincial Certificate. She has a District Certificate. She taught in the autumn of 1906 at Brown's 13th. She taught the full season of 1907 at Manawaska, and the year of 1908 she taught the full term or season at Gooderham. She will be nineteen years old in July 1909. Presbyterian in religion.\n\nI may say that a degree of unpleasantness has sprung up between Mr. Wm Kendall and Mr. Keech. Mr. Kendall is the Methodist Missionary and is absent at present.\n\nI enclose you the correspondence in the meantime.

Dr. Sutherland in reference to securing the services of a competent teacher for this reserve.\n\nDr. Sutherland was advised of the situation and expressed his willingness that Miss Forrest should remain on till the end of the school year, June 30, next. This arrangement was apparently satisfactory.\n\nThe correspondence forwarded by the Supt. indicates that trouble has arisen between the teacher and the wife of the resident missionary, Rev. Mr. Kendall, which will most likely result in the teacher's resignation being sent in, necessitating the closing of the school or the employment of an uneducated Indian boy. The whole trouble on this reserve seems to be that the resident missionary is married to an Indian woman, who makes herself most officious and overbearing. Mr. Kendall, although not actively engaged in the school work, is nominally the teacher. He signs the returns and draws the salary. It is time that\nanomalous state of affairs should end and that the offices of teacher and missionary should be separated.\n\nThere is nothing in the correspondence that would justify the Department in calling for Miss Forrest's resignation and rather than that the school should be closed it would be well to ask her to remain on till the end of the quarter and the Methodist Church should be requested to nominate a teacher whose time would be devoted to that work alone, to take charge after the summer holidays.\n\nMartin Butler\nOttawa, April 30, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th inst., with enclosures, in reference to the Gibson school, and in reply I beg to say that the correspondence would not justify the Department in calling for Miss Forrest's resignation. In fact, it would be glad if she would remain in charge of the school at least till the end of the current quarter, and you will be good enough to advise her accordingly.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nH.D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nD.F. Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nMy dear Sir,\n\nIn a communication just received from Rev. C. W. Watch, of Huntsville, who has the oversight of the Indian Mission at Gibson, he informs me that Miss Forrest, the teacher recently appointed, has given him a month's notice of her intention to leave the school. Knowing the disadvantage it would be to the school to be left even for a time without a teacher, Mr. Watch has asked Miss Forrest to continue teaching, if possible, till the end of the school year. In taking this course Mr. Watch has no intention whatever of interfering with the action of the Indian Agent, but is simply trying to meet an emergency that has arisen.\n\nWe are obtaining information wherever possible with the hope that in due time we may be able to submit a name to the Department that will be in all respects satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, April 23, 1908.\n\nRev. Sir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th inst. with reference to the Gibson school, and in reply I beg to say that, before your communication was filed, the Department had written Mr. Superintendent Macdonald to the effect that it would be glad if Miss Ferrest would remain in charge of the school till the end of the current quarter.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. A. Sutherland, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMethodist Missionary Society,\nToronto, Ont.\nSahanatien, Apr. 5th.\n\nAt the council held Apr. 5th by the Indians of Watha Band the following resolution was moved by Napoleon Commandant and seconded by John White and carried.\n\nThat Mr. Macdonald (Agent) should come and settle a school trouble.\n\nNapoleon Commandant\n\nChief\n\nNote. Mr. and Mrs. Kendall, are the only persons that are dissatisfied with the present teacher on account of her enjoying herself at a private dance at a wedding. Suggest to Miss Forest by letter that she had better send in her resignation but the Chief and many more are in favor of her staying.\n\nIndian Affairs.
