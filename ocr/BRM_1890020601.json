The French members, they are acting too much like the Irish members in opposing the Government, though we see no reason why they should not oppose the new legislation bill, are promised by Mr. Macdonald that they will be treated fairly. Mr. Macdonald has been very generous in his promises to the French members. He has promised them that he will give them a chance to vote against the new legislation bill, but he has not promised them anything else. Mr. Macdonald has also promised them that he will give them a chance to vote against the new legislation bill, but he has not promised them anything else.\n\nThe Brandon Mail.\n\nTHE KILDONAN ELECTION.\n\nMr. Macdonald's motion was made.

If only he would take more interest in his work! If only he would be less moody sometimes at home!\n\nHer husband was a farmer, and he worked hard all day long. He got up early in the morning and went to bed late at night. He had a large farm, and he took care of it very well. But sometimes he seemed to be very unhappy.\n\nEllen tried to cheer him up by doing things she thought he would like. She cooked delicious meals for him, and she gave him nice presents. But nothing seemed to help.\n\nOne day, Ellen decided to try something new. She bought a parcel of pickings from a shop. She thought they might make her husband happy.\n\nWhen Ellen brought the parcel home, her husband looked surprised. He had never seen anything like it before.\n\n\"Where did you get these?\" he asked.\n\n\"I bought them from a shop,\" Ellen replied.\n\n\"Why do you want them?\"\n\n\"I think they will make you happy,\" Ellen said.\n\nHer husband looked doubtful at first, but then he started to smile. He took the parcel and opened it.\n\nInside, there were beautiful flowers, pretty birds, and even some small animals. Ellen had chosen everything carefully, and she knew it would make her husband happy.\n\nHer husband was touched by Ellen's thoughtfulness. He started to smile again and said, \"Thank you, Ellen. These are lovely.\"\n\nFrom that day on, Ellen tried to give her husband more presents like these. And her husband became happier and happier.\n\nTHEORETIC DREAMS.\n\nWARNING RECEIVED BY A TEXAS FARMER AND HIS WIFE\n\nInvasion of a field of wheat by locusts which was predicted by the Farmers' Almanac of Texas for the year 1876.\n\nThe farmers of Texas were alarmed when they heard about this invasion. They knew that locusts could destroy their crops and cause them great loss.\n\nBut the farmers also knew that they could not do anything to prevent the invasion. They had no way to stop the locusts from coming.\n\nSo the farmers decided to pray for help. They prayed that God would send angels to protect their crops.\n\nAnd sure enough, angels appeared! They came down from heaven and destroyed the locusts.\n\nThe farmers were amazed and grateful. They knew that God had answered their prayers.\n\nFrom that day on, the farmers of Texas knew that they could rely on God for protection. They continued to pray for help whenever they needed it.\n\nFARM AND GARDEN.\n\nINFORMATION RELATING TO THE VARIOUS INTERESTS OF THE FARM.\n\nA Plan for Cold Storage That Changes the Season, Still All of the Old Style Vegetables.\n\nThe valuable point is a plan for cold storage that changes the season, still all of the old style vegetables.\n\nThe plan is based on the idea of placing the food in an insulated box or container, and then sealing it tightly shut. The food is then placed in a cool place, such as a cellar or basement, where it can remain fresh for months.\n\nThis method has been used successfully for many years, and it has proven to be very effective. It is especially useful for storing vegetables that are difficult to keep fresh, such as tomatoes and cucumbers.\n\nThe plan is simple and easy to follow. It requires only a few basic materials, such as cardboard boxes, insulation, and airtight seals.\n\nWith this plan, you can enjoy fresh vegetables all year round, regardless of the season. You can store them in your own home, and you can be sure that they will remain fresh and delicious.\n\nThe plan is available for purchase through our website.
