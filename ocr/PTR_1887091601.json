We may say at once that such a commission will not be set until a settlement of the question has been reached. While the commission is about it why should it not be set up to power to take up the question of extraterritorial settlement also? These subjects have been before the people of the two countries long enough. As for the fishermen, there are more fish in the sea than will ever be caught, just as for the Indians there is plenty of land. The only reason for not handling them over to the courts of their own country. A defaulter who came out from his native land, by the sale of so doing furnishes prima facie evidence of his guilt. If he were not guilty he would not need to become a fugitive from justice. Settle the fisheries question, settle the commerce law, and establish close commercial relations between the two countries, and then this talk of annexation will come to an end.\n\nIn one of the English magazines Mr. Gladstone makes some calculations of interest to the Liberal party\u2014the object being to show that the country is turning its face more and more towards Liberalism, and that the present reaction is simply a Liberal triumph. Mr. Gladstone is always sanguine. It is this quality that so largely commends him to his followers. If he were not to be convinced by the facts showing that the tide of the picture spread on the bright side they would desert him in shoals, so heavy are the demands he makes upon their loyalty to himself by allying themselves to his cause. Take Irish Bills as an example. These were swallowed by the Liberal party mainly because they were Mr. Gladstone's. Any body else who had made such a proposal the Liberals would have been hooted out of public life. His desire is said to be wind up his career by settling the Irish question. He fails to see that he has laid down, but it is quite evident that at his time of life he cannot expect to live to see the effect of the settlement. Two things the Irish agitation has done\u2014deprived Ireland of her landlord out of the country, and the other to put an end to English rule in Ireland. Is this not rather more than they have a right to expect?\n\nEnglish visitors all speak highly of Canada and her trans-continental railway. They come over expecting to find this a sparsely settled country with a simple state of railways running through it, and the most flourishing cities and railways running in all directions. To most of them, when they take as in with their single eye glass, Canada is a revelation, and they do not hesitate to express their astonishment at the progress the country has made. But why should it not make progress? It is peopled by men and women of hardy growth, who are fond of adventure, in a country which any country must well look forward with hopeful expectation. There is probably no country on earth where the comfort of life are so generally distributed as in the Canadian States. Here are millions of millionaires. We do not need them, and the sentiment expressed by one of themselves the other day that the time will come when it will be a reflection on a man to be very rich will prevail, and the result will be the end most that a good harvest is a matter of vital concern.\n\nThe summer has been short but too short most people think. But it must not be assumed that summer is short because of a few cool days. There will be warm weather yet. The finest months in the year of our Canadian climate are still before us. November cannot be more charming than September and October. The reports of the crop prospects are not peculiarly gratifying, except as regards the Northwest, where the crops are reported good. The early frosts have usually managed to arrive in time to do no end of mischief, but this year they have been anticipated. So much depends on the weather, and many farmers have all they can do to make both ends meet, that a good harvest is a matter of vital concern.\n\nCall and inspect our improved Heating Drums\n\nStoves and Stovepipes put up and cleaned on short notice\n\nPanel Doors and Sash,\n\nAT\n\nT.

Heydges, vice-President of the Macdonald and North-Western Railway Company, visited the farm from Edmonton where he has been for some months past in connection with railway and colonization matters. Mr. Heydges said that he had been successful in the object of his visit, which was to see the land and find a location for a town site. He has also been engaged in buying up land for the purpose of purchasing lands and establishing a settlement. The company has approved of the Minister of the Interior's plan for the settlement of the land. The company will be careful not to make any settlement until such time as the land can be purchased at a reasonable price.

They\nrefused to go and pulled their guns on\nthe cowboys, but the latter shot one of\nthe Indians dead and wounded another. Trouble is feared in conse-\nquence, and fifty police, twenty-five of\nwhom are mounted, are being sent to\nrealizus to march for the Blackfoot Crossing at a moment's notice.\u2014McLeod (Calgary).\n\nThe following in reference to Gabriel\nis taken from the Fargo County (Montan-\nta) Argus: \"Gabriel Pummett returned\nto Lawrence county, where he resides in\nthe upper country. Whatever his mission\nwas he has accomplished it. We have\nheard it said that he was trying to gather\nsome followers to make a raid. It is\nnot to be supposed that he is among\nthe half-breeds and he cannot make\nthem off with his herd, and proceed he\ncan with his herd. He has had enough\nmoney out of the half-breeds to purchase\na herd and a cart and will start soon for\nFort Benton. He expects to join the Wild West show\nlatter fall. It will be remembered\nthat Dumas was here last fall, but he did not dare\nventure on British soil, so remained at\nhome. Gabriel Pummett will go along\nwith him without much work, but\nlosing prestige among the half-breeds, and,\nindeed, a harmless character.\"\n\nA NORTHWEST MUSEUM.\n\nThe Historical Society has done a wise thing in purchasing the Hudson\nBay Company new assembly hall for\nreception at its noon, this afternoon.\nThe museum, especially those whose\nroots are situated in the far north and\nnorthwest, will splendid opportunities\nfor historical missions and specimens\nof geological, botanical and ethnological\ninterest. The members of the society\nare acquainted with many facts regard-\ning the history of the Northwest which might\nbe brought to light through such a\nmuseum and would be of great value\nto the students of the subject. The\nHudson Bay factors furnished the institute\nwith one of its most valuable collections,\nespecially those relating to the\nNorthwest. Indeed, the Smithsonian\nInstitute contains the only complete\ncollection of Hudson Bay artifacts on\nthe continent, and Canadians have to\ngo to Washington to properly study the\nsubject. The museum will be of great\nvalue to the students of the subject in\nthe country. The Hudson Bay officers\nwere without doubt but only too glad\nto assist the Historical Society in such an\nobject instead of sending their appear-\nances to United States museums.\n\nAnd what a fine record which this\ninstitute has made which will illustrate\nmore clearly than any other how\nWashington collection is simply because\nthere is nothing in the Northwest which would\nappreciate their donations.\u2014Calif.\n\nAnxious to Mention.\u2014Are you distur-\nbed at night and broken up of your rest by\nthe noise of the children?
