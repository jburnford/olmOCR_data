L. BRYDGES, Land Commissioner.\nSudden Death.\n\nWald was brought to death on Sunday morning by Mr. Joseph McPhail, who lives in Prince Albert. He was a neighbour of the man of Oliver, whose body was found near the latter's residence Saturday afternoon, by some neighbour named Mr. Porter. The body was carried into the deceased's house by Mr. Porter, and placed in the same place where it was found in the initial period. On Monday morning, Mr. Porter, accompanied by Mr. Oliver, went out with the other officers of the Lodge, to make a search for the missing member, to ensure him the particulars of the proceedings. It appears that the deceased had been suffering from an affection of the heart, and for that reason he had been sent to Mr. Porter. There seems to be no doubt that while engaged about his work, he fell down and died, which, as stated, proved fatal. The effects of the fall were immediately perceived in the members of the party present, who immediately called for assistance, but the deceased died entirely alone and without any apparent struggle. Mr. Porter will administer all affairs until his brother, Mr. John C. Oliver, number three, returns from the United States. The funeral of the late Mr. Oliver, who died at the age of thirty-three years, took place this afternoon at the Presbyterian Cemetery, with Masonic honours.\n\nItems of Interest.\n\nThe German police have got possession of some of Hartmann's communications from Nitidus, which are now being subjected to the German censorship.\n\nMr. Macdonald has received correspondence touching leases or coal lands in the North West, and statements of payments made and amounts owing.\n\nIt is probable that during the session of the Legislature, the question of the extension of the Portage Westward will be discussed.
