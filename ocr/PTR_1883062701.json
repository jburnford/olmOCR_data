DONALDSON, Prop.\n\nCOMMUNICATION\nQUEEN'S BIRTHDAY SPEECH\nTo the Editor of The Times.\n\nSir,-In a former letter I simply noted\nfrom the press that there was dissatisfaction\nwhich seemed to exist in connection with the\nlate 24th of May sports, and as the\nname of Mr. Alexander Taylor was mentioned\nin the honesty of every member of that\ncommittee. Judge then of my surprise\nto receive a communication from Mr. Taylor\nwhich will have no doubt in the mind of\nany one that for some unknown reason\nthe committee did not want to publish\nthe statement made by him. Had he\nnot been silent would they not have waited\nfor the name of anyone before doing\nthe thing? If the committee had been\ncollectors and expenditures have been\nbalanced why not publish the fact as a curi-\nosity? But the silence of the committee\nof Mr. Alexander's name being known\nwill not excuse the committee from\nresponsibility. If the shoe does pinch, let a meeting be\ncalled and let each collector be charged\nwith having been the sole cause of the\nsports and for the benefit of the public.\nTo the front.\n\nBoots and Shoes.\n\nShannon & McLeod,\nBoot and Shoemakers.\n\nHave opened out in Morrison & Morrison's\nold store building, where we will be\npleased to see the residents of Prince\nAlbert and surrounding district, and by\nstrict adherence to honesty, hope to gain\na share of their patronage.\n\nWe expect our stock of Ready Made Boots\nand Shoes to arrive in about two weeks.\n\nSHANNON & MCLEOD,\nFirst door east of Campbell's\nBlock.\n\nA.
