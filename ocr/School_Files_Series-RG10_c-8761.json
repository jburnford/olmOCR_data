The Department wishes you to purchase the highest grade cedar shingles from the Alberni Pacific Lumber Co., of Port Alberni. I trust that these can be secured at $4. per thousand. You should also arrange to have them hauled to the school, at an estimated cost of $36. You may also purchase, to the best advantage, the galvanized nails, flashing and gutter material, as well as the material for scaffolding, etc., as mentioned in your Estimate No. 1, which you enclosed. You may engage Mr. L. A. Pinco, of Alberni, to lay the shingles by contract. You should offer him $2.50 per thousand. You may also arrange to have the shingles dipped in linseed oil at $2 per thousand. Mr. Pinco should be offered this work as well.\n\nThe Department relies on you to arrange for this work at your earliest convenience and trusts that you will be able to keep the cost within your estimate of $1182.80.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

This tank is not functioning and needs prompt attention, as it may cause further trouble by backing up and blocking the main drain.\n\nThe tank is approximately 21 x 6 x 6 feet and is believed to be divided into 3 sections, 2 of which have man holes with covers. The center section (if the tank is in 3 sections) having no man hole; the first or intake section contains nearly 5 feet of concealed solids; the third or outlet section contains about 3 feet of solids through which it is difficult to force a measuring stick. Waste water from the school is passing through the tank without changing colour.\n\nAll the water from the laundry, baths and toilets as well as the rainfall from some portion of the roof is turned into this tank. Of the latter detail I am not certain as there is no plan showing where the down pipes lead to.\n\nI am of the opinion that the failure of the septic tank to function properly is due to the excessive quantity of water that is passing into it. This trouble is not new but the tank has been kept in operation by occasional flushings with the fire hose while agitated, but I am afraid that remedy will not work in the present instance owing to the density of the matter now congregated.\n\nThe reason this matter is being referred to you is that it is considered inadvisable to take the time to refer the matter to Ottawa before some steps are taken to help the condition.\n\nYour instructions are requested please as to what steps are to be taken as the cost of remedying the matter cannot be estimated except by some person who is qualified to judge the cause and remedy it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"E. H. Frost\"\nIndian Agent.\n\nW. B. Ditchburn Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nVictoria, B. C.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nP. O. BOX 666\nVICTORIA, B.C.\n\nMarch 27, 1930\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am attaching hereto for your information copy of a letter just received from Mr. Indian Agent Frost, of Fort Alberni, with regard to the septic tank system in connection with the Alberni Indian Residential School which it is explained is not functioning properly, giving considerable trouble.\n\nAs this matter required immediate attention I have asked Mr. Webb, of the Dominion Water Purification Reclamation Branch, to have one of his staff proceed to the school without delay and make an examination of the system to see what the trouble is and if necessary to afford any immediate relief that he may deem proper and to let me know at as early date as possible as to what the cost will be to put this system in proper shape. I will then inform you by wire and request that authority be given to have the necessary work undertaken.\n\nApparently, the trouble seems to have been caused by allowing all the rainwater from the roofs as well as the water from the laundry and baths to go through the septic tank with that from the toilets which, I understand, is not the proper thing to do if such systems are to function properly. At the Kamloops, Lytton and Alert Bay Schools, I believe they have a separate drainage system for the carrying away of the water from the laundry, rainwater from the roof and the baths and only that coming from the toilets is allowed to enter the septic tanks. It may, therefore, be that the Engineer in his report will state a separate drainage system should be constructed at the Alberni School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. E. Ditchburn\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\n\nEnclosure:\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI am advised by Mr. Webb, our District Chief Engineer at Vancouver, that he has been asked by Mr. Birchburn to make an examination and report of the sewerage disposal system at the Port Alberni Indian school.\n\nA preliminary examination has been made and it has been found necessary in the first place to have the septic tank cleaned out and a temporary cesspool constructed to serve while the septic tank is out of commission. A report will be prepared recommending certain changes in order that the system may function satisfactorily in the future. In order to do this, Mr. Webb asks to be supplied with any plans that may be available showing details of septic tank installation and particularly the disposal of roof drainage. From the examination made it would appear that some of the roof drainage may pass through the septic tank, greatly over-taxing its capacity in rainy weather. Mr. Webb states that there is no way of determining this definitely on the ground without digging up the drains.\n\nI shall be obliged therefore if you will supply me with copies of any plans showing the information requested for transmission to Mr. Webb.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nPer\n\nA.F.

On March 25th I went to Alberni School and examined the tank and found it out of action and in my opinion needing immediate attention. I notified Mr. Commissioner W.E. Ditchburn of the condition of the tank and my opinion of its needing immediate attention to prevent it causing obstruction in the main sewer and causing greater trouble. On March 30th Mr. A.L. McNaughton, an Engineer of the Dominion Government Water Department arrived in Alberni and on 31st examined the tanks and verified my opinion of its need, his estimate of the details of work needed and the approximate cost, including rate of wage paid for such work in Victoria and Vancouver. On receiving Mr. McNaughton's estimates I phoned Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn for authority to have the work done, this was given and work was commenced on 1st instant.\n\nMr. McNaughton stated that $6.00 per day was usually paid for such work and estimated the cost of cleaning and putting the tank in order (without renewing internal fittings if that is found necessary) at $200.00.\n\nA competent sewer worker was obtained at a wage of 75 cents per hour and an assistant at $4.50 per day or 56 cents per hour, and work was commenced on 1st instant and is progressing satisfactorily.\n\nTime sheet for week ended April 5th for work on the above mentioned repairs is enclosed herewith.\n\nEnc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent.\n| Name          | Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Sat | Total |\n|---------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-------|\n| G.T.

Randall and M. Clauson.\n\nI beg to advise the Department that the work as ordered by Mr. A.M. McNaughton, Dominion Waterworks Department Engineer has been completed, pending the decision of the Department on the suggested new sewer for flush sewage.\n\nThe Engineer's estimated cost of putting the tank in order was $200.00, but did not include some new fittings for the tank flush valve, uncovering about 90 feet of the overflow or outlet sewer (which was found choked), removing the drain tiles and relaying them in a temporary sewer, or the survey of a line for the proposed new outlet sewer.\n\nThe temporary outlet sewer is satisfactorily taking the flush sewage, and the permanent is in operation.\n\nThe expenditure to date on the work is as follows:\n\n| Item                                      | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Lumber for emergency tank                 | $28.42 |\n| Spikes and nails for same                 | 1.13   |\n| Tools for clearing tank                   | 10.70  |\n| Plumbing fittings (estimated, no bill)    | 6.00   |\n| Labour, tank and drain work               | 174.28 |\n| Chainman to assist Engineer               | 4.00   |\n| **Total**                                 | **$21.53** |\n\nThe emergency tank and drain connecting with permanent tank will be serviceable for at least 12 years when it is necessary to clean permanent tank, and tools representing a present value of $10.00 can be retained and stored for future use.\n\nThe extra work on drains not provided for in the Engineer's estimates, necessitated by finding the drains choked, was 4 days by two men at a cost of $40.00, so that the Engineer's estimates for known work were slightly over the actual cost.\n\nEnc,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Both the settling chamber and the syphon chamber were found to be in this condition. As it was, of course, impossible for the automatic syphon to function, all the liquid part of the sewage was flowing over the surface of the sludge and out through the emergency overflow pipe. At some time previous to my visit this pipe had been broken off and the sewage from the tank then flowed on the surface of the ground down the hillside to the lower flat.\n\nPRELIMINARY RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nAs it was urgently necessary that steps be taken immediately to remedy the conditions described, a memorandum was given to Mr. Frost, Indian Agent, recommending that the tank be cleaned out, the sludge buried and while this was in progress that the sewage be diverted to a\n\nC. E. Webb, Esq.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDominion Water Power & Reclamation Service,\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\ntemporary cess pool. The cost of this work was estimated at $200.00. While it was realized at this time that the filter beds below the tank were quite probably blocked with solid sludge no attempt was made to ascertain their condition, it being considered that this could best be done when the flow from the tank was again diverted to these beds.\n\n**SECOND EXAMINATION OF TANK**\n\nNotification having been received from Mr. Frost that the tank had been cleaned out and was ready for inspection, a second visit was made on April 16th. On my first visit it had been impossible to obtain the dimensions of the two chambers of the tank and this information was now obtained. It was found that the tank had been very thoroughly cleaned out at a cost approximately as estimated and was ready to be again put in use. On examination of the system below the tank outlet it was then found that alterations to this system would be necessary as hereafter described.\n\n**CONDITION OF FILTER BEDS**\n\nAt the time of my first visit the only information available as to the filter beds was contained in a block plan of the school and grounds on file in Mr. Frost's office. On my second visit information became available that the filter beds as originally installed on a steep side hill functioned for only about one year. At the end of this time many of the pipes had washed out and were lying on the surface of the hillside. The filter bed was then abandoned and a pipe line laid leading directly from the syphon chamber to\nthe Somass river without any intermediate filterage, as shown on attached plan (Appendix No. 2).\n\nUnfortunately this pipe was laid with open joints and not to line or grade and with no manholes for cleaning purposes. On digging it up at various points it was found that it was completely blocked for at least 150 feet past the septic tank and probably is blocked for nearly its whole length and so is now useless as a tank outlet.\n\nWhen this was discovered, arrangements were made to install a temporary drain from the tank to the cesspool and to put the tank again in operation. This disposal of the sewage will function satisfactorily for a few months pending the construction of a new outlet pipe to the Somass river which is hereinafter recommended.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\nIt is recommended that a new outlet pipe be constructed leading directly from the siphon chamber of the septic tank to the Somass river as shown on plan (Appendix No. 1). Flanged vitrified pipe 6 inches in diameter should be used and should be laid with cemented joints to accurate line and grade. At two points where changes in line and grade occur manholes for cleaning purposes should be constructed. A third manhole should be constructed where the sewage inlet pipe enters the septic tank and in this manhole there should be provision for temporarily turning the flow of sewage into the cess pool during periodical tank cleanings. The cost of this construction is estimated at $903.25 as itemized in Appendix No. 1 of this report.\nIt is also recommended that during the next year the tank should be closely observed and the settling chamber be cleaned out when the solids on the bottom reach a depth of two feet or more. The period required for such accumulation will then be ascertained and the tank should thereafter be cleaned out at the regular interval thus determined. Ordinary good practice is to clean these tanks once a year but as this tank is smaller than the standard size, special precautions are necessary.\n\nGENERAL OBSERVATIONS.\n\n(a) Capacity of Septic Tank\n\nThe settling chamber has dimensions as follows: Length 12 feet, width 4.5 feet, height to overflow 4.5 feet. This gives a daily capacity of 15 gallons to each of the 125 occupants of the school as compared to a standard capacity for such installations of 40 gallons. Thus the tank is apparently much too small for the purpose it serves. However, the fact that the tank has been in use for ten years without cleaning and without giving serious trouble until the present time indicates that with proper attention it should in future function satisfactorily. The figure of 40 gallons sewage per capita daily has no doubt been obtained from observations under different conditions than those here existing and is quite probably an over estimate of the sewage from an institution such as an Indian school.\nAs far as I could ascertain without digging up the drains there is no roof drainage admitted to the septic tank. Laundry water, bath water and kitchen waste pass through the tank but it is probable that these wastes will be satisfactorily eliminated as there are no filter beds in connection with the disposal system.\n\nIf, however, after the system is put into operation it should be found that these wastes are causing difficulties in the operation of the septic tank separate plumbing will then have to be provided and this water disposed of in some other way, possibly in surface irrigation of the school gardens.\n\n(b) Filter Bed Not Necessary\n\nAs originally designed and installed the effluent from the septic tank passed through a filter bed situated on a hill side to the south of the tank. While no excavations were made at this point, the soil in the vicinity of the tank and in the flats through which the present outlet pipe passes is a fairly heavy clay and quite unsuitable for filtration purposes. From the time that this filter bed was abandoned to the present time the liquid tank effluent has been discharged directly into the Somass river. As the\npoint of discharge is within the area of tidal influence the water in this vicinity is not used for drinking purposes. When the tank is working properly the effluent is a liquid and is unobjectionable in appearance or odor and does not create a nuisance along the banks of the river. Under these circumstances it was not considered necessary to make any alteration in the present system of disposal which has now gone on for several years without any local protest.\n\n(c) Maintenance of System\n\nIt should be remembered by those who are in charge of the maintenance of such systems that a septic tank installation is far from an ideal system of sewage disposal and will only function properly when it is carefully watched and prompt action taken to remedy any irregularities in operation as they arise. The following are the conditions most likely to cause trouble:\n\n1. Excessive accumulation of solids in the settling chamber.\n2. Failure of operation of the automatic siphon.\n3. Clogging of the filter bed system (usually caused by condition No.1).\n\nThe latter condition will not need to be watched in this case as no filter beds have been provided.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.L.

Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\n739 Hastings St. West,\nVANCOUVER, B.C., Vancouver, B.C.,\nAugust 27, 1930.\nREPORT\non\nINSTALLATION OF SEPTIC TANK OUTLET DRAIN\nat\nALBERNI INDIAN MISSION SCHOOL\nby\nA. L. McNaughton.\n\nVancouver, B.C.,\nAugust 27, 1930.\nVancouver, B.C.\nAugust 27, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nAs instructed in your letter of June 4th, 1930, I left Vancouver for Port Alberni on July 21st and commenced work on the installation of a new sewer outlet pipe for the Alberni Indian Mission School on July 22nd. From this date to August 11th this work was continuously carried on with five men employed. Owing to the necessity of furnishing transportation for the men to and from their homes in Alberni, it was impossible to employ a larger number of men without providing an extra car for use on this work.\n\nThe construction carried out followed closely that recommended in my report dated April 30, 1930, the only variation being that in place of the manhole shown on the inlet side of the septic tank, a smaller concrete diversion box was constructed. A section of wrought iron pipe 2 feet 6 inches in length carries the sewage from the school across this box and into the septic tank. When it becomes periodically necessary to clean out the septic tank this pipe will be lifted out and the sewage will then drop to the floor of the diversion box and be carried through a drain down to a cess pool. This will allow the thorough cleaning of the septic tank which, without some such provision, would be very difficult.\n\nC. E. Webb, Esq.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDom.Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\n739 Hastings Street, West,\nVancouver, B.C.\nConcrete manholes at stations 1 + 00 and 3 + 00 are each 5 feet in depth and 3 feet 2 inches square on the inner dimensions. The walls and base of these manholes are 6 inches in thickness. The inner and outer forms for these manholes were designed for easy removal and the same set of forms were used for both manholes and could have been used for further similar construction if such had been necessary. Photos showing these forms in place are appended hereto.\n\nSix-inch bell end vitrified sewer tile was laid from the septic tank to the river along the lines indicated in the original report. This pipe was laid exactly to the line and grade specified and after laying, it was possible to see through the pipe from end to end between manholes. All joints were packed with jute and the collars then filled with neat cement grout. A ten-foot length of cast iron pipe was set at the Somass river outlet to prevent any chance of the drain being blocked through river erosion. The drain discharges in tidal water between low and high tide mark. It was thought advisable to discharge the pipe above low tide mark as this makes the outer end available for cleaning purposes.\n\nAfter construction was completed the siphon chamber of the septic tank was flushed and as far as could be ascertained, the new drain was functioning satisfactorily.\n\nAppended hereto is a detailed statement of the cost of this installation and also photos taken while the construction was under way.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.L.

Barry, Inspector of Schools for B.C., dated June 10th & 11th, 1931, regarding his inspection of the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL. - Original on File 159-1-6.\n\nDORMITORIES:\n\nThe general condition of the dormitories was satisfactory, with the exception of the JUNIOR BOYS' DORMITORY in which the beds were untidy. This room did not seem to be well ventilated. There was a distinct smell of urine. This was also particularly the case in the toilet situated in the wash room attached to the above dormitory. The Principal stated that this toilet was cleaned each morning. It was not very clean when I inspected it. There was water on the floor. There were no signs of overcrowding in the dormitories, except in the case of the JUNIOR GIRLS' DORMITORY. This room is about 30 ft. by 30 ft. with a 12 foot ceiling. There were 28 beds in this room. This gives about 36 cubic feet per child, which is hardly sufficient. There is a ventilation system throughout the school.\n\nSANITARY CONDITIONS:\n\nThe boiler room was very untidy. Debris from wood used as fuel has been allowed to collect. There is a big pile of this in one corner of the room. I see no reason why the boys are not instructed to keep this room clean. The grates of the fire box and the bridges in the furnace are broken. These should be repaired during the vacation.\n\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF INDIAN COMMISSIONER DITCHBURN, DATED JUNE 26, 1931, FORWARDING MR. BARRY'S REPORT ON THE ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL. - Original on File 159-1-11.\n\nAs regards the fire escape, your file 159-1-5 contains full information with regard to the same. It would however, do no harm and be of small expense to have Inspector Barry's suggestion carried out.\n\n(See next Page)\nFIRE PROTECTION:\n\nThere are two fire escapes. The position in which these escapes have been located is a very poor one. They are quite near together, one on each side of the entrance steps. The lowest section of each escape is the usual swinging type. This section is balanced by weights, so that in the normal position the section is raised from the ground. These swinging sections at their lowest position are six feet from the ground.\n\nWhen the escapes are in use for practice drills, some member of the staff has to stand below the escape and watch the children as they jump from the lowest step of the escape. This system of escape is, in my opinion, a very bad one for use in schools. As the entire object of fire drills is to train children to escape from a building in an orderly manner, it is very necessary that the children are protected as much as possible from fear. During a fire there is of course a great danger of panic caused by fear. If children are badly frightened each time a fire drill is held, through difficulty in descending the escape, the value of such a drill is greatly decreased. These swinging sections, particularly when they do not reach in their lowest position to within a foot or so of the ground are a cause of fear to young children.\n\nThe principal of the school has promised that each time a fire drill is held there will be some one of cut hands, etc., to be treated, sometimes several cases. The children seem to hurt themselves on the escapes.\n\nI beg to recommend that the iron rail on the front entrance side of the lowest platform of each escape be cut away, and two wooden steps be built on each side of the entrance doorway to connect the entrance veranda with the lowest platform of the escape. This will enable the children to step from the escape to the floor of the veranda in front of the main door of the school. From this the children can walk down the front steps of the school.\n\nThere is no direct exit from the senior boys' or senior girls' dormitories to the fire escapes. The nearest method of access in each case is through a bath-room and then through the wash-room to the escape. The door between the bath-room and the wash-room is kept locked to prevent the senior children going into the junior dormitories. The key of the door might well be kept in a glass-fronted box attached to the wall.\n\nThe only other method of gaining access to the escapes from the senior dormitories is through the door of the room, across a passage, through the door of the junior dormitory, and then through the wash-room to the escape.\n\nThe windows leading from the junior dormitories to the escapes are kept locked, by permission of the Department. Bars are kept under the windows in each case. The same arrangement holds good in the intermediate dormitories.\n\nThere are three fire extinguishers of the pump type, four hydrants with hose attached inside the building, and two stand pipes outside. I had the city water turned on through one of the outside stand pipes and hose. The pressure was only sufficient to send the water up to the eaves of the school. I was unable to throw water on the roof of the main building.\n\nFire drills are held regularly. In the drill which I supervised, the children were clear of the school from the classrooms in under one and a half minutes.\n\nThere are in addition 15 fire extinguishers located in various parts of the school building. I would suggest that some of these be tested from time to time.\n\nExtract from Inspector Bury's report\n\nJune 10 and 11, 1931\nOttawa, July 9, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 26th ultimo, forwarding Mr. Inspector Barry's report on his inspection of the Alberni Indian Residential School, I have to inform you that we are communicating with the Principal regarding the overcrowded conditions in the junior girls' dormitory, proper ventilation and cleanliness in the junior boys' dormitory, cleaning of the debris in the boiler room and the repairs required to the grates of the fire box and bridges in the furnace.\n\nI have to request that you will arrange to carry out the Inspector's recommendation that the iron rail on the front entrance side of the lowest platform of each escape be cut away, and two wooden steps built on each side of the entrance doorway to connect the entrance veranda with the lowest platform of the escape. This will enable the children to step from the escape to the floor of the veranda in front of the main door of the school, which the children can walk down the front steps of the school.\n\nThe Inspector also states that the access to the fire escapes from the senior boys' and senior girls' dormitories is through a bathroom and then through the washroom, and that the door between the bathroom and washroom is kept locked to prevent the senior pupils going into the junior dormitories. He recommends that the key of the door be kept in a glass fronted box attached to the wall, and I have to request that you will arrange to have a suitable box installed in which the keys could be kept.\n\nAccounts, in duplicate, properly certified, should be forwarded covering the above authorized expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. H. Diphburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nBox 666, Victoria,\nB.C.\nOttawa, July 9, 1931.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nMr. Barry, Inspector of Schools for British Columbia, in a report on his inspection of the Alberni Indian Residential School, has drawn attention to the overcrowded condition in the junior girls' dormitory. He states there are 28 beds in this room, while there is only air space to accommodate 22 girls. I would, therefore, request that you arrange to reduce the number of beds in this dormitory to 22.\n\nThe Inspector also states that the junior boys' dormitory did not seem to be well ventilated, the beds were untidy and the toilet in the washroom attached to the dormitory was not properly ventilated. He also states that when he inspected this dormitory it was not very clean and there was water on the floor.\n\nThe Inspector further states that the boiler room was very untidy. Debris from wood used as fuel had been allowed to collect, there being a big pile in one corner of the room. It is also stated that the grates of the fire box and the bridges in the furnace are broken.\n\nI have to request that you will make early arrangements for proper ventilation and cleanliness in the junior boys' dormitory and in cleaning up the debris in the boiler room.\n\nRelative to the new grates and repairs to the bridges in the furnace, I have to request that you will arrange to have this equipment installed and the furnace placed in good condition during the present summer, the cost of same to be paid from per capita earnings or other receipts of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. F. E. Pitts, B.A.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Res. School,\nAlberni, B.C.\n\nA. P. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nOttawa, July 24, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, enclosing copy of a communication which you received from the Principal of the Alberni Indian Residential School, requesting authority to incur the expenditure required in replacing the firebox frame and grates of the school heating plant.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that, on the 9th instant, a communication was forwarded to the Principal regarding various matters drawn to the attention of the Department by Mr. Inspector Barry on his inspection of this school in June. In this report the matter of new grates and repairs to the firebox frame was drawn to our attention. The Principal was informed that the school authorities are expected to arrange to have the equipment required installed and the furnace placed in good condition, the expenses for which should be paid from per capita earnings or other receipts of the school. The school authorities should see that this furnace is repaired and placed in good condition before it is required for use next fall.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nE. E. Frost, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to submit herewith a copy of a letter from the Rev. F.E. Pitts, Principal of the Alberni Indian Residential School, asking for the expenditure by the Department of approximately $75.00 to defray the cost of replacing the firebox frame and grates of the school heating plant. Some replacements were made by the school during the past spring but the frame is now burned out and frame and grates will have to be replaced before the boiler can be used again.\n\nFor the Department's consideration and decision.\n\nEnc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Residential School,\nRev.F.E.Pitts.I.A.Principal. Alberni.B.C.\nJuly 13th,1931\n\nDear Sirs;-\n\nI hereby request authority to replace the grates and frame holding them in the 84 H P boiler of our school heating plant.\n\nI pointed out the condition of these and that they had been in use eleven years, to Mr. Pragnell, Inspector of Agencies, and to Mr. Barry, Inspector of schools, also to Mr. J.E. Frost, Indian Agent, all agreed that they should be replaced and I believe so recommended in their reports.\n\nThis should be done during the summer holidays.\n\nThe approximate cost will be seventy-five dollars.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont. (sd) F.E. Pitts,\nPrincipal.\nI have the honour to submit herewith a request from the Rev. Principal of the Alberni Indian Residential School, for permission to remove the wornout bake oven from the bakery of that school, the oven now being beyond repair.\n\n2. Authority to purchase an Economy oven to replace the wornout oven. For the consideration of the Department.\n\nI beg to advise the Department that for some time past this school has been compelled to purchase most of the bread used owing to the oven being unserviceable.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nEd. B. Frost\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDept. of Indian Affairs  \nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nIn the report of Mr. Pragnall, Inspector of Indian Agencies, you will note what he says about the bake oven at the school. This oven was in the present condition when I came to the school four years ago. The inside draught doors were gone and the walls leaked smoke into the oven and it was difficult to heat sufficiently and steadily enough to bake bread. I have understood that it was an old oven when it was installed here.\n\nI therefore request permission to remove it as useless, and to use the room for other purposes.\n\nI also request authority to buy an Economy oven #3 manufactured by J.J. Doust of St. Boniface, Manitoba, as per accompanying picture and price from their catalogues. The electric oven #B would be very preferable but the price is $550.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

In the winter it is about as difficult to keep meat as it is in the summer for during the rainy season it gets slimy and moulds quickly. Consequently, it is difficult to kill our own meat and to keep any quantity of it for more than a few days.\n\nThe cost of an electrically cooled Frigidaire plant, built in would be between $650.00 and $700.00. The cost of a Lord electrically cooled cabinet would be $285.00 for medium size and $375.00 for the large size.\n\nHoping that you may find it possible to furnish us with one of these styles of refrigeration, I remain\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nReceived\nJUL 27 1931\nINDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE\nPort Alberni, B.C.\nOttawa, August 12, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 180/31 S.l of the 29th ultimo, with reference to a frigidaire for the Alberni Indian Residential School.

The machine had been allowed to dry out during the holidays in order that the necessary repairs might be more definitely determined, and after careful examination, I am of the opinion that it can be made serviceable to last three years, probably longer, for an estimated cost of \u00a345.00.\n\nThe agitators inside the barrel are rotted out also the section of wood near the doors in the barrel and some wood brackets used for supports inside the barrel.\n\nThe main portions or parts of the barrel or container appear fairly sound and with the renewal of the parts named, I believe, the machine can be made to operate satisfactorily for a period of at least three years.\n\nI am sending under separate cover a portion of the wood from one of the agitators as evidence of their condition.\n\nIf the Department approves of and authorizes the expenditure stated can a reply be sent by wire as the machine is now sufficiently dried out to work on and the time remaining before it will be needed is getting short.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian agent.\nOttawa, August 13, 1931.\n\nE.

I found 3 or 4 inches of water in the boiler room and that more water was coming in through the wall, which appeared to be due to the choking of the carry off drain for the buildings being stopped up. The drain was uncovered and found to be blocked in places for a distance of about 40 feet. I instructed the Rev Principal, Mr. Pitts to have the drain taken up and re-laid, the estimated cost of which will be approximately $85.00.\n\nI considered it necessary that this work should be done at once as the basement wall was showing signs of settling due to the excessive saturation of the ground.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n| DATE | DETAIL                                      | AMOUNT |\n|------|--------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 1932 | Jan.

(RG 10, Volume 6433, File 877-5, part 4)\nOttawa, June 24, 1932.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nThe Department has received the report of Mr. Inspector Barry on his inspection of the Alberni Indian Residential School in which he draws special attention to the fire alarm system. He states that he found the fire alarm battery out of order and that new batteries were required. He recommends that large size dry cells be used rather than the present 6 volt battery.\n\nI have to request that you will take immediate steps to have the fire alarm system placed in a good, workable condition and ready for instant use in case of fire. You should see that this system is regularly tested and kept in proper working order at all times. In this connection I have to refer you to circular letter of February 5th, last, a copy of which is enclosed herewith, setting forth the Department's requirements to overcome fire hazard. It is expected that the principals of all residential schools will follow the instructions contained in the circular referred to and give this most important matter their serious attention. I shall be pleased to hear, at an early date, the action taken in having the alarm system at your school placed in good working condition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. F. E. Pitts,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nAlberni, B.C.\nEXTRACT from Inspector Barry's Report regarding his visit to the ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL on April 26th, 1932. - Original on File 159-1-6.\n\nIt may be pointed out in passing that the provisions of the Department's letter 1-1-5 dated February 5, 1932, are not being complied with in this regard.\n\nThere is no direct exit from the senior dormitories to the fire escapes. The exit is in each case through a bath room, and then through a wash room. As recommended in my last report, boxes containing keys to the locked doors between the bathroom and the wash rooms in each case have now been provided. These boxes have glass fronts and are on the wall near the locked door on both the boys' and girls' sides of the school.\n\nI beg to recommend the supply of 12 small mattresses and 12 large mattresses, to take the place of an equal number which are now of no further use.\n\nI found that the fire alarm battery, a 6 Volt Battery, was out of order. A hand bell was therefore rung for the alarm. It is impossible for me to understand how the Principal of a school where lives may be in danger at any time is content to leave things in this condition. A proper supply of large size dry cells would be far better than a 6 Volt Battery.

I found everything in the buildings and outbuildings very clean and tidy. In fact, though I searched thoroughly, I have no adverse criticism to make. There were one hundred and fourteen children in the school at the time of my visit. There had been a lot of influenza, but were all getting better. As it was Saturday, the day of my visit, I did not hear the children in the classrooms. They were having meat stew, potatoes and carrots for their midday meal and bread and butter and beans for supper. I requested that the fire extinguishers be refilled. I again took up the matter of the locked window screens to the fire escapes, and after talking it over with the Principal, and at my earnest request, he promised to substitute wax seals instead, which, I understand, has been done. I don't think he will have any trouble in this connection. The jacket heater is in very poor condition. What is required there is a small tubular boiler.\n\nThe herd consists of from ten to fifteen dairy cows, with a well kept barn, and there should be plenty of milk for the children.\n\nThe manual training is being carried out, but seems to be in rather the commencement stage; possibly it will improve, but I am not sure whether the instructor is first-class. I believe it is rather hard to get a good man. I will look into this at my next visit.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Geo. S.

The urgency for making these repairs has been noted, but I regret that, owing to a considerable reduction in our Estimates, we will have no funds to pay the cost of the work. The voucher which you submitted is returned herewith, and the Principal of the School should arrange for payment of same, from per capita allowance or other receipts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

C.\nSir;-\n\nI have the honour to call the Department's attention to the attached account, Vou No 100, amounting to $46.55.\n\nI beg to state that this expenditure was compulsory and had to be made at once.\n\nThe auxiliary heating system at the Alberni Residential School, used when the main system is not needed, has been giving trouble for the past two years. The Department has been asked to defray the cost of repairs twice and the School has paid for several minor repairs until it was decided that a replacement would be less expensive than trying to keep the defective system in service. The replacement was made last month when the system again gave out. The replacement (a drum heater with inside coils) is far cheaper than a new heater of the previous pattern. It gives greater heating surface with less cost for fuel and is easy to keep in repair.\n\nI respectfully recommend the Department's favourable consideration of this account as I consider it a legitimate charge against the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nEd.

F. Dawson, Esq.,\nDist. Mgr., Architect,\nDept. Public Works, Canada,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir: re: Inspection of Boilers and Machinery,\nIndian Residential School, Alberni, B.C.\n\nOn August 16th, 1933, I made an inspection of the mechanical plant of this School, which consists of,\n\nOne Horizontal return tubular high pressure boiler,\nNo. 43367 B.C., 66\" diameter and 12' long, having 54\n12\" x 4\" tubes, longitudinal joint double rivetted lap,\nrated at 84 H.P., built in 1920, making it now 13 years old.\n\nThe Laundry consists of one large washing machine and\none 24\" Hydro Extractor driven by a 5 H.P. motor, and\nhas a 7 H.P. Z type Fairbanks-Morse gas engine as an\nauxiliary unit steam for the laundry water being\nsupplied by the main boiler.\n\nBoiler No. 43367 B.C.\n\nI gave this boiler a careful inspection, hammer and Hydro-\nstatic test and found that the shell, stays and rivets of\nthe boiler in good condition. The tubes have a lot of pit\nblisters and pitting on the tubes is quite intense. Some\nof the pits are quite deep and in a short time several of the\ntubes will need renewing.\n\nI would recommend that before the firing season commences,\ntwo zinc plates be installed in the boiler 4\" x 6\" x 1\" in\nsize, one to be installed on the top and the other in\nthe bottom, screwed from the stays and placed near where the\nstained water from the system enters, also the use of a solution\nof Sal soda and lime water in the proportion of 1 1/2 Lb. Sal\nsoda to 4 gallons of clear lime water, using about 1 gallon\nof the solution per month. This will help to arrest the\npitting, but I am afraid that it is gone too far in some places\nto arrest it before it has eaten through the tubes. Also after\nthe firing season this boiler should be emptied and thoroughly\ndried, opened up and a free circulation of air allowed to pass\nthrough it.\n\nI also found that two of the rivets of the flange on the\nbottom of the boiler into which the return from the heating\nsystem is screwed sounded loose and had been slightly leaking.\nBoiler No. 43367 B.C. Continued.\n\nAlso the return pipe which together with this flange is exposed to the direct heat of the fire is getting quite thin and will need renewing. On tracing it back to the main return outside the boiler setting I found it badly corroded externally; nearly all the joints including the joint of the equalizer were corroded and showing moisture. The whole of this pipe should be renewed as soon as possible.\n\nOwing to the construction of the setting of this boiler the fusible plug where now placed does not get the direct heat of the fire. It should be changed to the front end where it would give much better protection for the boiler.\n\nI then gave this boiler a hydrostatic test of 50 Lb., and found all seams quite tight except the return flange which was leaking where it was riveted to the shell plates and the two rivets before mentioned were leaking quite freely. These rivets must be cut out and new ones installed and the flange recaulked.\n\nBrickwork.\n\nThe brickwork is in a very fair condition. In the furnaces quite a number of courses have the fireclay burnt out. This should be plastered with a coat of high temperature cement 1/2\" thick. There are also several small cracks in the brickwork which should be pointed up.\n\nGenerally.\n\nThe Laundry machinery is in a fairly good condition and is well guarded.\n\nThe general condition of this plant is very good. It has the appearance of being well looked after.\n\nI have issued a certificate allowing a steam pressure of 10 Lb. and condition, on account of tubes, fair.\n\nThe test cocks, water gauge and main steam valve are in good condition. The steam gauge is 1 Lb. light. The safety valves work freely and are set to blow off at 10 Lb. water pressure.\n\nThe blowdown cock must be overhauled, ground in tight and made to work freely.\n\nApproximate cost of repairs is as follows,\n\nRenewing return pipe from boiler to main return with 3\" extra heavy black pipe, including slight alterations to blowdown pipe and feed line, Fifty Dollars ($50.00). This is to include new rivets and caulking.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6433, File 877-5, part 4)\nGenerally, Continued.\n\nRemoving and repairing brickwork to allow of removal of return pipe including facing furnace and pointing up cracks, Thirty Dollars ($30.00).\n\nRenewing fusible plug where present placed, Two Dollars and Fifty Cents ($2.50).\n\nIf altered to new position and a new steel plug installed in present position of plug, Five Dollars ($5.00).\n\nTwo zinc plates and hangers, Ten Dollars ($10.00).\n\nTotal cost approximately One Hundred Dollars ($100.00).\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nT.J.

Smith,\nEngineer, I.P.W.,\nVictoria, B.C.\nSir;-\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of the Department's letter of 25th instant calling for an explanation re purchase of fire fighting accessories for the Alberni Indian Residential School as shown in Voucher No 180, amounting to $13.60.\n\nI beg to advise the Department that on visiting the Alberni School during May I instructed the Principal to test all his fire appliances and make good any defects found, but I failed to instruct him to report to this office what defects were found before he replaced them. When testing the apparatus it was found that 2 nozzles and some packing gaskets were defective and that 2 extra nozzles were necessary to fully complete the fire protection equipment for use, these were purchases by the Rev Principal at a cost of $10.05.\n\nEarly in June, during my absence from Port Alberni, a logging slash was fired near the school which caused burning debris to fall on the roofs of school out buildings and as these are located some considerable distance from the school proper, all fire fighting apparatus was called into use. It was then found that 2 extra reducers were needed to enable exterior and interior hose lines of different sizes to be coupled up together, and these were purchased by the Rev Principal and the purchases reported to me on my return to office.\n\nHad the fire fighting apparatus not been in serviceable condition, most probably, the out buildings would have been damaged.\n\nUnder these conditions the purchases were made on my order to the Rev Principal, without first having obtained authority from the Department. Voucher No 180 is returned herewith for consideration.\n\nEnc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEd.E.Frost,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\n180.

I would recommend that, before the firing season commences, two zinc plates be installed in the boiler 4\" x 8\" x 1\" in size, one to be installed on the top and the other in the bottom, suspended from the steam and placed near where the return water from the system enters, and the use of a mixture of sal soda and lime water in the proportion of 1/2 lb. sal soda to 4 gallons of clear lime water, using about 1 gallon of the solution per month. This will help to arrest the pitting, but I am afraid that it is gone too far in some places to arrest it before it has eaten through the tubes. Also, after the firing season, this boiler should be emptied and thoroughly dried, opened up and a free circulation of air allowed to pass through it.\n\n\"I also found that two of the rivets of the flange on the bottom of the boiler, into which the return from the heating system is screwed, sounded loose and had been slightly leaking. Also, the return pipe which, together with this flange is exposed to the direct heat of the fire, is getting quite thin and will need renewing. On tracing it back to the main return outside the boiler setting, I found it badly corroded externally, nearly all the joints including the joint of the equalizer were corroded and showing moisture. The whole of this pipe should be renewed as soon as possible.\n\n\"Owing to the construction of the setting of this boiler, the fusible plug, where now placed, does not get the direct heat of the fire. It should be changed to the front end where it would give much better protection for the boiler.\n\n\"I then gave this boiler a hydrostatic test of 50 lb. and found all seems quite tight except the return flange, which was leaking where it was rivetted to the shell plates and the two rivets before mentioned were leaking quite freely. These rivets must be cut out and new ones installed and the flange recaulked.\n\n\"Brickwork. The brickwork is in a very fair condition. In the furnaces, quite a number of courses have the fireclay burnt out. This should be plastered with a coat of high temperature cement, 1/2\" thick. There are also several small cracks\n\nE. E. Frost, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B. C.\ncracks in the brickwork, which should be pointed up.\"\n\nThe Engineer states that the carrying out of the above repairs would cost approximately $100. We have no funds to provide the cost, and the school authorities should themselves have the work done - the cost to be paid from per capita earnings and other receipts of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nMr. E. E. Frost, Indian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYours of Oct. 31st, #301/33/S1 received re repairs on steam boiler.\n\nIn reply: The Engineering Firm who estimated repairs state that it will take them at least three days to do the work and that the heating plant would be out of use for that length of time.\n\nAs the weather is now cold and damp and we have no other method of heating the school, it would be dangerous to the health of all concerned to undertake this work at present, especially as there is not likely to be any breakdown of the pipes mentioned in the repairs. The boiler is not used for any engine and seldom carries more than 2 or 3 lbs. of steam. I understood from the engineer from the Public Works Department, who made the inspection that there was no immediate necessity of making the repairs and he gave me the certificate for operation of the boiler till August 15, 1934.\n\nI therefore request the Department to sanction the delay in these repairs until the warmer weather in the spring, unless a leak should occur that would necessitate immediate action.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Residential School\nRev. F. E. Pitts, S.A., Principal\n\nAlberni, B.C. Nov. 6, 1933\nNovember 25, 1933.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 15th enclosing a communication from the Reverend Principal of the Alberni School, with reference to the heating boilers, and in reply I beg to say that the Department approves of postponing the repairs to these boilers until next summer.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nEd. H. Frost, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Alberni, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith, for the Department's consideration, a copy of a letter from the Reverend Principal of the Alberni Indian Residential School, re repairs to the heating plant boiler at that school.\n\nThe Department's decision is requested, please.\n\nEnc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Ed. E. Frost)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to refer to the Department's letter of September 24th, 1934, re the inspection of the boiler of the heating plant at the Alberni School, and the repairs found necessary by the boiler Inspector to put the boiler in order, and the Department's ruling that the work be paid for from school funds.\n\nI beg to state that the work was carried out at the time, the particular items of same under the supervision of the boiler Inspector, himself. The cost of the various repairs are as under; $36.50 and $139.09. Total cost $175.59.\n\nWhen Mr. N. C. Allen of the Finance Department visited this Agency the matter was taken up with him and the Department's ruling, that the account be paid from school funds, was stated to him and the fact that the school funds were very low and this extra unexpected expense would be a heavy drain on them. Mr. Allen advised that a statement of the school's revenues and expenditures be submitted to the Department, with a view to the Department's reconsideration of the matter.\n\nStatement of school finances and accounts for boiler repairs are enclosed herewith, for the Department's perusal and decision.\n\nI beg to state that in my opinion the school is operated with care and as economically as possible. The Rev. Principal has qualified as engineer in charge of the heating plant and has obtained an official permit as such, in order to avoid the cost of an Engineer, and he has at present $1300.00 of his own private funds loaned to the school to meet current expenditures.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEd.

A cheque for $139.09, in payment of the account of the Alberni Engineering Works, and one for $36.50, in favour of the Principal, will be sent in due course.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nH. E. Frost, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni,\nB. C.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF G. H. BARRY, DISTRICT INSPECTOR OF INDIAN SCHOOLS, VICTORIA, B. C., on his visit to ALBERNI Indian Residential School, Dec. 12, 1934. - Forwarded under cover of Asst. Commissioner Perry's letter dated January 2, 1935.\n\nALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nLAUNDRY: The laundry was quite clean. There is a very great need here for some better system of drying the clothes. In my last report I suggested a small room for this. Such a room could easily be partitioned off from the present laundry in the N.W. corner of that room. Steam pipes could be run into the partitioned-off space from the boiler which is located under this part of the laundry. The cost would perhaps be in the neighbourhood of $250. As reported last year, this would provide a proper system of drying clothes. Should this be authorized, the question would arise as to who should pay for the work, and this would be a matter for the Department to decide. I have no special opinion with regard to the matter.\n\nThe laundry machinery is worked by electricity. The extractor is reported as too small for the work to be done. I consider that it will take care of the necessary work for some time to come, even if it were too small a machine when placed here. As reported previously, the school supplied a laundry stove during the past two years. This is giving satisfaction.\n\nBOILER ROOM: This is as clean as it is possible to keep it. Water collects on the floor. This water comes in from the ground outside and at the back of the school. To drain this water may be a very difficult matter. I understand that there is a drain. It is just possible that this existing drain is not working properly, though I have no particular reason to state that this is so. The boiler room here is quite differently arranged to those in our other Indian Residential Schools. It is open to the weather to a certain extent and that may account for the water now on the floor, as may the fact that a large quantity of wet cordwood is piled up here.\n\nSeveral pipes in connection with the boilers were renewed since my last inspection. This is one of the boilers inspected by Mr. T. J. Arnall.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to refer to my wire of above date re water supply to the Alberni Indian Residential School.\n\nThe pipe across the Somass River was carried out by the present flood, and water for fire protection, washing, heating, cooking and sanitary purposes has now to be carried by hand.\n\nThe present system was installed in August 1922, H. M. T. Hodgson was engineer in charge of the work. The approximate cost was $500.00. The distance across the Somass River was then over 300 feet. The pipe was 2 inch and was buried 2 feet at the deepest point and 6 inches at the shallowest and covered with flat boulders. The river bed, below gravel, is blue clay on north side and hardpan on south side. The depth of water at shore end of pipe on south side of river was then 4 feet at low water.\n\nIt is necessary that provision be made as soon as possible, for a temporary supply, as permanent repairs may not be possible until about midsummer, unless a stretch of cold weather occurs before that time, to stop water from back in the hills, where there is a considerable depth of snow.\n\nCan a copy of the blue print of this school be supplied to this office, showing drainage and sanitary systems? It is often needed for reference, and there is not one available either in this office or at the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEd. E.

Warren, to Port Alberni to investigate breakage of the water system at the Alberni Indian Residential School reported by Agent Frost by telegram to be requiring urgent investigation.\n\nMr. Warren went to Alberni on the 5th instant and will report on his return.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. C. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nFebruary 5, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nI have received your letter of the 4th instant regarding the water main supplying the Alberni Indian Residential School which is being carried out by the river and have accordingly written to Mr. Webb to arrange for an examination and report as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T.

H. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools for the province of British Columbia, in a report on his recent inspection of the Alberni Indian Residential School, states as follows regarding the laundry:\n\n\"The laundry was quite clean, but there is a very great need for some better system of drying the clothes\".\n\nHe states that a small room could easily be partitioned off from the present laundry in the n. w. corner and steam pipes could be easily led into this partitioned off room from the boiler, which is located under this part of the laundry, and that this would provide a proper system of drying clothes. I shall be pleased if, after consulting the Principal in the matter, you will forward a report regarding what you would advise be done in the matter, stating in detail any work or alterations required and the approximate cost.\n\nWith reference to the boiler room, the Inspector states that, while this is as clean as it is possible to keep it, water collects on the floor and this water comes in from the ground outside and at the back of the school. The Department understands that there is a drain. It may be possible that this drain is not working properly and it may be blocked. No doubt, the Principal and staff could examine and carry out any repairs that may be required to the drain.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nE. E. Frost, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B. C.\nFebruary 9, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 5th inst., wherein you quote a letter received from the Department of Indian Affairs of February 4th containing a request for an examination and report on the break in the water main supplying the Alberni Indian Residential School I have to inform you that a similar request was received from Mr. C.C. Jerry and I had Mr. Warren make the necessary investigation on February 7th.\n\nMr. Warren's report of February 9th is enclosed herewith in duplicate from which it will be noted that the 2\" pipe line buried in the bed of the Somass river was broken during the recent floods and the school is now without a supply of running water.\n\nI would suggest that Mr. Warren's recommendations for temporary installation be proceeded with at an estimated cost of $275. For a permanent installation I would recommend the 4\" pipe at an estimated cost of $1360. This 4\" pipe will allow of at least some fire service at the Indian School. To have a satisfactory job of the permanent work it will have to be done during extremely low water which may be expected to occur, according to our hydrometric records, during the months of August, September or October.\n\nIf desired by the department I will be pleased to take up with the City of Alberni the question of the extension of their larger service main as far as the Indian School service pipe.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston, Esq.C.E.,\nDirector,\nOTTAWA.\n\nC.H. Webb\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\nVancouver, B.C.\nFebruary 9, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nIn compliance with your request, I made an examination of the pipeline supplying the Alberni Indian School, on the 7th instant, which had been reported broken by Assistant Indian Commissioner Perry on the 5th instant and who had requested an examination. The following is a report of my investigation.\n\nIn company with Mr. Indian Agent Frost, I visited the school and interviewed the principal. An examination of the pipeline was made but I was unable to locate the point where the break occurred in the river bed. The Somass river is still very high after an abnormal flood and it would be difficult, if not impossible, to repair the break at the present time. The pipeline is reported to be buried a depth of 1.5 feet below the bed of the river which has an extreme depth at low water period of about four feet. The maximum depth of water at present would probably be from 12 to 15 feet with a velocity of 5 to 6 feet per second.\n\nI am informed by local authorities that the river level may not materially lower before August or September.\n\nI am unable to determine the exact cause of the break but it is possible that a large tree with roots attached carried down by the flood, came in contact with the pipe at some point where the\n\nC.E. Webb, Esq.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDom. Water Power & Hydrom. Bureau,\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\ncover was slight. As it is reported that the break occurred after the river level had fallen three or four feet my surmise is probably correct.\n\nAt the present time water is being supplied to the school by means of barrels hauled by team from Indian wells nearby and the river, requiring such service throughout the day. Requirements prior to the break were approximately 7500 gallons a day.\n\nIt is unlikely that the river level will drop sufficiently to permit of permanent replacement before the early fall. I would therefore suggest that a temporary service may be provided by holding a pipeline in the bed of the stream by means of a cable. It would be necessary to install the pipe in short lengths with rubber connections so as to be flexible and with sufficient weight to hold it close to the bottom. The cost of such installation would be approximately $375.00. The major portion of the material to be used temporarily could be salvaged for future use.\n\nRegarding the construction of a permanent installation to replace that washed out, I would suggest that as the present pipe has been in place approximately 13 years it would be desirable to replace it with new pipe and to bury it to a depth of from 2\u00bd to 3 feet, if possible. The cost of the permanent replacement would be about $750.00.\n\nI should point out that the present pipe line when in use provided a service of only about 50 gallons per minute at 30 lbs. pressure for fire protection, whereas a 4-inch pipe line to the school\nwould provide a fire service of 100 gallons per minute at 45-lbs. pressure. While neither service is adequate for fire protection purpose it is the best which may be provided under existing conditions.\n\nIt is possible that the city of Alberni may in the near future find it necessary to renew the existing pipe from which the school receives its supply and it is probable that the city would, if requested, replace with 6\" pipe in order to provide a desirable service to its best customer.\n\nSuch an installation would supply the school with a service of 225 gallons per minute at about 40-lbs. pressure. Considering future possibilities and the better fire service to be secured it would be desirable when permanent replacement is to be undertaken, to install a 4-inch pipe across the river and to the school distribution system, a total distance of about 950 feet, the total cost of which would be $1250. without allowance for materials salvaged from the present line.\n\nAttached hereto are estimates of cost statements of several installations mentioned herein and sketch showing location of pipeline.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.C.

Frost,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\n\nDear Sir;-\n\nRe Water supply of Alberni Residential School.\n\nThis school, as you know, has been without its usual water supply for a period of three weeks. The result has been a marked curtailment in the cleanliness of pupils. If this continues much longer there is grave danger of an epidemic of skin disease among the pupils as well as danger to their general health through inadequate water supply for toilets.\n\nTrusting that in some way the work of providing adequate water supply may be speeded for these reasons.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.C. Thomas\n\nRECEIVED\nFEB 19 1935\nINDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE\nPORT ALBERNI, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to refer to my letter of 4th inst #537/34 S 1., reporting the washout of the Alberni Residential School water system by flood, and the advisability of an early temporary repair.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter from Doctor J.C. Thomas, the Department's Medical officer, received this morning, regarding the necessity for early repairs being made for health reasons. The Doctor's letter is self explanatory.\n\nEnc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEd. E. Frost\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6433, File 877-5, part 4)\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to refer to the Department's letter of January 10th, re the leak or seepage into the boiler room at the Alberni Indian Residential School, and note its contents.\n\nI have to advise the Department that the seepage is through the wall of the building, which is composed of rough stone, concrete and bricks, and as the floor of the boiler room is about 8 feet below the outer ground surface and the existing drains, believed to be about the floor level, there is 8 feet of soil outside the boiler room walls through which it is believed this seepage occurs. Some change in the surface drains were made about 2 years ago, to take care of this seepage, but it is still occurring.\n\nWhen the Dominion Public Works Engineer of the Waterworks Department was at Alberni School (Mr. Warren) on the 7th instant the matter was referred to him for suggestions for overcoming the trouble. He advised that a new system of surface drainage be installed to take care of surface and roof water, but could not give an estimate of the cost that would be thus incurred.\n\nI will endeavor to obtain further data from the Department Engineers when they come to Alberni to repair the water system, and the Department will be further advised. A blue print of this school is necessary to be able to trace the present drainage system.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEd. E. Frost,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 12, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your 2543-W*A* of the 7th instant, regarding repairs to the water main at the Fort Alberni Indian Residential School, I beg to say that accounts covering the expenditure should be submitted to this Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Mr. Pitts, Principal, should consult with the City Engineer of Alberni and see what the City is prepared to do toward the installation of adequate piping with sufficient pressure for all requirements of the school, both domestic and fire-fighting. I consider it is just as much the business of the School Principal to investigate the possibilities arising out of Mr. Warren's report as of any other official, more particularly as he is most familiar with the local conditions as well as being on the ground.\n\nIf you and the Principal will look into this matter and make a definite recommendation, I shall be glad to submit any reasonable proposal with a report to Ottawa. As the City is receiving revenue for the water supplied, it is felt that its engineer should be consulted in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. C. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nP/AC\n\nH. P. Nightingale, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nFort Alberni, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith, a copy of a letter received in this office from the Reverend Principal of the Alberni School and a copy of letter No. 257/35/D.-D.l. From this office to the Department dealing with the water supply for the Alberni School.\n\nI am forwarding these letters to you for your information, knowing that you, from your knowledge of local conditions and the position of the Alberni School, on a bench, above the river, will bring the matter to the attention of the Educational Branch of the Department. I am given to understand that Inspector Barry has reported this matter to the Department.\n\nIf there should be a fire it would not reflect to advantage on the Department if the water pressure was not sufficient to reach the roof of this building.\n\nI will endeavor to obtain prices of a storage tank (approximately 100,000 gallons capacity) and will then forward same to the Department. In the meantime, however, I would appreciate instruction re this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"H. P. Nightingale\"\n\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nEnc. 2.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nVictoria, B.C.\nOttawa, September 4th, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department finds it necessary to return your voucher No. 341, in connection with the cleaning of the septic tank at the Alberni Indian Residential School. The receipts from the persons who did the work should show the number of days employed and the rate per day.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nH. P.

Pitts for cleaning septic tank Alberni Residential School, July, 1935.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. dated\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nOttawa, August 28, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your 257/35/D.-3.1 of the 21st instant, enclosing copy of letter received from the Principal of the Alberni Residential School.\n\nPlease let me have an estimate of the cost of enlarging the pipe line and installing a storage tank. On receipt of this information, further consideration will be given to the Principal's request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nH. P. Nightingale, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\nSir:-\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith, a copy, of a letter, received in this office from the Reverend Principal of the Alberni Indian Residential School.\n\nThe letter, dealing with the water supply to that school is self explanatory.\n\nFurther dealing with the pressure, I have seen the hoses turned on and the water has not reached the roof (eaves) by approximately fifteen feet. As this school is situated near a standing forest and in event of a fire catching in the trees, it would be impossible to wet the roof of the building, except by buckets.\n\nIt is the opinion of this office that the pipe line should be enlarged and a storage tank installed with a pump for fire fighting purposes. The pump could be used both for filling the storage tank and for fire fighting. Approximate figures for this work will be obtained and submitted for the information of the Department at a later date.\n\nIf further work is to be done, this season, it would have to commence soon as with the fall rains the river would be too high for work in laying new pipe.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.

Nightingale,\nActing Indian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B. C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to call your attention to the fact that when our water supply pipe for the Residential School was replaced last March after being torn out by the flood it was understood that the repairs were temporary owing to the high water and swift current.\n\nThe repairs consisted of about 300 ft. of 2\" pipe\u2014the pipe lengths being connected by rubber hose and wired to a cable laid on the surface of the river bed.\n\nWe get our water supply from the City of Alberni and pay by the cubic foot with the meter on the far side of the river. Twice since March these hose connections have slipped and caused a heavy leakage. So much so that the City generously discarded the meter and jumped the account.\n\nIt is now/time of low water and/work is to be done in the river it should be done soon.\n\nI greatly fear that the present pipe will not stand the winter rains and consequent swift current. In this connection I wish also to call your attention to the fact that the school stands fully 75 ft. above the bed of the river. The building is about 50 ft. high. With a 2\" pipe we do not get pressure enough to put water on the roof of the building.\n\nEngineers Warren of Vancouver and Arnall of Victoria and Inspector Barry have reported the fire protection to be inadequate.\n\nWould it be possible to have the Department look into this matter before permanently fixing the water supply pipe?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\"F.

(RG 10, Volume 6433, File 877-5, part 4)\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to refer to Departmental telegram dated March 7th, last, in which I was advised that the Dominion Water Power Branch was authorized to make temporary repairs to the water supply system serving the Alberni Indian Residential School, West Coast Agency, B.C. In this connection I beg to advise that Mr. Acting Agent Nightingale has furnished me with copy of his letter dated August 21st addressed to the Department, with which was enclosed copy of a letter dated August 19th received by him from Reverend Francis Pitts concerning the inadequacy of the temporary work which has been installed, more particularly as to the fire fighting purposes. I now beg to transmit copy of letter received from Mr. Nightingale dated August 21st, also copy of my reply dated August 24th.\n\nThese letters will be self-explanatory, except that it should be pointed out that the report of the Dominion Water Power Branch dated February 8th, 1935, makes no provision for or reference to a storage tank in connection with the proposed installation. This is, I believe, an idea of Mr. Nightingale's, and it is understood that the elevation of the school buildings is not such as to ensure sufficient pressure for fire fighting purposes to be obtained from the City of Alberni's water system, the elevation of which is undoubtedly to be not higher than the second storey of the residential School, and a suitable storage tank or other installation would have to be made in order to obtain fire protection for the entire institution. It would seem desirable that the Dominion Water Power Branch should be requested to consult also with the authorities of the City of Alberni as suggested in the report of Mr. W.C. Warren of February 9, 1935, so whatever work is authorized should be carried out with a view to the greatest possible efficiency as well as economy. In the letter of Mr. C.E. Webb, District Chief Engineer to his Director at Ottawa covering Mr. Warren's report he stated that if the Department wished he would be pleased to take up with the city of Alberni the question of the extension of their largest service main as far as the Indian service pipe. No information has been received as to this office as to the Department's intentions in this connection. In the meantime I felt it was safe to instruct Mr. Nightingale to confer with the Principal and the City authorities at Alberni in a preliminary way as the issue seems to be one of considerable importance as affecting the interests of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.

This report showed that Mr. Webb estimated the cost at $1,360.\n\nNo action was taken at that time, but, on September 24th, a telegram was received from Indian Commissioner Perry, stating that Mr. Webb recommended immediate action along the lines suggested in the report mentioned in the first paragraph of this letter. The matter was taken up with the Minister and the following telegram was sent to Mr. Perry on the third instant:\n\n\"Authorize Dominion Water Power Branch to install water supply, Alberni School, at cost not exceeding Thirteen Hundred Sixty Dollars.

While at the school, at the request of the Indian Department officials I had Mr. Tredcroft look into the matter of developing a water supply for fire protection as the domestic source is insufficient.

Enclosed herewith, is a copy of his reply. From this I judge that the advance made will cover his salary except for three days pay amounting to $18.11 which Mr. Webb suggests could be paid from the Indian General Account.\n\nI should be obliged if you would advise me in regard to this, as you will note that Mr. Webb desires to have the decision of the Indian department wired to him so that his report may be completed and the account closed out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T.

Tredcroft for work on the Alberni pipeline repairs. It is noted the Indian Department suggest that this should be paid from advance of $1430.00 as part of labour costs, in view of the fact that allowance was made for supervision in Mr. Warren's report of February 9, 1935. Unfortunately the total expenditures on this project to date amount to $1427.46. The amount provided in the estimate was $1430.00. The three days pay due Mr. Tredcroft for November 30th and December 2nd and 3rd, amount to $10.11.\n\nIt will therefore be impossible to complete the payment from the appropriation. I think it would be advisable to take the remainder of the monies due Mr. Tredcroft from the Indian General Account which is an advance against minor general investigations and studies throughout the province.\n\nPlease wire the decision of the Indian Department as I have a report to submit on the repairs to the domestic water supply system and wish to close out the account under E.R.3855.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.E.

In this connection I might refer you to your letter of October 28th in which it is stated that an accountable cheque for the amount of $1,430.00 will be sent to us to pay the cost of the material and labour.

H. TREDGROFT\n\nVancouver, B.C.,\nDecember 4, 1935.\nVancouver, B.C.,\nDecember 4, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nIn accordance with instructions received from you on October 30th, I proceeded to Alberni on October 31, 1935, for the purpose of carrying out certain repairs to the Alberni Indian School water supply system as recommended by Mr. W.G.Warren in a report by him regarding this subject dated February 9, 1935, and in this connection would report to you as follows:\n\nWORK CARRIED OUT\n\nRepairs to the above water supply system consisted of the installation of 610 lineal feet of 4\" diameter wood stave pipe and 340 lineal feet of 4\" diameter galvanized wrot steel pipe across the Somass river to replace the old 2\" diameter galvanized wrot iron water pipe formerly used, as follows:\n\n1. The installation of 4\" diameter wood stave pipe from a point on the Alberni-Central Lake highway near where the old 2\" diameter school water pipe connects with the City of Alberni's 4\" diameter water main, west for a distance of 110 feet to the east bank of the Somass river.\n\n2. The installation of 340 lineal-feet of 4\" diameter galvanized wrot steel pipe beneath the bed of the Somass river from a point on the east bank of the river to a point on the west bank.\n\n3. The installation of 4\" diameter wood stave\n\nC.E.Webb, Esq.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDominion Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\npipe from a point on the west bank of the Somass river west for a distance of 500 lineal-feet to connect with the school 2\" diameter water main immediately outside the school buildings.\n\nAll of the above wood stave pipe was laid at a depth of three feet beneath the surface of the ground while the 4\" diameter wrot steel pipe which extends across the Somass river was laid at a depth varying from three feet to five feet below the bed of the stream.\n\nMETHODS OF WORK AND MEN EMPLOYED\n\nThe excavation for and the installation of all wood stave pipe on this project was carried out by hand, local Indians being employed exclusively for this kind of labour. The excavation for and the installation of the 4\" diameter wrot steel pipe beneath the bed of the Somass river was carried out by means of a gasoline driven donkey engine operating a 1/2 cubic yard capacity crescent bucket, and when the excavation for the above pipe line was finally completed the assembled pipe was pulled into place by the donkey engine from the east bank of the river. White operators were employed for the operation of the donkey engine, the local Indians being unable to supply experienced men for this type of work.\n\nTESTING OF PIPE\n\nUpon completion of the above work all 4\" diameter wrot steel pipe laid beneath the bed of the Somass river was tested by air to a pressure of 125 lbs. per square inch, when all joints in same, which are of the Vitaulic type, were found\nto be tight and in good order. This test pressure of 125 lbs. per square inch is 30 lbs. per square inch in excess of which the line will normally have to sustain, the normal working pressure in the line being 95 lbs. per square inch.\n\nWAGES PAID\n\nStandard wages were paid for all types of labour engaged on the above project, both to the Indians and white men employed, as follows:\n\n| Labourers | 40 cents per hour |\n| Donkey operator | 67\u00bd \" \" |\n| Riggers | 85 \" \" |\n\nTIME OCCUPIED\n\nWork on the above project, which was rendered somewhat difficult owing to weather conditions and the prevailing high tides, occupied a period of 19 days, commencing on November 4th and being finally completed on November 23, 1935.\n\nCONNECTION TO CITY OF ALBERNI WATER MAIN\n\nUpon completion of the above installation the new 4\" diameter pipe was connected by the City of Alberni to their 4\" diameter water main at the same point as the old 2\" diameter pipe and a new 4\" water meter was installed in the line by the City of Alberni immediately east of the Alberni-Central Lake Highway to replace the old 2\" diameter meter formerly used.\n\nCOST\n\nThe cost of the above project, including the purchase of all material and installation of same, amounted to $1,427.46 against an estimated cost of $1430.00.\nSALVAGE OF OLD 2\" DIAMETER PIPE LINE\n\nUpon completion of the installation of the new pipe line, the old pipe line across the Somass river consisting of 320 lineal feet of 2\" diameter wrought iron pipe, together with 16 Brass hose type couplings, which is in a comparatively good state of repair, was salvaged from the river and is now stored at the Alberni Indian School ready for future use or for sale according to the instructions of the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nREMARKS\n\nThe above installation, when finally completed and inspected by me, was in good order and operating satisfactorily and should, in my opinion, continue to supply the Alberni Indian School with water for domestic purposes without any further trouble.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.H.Tredcroft\nREPORT\n\non\n\nIMPROVEMENTS TO FIRE PROTECTION SYSTEM\n\nat\n\nALBERNI INDIAN SCHOOL\n\nWEST COAST AGENCY\n\nby\n\nE.

H. TREDGROFT\n\nVancouver, B.C.\nDecember 5, 1935.\nVancouver, B.C.,\nDecember 5, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nIn accordance with instructions received from you, I carried out an investigation having reference to improvements necessary to the fire protection system at the Alberni Indian School near Alberni, B.C., and in this regard would report to you as follows:\n\nALBERNI INDIAN SCHOOL\n\nThe Alberni Indian School which has accommodation for 125 children is a four-storey wooden structure, 52 feet in height, 100 feet in length by approximately 75 feet in depth. It has a net value of approximately $80,000 and is situated on the west bank of the Somass river, 3\u00bd miles northwest of the City of Alberni, B.C.\n\nPRESENT WATER SUPPLY\n\nThe Alberni Indian School obtains its water at the present time, for both domestic and fire protection purposes, from the 4\" diameter City of Alberni water main which extends along the east side of the Alberni-Central Lake highway approximately 1,000 feet east of the Alberni Indian School, water being carried from this main by means of a 4\" diameter wood-stave and steel pipe line recently installed by the Department of Indian Affairs, across the Somass river for a distance.\n\nC.H. Webb, Esq., C.E.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDom. Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\nof 950 lineal feet to connect with the school buildings on the opposite side of the river (see accompanying plan).\n\nWATER PRESSURE\n\nThe static pressure in the City of Alberni's water main at the point where the Department of Indian Affairs 4\" diameter pipe connects with same, is 95 pounds per square inch and the static pressure in the fire hydrants immediately in front of the school buildings, which are at an elevation of 38 feet above the City of Alberni's water main, is 78 pounds per square inch.\n\nEXISTING OUTSIDE FIRE PROTECTION SYSTEM\n\nThe Alberni Indian School is protected from fire at the present time by four 2\" diameter stand-pipes connected to the old 2\" diameter water main which surrounds the school building. This old 2\" diameter water main has now been connected to the new 4\" diameter water pipe recently installed across the Somass river and which, as previously stated, connects with the City of Alberni's 4\" diameter water main situated on the opposite side of the river.\n\nAMOUNT OF WATER AVAILABLE AT THE PRESENT TIME IN CASE OF FIRE\n\nOwing to the restricted size of the City of Alberni's water main (4\" diameter) the total amount of water which it would be possible to obtain at the Alberni Indian School in the event of fire would be approximately 100 U.S. gallons per minute at a working pressure of 30 lbs. per square inch and while this amount of water would be of help in extinguishing a small blaze.\nit would be practically useless in the event of any serious outbreak of fire.\n\nIn addition to the above the old 2\" diameter water main which surrounds the school building and to which two of the present standpipes are connected, is now so badly corroded in the inside that at certain places its effective internal diameter is not more than one-half its original size i.e. 1\" diameter in place of 2\" diameter, and the standpipe heads or valves, which are of an old type, are themselves in a poor state of repair. Out of four standpipes available for use, only three are actually equipped with standpipe heads and of these three standpipe heads, only two of same are equipped with 2\" to 1\u00bd\" reducers which are necessary to enable the 1\u00bd\" diameter fire hose supplied to this school to be connected to them in the event of fire.\n\nEXISTING INSIDE FIRE PROTECTION SYSTEM\n\nIn so far as inside fire protection at the Alberni Indian School is concerned, except for the small amount of water at present available (100 U.S.G.F.M.) the installation is quite satisfactory. The building is well piped on the inside for fire protection purposes, with sufficient outlets on each floor to ensure a proper degree of safety in the event of fire. Moreover each outlet is properly equipped with a hose and nozzle attached to the outlet and stored on racks nearby, ready for instant use.\nThe building is also provided with an adequate number of chemical fire extinguishers for use in case of an emergency.\n\nAMOUNT OF WATER NECESSARY FOR FIRE PROTECTION\n\nThe minimum amount of water necessary to safely take care of any serious outbreak of fire which may occur at the Alberni Indian School, is 500 U.S. G.P.M., i.e., two standard fire streams of 240 U.S. G.P.M. delivering water through 1-1/8\" diameter nozzles and with water delivered in the main at a pressure of 60 lbs. per square inch when two hydrants are operating simultaneously.\n\nIn order to supply the above amount of water it will be necessary to increase the capacity of the present school water system very materially and owing to the fact that the City of Alberni's water system is of limited capacity, together with the fact that the City is in no way considering the renewal or enlargement of their existing 4\" diameter water main along the Alberni-Central Lake highway, no improvement to the present supply can be expected from this source. For this reason, if any improvements are to be carried out it will be necessary to obtain water from the only other available supply, which is by pumping from the Somass river nearby.\n\nPROPOSED FIRE PROTECTION SYSTEM\n\nIn view of the above consideration and in view of the fact that the present supply of water (100 U.S. G.P.M.) is entirely inadequate for\nfire protection purposes at the above institution,\nI would hereby recommend that a complete new system\nof fire protection be installed, water being obtained\nfrom the Somass river by means of a gasoline oper-\nated fire pump and motor, delivering water to the\nschool fire mains through a separate system of\ndelivery pipes as outlined below and which would\nrequire:\n\n1. The installation of 1 - 500 U.S. G.P.M. Centrif-\nugal pump operated by 1 50-60 H.P. gasoline engine\nsituated on the west bank of the Somass river and\nhoused in a wooden pump house having concrete floor\nand foundations and which would obtain water from\na concrete intake well connected to the Somass river\nby means of a 14\" diameter Vitrifical supply pipe.\n\n2. The installation of 480 lineal feet of 6\" diam-\neter wood stave delivery pipe to deliver water\nfrom the proposed fire pump at the edge of the Somass\nriver to the school fire mains immediately surround-\ning the school buildings.\n\n3. The installation of 200 lineal feet of 5\" dia-\nmeter and 270 lineal feet of 4\" diameter wood stave\nfire main which would surround the school buildings\non three sides and to which the hydrants would be\nconnected (see accompanying plan).\n\n4. The installation of four standard 2\u00bd\" diameter\nfire hydrants situated so that one hydrant would\nbe placed at approximately each corner of the school\nbuildings and at a distance of not less than 50 feet\nfrom the nearest wall, these hydrants to be so\narranged that a fire in any part of the building\ncan be immediately covered by two standard fire\nstreams, two of these hydrants should be of the stand-\nard monitor type (i.e. having a swivel nozzle attached\npermanently to the hydrant standard and operating from the hydrant without the use of fire hose) while the other two hydrants should be of the standard fire hose type each equipped with 150 lineal feet of 2\u00bd\" diameter rubber lined fire hose. All four hydrants should be equipped with standard 1-1/8\" diameter smooth nozzles.\n\nThe above fire hydrants should be placed around the school buildings alternately so that each side of the building can be covered if necessary by one monitor type and one standard fire hose type hydrant.\n\nThe use of monitor type hydrants as described above will allow a fire stream to be played upon any portion of the outside of the school buildings immediately a fire is discovered without the necessity of running out any fire hose, which in itself is of great advantage at an institution such as the above where it may be expected that a minimum of trained help will be available for work of that kind.\n\nIn addition to the above I would point out that whereas the proposed new fire pump is intended to supply water to the outside fire mains, while the existing 4\" diameter pipe connected to the City of Alberni water main will continue to supply water to the inside fire hydrants, I would recommend that a connection between the two systems be made so that the outside fire mains may be kept full of water from the city main for immediate use in the event of fire until such time as the fire pumps can be started, and that a check valve be placed in this connection so that water from the fire pump cannot\npass from the outside fire main into the inside fire main with a subsequent possible contamination of the domestic supply.\n\nCOST\n\nThe cost of the proposed fire protection system including the purchase of both pump and motor, the construction of the pump house and well, the installation of all delivery pipe, fire mains etc. together with the installation of all hydrants, fire-hose, fire-hose houses, fittings etc. will amount to $3,600.00.\n\nREMARKS\n\nIn view of conditions outlined in the above report and the fact that the Alberni Indian School, which houses approximately 120 children, is without an adequate supply of water at the present time for fire protection purposes, I would hereby recommend that the above proposed fire protection system be installed and that in order to ensure its proper maintenance and operation frequent fire-drills with this pump be carried out until such time as the personnel who will be required to operate same in the event of fire are thoroughly familiar with its use. In addition to the above I would recommend that all equipment relating to fire protection at the above institution be periodically inspected and tested by a responsible officer of the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.H.

The work in this connection is described in the report by Mr. E.H. Tredcroft, dated December 4th, copy of which is enclosed. The cost of this work amounted to \u00a31,427.46 being slightly less than the estimate. Mr. Webb states that a copy of this report has been sent to Mr. Perry.\n\nThere is also enclosed herewith, a report by Mr. Tredcroft, dated December 5th, in which he recommends the installation of a new fire protection system to serve the Alberni School by means of water pumped directly from the Somass River.

It is noted, from the Engineer's report, that the cost of the scheme, as outlined by him, would be $3,600. The Department has not arranged to provide funds for this purpose in the Appropriation for the coming fiscal year and therefore does not intend to authorize proceeding with the work. The school authorities will have to carry on under present conditions, and they should exercise every care to see that all fire hazard is overcome as far as possible.

It is felt that this action should precede any recommendations from this office to the Department on the subject.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"C.C.Perry.\"\nAsst.

I am not at all conversant with pumping water to the height of 100 ft. with a gasoline engine.\n\nRe the school authorities undertaking to finance the expenditure seems to me quite impossible either from the per capita grant or from special grant from the Church. All the other permanent fixtures of the school are Department property and with the present stringency of funds it is not likely that those in authority in the Church offices would consider spending this amount on the fire protection.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n\"F.E.

Mr. Webb gives a full explanation of the difficulties encountered in connection with this work and of the extra work included in preparing the report on fire protection and suggests two ways in which the salary payment might be adjusted. I should be glad to have your instructions in regard to this matter.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nA.F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6433, File 877-5, part 4)\nJanuary 20, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 15th instant with reference to the non-payment of Mr. Tredcroft's time during the month of November last, amounting to $145.23, it has not been our practice to include engineer's salaries in estimates of cost prepared for the Department of Indian Affairs, it being generally assumed that the engineer's salary will be paid from the general appropriation. It is only when an additional engineer is required such as in the case of Mr. Tredcroft, that this particular question may arise.\n\nYour letter of August 15th, your file 2543A, quoting a letter from the Department of Indian Affairs authorizing Mr. Tredcroft's employment on the Nanaimo No. 185 Laying project, intimated that his salary was not to be paid from the appropriation but when his employment was subsequently continued for the Alberni job we took it the same contention would exist i.e., his salary would be paid from Ottawa and not from the appropriation of $1430.00 received here. In any event the work was carried out as expeditiously as possible and in a satisfactory manner and it is fortunate it was undertaken when it was as heavy rains occurred when the work was nearly finished and the Sushwap river rose considerably which would have caused considerable trouble had the work not been advanced as far as it was. As you know this work was rather precarious and called for the laying of a pipeline in the bed of the Sushwap river. Our estimate of cost was based on the assumption that the work would be done during the extremely low water stage. When the authorization for the work came this stage had passed for 1935. While the water level was not high it was considerably above its lowest stage prolonging the time required for the installation. Some years low water extends into November but this year such was not the case.\n\nWhile installing the pipeline for the domestic water supply system to the school, at the request of the Indian Department officials I had Mr. Tredcroft make an investigation into the possibilities of improving the fire fighting facilities at the school which have been reported as unsatisfactory. This report, together with the report\n\nJ.T. Johnston, Esq.C.E.,\nDirector,\nDom. Water Power & Hydrom.Bureau,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6433, File 877-5, part 4)\non the completion of the domestic water supply improvements, has been forwarded to Ottawa for consideration. The preparation of this report naturally took several days.\n\nThe situation in respect to this matter is at present as follows:\n\nUnder \u00a3R.355 the sum of \u00a31430. was received all of which has been expended. Tredcroft worked 33 days, one day in October, thirty days in November and two days in December. His time for the one day in October and twenty-nine days in November was sent, as customary, to Ottawa for payment, all other expenditures being charged against \u00a3R.3855. The total cost of the work exclusive of Tredcroft's salary amounted to \u00a31427.46. With authorization to pay Tredcroft for the two additional days which he worked over the 30 days, was received, he was paid by cheque here, \u00a32.54 being charged to \u00a3R.3855 closing out the account and the balance \u00a312.57 taken from Indian General funds.\n\nTredcroft was paid by Departmental cheque No.27848 received with your letter of November 29th last, for one day's work in October on this job. He therefore had owing to him payment for 29 days in November, the sum of \u00a3178.83 which paylist was sent to you under date of December 4th (note: this paylist was in error reading \u00a3178.54 instead of the correct figure \u00a3178.83).\n\nIt was only when your letter of December 31st arrived enclosing only MacNaughton's cheque that we realized there might be some misunderstanding in regard to Tredcroft's salary payment.\n\nSo far as I can see there are two ways in which this salary payment might be adjusted.\n\n1. In view of the fact that the improvements were carried out under unfavourable weather conditions and not during the period of lowest water in the Somass river, the expenditures were naturally greater and also in view of the fact that an investigation was, in addition made of the possible improvements to the fire fighting apparatus at the school and report prepared, the appropriation of \u00a31430. should be increased by an amount of \u00a3178.83 in order that all payments under this heading may be met.\n\n2. Our Indian General Fund has been set up to cover the cost of incidental investigations and emergency minor repairs. It was essential that this work be undertaken when it was, had it been necessary to delay its commencement awaiting authorization for Mr. Tredcroft's employment it could only have been carried out at an extremely high cost and possibly not at all until lower water conditions obtained next year. In the meantime the Indian school might have been without water had a break occurred in the temporary pipeline laid on the bed of the stream.\nIn view of these extraordinary circumstances it would appear there is ample justification to pay for this additional cost charge of $178.83 from the Indian General fund and if approved I will issue a cheque to Tredcroft from this fund.\n\nI would ask you to bear in mind that no engineer's salary is included in any of our reports unless so specified.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.E. Webb\nDistrict Chief Engineer\nOttawa, February 7th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nWith reference to your 2543-W.\"A\" of the 27th ultimo regarding the work done by Mr. Tredcroft in supervising the repairs to the water supply at the Alberni Indian Residential School, this Department is arranging to forward you a cheque for $178.83.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

Webb\nDistrict Chief Engineer\nFebruary 28, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nI regret to inform you that since the Alberni School account was reported closed, another bill has come in from the B.C. Electric Railway Co., Victoria, dated January 29, 1936, for moving guy rope and installing transformers $20.97. Upon investigation I find that there is also an account outstanding with the Alberni Machine Shops for machinist work. This account has not been presented, although I have written for it. The amount is estimated at between $10.00 and $15.00.\n\nAlso, owing to an omission in posting from the Cash Book to the Ledger, a credit of $4.92 did not appear in the latter. In consequence when I reported a balance of $2.54 on hand and suggested paying Mr. Tredcroft for these extra days' service, from General Surveys funds, the balance in the Alberni Account should have been $24.46.\n\nThen this correction was made the whole of Mr. Tredcroft's 3 days salary $18.11, was charged to Alberni School, which leaves a balance of $6.35 at credit of that account.\n\nIt still have to provide for the items mentioned in the first paragraph above amounting approximately $45.00.\n\nThe concluding paragraph of the Indian Affairs letter to you dated December 30, 1935, \"W'A\", reads:\n\n\"Work at the Alberni Indian Residential School being made from the Appropriation for Education and, consequently, the advance forwarded to Mr. Tredcroft distinctly show that the advance paid from Indian Affairs in order that we may make the adjustment in our books.\"\n\nThis would seem to indicate a certain degree of care in the Indian Department's accounts and wondering if, under the circumstances, the balance of those accounts (B.C. Electric and Machine Shop) not providable from the School account, could be...\nSir,\n\nWith reference to my letter of the 5th instant regarding the work of replacing the water pipe supplying the Alberni Indian residential school, I enclose herewith, copy of a letter from Mr. Webb, dated the 2nd instant, in which he states that the account with the Alberni Machine Shops, estimated at from $10.00 to $15.00, has now been received and amounts to $23.83 and increases the amount outstanding to $54.80.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMarch 2, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nReverting to my letter of February 28th concerning the outstanding accounts chargeable to the Alberni School account, I have now received the account referred to as the Alberni Machine Shops and estimated at $10. to $15.00. This account is from the Alberni Engineering Works and amounts to $23.85.\n\nThis will make accounts amounting to $54.80 outstanding, against which I hold a balance of $6.35.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.E.

I should be glad to know if his suggestion meets with your approval. The alternative would appear to be to ask Mr. Webb to certify the accounts for payment and send them to this office for transmission to the Indian Department from which they could be paid direct.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T.

I hesitate to state that it was overcrowded. The Principal tells me that the windows are kept open. On the whole I think that a room now used as a store room, but which was once used as a dormitory, should be again used as such on the girls' side of the school. The corresponding room on the boys' side is so used as a dormitory for the small boys. This prevents overcrowding on their side of the school.

He opened the door and found the smoke too dense to enter. He looked the door again, and went down for a chemical extinguisher, but was unable to do much good.\n\nFighting of Fire.\n\nThe Alberni Fire Department were notified, and responded, arriving about 20 minutes after the fire started.\n\nThe fire engine of the Alberni Pacific Lumber Company also arrived to assist, but were unable to do much good, owing to trouble with their engines.\n\nProgress of Fire.\n\nThe fire was very soon out of control, chiefly owing to lack of water pressure. The supply for this purpose is drawn from the Alberni City reservoir, and supplied to the school by gravity flow.\n\nBy 10:30 A.M. the school was completely destroyed.\n\nEvacuation of Building.\n\nThe Reverend Principal does not appear to have a very clear recollection as to how the children left the building, but, from what I can learn from the teachers, they simply walked out.\n\nThe girls each brought a blanket with them, and were subsequently taken care of by Mrs. Sainsbury.\n\nThe older boys assisted in removing furniture, etc., from the building, and dispersed to various parts of the nearby reserves.\n\n- Notification\nNotification of Fire.\n\nI was notified of the fire at 12 noon, by a constable of the B.C. Provincial Police, and immediately proceeded to the scene.\n\nI was not notified in any way by the Reverend Principal or by any member of his staff, although I have phones in both office and residence.\n\nAction of Agent.\n\nOn arrival at scene of fire, I endeavoured to locate the children, and to care for any without shelter.\n\nAll the children were housed by 5 p.m. The following morning, the greater majority of those not resident in Alberni were sent home in care of their parents, or relatives.\n\nOwing to fire occurring on Sunday, it was not possible to communicate with the Department by telegraph, but I phoned to Victoria and informed Mr. C.

There were no casualties.\n\nThe Alberni Indian Residential School, conducted under the auspices of the United Church of Canada, is situated about two miles from the town of Alberni, B.C., Electoral District of Comox-Alberni. It was a frame building, erected by this Department in 1920, at a cost of approximately $75,000.\n\nOne hundred and nineteen (119) children were in residence.\n\nI am instructing the Indian Agent, by wire, to return to their homes those children whose parents are able to support them, as no other provision can be made for them at the present time. There is accommodation for about fifteen (15) or twenty (20) children in the Ahousaht Indian Residential School and the Indian Agent is being authorized to place in that school those pupils whose parents are dead or whose home conditions are unsuitable for their return.\n\nDirector.\nMOA VIA VICTORIA BC\n\nPORT ALBERNI BC 22 900A\n\nSECY INDIAN BRANCH\n\nDEPT MINES AND RESOURCES OTTAWA ONT\n\nALBERNI RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL DESTROYED BY FIRE WRITING COMPLETE\n\nREPORT NO CASUALTIES PLEASE ADVISE DISPOSITION OF CHILDREN CAN PLACE FEW AT OTHER SCHOOLS\n\nP B ASHBRIDGE.\nOffice of the Indian Affairs\n\nJanuary 31, 1927\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 724, amounting to $40.00 in favour of Alberni Residential School, Alberni, B.C., for Alberni Residential School, January 1927.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 158-2-E dated October 7, 1926.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 518\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\nTo: [Name], Indian Residential School.\n\n---\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n|      | Allowance towards salary, night watchman, at Albemarle Indian Residential School, for the month of January 1937. | 60.00 |\n\n---\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\n---\n\nFORM No. 506\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6433, File 877-5, part 5)\nOttawa, November 5, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, reporting on the condition of the fire escapes and fire fighting appliances at the Alberni Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Department is pleased to note that this school is well equipped to meet emergencies, that all fire fighting appliances are in good condition and that there is ample water pressure. It is noted, also, that the Principal and yourself are of opinion that there is no present need of any further expenditure in connection with the fire equipment and fire escapes at this school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nP. B. Ashbridge, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni,\nB. C.\nCondition of Fire Escapes and Fire Fighting Appliances at Alberni Residential School October 26, 1936.\n\nFire Escapes. There are two fire escapes in the front of building, of iron construction, to which the children have access from all dormitories through the wash rooms. Wash rooms have concrete floors, and windows leading to escapes are kept on latch easily opened. Escapes are kept in good order. School was emptied under two minutes at inspection.\n\nPyrenes and Axes. There are 3 five gallon, and 6 small pyrenes placed at various parts of the building, also fire axes on each floor.\n\nFire Alarm. Large gong, electrically operated from box on each floor. In good working order, and sufficiently loud to arouse the whole school.\n\nStand Pipes and Hose. Stand pipe extends through the centre of the building, and hose connections with hose attached on each floor. There is also a hydrant outside of the building, with hose attached.\n\nWater Pressure. The water pressure is about 80 lbs., and sufficient to throw a stream over the roof. Water is supplied from the City reservoir, by gravity. Due to small storage capacity, the pressure could not be relied upon for any great length of time.\n\nFire Drill. The children are well disciplined, and understand their stations in case of fire. The staff also have their appointed stations, and drills are well conducted.\n\nGeneral. This school is well equipped to meet emergencies, and fire escapes are placed in that part of the building least likely to suffer from fire. Pyrenes, hose, axes, and axes are placed at advantageous spots, and the staff and children educated in their use. With the addition of the watchman, it is considered that present facilities are sufficient and the school well protected. No further expenditure is recommended in fire appliances for this school. This opinion is also shared by the Reverend Principal.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nPBA/AM.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, October 14, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your 113Q/3G/D of the 24th ultimo, regarding the accounts submitted, covering cost of labour and material for painting roof of main building at the Alberni Indian Residential School. In this connection I have to say that a cheque, to the amount of $500.00, is being sent Reverend F. E. Pitts, the Principal, in payment for material and labour.\n\nYou should inform the Principal that, in future, he is not to undertake any work for which the Department will be called upon to pay, until he has first received definite authority regarding labour and purchase of material. If work is undertaken without authority, the Department cannot be responsible for payment of costs.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nP. B. Ashbridge, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni,\nB. C.\nOctober 6, 1926\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nI have to refer to my memorandum dated July 24th, last, requesting to be advised the name of the firm from whom to purchase paint, and also the foreman to be employed in the painting of the roof of the main building and other miscellaneous repairs and painting, at the Indian Residential School, Port Alberni, B.C. (Electoral District of Comox-Alberni).\n\nYou instructed that the paint be purchased from John Thomson, Alberni, B.C., and that Alexander J. Thomas, Fort Alberni, be employed as painter. The local Indian Agent was advised accordingly.\n\nThe accounts covering the cost of this work have been received. A certain portion of the paint was purchased from John Thomson, and Alexander J. Thomas was employed in carrying out part of the labour. Besides the above, considerable of the labour was performed by Walter Adams and J.W. Georgeson - both of Alberni; and, while the greater part of the paint was obtained from John Thomson, purchase was also made from Carter's General Store and A. McDonald & Sons - both of Fort Alberni, B.C.\n\nThe local Indian Agent was requested to state why the instructions given him, regarding the labour and the purchase of the paint, were not carried out. He now advises as follows:\n\n\"On receipt of official letter of July 29, 1926, I immediately informed Rev. E.F. Pitts as to\n\n- the Department's Schools\nthe Department's instructions re labour and material, only to discover that he had already commenced the work and purchased some paint, etc., from A. McDonald and Sons and Carter's General Store. This, he did in anticipation of authority being granted and upon his own responsibility and not with my knowledge or instruction.\n\n\"Immediate steps were taken to rectify this but, unfortunately, due to my being up the Coast at the time the work had been started, the purchases mentioned had been made, and Walter Adams and J.

This is the same rate and for the same period as we provide grants for this purpose at a number of other schools, where there is fire hazard.\n\nYou should immediately request each Principal to obtain the services of a reliable man to carry out the duties as night watchman. He should make hourly visits during the night throughout the building and especially pay attention to the furnace room or where there is any danger of fire. Should it be necessary to pay a watchman more salary than the grant we allow, the school authorities will be responsible for payment of same, from per capita allowances or other receipts of the school.\n\nThe Department will rely on yourself and the Principals to see that this service begins as from November first, next. Payment of the allowance made by this Department towards salary of the watchman will be made at the end of each month, upon receipt of a voucher, in triplicate, from you. The voucher should be drawn, in the case of each school, as per the sample enclosed. Payment of the allowance will be made the Principals and not to the man employed, at each school.\n\nI would request that you communicate with the Department, stating the name and, briefly, the qualifications of the men who are engaged as night watchmen at each of the above named schools, and also the date they began duties. This matter should receive your immediate attention.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nP. B. Ashbridge, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B. C.\n\nA. F.

(RG 10, Volume 6433, File 877-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to submit my report on the fire at Alberni Residential School, which destroyed this building on February 21st, 1937.\n\nDiscovery of Fire.\n\nThe fire, which apparently started in the store room above the girl's dormitory, was first discovered by Miss Audrey Mills, teacher, who was at that time in the girl's dormitory.\n\nShe reports hearing a roar, and on investigation saw smoke coming from the upper landing.\n\nMiss Mills immediately rang in the alarm from the fire station, and went in search of the Principal.\n\nImmediate Action.\n\nMr. Pitts states that he ran upstairs, and saw smoke issuing from under the locked door of the store room. He opened the door and found the smoke too dense to enter. He locked the door again, and went down for a chemical extinguisher, but was unable to do much good.\n\nighting of Fire.\n\nThe Alberni Fire Department were notified, and responded, arriving about 20 minutes after the fire started.\n\nThe fire engine of the Alberni Pacific Lumber Company also arrived to assist, but were unable to do much good, owing to trouble with their engine.\n\nProgress of Fire.\n\nThe fire was very soon out of control, chiefly owing to lack of water pressure. The supply for this purpose is drawn from the Alberni City reservoir, and supplied to the school by gravity flow.\n\nBy 10:30 A.M., the school was completely destroyed.\nReport on fire at Alberni Residential School. (cont.)\n\nEvacuation of Building.\n\nThe Reverend Principal does not appear to have a very clear recollection as to how the children left the building, but, from what I can learn from the teachers, they simply walked out.\n\nThe girls each brought a blanket with them, and were subsequently taken care of by Mrs. Sainsbury.\n\nThe older boys assisted in removing furniture, etc., from the building, and dispersed to various parts of the nearby reserves.\n\nNotification of Fire.\n\nI was notified of the fire at 12 noon, by a constable of the B.C. Provincial Police, and immediately proceeded to the scene.\n\nI was not notified in any way by the Reverend Principal, or by any member of his staff, although I have phones in both office and residence.\n\nAction of Agent.\n\nOn arrival at scene of fire, I endeavored to locate the children, and to care for any without shelter.\n\nAll the children were housed by 8 p.m. The following morning, the greater majority of those not resident in Alberni were sent home in care of their parents, or relatives.\n\nOwing to fire occurring on Sunday, it was not possible to communicate with the Department by telegraph, but I phoned to Victoria and informed Mr. C. C. Perry, Assistant Commissioner, of the matter.\n\nFire Loss.\n\nThe main school building is completely destroyed, only the stone foundation being left.\n\nThe large chimney, which was still standing, was leaning at a dangerous angle, and this I had dropped, as it was a menace.\n\nPractically all of the school equipment was destroyed, as was most of the clothing of both staff and children.\nReport on fire at Alberni Residential School. (cont.)\n\nSalvage.\n\nSome furniture was saved from the lower floor, chiefly property of Mr. Pitts, piano, sewing machines, desks, and bookcases, etc.\n\nRemaining Buildings.\n\nBuildings not damaged by fire were:\n- The large barn containing 35 head of cattle\n- Agricultural Instructor's cottage\n- Primary Classroom\n- Small Cottage\n- Old Barn\n- Garage\n- Wood Shed\n- Implement Shed.\n\nInvestigation.\n\nCapt. G. H. Barry, Inspector of Schools arrived on Monday evening, February 23rd, and rendered valuable assistance in investigating matters.\n\nAccompanied by myself, he visited the site of the school, and questioned members of the staff, as to the cause of the fire.\n\nThe answers given were very unsatisfactory and contradictory, except those given by teachers, Miss Howe and Miss Mills, dealing with the discovery and alarm.\n\nAs to the cause, I have no reason to believe it was other than accidental, possibly from overheated chimney. Evasive answers were given by the kitchen staff as to the probable cause, but it was found that a pan of grease took fire in the oven about 7:45 A.M., the time of the fire.\n\nCare of Children.\n\nAll school children, except those of the Cowichan Agency, have been sent to their homes, and these will be leaving on February 23rd.\n\nArrangements are being made to send some neglected and orphan children to Ahousaht School. These will be taken on the Department Launch. To date, no expense has been incurred in connection with the evacuation of the school children.\nReport on fire at Alberni Residential School. (Cont.)\n\nCare of Remaining Buildings and Stock.\n\nThe Reverend Principal and staff are remaining at the school, until final arrangements can be made, and will care for the stock, which consists of 35 head of cattle, together with the buildings before mentioned, and, of course, the farm.\n\nGeneral.\n\nIn the foregoing report, I have endeavored to cover the subject as thoroughly as circumstances permit at this time.\n\nMr. Inspector Barry is forwarding his own report, with his views as to the cause of the fire, and with which I thoroughly agree.\n\nRespectfully Submitted,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP. B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nReport on Fire at Alberni Indian Residential School: Page 4.\n\n**ACTIONS TAKEN BY INDIAN AGENT:**\n\nMr. Indian Agent Ashbridge will render his own report; but I should like to say that when I arrived in Port Alberni he had the situation well in hand.\n\nI shall remain for a few days to render Mr Ashbridge any help in my power, and to carry out any investigation which the Indian Commissioner may wish, but in the absence of definite instructions to the contrary I propose to return to Victoria at the end of the week or not later than February 26th.\n\nIn addition to informing the Assistant Indian Commissioner in Victoria by telephone of the fire by 2 P.M. on the 21st Mr Ashbridge wired to the Indian Affairs Branch in Ottawa this morning as soon as the telegraph office was open. Mr Ashbridge also wired to the Principal of the Ahousaht Indian Residential School today and learned that the Principal, Mr A.E.Caldwell could accommodate up to twenty five children if he were given some extra beds and bedding.\n\n**MOVEMENTS OF CHILDREN SINCE FIRE:**\n\nAt the time of my last inspection on December 10th 1936 there were 70 boys and 53 girls in the Alberni Indian Residential School.\n\nSince the fire yesterday morning some 45 children from the local Indian Reserves have gone home to their parents. A number of children from more distant places are staying with relatives or friends on the local Reserves. Some 50 or more children have gone home to outside points with their parents in their own boats.\n\nThere remain to-night some twenty to thirty children whose parents have not come for them and who in fact for the most part live in different parts of the Cowichan Agency. Mr Indian Agent Ashbridge is arranging with Mr Indian Agent Graham to move the remaining children to Nanaimo with a suitable escort. From Nanaimo it is hoped that Mr Graham will be able to arrange the movements of children to their own homes or to those of friends in one or two special cases.\n\nMr Indian Agent Ashbridge and I are agreed that it is necessary to get the few children left on the school property home as soon as possible. Many of the children are only lately recovering from illness, and there is no proper accommodation now at the school for these children.\n\nThere is no need for the movement of these children to other Indian Residential Schools at the present time. Should such cases arise from special conditions no doubt the Indian Agents will communicate with the Department. I had thought that it would be necessary to move some at least of the children to Coqualeetza and to Ahousaht, but such children as will in the end have to be sent there are being looked after for the present in the homes of friends or relatives, if not in fact at home.\n\nThere are some 33 head of cattle on the farm attached to the school. A recommendation as to their disposal will be made in my next report. In the meantime there is a Farm Instructor to look after their needs.\nHIGH SCHOOL PUPILS:\n\nThere are three boys attending the Alberni District High School. These boys are living on the local Indian Reserve and are continuing to attend the District High School under instructions from Mr. Pitts.\n\nRECENT DEATHS OF PUPILS:\n\nMr. Ashbridge has brought to my notice the fact that on or about the 14th of the present month three girl pupils of this school died in hospital. They all died from T.B., Meningitis I am informed. The girls were:\n\nMARY BOB Duncan\nBERTHA FRED Alberni\nVIOLET MCKAY Ucluelet\n\nI also understand that some boys have been giving trouble at the school, but I have not had time to inquire into this yet.\n\nCAUSE OF FIRE:\n\nI wish to say at once that I am not as yet satisfied that the cause of the fire was accidental. There are features that lead me to think that this fire might possibly have been caused by a pupil.\n\nWILLIAM and LOUE BOB Brothers of and GERTIE BOB Sister of the deceased Mary Bob should be I think investigated. The other dead children appear to have been without brothers or sisters at the school.\n\nThe previous school here was burned on the 3rd of June 1917.\n\nNEW SCHOOL:\n\nThe Reverend Principal has suggested to me that the right course to follow would be for the Indian Affairs Branch to build a new Residential School to care for the children lately at the Alberni Residential School, and to absorb those now at Ahousaht, and the Uclulet Day School.\n\nI would most earnestly and with the greatest respect submit that great caution be taken in making any promise to the United Church of Canada with regard to the rebuilding of this school.\n\nI do not believe that the Alberni Indian Residential School is wanted as such, or that the expense in per capita grants here is justified. The Principal informed me to-night that he could not suggest any child who should go at once to another Residential School on the grounds of having poor home conditions. If this is so it is indeed hard to justify the presence of the children in any Residential School.\n\nI do consider that a large Indian Day School should be located on one of the Indian Reserves near Alberni and I would strongly recommend that if not entirely too late, the sum of at least $5,000.00 be set aside in the Supplementary Estimates for the erection of such a school before next September.\n\nPort Alberni, B.C.\nFebruary 23, 1937.\n\nGerald H. Barry\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nSomass Hotel,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\n\nFebruary 23, 1887.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI am forwarding herewith my Preliminary Report on the destruction by fire of the Alberni Indian Residential School, West Coast Agency.\n\nIt is now after 2 A.M. on the 23rd and I have been at work on this report since Mr. Indian Agent Ashbridge left me about 10 P.M. Under the special circumstances I believe that you will be glad to have some particulars of the burning of this school at the earliest possible moment; but I would ask you and the officials of the Indian Affairs Branch who may read the report to forgive mistakes and errors as I am very tired indeed after a most difficult journey and a number of interviews.\n\nMr. Ashbridge and I shall visit the Indian Residential School property at Alberni to-morrow or rather this morning, Tuesday the 23rd, and I shall prepare a further report on that visit and forward it without delay.\n\nVery little help can be had from the Reverend Mr. Pitts. As I have reported several times Mr Pitts is a very poor organizer and he appears to have lost his head completely. Mr. Indian Agent Ashbridge has excellent control of the situation. He is unhappy that he is unable to get a report off to you to-night, but trusts that the attached report of mine which he has read will be sufficient till he and I complete our investigations to-morrow.\n\nMay I most strongly urge in this confidential letter that the United Church of Canada be not given any promise with regard to the rebuilding of the Alberni Indian Residential School. An Indian Day School is required here with well trained teachers and not a badly managed Residential School such as the Alberni School has been for a number of years. I do not believe that the Residential Schools are worth the large sums spent on them, though some will have to be kept in operation for various reasons. The Alberni Residential School is not one of these, what the Church may urge to the contrary notwithstanding.\n\nA copy of this letter and of my report is being addressed to you in care of the Indian Agent, Vancouver as you may have left Victoria before the original can reach you there. Please wire me any further instructions that may be necessary.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nPurpose of Report:\n\nActing on the instructions of the Indian Commissioner for British Columbia, I left Victoria on Sunday, February 21st, spent that night in Nanaimo, and arrived in Port Alberni at 4:45 P.M. this afternoon February 22, 1937.\n\nFrom 5 P.M. to 6 P.M. was spent in the office of Mr. Indian Agent Ashbridge. The Indian Agent gave me a clear account of what he knew of the destruction by fire of the Alberni Indian Residential School on the morning of Sunday, February 21st 1937.\n\nThe Principal of the school, the Rev. F.E. Pitts, B.A., was good enough to meet the Indian Agent and myself at the Sans Souci Hotel from about 7:30 P.M. to 8:30 P.M. This Monday evening Mr Pitts was able to clear up a number of points with regard to which the Indian Agent had not been informed.\n\nThe purpose of this report is to inform the Indian Commissioner and the Indian Affairs Branch at the earliest possible moment of the facts so far brought to light with regard to the burning of the Alberni Indian Residential School. I have arranged to visit the school property with Mr. Ashbridge to-morrow but this Preliminary Report has to be prepared to-night to catch the mail leaving early in the morning.\n\nA further report will be made when I have seen what is left of the school building, and interviewed some of the school staff, and such report will be mailed on the morning of the 24th.\n\nDISCOVERY OF FIRE:\n\nThe Principal states that two teachers, Miss Audrey S. Mills, and Miss Kathleen How, who were not present at early prayers, and who reside on the second floor of the building, saw smoke about 8 A.M. They immediately rang the fire alarm.\n\nThe children were at the time at breakfast.\n\nRESULT OF FIRE ALARM:\n\nThe Principal states that the children left the building by the side doors. Two that were ill in bed appear to have got up, and walked out of the building. The reverend Principal does not seem clear in his mind as to what did happen to the children. He tried to locate the actual fire, and found that there were flames and smoke around the locked door of the attic room on the girls' side of the school. He states that this attic was always kept locked and that only he and Mrs Pitts had keys of the Yale Lock on the door. He unlocked the door and found the attic in flames. He then ran down to the main floor and returned to the attic with a chair and fire extinguisher. He could not make much use of this as the smoke drove him away.\n\nIn the mean time Mr Shaw, the farm Instructor, had turned on the water of the stand pipe and had tried to put water on the fire through the hose. He too was driven away by smoke. Alberni Central Telephone Exchange was informed of the fire by telephone at this time.\nATTIC IN WHICH FIRE APPEARS TO HAVE STARTED:\n\nThis attic was intended to be used as a dormitory on the girls' side, but does not appear ever to have been used as such.\n\nThe corresponding attic room on the boys' side was used for some time as a dormitory.\n\nThe Principal states that the attic on the girls' side was used to store clothes and extra bedding. He denies that cleaning materials were kept there.\n\nThe Principal states that the main flues two, one being from the kitchen I understand, with two ventilation flues, one being from the kitchen, passed through this attic, and that there was a radiator in the ventilation flue. The latter in some way covered with board or boarding or some such material. He thinks that dust in the ventilating flue may have become ignited with sparks from the kitchen. This appears to me to be just a wild guess, but I shall make further investigation. The ventilation flues opened on each floor. I rather wonder if burning paper could have been placed in one of these on a lower floor, and I shall investigate this.\n\nThe above mentioned smoke and ventilation flues were some six feet from the door where the fire was first seen.\n\nPROGRESS OF FIRE:\n\nThe fire appears to have spread quickly through the attics under the roof. The action of the Principal in opening the door of the attic on the girls' side when he discovered that room to be on fire of course increased the draft and spread the fire.\n\nThe school burned from the top downwards and took some hours to do so according to the Principal's statements. He is the only member of the staff that I have seen so far, and it is very clear to me that the Reverend Gentleman completely lost his head.\n\nNOTIFICATION OF FIRE TO INDIAN AGENT:\n\nIt would not appear that the Principal telephoned to the Indian Agent.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Ashbridge informs me that the first he heard of the fire was when the B.C. Police informed him by telephone at about Noon on the 21st FOUR HOURS AFTER THE OUTBREAK and when the school had been destroyed.\nACTUAL FIGHTING OF FIRE:\n\nThe Alberni City Fire Department arrived shortly after the outbreak, within perhaps the first half hour. No doubt the alarm to the Central Telephone Exchange caused the ringing of the town bell as the fire alarm. Some bell was rung.\n\nTwo lines of hose were taken up the iron fire escapes and water thrown on the fire.\n\nReference to my reports on this school will show that the pressure in normal times is only sufficient to throw water from one line of hose to the roof from the ground, but not over the roof. With two lines the water would not reach the roof, but in any case the hose were taken up the fire escapes.\n\nThe pressure fell as the fire was fought, and it is doubtful if there was sufficient water from the City supply.\n\nThe Alberni Pacific Lumber Co. fire pump was brought to the scene of the fire and an attempt made to draw water from the river. Time was wasted with more or less frozen hose lines and the fire pump would not function for some half hour through some defect, I am informed.\n\nACTIONS OF STAFF AND SOME OF THE PUPILS DURING FIRE:\n\nIt would appear that when the children first evacuated the building they just dispersed, and little attempt was made to preserve discipline. This will be investigated.\n\nSome of the staff and some of the boys carried articles out of the building. The girls took a blanket each the Principal informs me, though how they got these I have still to discover. The boys do not appear to have taken blankets with them. Some furniture was removed INCLUDING A PIANO. The Principal states that classroom material and desks were not saved from the main building.\n\nIndians helped to save articles, and the Indian Agent is issuing a Search Warrant as a result, as it is believed that articles were just stolen by the helpers.\n\nThe teachers would appear to have lost most of their clothes and belongings, and the children to have little but what they were wearing at the time.\n\nIn general from the little information in my possession so far it would appear that all the usual foolish mistakes were made and the wrong articles saved, including musical instruments, while children's clothes and blankets except on the girls' side were lost. I am informed two Singer Sewing Machines and the Principal's papers and records were saved.\n\nBUILDINGS SAVED:\n\nThe Primary Classroom and the cottage at one time occupied by the Farm Instructor were not burned. Some boys are being housed in the former and some of the staff and girls are with the Principal's family in the latter.\n\nThe desks and material in the Primary Classroom were of course saved.\nACTION TAKEN BY INDIAN AGENT:\n\nMr. Indian Agent Ashbridge will render his own report; but I should like to say that when I arrived in Port Alberni he had the situation well in hand.\n\nI shall remain for a few days to render Mr Ashbridge any help in my power, and to carry out any investigation which the Indian Commissioner may wish, but in the absence of definite instructions to the contrary I propose to return to Victoria at the end of the week or not later than February 26th.\n\nIn addition to informing the Assistant Indian Commissioner in Victoria by telephone of the fire by 2 P.M., on the 21st Mr Ashbridge wired to the Indian Affairs Branch in Ottawa this morning as soon as the telegraph office was open. Mr Ashbridge also wired to the Principal of the Ahousant Indian Residential School today and learned that the Principal, Mr A.E.Caldwell could accommodate up to twenty five children if he were give some extra beds and bedding.\n\nMOVEMENTS OF CHILDREN SINCE FIRE:\n\nAt the time of my last inspection on December 10th 1936 there were 70 boys and 53 girls in the Alberni Indian Residential School.\n\nSince the fire yesterday morning some 45 children from the local Indian Reserves have gone home to their parents. A number of children from more distant places are staying with relatives or friends on the local Reserves. Some 50 or more children have gone home to outside points with their parents in their own boats.\n\nThere remain to-night some twenty to thirty children whose parents have not come for them and who in fact for the most part live in different parts of the Cowichan Agency. Mr Indian Agent Ashbridge is arrangements with Mr Indian Agent Graham to move the remaining children to Nanaimo with a suitable escort. From Nanaimo it is hoped that Mr Graham will be able to arrange the movements of children to their own homes or to those of friends in one or two special cases.\n\nMr Indian Agent Ashbridge and I are agreed that it is necessary to get the few children left on the school property home as soon as possible. Many of the children are only lately recovering from illness, and there is no proper accommodation now at the school for these children.\n\nThere is no need for the movement of these children to other Indian Residential Schools at the present time. Should such cases arise from special conditions no doubt the Indian Agents will communicate with the Department. I had thought that it would be necessary to move some at least of the children to Coqualeetza and to Ahousant, but such children as will in the end have to be sent there are being looked after for the present in the homes of friends or relatives, if not in fact at home.\n\nThere are some 33 head of cattle on the farm attached to the school. A recommendation as to their disposal will be made in my next report. In the meantime there is a Farm Instructor to look after their needs.\nHIGH SCHOOL PUPILS:\n\nThere are three boys attending the Alberni District High School. These boys are living on the local Indian Reserve and are continuing to attend the District High School under instructions from Mr. Pitts.\n\nRECENT DEATHS OF PUPILS:\n\nMr. Ashbridge has brought to my notice the fact that on or about the 14th of the present month three girl pupils of this school died in hospital. They all died from T.B. Meningitis I am informed. The girls were:\n\nMARY BOB Duncan\nBERTHA FRED Alberni\nVIOLET McKAY Uclulet\n\nI also understand that some boys have been giving trouble at the school, but I have not had time to inquire into this yet.\n\nCAUSE OF FIRE:\n\nI wish to say at once that I am not as yet satisfied that the cause of the fire was accidental. There are features that lead me to think that this fire might possibly have been caused by a pupil.\n\nWILLIAM and LOUE BOB Brothers of and GERTIE BOB Sister of the deceased Mary Bob should be I think investigated. The other dead children appear to have been without brothers or sisters at the school.\n\nThe previous school here was burned on the 3rd of June 1917.\n\nNEW SCHOOL:\n\nThe Reverend Principal has suggested to me that the right course to follow would be for the Indian Affairs Branch to build a new Residential School to care for the children lately at the Alberni Residential School, and to absorb those now at Ahousaht, and the Uclulet Day School.\n\nI would most earnestly and with the greatest respect submit that great caution be taken in making any promise to the United Church of Canada with regard to the rebuilding of this school.\n\nI do not believe that the Alberni Indian Residential School is wanted as such, or that the expense in per capita grants here is justified. The Principal informed me to-night that he could not suggest any child who should go at once to another Residential School on the grounds of having poor home conditions. If this is so it is indeed hard to justify the presence of the children in any Residential School.\n\nI do consider that a large Indian Day School should be located on one of the Indian Reserves near Alberni and I would strongly recommend that if not entirely too late, the sum of at least $5,000.00 be set aside in the Supplementary Estimates for the erection of such a school before next September.\n\nPort Alberni, B.C.\nFebruary 28, 1937.\n\nGerald H.

W. LIPSETT\n\nOttawa, Feb. 16.\u2014The Indian Affairs department has confirmed reports that influenza continues epidemic among Indians in all parts of the Dominion. It was officially stated that the mortality rate has been comparatively low; however, the number of known cases of pneumonia and scarlet fever is small and the cases have proportionately high. There have been many cases of influenza, but all reported have been mild in type.\n\nThe department said that the outbreak of the epidemic had been passed. It was stressed that the epidemic had swept across the Indian population from one end of the Dominion to the other.\n\n400 CREEKS III.\n\nSpecial to The Star\n\nKenora, Feb. 16.\u2014More than 400 Indian school children and hundreds of other Indians have been affected by an epidemic of influenza which has spread through the Indian population of 2,700 in Kenora District this winter. Most of the sickness has been influenza, but there have been several cases of malaria and scarlet fever.\n\nDespite the efforts of Frank Edwards, Indian agent, and the M.O.H.'s district surgeon, Dr. Donaldson, Dr. Mitchell of Sioux Lookout and Dr. A. D. Ferguson of Kenora have been unable to summon upon air companies to get to the scene of reported outbreaks in haste before the epidemic developing into a serious simultaneous outbreak.\n\nAlthough mild, the epidemic is nevertheless making conditions exceedingly difficult for the Indians who have yet developed the resistance of the White against such sickness. In addition, trapping season has been very lean and some may be forced to go without food shortage. No deaths have been reported.\n\nWord of outbreak has been brought to Hudson Bay Co. traders or police. Each Indian agent has obtained a doctor when necessary and has been able to send medical help or medicine to the scene.\nSend the following message, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\nOttawa, Ont., March 3rd, 1937.\n\nP.

I believe that Mr. Indian Agent Ashbridge will be in perfect agreement with me in this matter. Should you consult me with regard to the best interests of the Indian children.

Barry.\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nINSPECTORS REPORT ON THE DESTRUCTION BY FIRE OF THE ALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nUnited Church. West Coast Agency.\n\nDate of investigation: February 23, 1937.\n\nVisit to School Property: Accompanied by Mr. Indian Agent Ashbridge I visited the Alberni Indian Residential School property this morning. Several members of the staff of the school were questioned to clear up points for this report. The answers of some of the staff were most unsatisfactory to me. It was fairly clear that some of the lady members of the staff were attempting to hide something which had occurred in the school kitchen on the morning of February 21st last.\n\nPreliminary Report: The subject matter of my Preliminary Report forwarded to the Indian Commissioner, Victoria this morning would appear to be correct in broad outline. Corrections of minor points are made in the body of this subsequent report, which should of course be read in continuation of the former.\n\nDiscovery of Fire: Miss Audrey Mills, teacher of the Senior Division, was in her room on the second story. She heard, she states, a noise above her, and opening her door to see what was the matter, saw smoke coming from the attic. Miss How was not present as previously reported. Miss Mills broke the fire disc alarm, but as no one appeared for some time she went down stairs and there met the Principal, Mr Pitts, to whom she reported that the attic was on fire. She then returned to her room to finish dressing. The actual time of the alarm was 7:45 A.M., and not 8 A.M. as previously reported.\n\nResult of Fire Alarm: This was in my opinion highly unsatisfactory, in that the children did not AT ONCE leave the building. They waited for orders from a badly disorganized staff. The girls were handed blankets by members of the staff who had obtained these from the lower dormitories. The boys did not get blankets, and I still am unable to find that they were properly looked after. The first that I can discover of the boys is that they were playing around the school. It was the Principal who made his way into one of the boys' dormitories and threw out some blankets through the window.\n\nGERTRUDE BOB, a sister of the deceased, but a near relative of Mary Bob of whom I was in bed in the Junior Girls' Dormitory and three or four older girls were in the Senior Girls' Dormitory. These children were told to get up and dress by Mrs Sainsbury one of the staff on the girls' side of the school. Why they did not get up when they heard the fire alarm is a question for the Principal to answer. When a Fire Alarm sounds the children should obey in an automatic manner and certainly not wait for orders, sensible or foolish, from a staff that may have become disorganized. In the case of PRACTICE ALARMS children in bed ill should be first warned that there is to be a Drill and that they are to remain in bed.\n\nThe other matter in my Preliminary Report under this heading is correct in outline, except that Mr Pitts locked the door of the attic after he had first seen that it was on fire. Mrs Pitts also unlocked this door she states.\nAttic in which Fire Started:\n\nThe ventilation flue from the kitchen had openings covered with gratings on each floor. It does not appear likely that any of the children placed burning paper in this ventilation pipe.\n\nThe canopy over the kitchen stove or range led through a pipe some fifteen to twenty feet long to the ventilation shaft.\n\nActual Fighting of Fire:\n\nThere would appear to have been a shortage of water from the Alberni City mains due to causes that the school had no control of, and the pressure does not appear to have been maintained in the fire hose. In any case the fire had too big a start when the Alberni City Fire Department arrived on the scene.\n\nAction of Staff and Pupils during the Fire:\n\nIn addition to what has been reported under this heading and in partial correction of former statements, I may say that the GIRLS when taken from the burning building were housed in the Primary Classroom under the care of the two junior teachers, Miss K. Pitts, and Miss How.\n\nThe point of just how the blankets were distributed has been cleared up as described above.\n\nIn all some six Singer Sewing Machines were saved. Much of the Principal's furniture and that from Staff rooms was saved. Some of the children's clothes from the laundry were saved also. The teachers lost nearly everything. The teachers I may say in passing were the only members of the staff that could give me a reasonable account of what did happen. They would appear to have kept their heads better during the fire than the missionary members of the staff, and they certainly were far more straightforward in their answers to my questions today.\n\nBuildings Saved:\n\nThe following buildings are standing:\n- Primary Schoolroom\n- Cottage near Primary Schoolroom\n- Farm Instructor's Cottage\n- Big Barn\n- Small Barn\n- Garage\n- Woodshed with wood\n- Implement shed\n\nAction taken by Indian Agent:\n\nMr. Indian Agent Ashbridge is, I understand, forwarding his own report on the fire by this mail. He has now arranged for the disposal of the remaining children on the school property. These are for the most part being sent home. Mr. Indian Agent Graham has been communicated with in regard to the children going to the Cowichan Agency.\n\nThere are several special cases, that is children from poor homes, are being dealt with under authority of a telegram from the Indian Affairs Branch, and several of these special children will be sent to Ahousaht Indian Residential School where there is plenty of room for a dozen or more.\nCause of Fire:\n\nThough the discipline at this school has been very weak for years, and the control of the children unsatisfactory, I am quite satisfied that the present fire was not incendiary.\n\nIt appears that the regular cook, Miss McKinnon is away ill in Vancouver. Mrs Froates is acting as cook. This lady was not in the kitchen on the Sunday morning of the fire, and was in fact in bed.\n\nThe kitchen fire was started by Mr. Shaw, Farm Instructor. I am told that big fires are set to cook cereal for breakfast. This seems strange but such is my information.\n\nOn this particular Sunday morning a Miss J. Davidson was preparing breakfast in the school kitchen. Her answers to my simple questions with regard to any peculiar circumstances having occurred were more than evasive. She was in fact incoherent, but admitted that sparks had gone up. She was so obviously covering up something that I determined to question another member of the staff.\n\nMrs Sainsbury admitted that there had been an oven fire about half an hour before breakfast. A pan of grease had been left over night in the oven. When the stove became hot and it must have been very hot the grease caught fire and the pan was left on the top of the oven while the above mentioned Miss Davidson went to Mrs Pitts for advice. Mrs Pitts appears to have put salt on the burning grease.\n\nIt has been impossible to get these Missionary Supervisors to tell me plainly what did happen. They are trying to cover up the real facts in my opinion.\n\nI suggest that some paper or cloth soaked in burning grease was drawn up the ventilator shaft and lodged against the light wooden covering of the ventilator system in the attic. The draft up this shaft from a hot kitchen range would be sufficient to draw up such a burning cloth. It is possible that a large sheet of newspaper was the item drawn up and not a cloth. It is just possible that the chimney caught fire near the top from the fact that there was too big a fire in the kitchen range, but it is hard to explain how the fire spread in such a case. The possible explanation of the burning cloth or paper in the ventilation system appears to me to be a very simple answer to the question of what caused the fire? I would particularly draw your attention to the actual times, the burning of the grease in the kitchen being some half hour before breakfast and the alarm of fire.\n\nI am of the opinion that some of the Supervisors are attempting to suppress the facts of the occurrence in the kitchen, which seems to me the most likely cause of the subsequent fire, and burning of the school.\n\nIndian Office,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\n\nGerald H.

These, I understand, were paid for by the Department, and are being cared for, at present, by the school staff. It is requested, please, that I be instructed as to the disposal of the stock.\n\nThe Reverend Principal is still retaining his staff, on the assumption that the school will be immediately rebuilt. As this is a matter for the Department to decide, I have refrained from advising him in this matter.\n\nIt is felt that the Department should be advised that the Reverend Mr. Pitts is putting every obstacle in the way of transferring pupils to the Ahousaht or other schools, and is holding meetings with local Indians, with the object of inciting them to protest against their being sent to other schools, and to make demands for rebuilding of school at Alberni.\n\nMr. Caldwell, Principal of Ahousaht School has kindly offered every assistance in caring for, and admitting pupils to his school, where it may be desirable to relieve parents who have too many to properly care for, or for the purpose of continuing their education.\nWest Coast Agency,\nPort Alberni, B.C.,\nMarch 3, 1937.\n\n(2)\n\nHe has, however, met with nothing but opposition from Mr. Pitts, and it was not thought advisable to take any steps in the matter, except by direction of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.B.

I may state, in reply, that a copy of the official report, submitted to the Department by Mr. P. B. Ashbridge, was forwarded, a week or so ago, to Dr. Cochrane, Secretary of the Home Mission Board. We have received, from Inspector Barry, a number of letters in which reference is made to the fire at Alberni. I understand, however, that it has not been the practice of the Department to prepare and send out copies of these reports to the officials in charge of our residential schools. If there is any specific information you have in mind, you might communicate with us again.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. F. E.

(RG 10, Volume 6433, File 877-5, part 5)\nMrs. C. M. Levey,\nExecutive Sec'y, W.M.S. Board,\nUnited Church, Toronto.\n\nDear Mrs. Levey:\n\nThanks for your prompt telegram expressing sympathy and consideration for us in our great loss of the school. I have delayed the report for a few days that I might better consider the details.\n\nWhat we felt was the greatest loss was that after ten years of very close and strenuous work we could not leave it for someone else to carry forward on the foundation we had laid. We had all repairs and work in the best condition we have ever had them and to think that in one month, and that the most strenuous month we have ever had, things could go wrong in so many ways.\n\nWe have had the longest winter this country has experienced for a long time\u2014over 9 weeks. On January 15, our kitchen matron was taken seriously sick and Mrs. Pitts had to take charge of the kitchen for nearly a month along with her own work; a few days later one of the senior boys walked in his sleep and jumped from a third story window and very fortunately got off with a compound fracture of one leg. One of the senior girls developed T.B. meningitis, was taken to the hospital and died three weeks ago today; seventy-five children got flu and many of them were seriously sick; two more developed T.B. meningitis, and died in the hospital two weeks ago today. That same night a heavy snow storm and rain and wind crushed in the roof of our recreation hall\u2014a big building 38' by 56' and the other out-buildings were dangerously laden with snow. Part of the time the seamstress and laundress were very sick in bed with flu.\n\nWe just got all the children up and everything going nicely again, when for no apparent condition other than had been there all along, the school burned down a week ago. This surely seems like a chapter from the book of Job.\n\nI write all this to impress upon you what it means to run an Indian school out in the country with 120 small children and to have the responsibility of every department.\n\nThere is always speculation as to the cause of a fire in any Indian school. Captain Barry came to investigate for the Department. He seemed to think that a very likely cause was that some of the children had died and according to old Indian custom some of the children had burned down the building (although they died in the town hospital.)\n\nA second possible cause Captain Barry investigated was that I had called in the Indian agent about a month before to reprimand and advise two boys that who had stolen something and thought that in revenge they had set the fire.\nI wish to state positively that I am as certain as is humanly possible that no child nor Indian had anything to do with it and state also that it was impossible for any of the children or Indians to get where the fire started even if they had wanted to do so.\n\nMy own theory of the origin of the fire is that it was due to a faulty construction of the building\u2014a fault that any architect should have seen and if there are any other schools built on this same plan, as I believe a number are, the Indian Department should have a competent man inspect them at once, and the Church should see that they do.\n\nNote: The school was a basement three story building with kitchen, dairy, bake shop, dining rooms and playrooms in the basement. The fire started on the top floor on the girls' side of the building in a room approximately 30 x 46 x 10 feet, finished for a dormitory but used to store summer clothing in the winter and winter clothing, bedding, etc., in the summer. It had hardwood floor, fir wainscoting, plastered walls and beaverboard ceiling.\n\nThe chimney and ventilating flues ran through this room about 3 feet from the door on the north side of the building. (The chimney of the heating plant and of hot water system did not go through this building.)\n\nThe chimney was built on concrete foundation and extended through the four floors and peak of the roof, approximately 60 feet high and had four flues. The outside flues were single brick walls with flues about 26\" square, with ventilating grates on each floor. The one on the south side took a ventilating pipe from the canopy over the kitchen range. The pipe from the canopy was about 30 feet long and about 15 inches in diameter. The two middle flues of the chimney were smoke flues; the one on the north took the smoke from a small galvanized bake oven. The one on the south took the smoke pipe from the kitchen range. These smoke flues had an 8-inch wall at the sides and a 4-inch wall between the smoke flues and the ventilating flue.\n\nIn order to get a better circulation of air through the ventilating shaft a steam radiator of four sections 4 feet high was placed inside this ventilating flue on the top floor on both sides of the chimney. These radiators were heated, of course, from the steam boiler under the laundry building.\n\nWhen these radiators were put in, an opening in the brick work about 4 feet by 13 inches was left in front of the radiator. The whole chimney, smoke and ventilating flues, was covered with light fir wainscoting and a door of the same material was placed over this opening in the brickwork in front of the radiator. All this woodwork in the room was varnished.\n\nThe door to the room was locked with a heavy spring Yale lock and Mrs. Pitts had the one key and I had the other. No one else went into that room unless with us or by use of our keys.\n\nThe teacher who discovered the fire was sleeping in Sunday morning while we were at breakfast. She was aroused by a slight explosion that shook the windows and made them rattle and immediately saw the smoke coming through the beaverboard ceiling. Just outside the door of her room was the fire alarm that rang all through the building. Before she was half way down the stairs, I met her and rushed to the door of this room. On opening it, I found the casing of the door on fire all way\nround, also the back of the door, just 3 feet from this chimney. The fire was on the opposite side of the room 30 feet from the door but any man would have been a fool to have tried to reach it. I closed the door and ran down two floors for the 5-gallon chemical tank. When I returned the farm instructor had the hose from the floor below and we tried both the water and chemicals without effect as the smoke was so dense and strong from the varnish that we were driven out and we phoned for Alberni City Fire Brigade, also Port Alberni brigade and the Alberni Pacific Lumber Co. and Forestry Department engines; but we could not control the fire and could only save a few things.\n\nI am convinced that the fire was caused either by the heat of the smoke flue setting fire to the fir wainscoting and varnish off if from the ventilating flue it was caused by spontaneous combustion of dust accumulated in this small radiator or a slight explosion of gas that blew open this little door in front of the radiator and set fire to the varnish near it.\n\nI am sure the smoke flue was not burning out, for there was a little iron trap door at the bottom of this flue and I was past this door four times within half an hour before the fire occurred and could have heard and smelled it if the chimney had been burning out.\n\nHad this fire occurred at night nothing could have prevented panic and no training in fire drill would have prevented loss of life. Had it occurred a week earlier, we had seventy-five children in bed with flu.\n\nI have written this to warn all concerned to prevent a similar occurrence in any other school.\n\nAll our equipment and help worked like clock work but still we were helpless \u2014 our good fortune was that it happened when it did while we were in the basement.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6433, File 877-5, part 5)\nREPORT.\n\nRe:- INDIAN MISSION SCHOOL. Destroyed by Fire.\n\nI beg to report that a 6.00 A.M. Sunday February 21st 1937 a fire alarm was turned in from the Indian Mission and Residential School situated at the Sheshahlt Indian reservation, Alberni B.C.\n\nUpon my arrival all the children were out of the building and I proceeded to the attic of the girls dormitory where the fire started. Owing to the intense heat a thorough check of the attic could not be made but it was noticed that the fire had started at the chimney or ventilator.\n\nThe chimney is a large affair with four flues. The two outer flues being ventilators and the center flue chimney flues. The outer walls of the chimney were built of two layers of brick with a single layer of brick between the chimneys and ventilators. Over the large kitchen range was a canopy connected to one of these ventilators by a fifteen inch pipe for the purpose of taking fumes from the cooking out of the kitchen.\n\nIt is my opinion that the fire was caused by a defective chimney when either excessive heat or flame from the chimney flue penetrated the ventilator igniting the grease which would have accumulated in the ventilator from the kitchen range, the fire escaping from the ventilator by the way of a wooden door opening into the attic from the ventilator.\n\nDuring the morning of the fire and about fifteen minutes before the fire in the attic was noticed, there was a large fire in the kitchen range and fat was being rendered down in the oven. This fat became ignited but was noticed and extinguished. In my mind this had nothing to do with the fire, as the flame from the fat in the oven would not have reached as high as the ventilator.\n\nThe building was a wooden frame building on a stone foundation owned by the Department of Indian Affairs and valued at $60000.00 was a total loss, the contents of the building owned by the United Church of Canada was valued at $10000.00. Loss estimated at $8000.00 at present I have not been able to ascertain if insurance was carried by the United Church. Personal property belonging to Mr. Frank Edwin Pitts, Principal, was valued at $1600.00 was insured for $800.00 by the Queen Insurance Company of America. Policy #184927, Part of Mr. Pitts's belongings were saved.\n\nThe fire was attended both by the Alberni City Fire Department also the Port Alberni brigade. But lack of water pressure and hampered by heavy mesh screening on the windows little could be done to save the building.\n\nWitnesses who can testify. Mr. Frank Edwin Pitts, Miss Audrey Mills, school teacher.\nOn my return to Alberni at about 11.30 A.M. I notified Mr. P. B. Ashbridge, Indian Agent who made arrangements to have the one hundred and twenty indian children who were residing at the school returned to their homes.\n\nFire Marshal's Report attached hereto.\n\nThe N.C.O.

Consequently, the school funds consist of per capita grant, church contributions and money earned by farm, etc. and the stock, machinery and equipment purchased with school funds are the property of the Church and under their management.\n\nI have asked the Church offices in Toronto for instructions as to what they wish me to do with carrying on the farm in the interim until some decision is arrived at about the residential school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nP.

In the meantime I considered it advisable to bring the matter to your attention in order that a preliminary sketch might be made of the proposed building and other arrangements made in connection with it so that in the event of funds being provided there will be no unnecessary delay in commencing construction.\n\nAs a first step I would suggest that you arrange, at the earliest possible date, for a visit to Alberni by one of your engineers or an architect, if the services of the latter are available at the coast, with a view to examining the basement of the former school. Your representative should ascertain the size of the basement of the old school and all other information that would be of assistance in preparing plans.\n\nIn erecting a new residential school at this point provision will have to be made for 200 pupils and a staff of approximately 12 persons. The building should, of course, be fireproof.\nI am under the impression that if a building with four class rooms with full basement accommodation were erected separate from the main building, it would involve less expense and at the same time provide other advantages. The building containing the class rooms would not necessarily have to be of fireproof construction. The class room building would contain a hall in the middle with two class rooms on each side. Sliding partitions should be placed between the two class rooms on either side of the building. This would enable these rooms to be opened into one room if necessary. As stated above full basement should be provided under this building for vocational training purposes.\n\nIf the suggestion made in the preceding paragraph were put into effect it is quite possible that the present basement would be sufficiently large to permit the erection of the main building which should be a building with full basement, two stories high with dormer roof and a residence for the Principal at one end.\n\nAs soon as your representative forwards his report it would be appreciated if you would submit it to me for consideration by the officials of this Branch.\n\nDirector.\nREPORT\n\non\n\nSITE AND OLD FOUNDATION WALLS\n\nALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nWEST COAST INDIAN AGENCY\n\nALBERNI, B.C.\n\nby\n\nG.H.WHYTE\n\nC.E.Webb, Esq.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDominion Water and Power Bureau,\nVANCOUVER, B.C., Vancouver, B.C.,\nApril 6,1939\nREPORT\n\non\n\nSITE AND OLD FOUNDATION WALLS\n\nALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nWEST COAST INDIAN AGENCY\n\nALBERNI, B. C.\n\nby\n\nG. H. WHYTE\n\nVancouver, B. C.,\nApril 6, 1939.\nVancouver, B.C.,\nApril 6, 1939.\n\nSir: Report on Site and Old Foundation Walls,\nAlberni Indian Residential School,\nAlberni, B.C.\n\nIn accordance with your instructions of recent date, I inspected the remains of the Alberni Indian Residential School on March 20th, and beg to report as follows:\n\nSITE\n\nThe school site consists of a block of land on the north or right shore of the Somass river about one mile from Alberni and three miles from Port Alberni. Adjoining the site on the west is Tsahaheh Indian Reserve and on the east property owned by the United Church. The portion of the site adjacent to the river is low clay land suitable for garden purposes. At an elevation about 35 feet above this is a level bench of sandy gravel on which the old school was located. This flat bench area is about 500 feet by 350 feet and is a very suitable site for a school, with sufficient area for small playing fields. Back of this bench the land rises to the north edge of the property. The eastern part of this slope is cleared agricultural land on which is situated a large barn. The western edge is uncleared land with rock exposures at about same elevation as the bench on which school was located.\n\nDRAINAGE\n\nThe old school had a basement floor two feet below the ground level and no trouble from water was reported. The heating plant floor was four feet below ground level and considerable trouble\n\nC.E. Webb, Esq.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDominion Water and Power Bureau,\nVancouver, B.C.\nfrom water was experienced. With precipitation to be expected at this point (Port Alberni 70.65 inches per year) it will therefore be necessary to provide for proper drainage. With the lower land in front of the building construction of drains from the building site to this lower land is an easy problem.\n\nOLD WALLS ETC.\n\nThe foundations of the old school are still standing but an examination of them indicates that the mortar and concrete is of very poor quality, either due to the fire or as a result of using poor mixtures during construction. These walls extend nine feet above ground level and consist of one course of brick with a five inch face of field stone and cement blocks. The bricks about windows, doors etc., are badly broken and the whole can be easily removed from position by hand or with a hammer. The mortar does not adhere to the bricks as it should and I would therefore suggest the whole of this masonry be removed. Some of the brick can be used again although it is generally of poor quality. The boiler room has a concrete lining inside the brick work to keep out seepage through the walls but this also is of very poor quality, it being possible to penetrate the concrete almost an inch with a pointed 1\" bar about 8 inches long held in the hand. The chimney for the boiler is still standing but the mortar is so poor that it is probably not safe. This chimney is four feet by four feet at the base and about 50 feet or more high.\nWATER SUPPLY\n\nIn December, 1935, this Bureau installed a new 4\" water main from the City of Alberni's 4\" main to the school where it connected to the school 2\" system. This pipeline appears in good order and could be used for the domestic supply of the new school but is not suitable for fire fighting purposes owing to the limited supply of water available through the 4\" mains of the City of Alberni which can supply 100 U.S. gallons per minute at 30-lbs. pressure.\n\nReport of E.H.Tredcroft made December 5, 1935 (our number 407) on \"Improvements to Fire Protection System at Alberni Indian School\" goes into this phase of the water supply system at some length. This report suggests a 6\" wood stave fire main be run from the Somass river to the school, water to be pumped by a 50-60 h.p. Gasoline engine housed in a wooden pump house near the river and above a concrete intake well connected to the river by means of a 14\" Vitrified supply pipe. This system would supply 500 U.S. gallons per minute or enough to keep two fire streams of 240 U.S. gallons per minute in operation. The system of partial monitor hydrants and partial ordinary hydrants to which hose may be connected is worthy of consideration in connection with this project as the monitor type hydrants are available without delay and can thus be put in service before the hose lines can be run out. The estimated cost of this system as then proposed was $3600.00.\n\nLIGHT SUPPLY\n\nElectricity was previously supplied to the school by the National Utilities Corporation of Alberni who had a 2200 volt power line from their\ntransmission line along the Alberni-Great Central Lake road. This supply is considered to be more satisfactory than would be the construction and operation of a private system at the school. Charges for light are 9\u00a2 for first 30 K.W. hours and 3\u00a2 per K.W. hour for the balance with $1.50 per H.P. standby charge for any motors which may be installed. The charges at the old school ran from $5.50 to $40.00 per month and maximum consumption was 1321 K.W. hours. At the old school there was a 2 H.P. motor in the laundry.\n\nHEATING SYSTEM\n\nThe old boiler and hot water tank at the school are still in place and it is probable that this boiler could be put in shape to handle the heating of the proposed school. It is an 84 H.P. Horizontal Return Tublar boiler 66\" x 12'0\" built in 1920 by Vulcan Iron Works of Vancouver and designed to operate at 100 lbs. pressure. The boiler normally worked at 10 lbs. and as it is brick encased it is probable that it would be suitable for the new school after overhaul.\n\nA number of the old radiators are in the ruins but it is probable these are of little value except as scrap iron.\n\nThe fuel for the new building could be crude oil, coal, wood or sawdust (hog fuel). It is probable that a heating unit burning sawdust or hog fuel would be the most economical at the moment as there are two large sawmills at Port Alberni and others nearby from which fuel could be obtained at a reasonable cost at present. It is probable this type of fuel will be available at reasonable cost, if storage is provided, for a number of years to come.\nSEWAGE SYSTEM\n\nAt the old school there is a sewage disposal system consisting of pipe lines to a septic tank with necessary filter beds. The filter beds located on the side hill washed out and after further consideration were not considered necessary and overflow from the tank was then carried direct to the Somass river by means of a 6\" vitrified pipe installed in 1930. The tank is 12 feet by 4.5 feet by 4.5 feet and was designed for a school of 125 occupants. After the new outlet was installed in 1930 this tank gave entire satisfaction. It is believed that if the waste water from laundry and kitchen of the proposed school were carried by a separate pipe direct to the outlet pipe by-passing the septic tank, the present septic tank would meet the requirements of the new school. The presence of laundry and kitchen waste in a septic tank materially decreases its efficiency and it is not desirable to pass such waste through the tank if at all possible.\n\nIf the present system is used it might be found desirable to replace the pipe between the new school and the tank and in any case would require a new 4\" pipe to convey laundry and kitchen waste from the school to the septic tank outlet pipe.\n\nSALVAGE MATERIAL AT OLD SCHOOL\n\nA considerable amount of brick could be salvaged from the old school site and while not of best quality could be used for certain purposes. There is also a considerable quantity of field stone and cement blocks in the walls and these look to be in fair condition and probably a good percentage could be used.\nThe window sash weights have been salvaged and are neatly piled near the wall of the boiler room. These are in good condition and can be re-used.\n\nA good deal of scrap iron such as pipes, broken radiators, fire escapes etc. could be salvaged.\n\nPROPOSED TYPE OF SCHOOL\n\nThree possible types of schools might be considered for this site.\n\n(1) School similar to that destroyed, with residence and class rooms under one roof.\n\n(2) Separate school building and residence building.\n\n(3) Separate school building with several cottage residences and administration building.\n\nThe apparent advantages and disadvantages of these are considered hereafter.\n\n1. A building of this type would have to be fireproof throughout and unless of about three stories would cover a considerable area. Heating of such a building would be least costly and supervision would be easiest although such a building would of necessity have day students in it as well as residents, which is possibly a disadvantage.\n\n2. Separate school and residence would permit of the school functions being entirely separate from the dormitory which is said to be an advantage. The heating of the two buildings would be probably more expensive than of one combined building although a central heating system could be installed. If this layout is desired it is suggested the new dormitory building be to the west and the school to the east so that sewage disposal can be readily handled. The school buildings might be slightly forward or south of the old site to leave more playground space to the back and north of the buildings. The boiler house\ncould be adjacent to the dormitory building making access easy at night to check over fires. Sketch shows suggested location of new buildings.\n\n3. At the request of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs a visit was paid to the Fairbridge Farm School near Duncan and the system of cottage residences was looked into and very much impressed the writer. Here they have a large school building, 14 cottage residences, a main building with kitchen, dining hall and laundry as well as separate building for manual training, office, principal's residence, farm buildings etc. In each residence are housed 14 students of various ages under control of a matron. The most modern of these cottages are double buildings and each section contains small sitting room, bedroom and bathroom for matron, dormitory room, kitchen and small dining room on one floor with play room under dormitory, bathroom, locker room in basement with one hot air wood burning heating unit, drying room and fuel room for the two sections. Thirteen of these cottages are used as residences and the fourteenth as a hospital. Breakfast and dinner (noon) are obtained at the main dining hall and supper in the cottage. The Alberni site would be very suitable for such a school system as the cottages could be built on the side hill to the northwest of the old school site.\n\nAs the cottages are all small they need not be of fireproof construction and therefore would probably not be expensive to build, although due to having additional matrons it would probably make the cost of operation heavy as compared with a single dormitory building. If this type of school was decided on it might be considered each cottage should house more than 14 and to do this it is suggested only part of building have basement and the playroom as at Fairbridge.\nschool be built with floor above ground level and used as one dormitory with a second dormitory above.\n\nGENERAL\n\nThe provision of adequate and suitable fire protection for the proposed buildings is desirable and it is also desirable that fire escape provision be of such a nature that they cannot be cut off from ease of access. It is probable that chutes would be most suitable as they do not permit of easy access to the upper stores which is an objection to the usual type of fire escape. The school itself should be so designed as to permit of more than one outlet in case of fire to each portion of the building.\n\nThe wash and bathrooms for the school should be adjacent to the dormitories themselves and on the same floor. Provision should also be made for toilets adjacent to the school rooms for use of day students as it is not desirable that they have access to the dormitory building or portion of the building.\n\nThe small building shown on plan as school room was formerly used as a manual training room and it could be converted into a shop to be used for boat building which it is understood is desirable at this school. If boat building is to be carried on in the basement of the school proper adjacent to the manual training shops provision should be made to permit the boat being removed when completed.\n\nReference reports on this school are:\n\nOur No.237 Report on proposed repairs to Sewage Disposal System, Port Alberni Indian School by A.L.McNaughton, April 30, 1930.\n\nOur No.269 Report on Installation of Septic Tank Outlet Drain at Alberni Indian Mission School by A.L.McNaughton, Aug.27, 1930\nOur No. 407 Report on Improvements to Fire Protection System at Alberni Indian School, West Coast Agency, by E.H.Tredcroft, Dec. 5, 1935.\n\nOur No. 410 Report re repairs to Domestic Water Supply, Alberni Indian School, Alberni, B.C., by E.H.Tredcroft, Dec. 4, 1935.\n\nThe several possible arrangements of school and residence in connection with this project have been covered in some detail as such information may be of value to the officials in charge of the educational phase of the Indian Affairs Branch activities, to enable them to decide on which type of school would be most suitable to meet the requirements of the Alberni locality.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.H.Whyte\nAsst. District Chief Engineer\n\nAPPROVED:\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6434, File 877-5, part 6)\nOttawa,\nMay 18, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 3rd instant in which you request authority to sell a large quantity of scrap iron, piping etc. at present on the site of the Alberni residential school in order to pay the Indians for their labour in clearing the site. I agree with you that your suggestion would be a simple and convenient method of cleaning up the old site preparatory to the erection of the new building, but unfortunately, the procedure suggested would be contrary to the provisions of the Consolidated Revenue and Audit Act. To dispose of the old material and use the proceeds would really be supplementing any parliamentary appropriation provided for the re-erection of the building. The proceeds of the sale should of course be deposited to actual revenue. At the same time, the Chief Treasury Officer would no doubt decline to pass the accounts for the labour involved. I am confident that we would be severely criticized by the Auditor General's Department and the Treasury Board if the circumstances became known that we were using the proceeds of material sold, to meet other expenditures.\n\nUnder the circumstances, I think that the only legitimate course open to us is to ask the Salvage Officer to dispose of the old scrap iron, piping etc., by tender in the usual way, crediting any proceeds to Casual Revenue of your Branch. The cost of clearing the debris would have to be borne by the appropriation for the re-erection of the building.\n\nIn view of the above you should not take any further action toward clearing the site of the Alberni school.\n\nI. H. Ashbridge, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Alberni, B. C.\nYou might let me know the approximate quantities and kinds of scrap iron, piping etc. that is at present on the site and also advise if you consider it marketable and if it could be sold locally. If so, you might let me know the names of the persons who would possibly purchase it. I require this information for the Salvage Officer.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

George Dorsey, D.D.,\nWesley Buildings,\nToronto, Ontario.\n\nDear Dr. Dorsey:\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter of May 30th enclosing the above plans and asking for my remarks on the same. I beg to say that I had planned a trip to Campbell River and Cape Mudge villages for this weekend, and so delayed making comments until I had had the chance to look over the exact situation. Consequently I left home on Saturday, took the boat to Nanaimo and then drove right through to Alberni and had a good look at the proposed site. I trust that such comments as I may make may be some help, and all the better because I have taken the extra day or two.\n\nSpeaking generally, I think the Department is to be congratulated in the proposed plans as there are decided improvements to be noted. Putting the senior girls' play room on the first floor is a good move. You can put few brightening touches in a basement room, and being upstairs will enable the staff to appeal to the girls to make order and beauty a factor in taking care of their room. Having the ladies of the Staff in one place is another good idea. The dormitories are adequate but not too large; the lavatories well placed and the shower baths on the second floor will allow a maximum use with the least possible trouble. The \"lift\" running from basement to the top storey is an excellent idea. But I shall make particular observations as follows:\n\nI. Principal's Residence.\n\nI do not see any objection in having connection with the School by passageway. There are benefits both ways but I would rather favor communication with the School through a doorway from the same to the Residence.\n\nIn looking over the actual site however, there is some doubt in my mind as to the advisability of placing the residence on the N.E. side as at present shown. It is the cold side, and there would be less sunshine than were it on the opposite or S.W. end of the School building. If the proposed Day School of two rooms, is to be located where the present small school room is now, it would cut off the view from the living room of the residence almost completely. So, if the Class Room building is to be placed where the old school room (day) is now, as shown on the sketch, I think it would be better to put the Residence on the other end. There is plenty of room between the front side and the bank, and also between the back line and the edge of the bank. If, however, the Class Room building were to be placed on the back or S.W. end of the School, then the residence would be better where it is. In view of the fact that the Class Room building ought to be near the playground, it would seem as though the N.E. end would be the proper\nplace, and in that case I would strongly urge the Residence to be placed on the S.W. end, as it would be more private and would enjoy a much better view over the river, and get lots more sunshine and be further removed from the play grounds.\n\n2. Boys' and Girls' sides, respectively:\n\nAs at present planned, the girls are to be on the N.E. side of the School, and the boys on the S.W. end. This is doubtless due to the fact that they were so arranged in the old School. I would like to point out however, that the new School will be larger than the old one, and that the boys playground as proposed adjoining the S.W. end is much the smaller of the two, and quite inadequate to give room for say 100 to 120 boys. Athletics play a large place in the education of our Indian boys and girls, and play grounds are vital accessories. There is not room on the back, as at present planned, for playgrounds for boys, and the space between the school and the edge of the hill does not leave room for the present playground to be enlarged. The back playground is however, large enough for the girls' side if the change were made and the girls placed in the S.W. end of the building. The sports which take up most room for girls are planned games, and Soft Ball etc. and there is room for such. Boys would have to go, in any case to the front playground, at present intended for the girls, in order to play football for instance, so that I would respectfully suggest that the Department seriously consider making the S.W. end the Girls' end in the new School, and allow the boys to have the N.E. end with the larger playground.\n\nIf this change were made, it would bring the Ladies rooms on the Girls side, which would be better. They are at present on the Boys' side.\n\n3. The Laundry:\n\nThe laundry, as proposed in the sketch plans, is to my mind, in quite the wrong place. It is right on the front and most public end of the building. There is no more noisy department of the school than the laundry, and to have it grinding out its noise to incoming visitors would be the reverse of pleasant. Again, it is right up against the living rooms of the residence as at present planned. Then too, it is at the furthest possible distance from the boiler room and the source of steam supply. Consequently, I would urge that it be placed in the place now proposed for the Junior girls' Playroom. This would allow a room of about the same size, and would allow it to be near the sewing room as proposed. The lines for outside would be nearer, and it would be much nearer the boiler room.\n\n4. I would strongly urge some system of washing dishes by mechanical means. This would make for much less danger of infection, and it would help materially in meeting the problem of school labor which is growing more difficult all the time due to the lowering of the grade age. Young pupils are more and more coming to these schools, and it is most important that the work required of the lesser number of older pupils, ought not to interfere with adequate opportunity for really educative activities. For both reasons this proposal is important. The installation need not be at all expensive and I would urge that some such system as we have now in operation in Coqualeetsa be installed rather than the more complicated and expensive apparatus advertised by some firms. Most of the\nlarge restaurants have systems something like ours in Coqualeetza and they are efficient and ought not to cost more than around $100.00.\n\n5. The provision for a dairy is fine, but I would suggest that further provision be made for Pasteurizing the milk. There would be room in the proposed space. Dr. McQuarrie, I understand, thinks this to be very important, and I think we agree generally. Even if the herd is tested regularly for T.B., there is always danger of an infection through a cow becoming \"active\" between tests. Pasteurizing would take care of such a danger. If this is not done, then I would urge the building of a small dairy close to the barn, with adequate water supply. The milk could then be cooled there, and taken to the School and placed in the refrigerator. This system is usually followed, but Pasteurization would be much the better, and would entail no more work as the milk has to come to the School in either case.\n\n6. Sump in Student Dining Room.\n\nIt is very important to have a sump in the floor of the Student Dining room, with adequate attachment to suitable drainage. This allows for scrubbing quickly and for it being done more frequently, and to better effect than when pupils have to do it on their knees by hand. The extra time taken to do it in that fashion is not justified in view of the need for time in really educative departments. The only way at present to obviate this difficulty, is to scrub less often. Such a sump would be inexpensive to install if done during the building of the school, and would be a boon to both staff and pupils.\n\n7. Plumbing on Boys' side.\n\nI infer from the proposed plans that this will include installing urinals, instead of so many toilets. I heartily approve of this. It means much better sanitation, and less expense both to install and to keep up.\n\n8. Infirmary.\n\nI note that the sketch plans place this room on the back of the School. There will be less light there as it is the North side, and it places the Nurse's room completely at the back. I think it might be well be considered that the Infirmary be placed in the front of the building. This would leave the Nurse's room over the verandah of the main front entrance. It would allow the space at present taken up by her room for a dressing room for pupils. It is important to have such a room for the School \"Clinic\", twice a day, when the pupils who need attention parade before the nurse. The plans at present, while making commendable room for closets and medicine cabinets etc., does not, to my mind make allowance for such a dressing room as now suggested. Sunshine and light are important in an Infirmary and the south side is better than the proposed North side.\n\n9. Iron Firemen:\n\nI would strongly urge the Department to consider the installation of mechanical stokers. It allows a saving on the first cost of the\ncoal, and gives much more adequate service. We have never been so comfortable so far as heat is concerned, at Coqualeetza, as since installing the mechanical stoker placed there by the Canadian Summer Iron Works.\n\nI consider that it means a saving to the School of about $400.00 a year for the one on the main heating boilers alone, and best of all, we are getting HEAT from the fuel consumed. The High Pressure steam boiler would allow for senior boys getting training in firing such units. Hand firing a heating furnace is not vital for their future. Firing a H.P. Steam boiler would be, however. I would suggest that not less than a 15 H.P. Steam boiler be installed to supply steam for laundry, dishwashing, etc.\n\n10. Laundry.\n\nI would strongly urge that some form of Steam Mangle be installed to assist with the ironing of flat wear. No work is harder on pupils than that in the laundry; and here again, any relief that can be given reacts favorably upon time available for more educative activities.\n\nIn conclusion, upon closer look at the plans, it would appear that the class room building is to be in the rear, between the girls' and boys' sides. This is better. It puts the play grounds in proper relation to each side. I would again, however, urge that the respective sides be changed in accordance with reasons expressed above under (2). If at all possible, I think it would be much better if the Residence were placed on the S.W. end of the building, as it would be more private, allow for better view, more sunlight, and be further removed from the playgrounds. The entrance from the outside, in that case, might be placed in the front, even if the study had to be given up, and the Living-room would then occupy the south of the residence overlooking the river and the view southward. The kitchen would be quite close to the back of the School, and the residence would be as far away from the laundry as possible. I do not know whether it would be possible to have a toilet installed on the 1st floor of the residence in addition to the one upstairs. If it could be done without much extra expense, or disturbance of present plans it would be very convenient. Hoping these suggestions will be of some help, and trusting that I have not held the plans too long,\n\nI am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nSigned \u2014 R.C. Scott.\nPrincipal.\n\nP.S. It occurs to me that I may not have made it clear as to what I mean in \u00a7, under Infirmary, by \"dressing room\". I mean a room where the nurse may change such dressings as need it, and where pupils come for treatment of minor injuries etc. Such a room is most important and ought to be fitted with proper sinks, with hot and cold water etc. I had to install all this in Coqualeetza and the water had to be connected up with the kitchen range at considerable expense. Minor injuries very often become serious through lack of attention and consequent infection, and a room\nwith simple but necessary appliances is most important in the health of the School. I should have said too, in connection with the \"Iron Fireman\", that we have installed a second, a smaller unit to heat our hot water for baths etc. It is automatic and by means of an \"Aquastat\" keeps an adequate supply always on tap. Previously, we burned nearly one-fifth more coal, and had a most inadequate supply of hot water, now it is always ready, and piping hot. I reckon we shall save another hundred dollars when this unit is paid for. Meantime we are paying for it out of the saving in fuel.\n\nFor Principal's Residence. The more I think over the position of the residence, the more I feel that it ought to go on the S.W. end of the building, if at all possible. Perhaps the entrance could be arranged on the front, in that case.\n\nR.G.S.\nDr. Harold W.

A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of the 4th ultimo, with reference to questions arising out of the construction of a Residential School at Alberni, has been referred to Mr. Inspector Barry, whose comments on the suggestions on page 2 of your letter are attached hereto in the form of an interim report pending his meeting with Captain R. C. Scott, which I trust will furnish you with the information more urgently desired.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI have read Departmental letter from Mr. Hoey dated May 4th with reference to the educational needs of the West Coast Agency.\n\nIt will not be possible for me to meet Captain R.C. Scott, Principal of Coqualeetza School, till after my return to Vancouver on or about June 13th, but as I feel that Mr. Hoey is anxious about several matters which I can answer in a few words, I am making this interim report.\n\n(1) No it would not be worth while to continue the Alberni Day School after the proposed Residential School is in operation at that point. The fact that some Alberni children receive clothes and full Residential School treatment while some only received lunch would lead to constant trouble with parents.\n\n(2) At Ahousaht a one room Indian Day School should be provided as recommended in my survey report on the West Coast. Though my survey was made just over two years ago there is no reason to believe that conditions have greatly changed.\n\nProvision should be made there for up to 25 day school pupils, but the room should be such that 40 children might be accommodated if necessary during certain months.\n\nNo residence need be provided for a teacher if the United Church Missionary would undertake to give room and board to a teacher in the residence erected by the Department on the Woman's Missionary Society's land at the present Ahousaht Indian Residential School.\n\nIf the United Church does not continue this Mission the Ahousaht Indian Day School should have residential accommodation for one teacher.\n\nThe proposed Ahousaht Indian Day School should be erected on the high piece of rocky land in front of the Indian village of Ahousaht. There is a village green on each side.\n\nThe proposed Ahousaht Day School should have in addition to a large classroom accommodation in a cement basement for Manual Training and if a teacher's residence is included a small room for use as a dispensary or vocational training room.\n\nA school such as that erected at Pemberton would be highly satisfactory if the teacher is to live at the school itself and not with the Missionary, and such a plan has certain advantages.\n(3) The erection of the four room consolidated school at Cowichan will not reduce the United Church enrolment at the Koksilah Indian Day School, for the consolidated school will be for Catholic children and administered under the auspices of the Catholic Church as the Cowichan Indian Day School is now.\n\nIt is true that when the Catholic children now attending the Koksilah Indian Day School are accommodated in the new consolidated school at Cowichan there will be increased space left vacant for United Church pupils at the Koksilah school. Some now at Coqualeetza from Koksilah could no doubt find accommodation in the Koksilah Day School without any further building at that point.\n\n(4) Most of the children attending the Kitamaat and Port Simpson Indian Residential Schools are local pupils and many could attend day schools at these places, though in each case an extra day school classroom will no doubt be required. These two residential schools would then provide accommodation for a number of the orphans and pupils with unsatisfactory homes now being cared for at Coqualeetza.\n\nThe above is of course not a full report but it is hoped that the information will be of assistance to Mr. Hoey till such time as it is possible to consult Captain Scott at Coqualeetza.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nJune 29th, 1939\n\nDear Sir:\n\nPlease be advised that we have the following old cast iron scrap on the site of the Alberni Indian Residential School, which was destroyed by fire:\n\n- 100 ft. steam pipe\n- 20 Radiators\n- 300 Sash weights\n- Approx. 2000 ft. iron pipe, burnt and twisted.\n\nThis old scrap may be examined on application to Mr. P.B. Ashbridge, Indian Agent, Port Alberni, B.C. It would be appreciated if you would endeavour to dispose of this old material for us at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC.W.

He intends to endeavour to secure purchasers for this, and if anyone should apply to you, you should take him to the site of the Alberni School.\n\nThe Horizontal Tubular Boiler and the 100-gallon Tank should be retained, as these may possibly be used in the new building.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nP. B. Ashbridge, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni,\nBritish Columbia.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDr. McGill,\nIndian Affairs Branch.\n\nReference is made to Mr. Hoey's memorandum of the 20th instant, file 155-1-5, respecting the old material at the site of the Alberni Indian Residential School. From the information in the Agent's letter, it would seem that the Horizontal Return Tubular Boiler, and the one 100-gallon tank might again be used. I presume the Branch will make the necessary arrangements in this connection.\n\nRespecting the old scrap iron, little or no expense would be involved in the Salvage Officer inviting tenders for the same. If you concur in this move, would you kindly let me have details as to whom interested parties should apply in order to inspect the scrap.\n\n[Signature]\n\nW. M. Hatley,\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\nJune 5th, 1939\n\nRev. George Dorey, D.D.,\nWesley Building,\nToronto, Ontario\n\nRe: Sketch plans for proposed new school at Alberni.\n\nDear Dr. Dorey:\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter of May 30th enclosing the above plans and asking for my remarks on the same. I beg to say that I had planned a trip to Campbell River and Cape Mudge villages for the weekend and so delayed making comments until I had had the chance to look over the exact situation. Consequently I left home on Monday, took the boat to Nanaimo and then drove right through to Alberni and had a good look at the proposed site. I trust that such comments as I may make may be of some help.\n\nSpeaking generally, I think the Department is to be congratulated in the proposed plans, as there are decided improvements to be noted. Putting the senior girls' play room on the first floor is a good idea. You can put a few brightening touches in a breakfast room, and being upstairs will enable the staff to appeal to the girls to make order and beauty a factor in taking care of their room. Having the ladies of the Staff in one place is another good idea. The dormitories are adequate but not too large, the lavatories well placed and the shower baths on the second floor will allow of maximum use with the least possible trouble. The \"lift\" running from the basement to the top storey is an excellent idea. I shall make particular observations as follows.\n\n1. Principal's Residence.\n\nI do not see any objection in having connection with the School by passageway. There are benefits both ways, but I would rather favor communication with the school through a doorway from the same to the Residence.\n\nIn looking over the actual site however, there is some doubt in my mind as to the advisability of placing the residence on the N.E. side as at present shown. It is the cold side, and there would be less shading than were it on the opposite or S.W. side of the School building. If the proposed Day School of two rooms is to be located where the present small school room is it would cut off the view from the living room of the Residence almost completely. So, if the Class Room building is to be placed where the old school room (Day) is now, as shown on the sketch, I think it would be better to put the Residence on the other end. There is plenty of room between the front side and the bank, and also between the back line and the edge of the bank. If however, the Class Room building were to be placed on the back or S.W. end of the School, then the Residence would be better where it is. In view of the fact that the Class Room building ought to be near the playground, it would seem as though the N.E. end would be the proper place, and in that case I would strongly urge the Residence to be placed on the S.W. end, as it would be more private and would enjoy a much better view over the river and get lots more sunshine and be further removed from the playgrounds. In that case, the entrance from the outside might be placed in the front even if the study had to be given up and the living room would then occupy the S. side of the residence overlooking the river and the view southward. The kitchen would be quite...\nclose to the back of the school and the residence would be as far away from the laundry as possible. I do not know whether it would be possible to have a toilet installed on the first floor of the residence in addition to the one upstairs. If it could be done without much extra expense or disturbance of present plans, it would be very convenient.\n\n2. Boys' and Girls' sides, respectively.\n\nAs at present planned, the girls are to be on the N.E. side of the school and the boys on the S.W. end. This is doubtless due to the fact that they were so arranged in the old school. I would like to point out however, that the new school will be larger than the old one, and that the boys' playground as proposed adjoining the S.W. end is much the smaller of the two, and quite inadequate to give room for say 100 to 120 boys. Athletics play a large part in the education of our Indian boys and girls, and play grounds are vital accessories. There is not room on the back as at present planned for playgrounds for both, and the space between the school and the edge of the hill does not leave room for the present playground to be enlarged. The back playground is however, large enough for the girls' side if the change were made and the girls placed in the N.W. end of the building. The sports which take up most room for girls are planned games such as Soft Ball, etc., and there is room for such. Boys would have to go in any case to the front playground, at present intended for the girls, in order to play football for instance, so that there would not be any suggestion that the Department seriously consider making the S.W. end the girls' end in the new school and allow the boys to have the N.E. end with the larger playground.\n\nIf this change were made, it would bring the ladies' rooms on the girls' side, which would be better. They are at present on the boys' side.\n\n3. The Laundry\n\nThe laundry as proposed in the sketch plans, is to my mind, in quite the wrong place. It is right on the front and most public end of the building. There is no more noisy department of the school than the laundry, and to have it grinding out its noise to incoming visitors would be the reverse of pleasant. Again, it is right up against the living room of the residence as at present planned. Then too, it is at the furthest possible distance from the boiler room and the source of steam supply. Consequently I would urge that it be placed in the place now proposed for the Junior girls' play room, which would allow it to be of about the same size, and would allow it to be near the sewing room as proposed. The lines for outside would be nearer, and it would be much nearer the boiler room.\n\nAlso, I would strongly urge the Department to consider the installation of some form of Steam Mangle to assist with the ironing of flat wear. No work is harder on pupils than that in the laundry, and here again, any relief that can be given reacts favorably upon time available for more educative activities.\n\n4. Washing Dishes by mechanical means.\n\nI would strongly urge that some system of washing dishes by mechanical means be installed. This would make for much less danger of infection, and it would help materially in meeting the problem of school labor which is growing more difficult all the time due to the lowering of the grade age. Younger pupils are more and more coming to these schools and it is most important that the work required of the lesser\nnumber of older pupils ought not to interfere with adequate opportunity for really educative activities. For both reasons this proposal is important. The installation need not be at all expensive and I would urge that some such system as we have in operation in Coqualeetza be installed rather than the more complicated and expensive apparatus advertised by some firms. Most of the large restaurants have systems something like ours in Coqualeetza and they are efficient and ought not to cost more than around $100.00.\n\nIn discussing with Dr. Henderson the small outbreak of T.B. in the school, it was noted that it had been confined entirely to the girls' side, so that apparently no complaints were made through the dining-room. I think it is fair to assume that our system of washing and sterilizing dishes has justified itself.\n\n5. Dairy\n\nThe provision for a dairy is fine, but I would suggest that further provision be made for pasteurizing the milk. There would be room in the proposed space. Dr. McQuade, I understand, thinks this is very important, and I think we agree generally. Even if the herd is tested regularly for T.B., there is always danger of an infection through a cow becoming \"active\" between tests. Pasteurizing would take care of such a danger. If this is not done, then I would urge the building of a small dairy close to the barn with adequate water supply. The milk could then be cooled there, and taken to the school and placed in the refrigerator. This system is usually followed, but Pasteurization would be much the better and would entail no more work as the milk has to come to the school in either case.\n\n6. Sump in Student Dining Room.\n\nIt is very important to have a sump in the floor of the Student Dining room with adequate attachment to suitable drainage. This allows for scrubbing quickly, and for it being done more frequently, and to better effect than when pupils have to do it on their knees by hand. The extra time taken to do it that fashion is not justified in view of the need for time in really educative deportments. The only way at present to obviate this difficulty is to scrub too often. Such a sump would be inexpensive to install if done during the building of the school, and would be a boon to both staff and pupils.\n\n7. Plumbing on the Boys' side.\n\nI infer from the proposed plans that this will include installing urinals instead of so many toilets. I heartily approve of this. It means much better sanitation and less expense both to install and to keep up.\n\n8. Infirmary\n\nI note that the sketch plans place this room on the back of the school. There will be less light whereas it is the North side and it places the nurses' room completely at the back. I think it might well be considered that the Infirmary be placed in the front of the building. This would leave the nurse's room over the verandah of the main front entrance. It would allow the space at present taken up by her room for dressing room for pupils. It is important to have such a room for the school \"clinic\" twice a day, when the pupils who need attention parade before the nurse. The plans at present, while making commendable room for closets and medicine cabinets, etc., do not to my mind make allowance for such a dressing room as now suggested. Sunshine and light are important in an Infirmary and the south side is better than the proposed north side.\nIt occurs to me that I may not have made it clear as to what I mean by \"dressing room\". I mean a room where the nurse may change such dressings as need it, and where pupils come for treatment of minor injuries, etc. Such a room is most important and ought to be fitted with proper sink with hot and cold water. I had to install all this in Coqualeetza and the water had to be connected up with the kitchen range at considerable expense. Minor injuries very often become serious through lack of attention and consequent infection, and a room with simple but necessary appliances is most important in the health of the school.\n\n9. Iron Firman\n\nI would strongly urge the Department to consider the installation of mechanical stokers. It allows a saving on the first cost of the coal, and gives much more adequate service. We have never been so comfortable so far as heat is concerned at Coqualeetza, and since installing the mechanical stoker purchased by the Canadian Summer Iron Works, I would consider that it means a saving to the school of about $400.00 a year for the one on the main heating boilers alone, and best of all, we are getting HEAT from the fuel consumed. We have installed a second smaller unit to heat our hot water for baths, etc. It is automatic and by means of an \"Aquastat\" keeps an adequate supply always on tap. Previously we burned nearly one fifth more coal, and had a most inadequate supply of hot water. Now it is always ready and piping hot. I reckon we shall save another hundred dollars when this unit is paid for. Meantime we are paying for it out of the saving on fuel. The High Pressure steam boiler would allow for senior boys getting remaining in firing such units. Hand firing a heating furnace is not vital for their future. Firing a H.P. steam boiler would be however; I would suggest that not less than a 15 H.P. steam boiler be installed.\n\nIn conclusion, upon closer look at the plans, it would appear that the class room building is to be in the rear, between the boys' and girls' sides. This is better. It puts the play grounds in proper relation to each side. I would again however, urge that the respective sides be changed in accordance with reasons expressed above under (2).\n\nHoping these suggestions will be of some help and trusting that I have not held the plans too long, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.C.

We have looked over these, submitted them to the representative of the Woman's Missionary Society, and are sending them by air mail today to Captain Scott at Coqualeetza, with the request that he will study them and return them with any suggestions that he thinks would be wise. We are asking him to do this by air mail, as we, like you, appreciate the necessity of not delaying the matter any longer than possible.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd.) Geo Dorey.\n\nGD.MLT\nOttawa,\nMay 26, 1939.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nI enclose a sketch plan of the proposed new Alberni Indian residential school. You will note that the plan includes both the residential school section and the day school section.\n\nWith regard to the final plans for these buildings, any minor changes required to suit the function of the building can be made during the preparation of the working drawings, provided such changes do not require structural revision of the building. Should changes affecting the structural design of the buildings be required, it will be necessary to submit revised sketch plans for our approval before the final working drawings can be made.\n\nIn order that the erection of the building may not be unnecessarily delayed I should appreciate hearing from you as soon as possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.)

Will you kindly have these examined and if satisfactory initial one set and return to this office, at the same time providing the information required as regards the treatment of the chapel, services in the kitchens, bakery, etc., as requested in the Chief Engineer's memorandum, a copy of which is attached.\n\n(Sgd.) J. M. Wardle\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 23, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nRe: Proposed New Indian Residential School,\nAlberni, British Columbia.\n\nWhile a definite decision has not yet been made the Department is considering the erection of a new Indian residential school to replace the Alberni Indian residential school which was destroyed by fire on February 21, 1937. In the meantime I considered it advisable to bring the matter to your attention in order that a preliminary sketch might be made of the proposed building and other arrangements made in connection with it so that in the event of funds being provided there will be no unnecessary delay in commencing construction.\n\nAs a first step I would suggest that you arrange, at the earliest possible date, for a visit to Alberni by one of your engineers or an architect, if the services of the latter are available at the coast, with a view to examining the basement of the former school. Your representative should ascertain the size of the basement of the old school and all other information that would be of assistance in preparing plans.\n\nIn erecting a new residential school at this point provision will have to be made for 200 pupils and a staff of approximately 12 persons. The building should, of course, be fireproof.\n\n(Sgd.) H. W. McGill\nI am under the impression that if a building with four class rooms with full basement accommodation were erected separate from the main building, it would involve less expense and at the same time provide other advantages. The building containing the class rooms would not necessarily have to be of fireproof construction. The class room building would contain a hall in the middle with two class rooms on each side. Sliding partitions should be placed between the two class rooms on either side of the building. This would enable these rooms to be opened into one room if necessary. As stated above full basement should be provided under this building for vocational training purposes.\n\nIf the suggestion made in the preceding paragraph were put into effect it is quite possible that the present basement would be sufficiently large to permit the erection of the main building which should be a building with full basement, two stories high with dormer roof and a residence for the Principal at one end.\n\nAs soon as your representative forwards his report it would be appreciated if you would submit it to me for consideration by the officials of this Branch.\n\n(Sgd.) H. W. McGill,\nDirector.\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Phelan.\n\nRe - Indian Residential School,\nAlberni, B.C.\n\nWe are returning herewith a letter handed to the Architectural Division on the 13th ultimo in connection with the above school.

Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your wire this morning asking for my comments on the Alberni plans.\n\nI beg to say that these were forwarded to Toronto on the 5th of June by Air Mail, but in case they are delayed until after the meeting of the Home Mission Board Executive, on the 12th instant, I am sending a copy of the same to you by Air Mail today. The notes are necessarily a bit disjointed, but I think that the comments are fairly accurate. I trust they may be of some help to those in charge of the plans.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.C. Scott\nPRINCIPAL\n\nRCS/EW\nEncl.\nOttawa, July 6, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. JACKSON\n\nIn response to your request, I am sending forward herewith copies of certain correspondence relating to the construction of the Alberni Residential School. The subject matter of these communications, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nMay I direct your attention particularly to a letter, which was sent forward to the Surveys and Engineering Branch dated February 23, 1939. In this letter the officials of the Surveys and Engineering Branch were asked to make a preliminary survey of the site at Alberni. The records indicate that this survey was undertaken by Mr. G. H. Whyte, whose report is dated April 6, 1939, and was sent forward to this Branch with an accompanying letter from Mr. Wardle on April 20, 1939.\n\nYou may remember that Dr. Cochrane and Dr. Dorey, representing the Home Mission Board of the United Church of Canada, interviewed the Minister at his office on April 25, 1939. At that conference the advisability of using the Cocualeetza residential school as a sanatorium for the treatment of T.B. patients was fully discussed. On that date, also, the representatives of the United Church met Mr. Buck and Mr. Dudley at my office and discussed with them in a general way the type of building that should be constructed - dimensions, principal's residence, accommodation for vocational instruction, etc. An understanding was reached at that time that a copy of the sketch plans would be sent forward to the church officials just as soon as they were prepared.\n\nThree copies of the sketch plans were received by this Branch on May 24, 1939, and were sent forward to Dr. Dorey with an accompanying letter on May 26, 1939. Dr. Dorey acknowledged receipt of these plans in a letter dated May 30, 1939, and intimated that he had sent them forward by air mail to Captain Scott, Principal of the Cocualeetza School.\n\nOn June 10 a telegram was sent to Captain Scott, which read as follows: \"Anxious to have immediately your comments on plan, Alberni school\". On the evening of the same date the draft plans were received by this Branch from Dr. Dorey. These plans, together with a letter containing a number of suggestions made by Captain Scott, were handed to Mr. Buck, of the Surveys and Engineering Branch, on the 13th of June.\n\nR. A.

BAILEY\n\nI desire to refer you to my memorandum of April 26 and your reply of May 12 in connection with the disposal of the old material at the site of the Alberni Indian residential school.\n\nI wrote to the Indian Agent immediately following receipt of your memorandum and in a letter dated June 13 he reports as follows:\n\n\"I have the honour to refer to your letter of May 18th in connection with scrap iron at the site of the Alberni Residential School, and to report having surveyed this as instructed.\n\n\"I find that, contrary to my expectations, the value of same is negligible and the cost of transportation would overbalance the value.\n\n\"The only articles of real value are one Horizontal Return Tubular Boiler, apparently undamaged with the exception of some fittings, and one 100 gallon tank. The cast iron scrap consists of:\n\n- 100 ft. steam pipe\n- 20 radiators\n- 300 sash weights\n- Approx. 2000 ft. iron pipe, burnt and twisted.\n\n\"As there are no buyers locally, I would not recommend that the Department go to any expense in the matter of scrap, but would respectfully request instructions regarding the boiler, which could possibly be used to advantage in the new building. This boiler, of course, would have to be examined and passed upon by the boiler inspector.\"\n\nR. A.

Early in the year a representative of the Department visited the Alberni site and also the Fairbridge Farm School, near Duncan.

I wish to protest. It should not be more than two stories high for a number of reasons for which safety of the children in the case of fire, is number one. There is plenty of ground and the buildings should be separated. The laundry should be in a separate building and the school rooms. The spectacle of having little children 8 years old four stories up, in the case of fire and in the charge of a single young woman who might lose her nerve, is not pleasant to think of. Only a few years ago I found an Indian school with the youngest children on the third story and the fire escape would have baffled an adult in broad daylight. The tendency in all modern boarding schools now a days is to keep them down to two storeys high if the ground is available.\n\nYours faithfully\n\n(SGD.) A. W.

I have also supervised construction work for the Indian Department at Lytton, B.C. The Indian Residential School at Kuper Island, B.C. was built under my supervision some years earlier.

The short time I was in Vancouver I was busy with the Indian Commissioner and as he was very short of help it was necessary for me to take him away from his work, that probably is one reason why I did not spend more time in Vancouver. After leaving there I visited seven agencies.\n\nThe only ex-Indian Departmental officials I called on were Mr. and Mrs. Hutcheson and Mr. and Mrs. John Weir, former agent at Carlton, and I do not think I would have called on them only the departmental nurse kept asking me to go with her to see these people and on my return from Victoria she called for me in her car, which was very kind, and we went to see them. The next night I left. Had I used any common sense I would have taken a few days off, seen my friends in Vancouver and enjoyed myself for a few days.\n\nHowever, to get back to the subject of your letter - re building inspector of the new Alberni school. As far as I know the plans are not out yet and on checking this I find it is correct. All work of this nature is handled by the Surveys and Engineering Branch of the Department of Mines and Resources and an engineer of the department has looked after the inspection work of every building that has been erected in the last three years, and I presume the same procedure will be carried out in this case.\n\nE. Gardner-Smith, Esq.,\n614 West Pender St.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nTo make sure I just phoned Mr. Mills, Chief Engineer of the Surveys and Engineering Branch, and informed him of your letter, also that you had been an inspector on several of the schools built by the Indian Affairs in the west. Mr. Mills advised me that one of their engineers, a graduate of British Columbia University, who has been employed by the Surveys and Engineering Branch for the last 10 years, had already been slated for the position of inspector on the Alberni School. I regret that there is nothing further I can do in the matter.\n\nWith very kind regards to yourself and family, and hoping that I shall be able to make another trip to the coast, when I certainly shall arrange to see you.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Superintendent of Agencies.\n614 West Pender St.\nVancouver, B.C. Sep't 13, 1939.\n\nMy dear Mr. Christianson:\n\nI noticed in the papers a few days ago that tenders were being called for, for a new Indian school at Alberni, B.C. I called on Major MacKay, of the Dep't here, and although I had not met him before, he was very cordial, and seemed well disposed to help me in any way he could.\n\nOwing to changes in the various government departments in late years, the Major said that he scarcely knew to whom I should make application for the position of Inspector of Construction, and suggested that I send the application to you, as you would be sure to know the proper official, and would, he felt sure, do me the kindness of passing the application on. I also feel that I can impose on your kind offices to this extent, and consequently am sending the application in your care. If you feel that you can put in a favorable word or two as to your knowledge of my capabilities I shall greatly appreciate it.\n\nI was sorry to have missed you when you were at the Coast last year, as I did not know of your visit until the day after you left for the East. The Hutchesons told me how much they enjoyed your short call on them.\n\nPerhaps you have heard of the recent serious illness of Mr. Hutcheson, with pneumonia and heart trouble. For several days his life was despaired of, but he took a sudden turn for the better, and stole another march on the undertaker! He is practically fully recovered now, though not strong yet.\n\nI have been keeping busy with the Montreal Life since becoming domiciled in B.C., but still have a hankering for bricks and concrete, and would like to be at my old work again. Cyril is making an outstanding success of the Vancouver branch,\n\nMajor MacKay spoke very nicely of you, saying you were \"the right man in the right place\", with which sentiment I was in full agreement.\n\nTrusting your family and yourself are well and happy, and not worrying unduly about this regrettable war, and with kindest personal regards,\n\nYours very sincerely\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

In view of the information contained in your memorandum I consider it unnecessary to take any action regarding the work suggested in Rev.

Also there may be occasions when the latter would want more heat than might be necessary in the main building.\n\nIf we can give you any further information on this matter, will you kindly advise me.\n\nDirector.\nFebruary 9th, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Wardle\n\nRe: Indian Residential School, Alberni, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of the 5th instant with which was received copies of correspondence from Dr. McGill and Rev. R. C. Scott, in connection with the above, it is noted that Mr. Scott advances certain proposals and that Dr. McGill advises that his wishes should be met, provided that additional expenditure is not incurred.\n\nFrom Mr. Scott's letter it appears that he requests additions and changes to the Principal's residence as follows:\n\n1. Provision of a chimney to accommodate a fireplace in the Living Room to supply heat when general heating system is not in operation.\n\n2. Provision of a kitchen chimney to accommodate a garbage burner and to permit of supplementary heating.\n\n3. Domestic hot water tank in kitchen.\n\nIn connection with items 1 and 2 I may say that each room is equipped with radiators of sufficient size to provide adequate heat for any required load and at such times as a minimum of radiation is desired it will only be necessary to operate one boiler with a low fire. In discussing these points with officers of the Indian Affairs Branch we have been advised that when it is necessary to supply heat to the Principal's Residence it will also be necessary for some degree of heat in the school, and one of the boilers will then be placed in operation. As the garbage burner would be included in furnishings, it has not been mentioned herein.\n\nWith regard to item 3, the Principal's Residence is already supplied with hot water by means of the general hot water supply system, which, of necessity, will be in constant operation.\n\nIt is felt ............\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nIt is felt, therefore, that none of the extra work suggested in Mr. Scott's letter is necessary, but should the Indian Affairs Branch insist on meeting the wishes of Mr. Scott, it would involve an estimated additional cost of approximately Four Hundred Dollars ($400.00), in addition to causing a serious delay in the progress of the work while revisions were being made to the plans in this office.\n\nI may say that in accordance with a request from the Indian Affairs Branch, we forwarded to them, on the 8th instant, two complete sets of working drawings for the project which included plans of the drain layout. It is understood that one set of these plans is being forwarded to Mr. Scott.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\n\nChief Engineer.\nIt is felt, therefore, that none of the extra work suggested in Mr. Scott's letter is necessary, but should the Indian Affairs Branch insist on meeting the wishes of Mr. Scott, it would involve an estimated additional cost of approximately Four Hundred Dollars ($400.00), in addition to causing a serious delay in the progress of the work while revisions were being made to the plans in this office.\n\nI may say that in accordance with a request from the Indian Affairs Branch, we forwarded to them, on the 8th instant, two complete sets of working drawings for the project which included plans of the drain layout.

At the present time it appears that some $34,000 may be available from the latter project and a Memorandum to Council is being drafted asking for authority to pay or refund to the Church authorities the amount of the over-expenditure as represented by accounts submitted. Some of these accounts have already been forwarded to you.\n\nIf your understanding in regard to the additional payments is in accordance with that outlined above, would you kindly advise me if you would like to have all accounts submitted to you for inspection before they are paid by this Branch from the Port Alberni Vote, or if you would prefer that they be checked by our Architectural Division and paid without further reference provided they are considered in order.\n\nJ. M. Wardle,\nDirector.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of February 17th. I think you are quite justified in not incurring any \"extras.\" I hope, however, that it will be possible for the Engineer in charge and the Contractor to consult with Mr. Scott, because it seems to me that a little intelligent and careful planning might, without any additional expense, make it possible for provision to be made for playground accommodation. In any case, I presume that not very much will be done in the immediate future.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGD.MLT\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6434, File 877-5, part 6)\nOttawa, February 17, 1940.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nImmediately following the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, I discussed with Mr. Buck, of the Surveys and Engineering Branch, the suggestion submitted by you for our consideration.\n\nMr. Buck informs me that the contractors are under an obligation to level the grounds and terrace the land in the immediate vicinity of the school. Should we ask them to do more than they are called upon to do by the contract, such work would be looked upon as \"Extras\". These extras, I have learned from experience, are rather costly and I hesitate to recommend them. It is my personal opinion that any improvements that may be necessary should be undertaken by the Department, under the direction of the Principal, after the school is in operation. It is just possible that the Principal might be able to secure a certain number of Indians now in receipt of relief for this work. In any event, while the funds at our disposal are somewhat limited, I shall attempt to assist him in any reasonable program which he may deem necessary at the school.\n\nIt was my intention to visit Toronto some time this month, but in view of the dissolution of Parliament and the conditions now confronting me, I am not at all sure that I will be able to make the trip.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

It will, of course, be obvious to you that this will be necessary. Would it be possible for instructions to be sent to the Engineer in charge of the work, asking him to look into the matter and report as to what will be necessary?\n\nMight I also make the suggestion that Captain Scott, who will be the new Principal, be asked to confer with the Engineer? He might have some ideas about such things as provision for school playgrounds. My recollection of the site is that it is far from level, and it might be that some of the earth from the excavation could be used for levelling. My thought is that the Principal would have an idea as to what he needed in this line.\n\nI should be glad if you would take this matter up, as, whilst it is a matter of comparatively small expenditure, it is very necessary. The grounds at Coqualeetza are in good shape and we naturally feel that the grounds of the new school should be in as good shape as possible when the exchange between the two schools is made.\n\nI should like to know if you are coming to Toronto this month, as you suggested in a recent letter. We shall be very glad to see you, and whilst I can promise no brass band, I can assure you of a very hearty welcome!\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGD.MT\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

R.C. Scott, Sardis, B.C. Mr. Scott is at present the Principal of the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School at Sardis but he will be the Principal of the Alberni Residential School when it is completed. The letter explains itself and if it is possible to meet his wishes without increasing expenditure it would appear advisable to do so.\n\nMr. Scott has also requested that he be forwarded a set of the plans of the new Alberni School as he would like to familiarize himself with the layout of the building.\n\nMr. Scott also points out that it is very important that there should be plans showing the layout of drains from lavatories, kitchens etc. This is very important in the event of any stoppage and will permit repairs to be made more quickly. No doubt you also have plans of the drains and I should appreciate it if you would send him a copy of these together with the plans of the building itself.\n\nDirector.\nCOQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSARDIS, B.C.\n\nJanuary 23rd, 1940.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSupt. Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nFollowing information from Rev. R.F. Cochrane, P.D., of our Home Mission Board in Toronto in connection with the farm at Alberni School, I went over on Monday and Tuesday of this week. While there, I had more time to go into the matter of the heating of the residence in connection with the school. This, as you know, is to be done by the main heating plant of the school.\n\nAs I pointed out in my letter of the 15th inst., this would be almost impossible, but is running normally, and in the winter time, but it would be quite inadequate much of the time when it would not be necessary and still there would be need of heat for the residence. The proposal in my letter of the 15th was a makeshift. It seemed however, that something ought to be done, and I had little time for thought about it.\n\nHowever, now that I have had time to go further into the matter, and have had another look at the plans, it does not seem at all impossible to provide for an ordinary fireplace in the sitting room of the residence. The chimney need not be carried up high enough to be unsightly, and if the draft were not perfect, it could be materially helped by the use of a \"hood\" which would turn with the wind, on the chimney top. I feel that it is quite problematical to say that a chimney would not draw, or that it could not be made to draw, over the fireplace in the residence.\n\nWith an abundance of firewood handy, it does look quite wrong to consider installing electric equipment. This would add to other expenses which will be increased due to the location of the school, as measured with the same expense here at Coqualeetza for similar services. Hence, because of the real need for some supplementary heating, and since wood is easily obtainable, I would respectfully urge on the Department that a fireplace be built in the large sitting room of the proposed residence of the new school.\n\nWith regard to the Kitchen in the residence; it would appear that provision is made for installing an electric range. With nothing more than the fireplace in the sitting room, some form of heating would be necessary in the kitchen. Going over the plans again, I do not see why a flue could not be constructed within the walls of the main building to which the residence is attached. This would give a good chimney for a garbage burner attached to an electric range, or, for that matter, for any ordinary range. The top would not show at all, as it would in all cases be a part of the wall, and would not need to extend much beyond its top. This would cost little if anything extra, and would be perfectly safe.\n\nA garbage burner could also allow of the installation of a coil for heating a hot water tank. There will be weeks when the hot water system for the school will not be required, and an auxiliary hot water tank in the residence is a necessity.\n\nWe are really pleased with the plans for the residence. They show thought and understanding. I do feel, however, that the foregoing additions should be made, to secure a good and complete job.\n\nIn view of the progress being made on the building, it is urgent that some decision be reached almost immediately. Thanking you for your kind attention and interest in these things, and asking that you disregard my letter of the 15th inst. re an electric fireplace,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nREV.

January 19, 1940\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nWhen at Alterni last week I spoke to the representative of the contractors for the new school. He assured me that there were plenty of blue prints available so I wrote Mr. Wallace, but have now been informed that they have none to spare, but that if I would write to the Department, doubtless a set might be forthcoming. If it seems agreeable to you, I would very much like to have a set of plans as it would mean a good deal to me to be familiar with the layout of the school even before I might see the finished building. I fancy it would be of assistance in utilizing the space provided in best way.\n\nI would again call your attention to the fact that we have no plans whatever showing the layout of drains from lavatories, kitchens, etc., underneath the building itself. There is a good plan of the sewage disposal system from the exterior of the building to the outlet. We have experienced the greatest difficulty in locating stoppage in these drains underneath the building, as we can only go by theory as to where the various turns are and where the difficulty might be. We have at times put down over 100 feet of steel tape and then have not known just where it led. Consequently I would suggest that the Department secure in the case of the new school, accurate plans showing the location and direction of these drains beneath the floors of the building itself. Perhaps this has already been attended to, but I feel it of such importance owing to our experience here, to make mention of it.\n\nThanking you for your interest in all such problems, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRCS/EM\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6434, File 877-5, part 6)\nCOQUALEETZA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSARDIS, B.C.\n\nJanuary 15th, 1940.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nWhile over on Vancouver Island last week on School business, I took the opportunity to run over to Alberni and have a look at the new school now in process of erection. I think the Department is to be congratulated on the type of building, and on the construction evidently of the best. For such purpose, we were somewhat disappointed however, that the residence is but so far back from the front line of the building, and unless another way of approach can be found, it looks somewhat like an afterthought. However, I was glad to find from those on the ground familiar with the lay of the school, that it is where it will get the maximum of sunlight, so that moving it to the end where it is located was a good idea. On the other end it would have faced N.E., and would have gotten only a little sunlight in the morning. Now it will have the sunlight practically all day.\n\nMr. Wallace, the resident engineer, said that it would be impossible to build a fireplace owing to the fact that a chimney for it would have to run right up higher than the main building, and it would be unsightly, and would spoil the contour of the building. I can quite understand this, and should not, for that reason press for a fireplace.\n\nHowever, if the residence is to be heated from the main building, there will be a lot of time when it would not be necessary to light up the big furnace. Staff members and pupils, busy with their duties would not feel the need of heat, but it would be quite different with anyone sitting in the sitting room of the residence.\n\nHence, I trust that it might be possible to build a \"dummy\" fireplace, for want of a better word, which could be heated with electricity. It would not need to be used much, but very likely it would be badly needed when it was desired.\n\nIt occurs to me too, that there would have to be some sort of chimney for the kitchen range, even if it were an electric one. In that case a rubbish burner would require outlet through a chimney. I am sure, if it is possible, the Department will try to take care of this item which seems to me to be of some consequence.\n\nReferring again to the matter of a kitchen range, I really think it would be advisable to have an electric range installed. I am thinking not alone, but not very much at that, of our own convenience, but of the need of such a unit for training senior girls. We have our own electric washer purchased after the young girl mentioned below had gone to her position, but in the case of this girl, for whom we secured a household position, she went to a home where everything was electric; range, washer, ironer, etc. etc. We have an ironer now in the school laundry, which would take care of instruction in that phase of a modern home requirement, and our own washer would be used for that purpose also. It would seem that an electric range ought to be installed somewhere, and it could be used for purposes of instruction if in the residence kitchens. These are merely suggestions which occur to me, and I am sure you will give them your due consideration. Thanking you in anticipation, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

There will consequently be an unexpended balance of $84,000 of the Allotment provided in this fiscal year for the above project. The amount required for the coming fiscal year will thus be increased and is now estimated at approximately $104,500.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nApril 5, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nI have your memorandum of March 21 in which you advise that approximately $84,000.00 of the amount provided for the Alberni Indian Residential School will be unexpended.\n\nPlease arrange for the transfer to this Branch of an amount of $4,800.00 in connection with reconstruction project No. 30 at the Kenora Indian Residential School.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector\nRequisition for School Material\n\nDate: March 31st, 1940.\n\nFor: Alberni Indian Day School West Coast Agency\n\nNOTE:\nTo avoid delay, teachers should give full particulars regarding each article required.\nThe name, series, number of grade, and name of author and publisher of all books required should be given as fully as possible.\nWhen ordering kindergarten material, the catalogue number of some well known firm should be given for each article required.\nOnly one item should be specified on each line of this requisition and no entry should be made under heading \"Number Authorized\".\n\n| ARTICLES | NUMBER ON HAND | DATE OF LAST RECEIPT | NUMBER REQUIRED | NUMBER AUTHORIZED | REMARKS |\n|----------|----------------|----------------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------|\n| Floor Oil | \u2014              |                      |                 |                   |         |\n\nN.B.\u2014Explicit information regarding address must be furnished.\n\nName: J.

C.\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nI am giving herewith, for your information, final figures on the value of the work done on the Port Alberni School by the Marwell Construction Company up to the end of the past fiscal year:\n\n1. Gross value of work done to March 31st, under contract .................. $62,862.35\n\n2. Total payment made for work done up to March 31st, 1940, retaining one-half of the 10% holdback only .................. $59,719.71\n   (Gross value of work - $62,862.35\n   Less 10% - 6,286.28\n   $56,576.57\n   Add one-half of holdback 3,143.14\n   $59,719.71)\n\n3. Amount of re-vote necessary, including one-half of holdback .................. $90,280.29\n\n4. Additional amount required to be voted to bring the total to $170,500.00 ....... $20,500.00\n\nThe sum of $111,000.00 should therefore be provided for in the 1940-41 Estimates in connection with the Port Alberni Indian Residential School.\nOn work of this nature there is usually a holdback of 10% of the value of the work done by the contractor until the project is satisfactorily completed, which in the present instance means that there will be a carry-over of funds due the contractor for work done in 1939-40 into the fiscal year 1940-41. In order to reduce the re-vote required as much as possible and since the Department is well protected by security bond, we have only held back 5% of the gross value of the work done in 1939-40.\n\nYou will note that the figure now given is greater than that given in my memorandum of March 31st and which was estimated prior to the receipt of the March estimate of work done.\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\nJune 26th, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Wardle\n\nRe: Indian Residential School, Alberni, B.C.\n\nIt is brought to your attention that there is included in the contract price for the above, a sum of Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) to cover specially built shelving, storage racks, isolated counters, etc., as might be required for definite functions in certain areas, the details for which were not known when the contract was awarded.\n\nWith a view to obtaining information regarding this equipment, the matter was discussed with officers of the Training Division, Indian Affairs Branch, but no such information was available.\n\nThe data required for transmission to Mr. Cornish, our engineer at the job, is as follows:\n\n(a) Storage rooms: Details regarding dimensions and spacing of shelving, storage racks, etc.\n\n(b) Locker rooms: Details regarding shelving racks used in lieu of pupils' lockers.\n\n(c) Dairy, bakery and laundry: Details regarding shelving, counters, etc.\n\nTo expedite this matter so that the information will be available for use while the carpenters are still on the job, it is recommended that the Indian Affairs Branch be requested to have their Indian Commissioner for British Columbia make arrangements for Captain Scott, the Principal, to visit Alberni as soon as possible, and confer with Mr. Cornish.\n\nDefinite instructions regarding the desired construction of the equipment mentioned might then be transmitted directly to Mr. Cornish, who would be able to advise Captain Scott to what extent the provision of such equipment might be carried for the amount provided under the contract.\n\nAs it will not be long before the carpenters have completed their work on the school, I would appreciate being advised on this matter as soon as possible.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ.

It would appear, however, that there is not even a remote possibility of securing funds other than the amount necessary for essential furnishings. We have been informed by the Government that it is simply impossible in this national crisis to secure the funds necessary to maintain our regular services in the sense that they have been maintained in recent years. I can only express the hope, therefore, that this crisis will pass quickly and that we shall be in a position in the immediate future to give sympathetic consideration to the best ways and means of improving our courses of study and equipment at our Indian day and residential schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

I expect I misunderstood the Principal of another school and thought he said the Department supplied them with such a vehicle. I shall have to try to arrange it in some other way although I do not see my way clear at the moment to get a truck ourselves.\n\nI wonder if it will be possible to secure a moving picture machine for the new school as part of the equipment? Our present one gives a lot of trouble and is not satisfactory. It is a very old model, silent, and has only one ratchet for passing the film along. This results in torn films and unsatisfactory use. It would bring very little in a trade in on a new machine, but I would be willing to let it go in that way if it would help.\n\nThanking you for your interest at all time, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Scott's recommendations covering the removal of certain buildings near the new Alberni Residential School and the erection of a gymnasium, I enclose herewith a report, dated the 7th instant, from Mr. Indian Agent Ashbridge in this connection, which is self-explanatory.\n\nIt is not expected that the Department will undertake this work until funds may become available for the purpose.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M.

R. C. Scott on buildings etc. at the Alberni Residential School.\n\nRegarding the slaughter house, near the back of the residence, and the building referred to in paragraph three as a store-house, I would recommend that these be torn down and the lumber given to the local Indians, as the buildings are of no value and detract from the appearance of the school.\n\nThe old barn, while not being a thing of beauty, may be required later as an implement shed or garage, and it would not seem good policy to destroy all these buildings if others are going to be found necessary.\n\nThe old day school stands on a good cement foundation with a good cement basement. If it is found necessary to remove it, I would suggest that it be skidded back about fifty feet, rather than destroyed, as it should prove to be a very useful building for many purposes.\n\nRe proposed gymnasium, I would hesitate to recommend such a building as referred to by Mr. Scott, not knowing whether the Department is prepared to go to added expense. The weather here, for the greater part of the year, is suitable for outdoor gymnastics and exercise, and I would say that setting up drill out of doors is far more healthy than indoor exercises.\n\nMr. Cornish also agrees that such a building would detract from the appearance of the school. I would prefer to leave this matter until such time you are able to inspect the present building, and thus form a better opinion.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP. B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\n\nD. M.

The Inspector is not expected to return from the north until the middle of next month but in the meantime I have written to Mr. Indian Agent Ashbridge for his views with respect to several of the matters dealt with by Mr. Scott. On Inspector Barry's return, the subject matter of Mr. Scott's letter will be given further consideration and I will again communicate with the Department.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M.

R.C. Scott. I should appreciate having your views on the various matters mentioned in this letter. For your guidance I may say that while the Department hopes to be able to obtain the funds that will be necessary to furnish this building in a reasonably comfortable manner at the same time it must be realized by all parties concerned that it will be impossible to secure funds for many improvements that might be considered necessary. The provision of such improvements will simply have to wait until some future time when funds can be secured.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M.

C.\nOttawa,\nApril 23, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant requesting that in equipping the new Alberni School the Department arrange for the purchase of a truck.\n\nWhile we hope that funds will be provided for furnishing the new building at Alberni in a reasonably comfortable manner there is not a remote possibility of securing the funds that would be required for the purchase of a truck. Besides, it has not been the practice of the Department to supply trucks or automobiles at Indian residential schools. Such vehicles are always purchased by the school management from their own funds.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hosey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. R.C. Scott,\nPrincipal,\nCqqualeetza Residential School,\nSardis, B.C.\nMr R.A. Hoey,\nSupt. Welfare and Training,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr Hoey:\n\nWhile at Alberni recently in connection with our farm programme, I took occasion to look over the grounds of the new school with special reference to the old buildings which are there. I noted that the old slaughter house is quite near the back of the residence, and hence would be quite unsuitable for that purpose should we ever wish to do our own butchering. It is somewhat on the playground on the girls' side as well, so that I feel it could very well be torn down. It is old also, I might have said.\n\nThe same is true of the old barn situated somewhat farther away from the residence, but quite an encroachment upon the ground for the girls' play space. It is, if anything, older than the aforementioned building, and I do not see that it would fit into any scheme for use by the new school. Both buildings are unsightly in the presence of the fine building at present being erected.\n\nThere is another older building, at present being used as a storehouse for the materials of the contractors. It might have been a woodshed in days past, but is beyond all repair now, and is too close to the new school. It is very unsightly and should come down.\n\nWhat should be done with the old Day School building which is immediately in front of the North end of the new school? I cannot say, except that it ought to be taken away.\n\nI feel sure that your Mr Cornish will be able to advise you further on these points, and shall be satisfied with what may be decided when you have heard from him. I am sure however, that these buildings should come down. If new ones are required, it would be good training for the Manual Training boys to erect them under supervision of their instructors, if the Department would be good enough to supply the materials. None of these buildings would be high enough to be a hazard to the boys in doing that work.\n\nRe a Gymnasium: there is going to be real need for such a building at the new school. Play rooms are not adequate for sports such as are fundamental to the health and training of these boys and girls. There is a fine site just alongside the new class rooms, but sufficiently removed, for such a building. I wonder if it might be possible to have Mr Cornish, or some other of your men prepare a plan\nCoqualeetza Residential School\nUnited Church of Canada\n\nREV. R.C SCOTT, B.A.\n\nSardis, B.C.\n\nR.A.H.\n\nfor such a building. It could then be gone into, perhaps jointly by\nthe Church and the Department. I understand that a considerable sum\nwas raised by the former Principal of Coqualeetza, the Rev Dr G.H.\nRaley for use as a building fund for a Chapel. As that will not now\nbe necessary, it might be possible to have it diverted for the\nbuilding of a Gymnasium. We could fit up the Assembly Hall as\na chapel, and use part of the fund for that purpose. The assembly\nhall is, I fear too small to be adequate for a \"gym\" although I have\nnot investigated that closely up to the moment. I think I am safe\nin saying it is.\nI have not taken this up with either Mr Cornish or with our own\nmen in Toronto, but shall do so in the near future. Meantime, you will\nhave the proposal before you.\nThanking you in anticipation, and with all good wishes, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL\nCoqualeetza Residential School\nUnited Church of Canada\n\nPrincipal\nREV.

The tires are bad this year, although I have got a new set since the truck was first put into commission four years ago. The wheels are \"wheezy\" and have been cobbled up and last year they gave us a lot of concern. I really do not feel it is right to ask the Camp Overseer to use it this year, for it is not safe. The brakes need a lot of expense also to make them safe.\n\nWe have not so much use for a truck about the school during certain times of the year, but in the summer we use it every day to haul water. Two barrels of drinking water have to be hauled every day along the highway from White Rock to our Camp, a distance of about a mile and a half. Then, it is our principal way of getting the children out for picnics or to take their part in soft ball or other games as are arranged from time to time during the summer. When my cure is not at camp, and it is impossible for it to be there constantly, there is nothing but this old truck for use to take a child to the doctor, for instance, as is necessary at times during every summer. There will be from sixty to seventy children there again this year I expect.\n\nWhen we go to Alberni, it will be necessary for us to have a truck, at least a one ton one, and perhaps a ton and half would not be amiss. All our coal will have to be hauled from the depot and as this is a mile and a half or more, it means that a team cannot be used to advantage as it would take so long there would be demurrage on the car, and interfere with the school work of the boys detailed.\nR.A. Hoey,  \nApril 15th, 1940\n\nAs we have, or expect to have, plenty of help, it would not pay to have to hire trucking of this kind done. In view of the fact that food and most times we have to buy will be higher in price, it is likely that we shall have to buy wholesale in Vancouver and have our goods shipped over direct from there to Port Alberni, and then haul them from the Government wharf ourselves. I have been in touch with wholesale firms, and they suggest this as the best way of getting our supplies. I would like to be able to go down with our own truck and haul them to the School. With all the stokers to be supplied, and since we are likely to burn coal in the kitchen range as well, there will be a lot more coal used than here where we use wood for the kitchen stoves and residences. We use our teams as we can put two of them on, and the car is spotted only a block from the school, but in Alberni, as I have pointed out, it will be different.\n\nI trust that it may be possible to include in the equipment for the new school a truck of at least one ton capacity, and perhaps a ton and a half. If it could be supplied for this summer, we could use it as above for our Camp prior to moving over to Alberni.\n\nHoping for favorable consideration, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.C.

We have one or two snapshots taken by somebody, but they are very poor and would not make a decent cut.

It would appear from recent correspondence that it is the intention of the school authorities to transfer a number of electrically operated units from the Cocumletza School to Alberni, with the object of making provision for a worthwhile course of vocational instruction at the new building.

This involves additional installations, heavier wiring and a rearrangement of the existing switchboard.\n\nInstructions are being issued immediately to the contractor to undertake this work as an extra work item, funds being available in the amount provided.

The children are all well clothed and fed, and appear to be very happy. Meals are very good and well prepared. The cups and dishes however are not good, being enamel ware and badly chipped and difficult to sterilize. The laundry was in operation at time of inspection, and appeared to be running satisfactorily. Grounds and classroom were in good order, as were the dormitories, hallways and basement.\n\nThe staff appears to be very capable and considering the inevitable confusion attendant upon the opening of a new school, very good progress has been made.\n\nAs the previous visit to the school during the month, I was accompanied by the medical officer, who examined all pupils admitted from west Coast points. Mr. Jones also inspected the school, and was well satisfied.\n\nThe boilers and heating plant were also inspected during the month by the boiler inspector, Mr. Arnall.\n\nP. B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\nThis is to certify that the above is a correct voucher of expense in connection with the freight charge on furniture shipped by McLennan, McFeely & Prior to the Alberni Indian Residential School. The articles were received in good condition and it is a fair and just charge on the Government of Canada.\n\nSIGNED:\n\n[Signature]\n\nReceived Payment\n\nOperator\n\nShipper\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**PAY TO** Island Freight Service, Ltd.,\n\n**ADDRESS** 514 Cormorant Street,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| Dec. 3 | School Account. |        |\n|       | Cartage on 20 pieces of furniture, Nanaimo to Alberni Residential School, September 1940. | 12.60 |\n\nVote 99.

We had four in the old school and even though we have the steam ironer here, it takes care only of the flat work and a certain amount of other plain ironing, and while this is a tremendous relief and help, it does not take care of the ironing of girls' dresses, boys' Sunday shirts, etc., which is always a considerable item. Consequently, to avoid extra expense I told Mr. Lake the contractor, to put in these circuits and that I would take the matter up with you.\n\nI regret very much having overlooked the matter until I received the account from Mr. Lake a few days ago. It is dated November 30th, but the account came to hand only within the last few days. I regret very much this over-sight, but there was nothing to bring it to my mind again until the receipt of the account. I am quite prepared to deal with it out of school funds if necessary, seeing it has been delayed in reaching you, but as it is new equipment and very necessary, I would appreciate any sympathetic attention which you may feel able to give to it.\n\nThanking you in anticipation I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd.)

Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools for the Province of British Columbia, visited the above-mentioned residential school on November 13 and 14 and reports that it was impossible to hold any sort of fire drill as the Department has not provided any fire alarm system in either the main school itself or in the class room block.\n\nI do not see any necessity for a fire alarm system in the class room block but I was under the impression that fire gongs had been installed in the main building.

Principal of the Alberni Indian Residential School has applied for materials to construct a boat house and piggery at the school.\n\nThere has already been some correspondence regarding the piggery, vide your letter of November 25, 1940, your file 159-1-5. Mr. Scott suggested at that time the removal of the existing pig pens to a new site and their repair and extension. However, as there were no funds for repairs, the Department could not approve of the expenditure involved. The attached application is for a complete new piggery.\n\nBoat building was carried on as an important division of the Manual Training instruction given to the pupils at Coqualeetza, and it is the intention to continue this policy at Alberni. The children attending Alberni School are nearly all from maritime Agencies and from families engaged in industries where fishing and towing boats are constantly in use. There is no doubt that good boat building accommodation should be provided at Alberni, and I would recommend that the Department approve of the purchase of the materials required for this purpose. The cost of lumber, hardware, paint and chimney for the project is estimated at $650.00. The construction would be under the supervision of the boat builder and the labour supplied by the school without cost to the Department.\n\nThe cost of the new piggery is placed at approximately $250.00. The labour in connection with this project would also be supplied by the School and the construction carried out under the supervision of the boat builder, who is an experienced carpenter. Should funds be available, I would recommend favorable consideration of this expenditure.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nThe provision of a building for the training of the children in practical boat building construction is necessary and should be given priority over the other expenditure applied for.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to forward herewith request of the Reverend Principal of Alberni Indian Residential School for materials for construction of a boat shed and a piggery.\n\nAs instructed during our conversation on the subject, I obtained quotations from local sources and attach same with analysis.\n\nIt is understood that all labour in connection with these buildings is to be provided by the school, if approved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.

Before laying any linoleum on the basement slab, the linoleum layers tested the concrete for dampness and were satisfied that the surface was dry.\n\n\"Linoleum floors have been cleaned by scrubbing with mop and water, this being done as often as three times a week. As the linoleum was laid with tight joints filled with wax, I do not think that the scrubbing started the condition. However, once a joint was slightly opened the use of water no doubt accentuated the trouble. The danger of using an excess of water on the linoleum surfaces was pointed out to Mr. Scott.\n\n\"Careful examination of basement walls and of cement floor areas not covered with linoleum disclosed no sign of dampness. The linoleum on all floors above the basement is in good condition\".\n\nMr. Cornish's report has been carefully reviewed, and it is felt that in addition to the damage attributable to excess water used in cleaning, the possibility exists of a slight trace of moisture being present in the concrete slab below the linoleum during the rainy season.\n\nIt is common practice to lay linoleum on good concrete basement floor and this was followed in this structure in order to keep capital cost as low as possible. However, it would seem local conditions at Alberni would be better taken care of by the application, over the concrete slab, of a damp-proofing treatment.\n\nThe cost of carrying out such work is no greater now than when the building was under construction, with the exception of the minor charge of lifting the linoleum.\n\nThe enclosures which were forwarded with your memorandum of the 29th ultimo included an estimate dated the 25th ultimo from the Fred M. Beatty (Tremco Western) Ltd., to take up linoleum, remove all adhesive materials from floor and linoleum, thoroughly damp-proof all concrete floor surfaces and lay linoleum in certain listed rooms, for the sum of $718.00. The list included all linoleum covered areas except the boys' and girls' locker rooms. In considering treatment we felt these areas should also be included. The Beatty Company have advised by wire in this connection:\n\n\"Retel locker areas not included in tender STOP Figure eighteen cents per square foot additional STOP This now covers all linoleum areas in basement STOP Can safely recommend and guarantee specification\".\n\nThe additional area involved is approximately 600 square feet and at the figure quoted raises the total cost to $823.00, which is considered reasonable.\nUnder the circumstances it is recommended that the price submitted by The Fred M. Beatty Tremco Ltd., of Vancouver, be accepted.\n\nWith regard to the item in the Beatty tender regarding the application of Tremco Penetrem floor finish to the linoleum in the three basement Recreation rooms, at an additional cost of $82.00, I may say that these areas were specified to be wax finished when the linoleum was laid and the suggested treatment over a waxed surface is not desirable. The linoleum should be waxed periodically as an ordinary maintenance operation.\n\nWith reference to the Fir floors in the Classroom Building which were reported to be deteriorating due to unsatisfactory finish, Mr. Cornish reports as follows:\n\n\"There is slight wear in the most used sections of these floors and some dirt has been ground into the surface of the flooring. The condition is not serious, the wear being no more than might be expected from the heavy traffic. In my opinion, there is no evidence of faulty material or finishing. In order to apply a protective finish of the nature of Penetrem it would be necessary to re-sand the floors. Such a finish would certainly save the surface from future wear but I do not see the necessity for it at this time\".\n\nUnder the circumstances no action is recommended in this connection.\n\nThere still exists a free balance of $1,020.00 from funds provided under this year's estimates for the project. If these funds are to be used for the work it will be necessary to arrange to begin work immediately to have it completed before March 31st. In this connection it should be ascertained from the Indian Affairs Branch whether they prefer to have the work carried out now with funds available, but at great inconvenience to the school authorities, or if they will provide funds in 1941-42 to have the work carried out during the summer months when the pupils will be absent.\n\nWe would be glad to be advised of the decision regarding the matter as soon as possible if the work is to be carried out before March 31st.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nChief Engineer.\nFebruary 23, 1941.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nThe destruction by fire of the new classroom building at Port Alberni, which is mentioned in your memorandum of February 20th, is very much regretted.\n\nThis building was part of a lump sum contract which covered the construction of the residential building as well, but its replacement value is placed at $16,000.\n\nThe classroom building was heated by hot water from the main heating plant in the main building. Two stand pipes were located in the classroom building, each with fifty feet of two-inch fire hose, and which could reach every part of the building. The school buildings are connected with the Alberni Water System which has a pressure at the school of 30 pounds. An electric booster pump was installed in the boiler room when the school was constructed to boost this pressure to 60 pounds, in case of fire.\n\nOur Engineer, Mr. Cornish, recently inspected the School and in a telegram received yesterday he states as follows:\n\n\"Recent inspection disclosed nothing likely to become a fire hazard.\"\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 25, 1941.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nI am in receipt of your memorandum of February 20 forwarding a report on the condition of the floors in the basement of the Alberni Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is noted that to do the work required will involve an expenditure of $623.00. There are no funds for this purpose provided in our appropriation for the fiscal year 1941-42.\n\nDirector.\nPORTALBERNI BC 915A FEB 19\n\nTHE SECRETARY, INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES OTTAWA ONT\n\nREGRET REPORT CLASSROOM BUILDING ALBERNI RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL COMPLETELY DESTROYED BY FIRE NO DAMAGE TO MAIN BUILDING NO ONE INJURED COMPLETE REPORT TO FOLLOW\n\nP B ASHBRIDGE INDIAN AGENT\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6434, File 877-5, part 7)\nFebruary 20, 1941.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe - Floors, Indian Residential School, Alberni, B.C.\n\nOur Engineer, Mr. C.R. Cornish, made a recent inspection of the condition of the floors in the basement of the above building, with particular regard to the cementing of the linoleum on the concrete floors. The attached copy of Mr. Mills' report of the 13th instant in this connection is self-explanatory.\n\nI am advised that with the provision made in this building for sub-drainage of the basement by a tile system underneath the floor, it was considered that the cost of waterproofing might be saved. However, perhaps due to both seepage from under the floor and from water applied to the floor surface, waterproofing seems now necessary, and our officers recommend that the offer of the Fred M. Beatty (Tremco Western) Ltd., to take up the linoleum, damp-proof all concrete floor surfaces and re-lay the linoleum in certain rooms, for $715.00, be accepted. At the same time, the locker areas should be similarly treated, giving an approximate cost of $823.00.\n\nThere are funds remaining in the Vote for this School to cover this work, but it is doubtful if it should be undertaken at this time. It will greatly disrupt the work of the School and the dining room facilities, if undertaken now, as the work would likely be under way for some three weeks. At the same time it might be difficult to get the floors thoroughly dry at this time of year.\nIt would consequently be preferable to defer the work until the School is closed next summer, if your Branch could make funds available at that time.\n\nWould you kindly advise me of your wishes in this connection.\n\nDirector.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to report on the fire which destroyed the classroom building of the Alberni Indian Residential School.\n\nDate and Time. Fire was first discovered at 10:30 P.M. on February 18th, 1941.\n\nNotification. At 10:40 P.M., I was informed by the telephone operator that she thought there was a fire at the Indian Mission.\n\nAction. I immediately phoned Constable Garrard, and proceeded to the school, arriving at approximately 10:50 P.M. On arrival I noticed that the fire was centred about the entrance and the centre of the building and roof. The fire department from Alberni had arrived and had two streams of water on the fire from the one hydrant. The amount of water was insufficient to be of any great value, and the fire was quickly out of control. Every effort was made to protect the main and surrounding buildings, and the fire was successfully confined to the classroom.\n\nI had the Constable patrol the grounds, and posted others on the roofs of main buildings with extinguishers. The School staff and pupils behaved splendidly. Pupils were dressed and held in dormitories, and no confusion or panic existed. Members of the staff guarded the exits and assisted generally in a very creditable manner.\n\nFire completely destroyed the classroom building and contents. Manual training machinery and exhibits were also destroyed. Fire was turned out by 1:30 A.M., when I arranged for one hose to be left with a fireman in charge.\n\nOn return from the school, I immediately notified Mr. D. M. MacKay, and wired the Department of the occurrence.\n\nEnquiry. On February 19th, I investigated causes etc. in company with the Provincial Police, and attach hereto findings and evidence as taken. The Police notified me that they were conducting their enquiry, and were not requested by myself to do so.\nReport on fire, Alberni School.\n\nApproximate Loss. Approximate loss would be as below:\n\n- Building $10,000\n- Machinery 1,000\n- School Desks & Supplies 1,500\n- Pianos, etc. 500\n- Supplies 500\n- Exhibits 300\n\n$13,800\n\nCause of Fire. As investigation is being continued, I would hesitate at this time to express an opinion, but I do not feel satisfied that it was caused by spontaneous combustion or by carelessness.\n\nInspection by Commissioner. On February 21st I accompanied Mr. Commissioner D. M. MacKay on his inspection of the school, at which time temporary arrangements were made for carrying on the school routine.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP. B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\n\nD. M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nRev. R.C. Scott, B.A., Principal.\n\nI was in the Mending Room with Miss Kirkpatrick, the Matron, talking over arrangements for the Opening Day. I left there at 10:20 P.M. and came to the office. Then I stepped into the Staff Sitting room and just then Mr. Bothwell, who was on duty on the Boys' Side came along. I asked him if he smelled smoke. He said \"No\", but I distinctly smelled something so though there was cloth burning or burning rubber. We stood around a moment and then Mr. Bothwell went to the Boiler Room. He came back up and said there was smoke in the Boiler Room. I did not think anything of that as the fire box on the High Pressure Boiler often leaks a little smoke when freshly banked for the night. Mr. Bothwell then went through the door on the Boys Side and rushed back saying the Classroom Building was on fire. He rushed out then to the Classroom Building and I followed him. When I got to the door, the fire was burning up the wall to the right of the door and coming through the window at the top of the door and high up where did not seem to be any fire on the basement floor; it seemed to be on the steps and up the wall. It seemed to be a ceiling flame. There was no base to it. I rushed into the Main Building and got a Fire Extinguisher. The Alberni Fire Department had been called. One of the small panes in the glass door was broken and I squirted the pyrene fluid in through that. I saw then that I could not do anything more and I realized that the children might get panicky if the fire got bright enough to waken them, so I came back into the building and gave instructions to the staff to stand by and to dress the children.\n\nMiss L. Swartz, Teacher.\n\nI left the Classroom Building at ten minutes after six. I tried the door to see if it was locked and it was. I know it can be forced open if you pull on both doors. There was nothing inflammable in the hall and there was nothing there to cause a fire that I could see.\n\nSubsequent enquiry, February 19th, 1941, by Indian Agent and Provincial Police:\n\nQues. When did you leave the building, Miss Swartz?\nAns. Ten minutes after six.\n\nQues. How did you establish the time? Ans. I looked at my watch.\n\nMiss Swartz: The lights were out. I had the hall light on and put it off when I came out. Miss O'Brien came over at 5:30 for her supper. When I came out the little catch on the door was out. Why it was out, I don't know. I just wondered if it had slipped out or what. When I had come in I knew it was in. When I went in the catches were back in. I came definitely putting my finger on the part for my thumb. I went in at 5 o'clock. We were looking over seat work. I didn't have a light on. I didn't see anyone and didn't hear anyone. Had classroom door open too. I didn't have the light on at the foot of the steps but I could see my way down. This is my first year. I have the Junior room.\nMiss L. O'Brien, Teacher.\n\nI saw the fire between 10:25 and 10:30 P.M. There was no one around the Classroom Building. The flames were coming out above the door. I ran out to the school. Mr. Bothwell was ahead of me. The door did not appear to be locked. It was open when I got there. The hall seemed full of fire right in front of the door.\n\nSubsequent enquiry, February 19th, 1941, by Indian Agent and Provincial Police:\n\nMiss O'Brien: I have been here four and a half months. I teach grades three and four.\n\nQues: Did you go into the building with Miss Swartz? Ans: Yes.\n\nQues: Who opened the door? Ans: Miss Swartz - with a key.\n\nQues: Did you notice just exactly what she did with the lock?\n\nAns: No. I was talking to two boys and didn't notice what she did. They came with me into my room, one of them wanted his book. Then they both went directly out. I saw them out. I came back here about 5:25. I came out through the boys' door. I believe it was open, I don't remember for sure. The boys were then lining up. I came directly over to the school.\n\nQues: Would you be definite in saying that only Miss Swartz was left in the building? Ans: No - I wasn't in the other two rooms. They were closed. There was no sound. I believe Miss Enves was in one room when we arrived. She left after we had got there.\n\nQues: When did you first notice the fire? Ans: 10:25 to 10:30, I think. I was in my room. I was opening my window. I saw the blaze coming from the boys' entrance from the door to the roof. Right from the bottom to the top. When I got over to the school the door was open but I believe Mr. Bothwell opened it just then. I didn't see anyone on the grounds from my window. I wasn't looking for anyone. I couldn't see very far around.\n\nMr. Nichol, Engineer.\n\nI saw the fire about 10:30 P.M. I live in the cottage and I was in bed. Mr. Prosser, who lives there too, saw the fire and shouted that the school was on fire. He went out ahead of me. I saw no one. I am usually the last around at night. I left the cottage about 9:55 P.M. and came to the Boiler Room to look after the fires for the night. There was no fire then in the Classroom Building. I came up through the building and out the front door. That was about 10:20 p.m.\n\nSubsequent enquiry, February 19th, 1941, by Indian Agent and Provincial Police.\n\nQues: You are the Engineer, Mr. Nichol? Ans: Yes. I have been employed here since 1st August 1940. I came from Coqualeetza. I am staying in the cottage and I am practically the last one around the buildings at night looking over the boilers, etc. At about 5 to 10 I went over to the Boiler Room. I saw no lights in the Classroom Building. If there was any fire, I would have seen it. At the school, whoever comes last puts out the lights and sees that the doors are locked. I wasn't within 50 or 50 feet of the door. There were definitely no lights. No one was around. I had been down in the boiler room 6 or 8 minutes. It was after ten before I left. The clock was striking ten when I was coming up the stairs from the Boiler room. The \"iron Firemen\" were the last that I put out. I came up here and looked into the staff sitting room, then came into the office with Mr. Scott for possibly ten minutes. I left there and went straight over to the cottage and went into the bedroom and looked at my watch. It was between 20 and 25 minutes past ten. I set my alarm clock at that time. (To go to the cottage, I left the school by the front door. I had my back towards the classroom building.) I then went to bed and Mr. Prosser came into the bedroom and looked through the window, and said \"the school is on fire.\"\nMr. J. Nichol, Engineer.\n\nThe fire was breaking through over the door. Whether it was coming through the glass or not I could not say. It was all right in the doorway. It hadn't broken through the ceiling then. It was all confined to the stairway and was not on either side or doorway at first, looking in through window. There was a light switch in the lobby. I would say there was absolutely no defective wiring. There was nothing in the back way leading from the Manual Training room to the Motor Mechanics that was inflammable, with the exception of lino on the stairs. My theory was that there was nothing inflammable. I hadn't been actually at the door and am not prepared to say that it was open or closed. I am not prepared to say if the door was locked or not. It definitely started in the stairs and was fed pretty huskily. I couldn't say that I smelt any special odour. There were no strangers around. I could see no lights or fire in the manual training room itself. I couldn't have helped seeing it if there was. I am positive there was no light or fire. There was no sign of fire in the Manual Training room when the firemen arrived. After they began to break windows the draft got in and away it went. Nothing could cause a short circuit in the wiring in building.\n\nQues.: What colour was the flame? Ans.: There was not much flame until it broke through the roof.\n\nThere were no rags in the building to cause spontaneous combustion.\n\nMr. R. Huddleston, Boat Building Instructor.\n\nI heard a roaring noise and saw the glare on the wall of my room. I did not hear anything outside of that. The fire was in the hallway inside the door on the Boys' Side of the Classroom Building.\n\nSubsequent enquiry, February 19th, 1941, by Indian Agent and Provincial Police.\n\nMr. Huddleston: I have been six years with the Indian Department. I have been heresince the school opened in August. I stay in the cottage Mr. Clover had.\n\nQues.: When did you first see the fire? Ans.: I thought it was 10 minutes past 10, but it must have been 20 minutes past ten. I noticed it from bedroom window which faces that way. I heard the noise (like a car on gravel) and saw the reflection on the wall at the same time. I was up like a shot. I looked out first, then, as I remember it, there was a considerable glare even though it seemed just like a few seconds for the start. They were all by the boys' dormitory door. (flames)\n\nIt seemed to be a mass of flames. The house is about 250 feet from the Classroom building. I went down to see it as quickly as I could. I didn't notice any peculiar odour. The motor mechanics department is in that building. There were some chemicals stored there but they were nowhere near where the fire started.\n\nQues.: Do the boys ever get out of the dormitories at night? Ans.: They can't after the doors are locked. When the lights are out, the doors are locked, and the lights are not put out until they are all in.\n\nI know that the Manual Training room was clean and tidy. It apparently didn't start in that room anyway. The centre burned out first. There was practically nothing that would burn. The hallway was painted.\n\nMr. R.R. Bothwell, Manual Training Instructor.\n\nI saw the fire at 10:25 P.M. I was just going through the Fire Doors on the Boys' Side. The flames were coming through the window above the doorway. I ran back down the hall and told Mr. Scott. Then I ran back out to the Classroom building. The door was loose but you could not force it. I closed the door at once as the flames broke out. As I came back from the Girls' Side, I saw an Indian coming across the grounds. I do not know who he was but I pointed him out to Mr. Scott and Mr. Nichol.\nMr. R.R. Bothwell, Manual Training Instructor.\n\nHe had a round face, about 5'4\" in height, wore horn rimmed glasses, a Chinchilla coat, grey trousers. He appeared to be quite neat. Just the one door opened. The plungers were in the door. The door on the Girls' Side was locked.\n\nThe flames appeared to be smouldering at first, but when I opened the door they flared up. The fire appeared to have started on the concrete floor and worked up the walls. The basement had all been cleaned up that day. I was in the Boiler Room at 10:20 P.M. and there was smoke in the Boiler Room. The building (Classroom) was full of smoke. There was a liquid on the floor under the door leading from the Motor Mechanics room into the passageway where the fire was. I do not know what this was.\n\nSubsequent enquiry, February 19th, 1941, by Indian Agent and Provincial Police.\n\nMr. Bothwell: Have been here about six months. This is my first appointment with the Department. I left the building about ten minutes to five. Miss Enves was in the building when I left. She was the only one as far as I knew. Building was clean and in order. I asked the boys to sweep the dust out of the passage - no rags, etc. First noticed the fire at 10:25 P.M. I came up from down stairs after putting lights out. Mr. Scott said he could smell smoke. I couldn't. I had been down in the boiler room. I saw an orange coloured flame coming through windows on the landing just in the doorway. Coming out through windows. Signs indicated fire was in lobby. Flames came out top window.\n\nQues. You pulled the door open? Ans. It wasn't unlatched. The door was closed but not locked. The lock wasn't out.\n\nQues. Did you open the door without a key? Ans. I unlocked the girls' door. Nothing can stick or hang up if door had been locked or charred from inside. On the girls' side it had definitely been locked. The door was well charred inside on the boys' side. I could tell from the heat coming from the door. One door was fastened and one was not locked. I put my hand out and pulled it. I always go out to the school, try door first, then if looked put key in it and open it. I have the key.\n\nWhat about the Indian you saw? -- I saw him coming across the girls' playground when I was coming back, or going to the girls' door. The Indian was coming from East to West. He was approaching the school. I can pick him out. I ignored him altogether. He had a surprised look on his face. His hands were in his pockets. He was coming towards the school.\n\nQues. Where, in your opinion, did the fire originate?\nAns. Either on the landing or just downstairs towards the basement. The fire seemed to catch hold in the wall. I told the firemen that alcohol, paint, etc. were in the manual training room.\n\nRe liquid on the floor: -- It wasn't burning. I have no idea what this would be. When I picked up my feet it seemed to cling to my feet. It was a concrete floor. No reason for it unless the fire extinguisher broke. The wiring was in flexible cable up above. I don't see how it could have possibly started there.\n\nQues. The boys do come down there after school hours?\nAns. They come down before the quarter to four bell rang, and watched me build the partition, then all cleared out after. I remember putting the latch on the outside door on the boys' side. Miss Enves mentioned she thought that Miss Swartz and Miss O'Brien were in the building. The Indian was there shortly after the fire.\n\nQues. How would you account for the quick way the fire took hold?\nAns. Perhaps the donnaconna board (pressed paper), which was used on all upper part of the hall. Three-ply was used below. I saw smoke while I was in the boiler room.\n\nQues. How long from time you were in boiler room before you saw fire?\nAns. A few minutes. I saw smoke in boiler room that had come through the tunnel.\nIt was a straight frame building. The construction was such that it should have been a slow burning building. The walls were finished in tile board, which is fireproof. I can't imagine how fire could have gained such rapid headway. It is the second building I have built like that. The large hall was 15 feet to the top. Flames shooting up from the bottom of the stairs would have a good chance to lick right up the centre of the walls. I believe there must be about 15 keys for these buildings because we locked the buildings up all the time. Many sub trades had keys. There are about 23 keys now in existence for these buildings. I had 8 more sent to Mr. Scott. Indians were around here all the time before the school was taken over by Mr. Scott.\n\n(The building must have been dry as tinder)\nWest Coast Agency,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\nFebruary 28, 1941.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to submit herewith regular Agency Letter, covering conditions within this Agency during month ending February 28th, 1941.\n\nSCHOOLS:\n\nAt the Alberni Residential School, fire destroyed the classroom block and all school supplies, desks, etc. A complete report on the fire has been forwarded.

It was to have been opened formally next week.\n\nRev. R. C. Scott, school principal, said he smelt \"an odor like overheated iron\" in the building about 10:20 p.m., but at first located no fire although a small quantity of smoke was seen coming from basement heating apparatus.\n\nWhile the tour of inspection was in progress, flames were seen to burst from the windows. The staff rushed to fight the fire while a call was sent in for the volunteer fire department, which arrived in seven minutes. No one was injured.\n\nFour years ago almost to the day the entire school was destroyed by fire.\n\nMr. Scott said the school opening would probably be postponed as a result of the fire. It was postponed once before due to a mild influenza outbreak among the children.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 27, 1941.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nWith reference to my memorandum of February 20 and your reply of February 23, in connection with the destruction by fire of the new classroom building at the Alberni Residential School, I enclose, for your information, copies of letters which have just been received from Indian Commissioner MacKay and Indian Agent Ashbridge.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 27, 1941.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Alberni Indian Residential School\n\nWith reference to the fire on February 16 which destroyed the classroom building at the above-mentioned residential school I enclose copies of letters which have just been received:\n\n1. The Indian Commissioner's letter of February 25;\n2. Indian Agent Ashbridge's letter of February 22;\n3. Statements of the Principal and staff members of the Alberni School in connection with the fire.\n\nDirector.\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department has no doubt been advised by Mr. Indian Agent Ashbridge of the destruction by fire last Tuesday night, the 18th instant, of the new classroom block of the Alberni Indian Residential School. I was informed of the fire by the Agent early Wednesday morning while in Victoria on my way to Alberni for the official opening, which had been arranged for 2 P.M. on the 21st instant.\n\nI visited the school on Friday, last, and conferred with Rev. Mr. Scott and also the Provincial Police and Provincial Fire Marshal, who were at the school making the usual investigation. Up to the present time the origin of the fire, which completely destroyed the classroom block, remains a mystery. Although incendiaryism is suspected and has been suggested, no evidence has so far been produced which would indicate this to be the cause.\n\nSmoke was first noticed issuing from the building shortly after 10 P.M. but the fire had gained too much headway to be controlled with hand extinguishers, the only fire fighting equipment available and which had to be taken from the main building as the fire prevented the use of the equipment in the classroom block.\n\nThe loss to the Department is considerable. Valuable stocks of school supplies, manual training tools and machinery, all the desks and classroom equipment were totally destroyed.\n\nMr. Ashbridge's report has been received and is enclosed herewith. Reports of the investigation held by the police and fire marshal will also be forwarded when received.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nThe assembly hall, senior girls' and boys' playrooms and the old day school will be utilized as classrooms until such time as the classroom block can be replaced. A complete list of desks and other equipment necessary to continue the academic work of the school will be forwarded at the earliest possible date. It has occurred to me that the Department would no doubt wish to purchase as much as possible of the equipment required from any balance that may still be available in the current year's Vote, and all information with respect to such equipment is being secured and will be provided without delay.\n\nRev. Principal Scott and Rev. Mr. Bunt, the Superintendent of the United Church Missions for B.C., are to visit this office this morning for a conference with Inspector Barry and myself.\n\nI expect, as a result of this conference, that it may be found necessary to have Inspector Barry proceed to Alberni during the first week in March to assist the Indian Agent and the Reverend Principal in the reorganization of the classroom work.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

H.H. Wallace and Rev. W. Allan of Victoria; Rev. J.H. Wright of Nanaimo; Rev. A. McLean and Rev. F.E. Pitts of Alberni. This committee accompanied by Rev. W.F. Bunt, United Church Superintendent of Missions for B.C., and Rev. R.C. Scott, principal of Alberni Residential School, met in the school on the evening of Friday the 21st, February at 7 p.m.\n\nOn motion the following resolutions were unanimously adopted:\n\n1. That this special Committee of Victoria Presbytery of the United Church of Canada places on record its deep appreciation of the excellent and far-reaching provision made for the comfort, wellbeing and educational development of B.C. native Indian children, in the erection of the new institution at Alberni, B.C., and known as the Alberni Residential School.\n\n2. That in view of the recent destruction by fire of the day school in connection with the Alberni Residential School, any future replacement of the destroyed edifice should be built of brick or cement.\n\n3. That ample supplies of hose and other fire-fighting apparatus should be provided for both Residential School and adjacent day school, such apparatus to be installed at a convenient location removed from the buildings themselves.\n\nWilliam Allan\nSecy.\nMarch 3, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith a letter dated the 28th ultimo received from the secretary of the special committee appointed by the Victoria Presbytery to make a survey of conditions pertaining to the work at Alberni Residential School, together with their resolutions, which are self-explanatory.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor D.M.

If these funds are to be used for the work, it will be necessary to arrange to begin work immediately to have same completed before March 31st. In this connection it should be ascertained from the Indian Affairs Branch whether they prefer to have the work carried out now with available funds, but at great inconvenience to the school authorities, or if they will provide funds in 1941-42 to have the work carried out during the summer months when the pupils are absent.\"\n\nYou will recall that the matter was further discussed with you on the 20th ultimo, and it was understood that you would recommend the waterproofing treatment be deferred until the summer vacation period.\n\nIt is now understood that due to the destruction by fire of the Class Room building that the areas to have been treated will be required by the school authorities for class room purposes, under which circumstances it would appear undesirable to carry out the work on the floors before the summer months.\n\nWe would appreciate being advised as soon as possible of the final decision on the matter.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\nChief Engineer.\n\nJ.

This would involve considerable expenditure and in addition would necessitate totally vacating these rooms for a period of approximately four weeks.\n\nDue to the approach of the end of the present fiscal year our funds are becoming limited and in addition there is the inconvenience that would be caused to you. With these in mind it has been decided that the best course to take is to take up the linoleum, store it and replace it later on.\n\nThe Surveys & Engineering Branch is arranging to have expert men take up the linoleum and that Branch will also purchase the materials required for waterproofing it.\n\nWhen the linoleum is taken up the Department will depend on you to see that it is properly dried and stored until such time as we can arrange to have it relaid. This could most easily be done when the pupils are absent from the school.\n\nRev. R.C. Scott,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nAlberni, B.C.\nThe materials which are being purchased by the Surveys & Engineering Branch and will be sent to the school before the end of the month should also be carefully stored so that they may be available when required.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

(RG 10, Volume 6434, File 877-5, part 7)\nAlberni Residential School\nUnited Church of Canada\n\nPrincipal\nREV. R. C. SCOTT, B.A.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI am sure you would be interested in getting a first hand account of the tragic loss of our Class Room building. I presume you will have received an official account, but it has been upon my heart for some time to write you, giving my own account. Needless to say, I have had little leisure for anything except the work of getting the classrooms under way again.\n\nI am glad to say, in this regard, that the children were only eight days without classroom work. During that time they were given extra work along handicraft lines. The building was burned Tuesday night, Feb. 18th, and class rooms re-opened on Monday morning the 24th Feb. I cannot speak too highly of the work of our Boatbuilder, Mr. Huddleston in getting temporary desks, blackboards etc ready. By an ingenious arrangement we are able to use the regular Assembly Hall seats, and desks are attached which can be taken off for our Sunday services with little trouble.\n\nThree ply screens divide the Assembly hall into two good class rooms and these screens form extra blackboard space. The Senior and Junior Divisions are accommodated here, and as they are in opposite ends of the hall, little trouble is made for either one by the lessons under way in the other.\n\nWe took one half of the Senior Girls Play room, and have made a good Primary Class Room. The Intermediates are housed in the old Day School building, which fortunately had not been taken down. We can carry on quite well for the rest of this school year, but I do hope it may be possible to renew the Class Room unit before the opening of another academic year.\n\nThe teachers and the boys and girls have reacted splendidly, and feel definite responsibility for the success of the work under the handicaps which for a time they must face.\n\nBut to return to the fire. I was in the Staff Sitting Room, just preliminary to going to the Residence. The Manual Training teacher passed the door and I called him in saying that I smelled something not unlike rubber burning. We at once inspected the standing electric reading lamp but there was no sign of any heat. The teacher went on to the boiler room, but kept on investigating. I went to the Sewing room to see if an electric machine had been left connected, or an iron, but all was right. There was no smell in the corridor outside the Staff Sitting room. But then, and this would be between twenty and twenty five minutes after ten P.M., Mr. Bothwell returned from the boiler room saying there was some smoke in it. I remarked, that I must have been wrong but that \"you know a Principal is always smelling something\". With that he went out to the stairway on the boys' side to go to his room. When he got to the first landing, he saw the flames beginning to come through the door, or just above the door, of the Class Room building and rushed back saying it was on fire. He ran out the boys' entrance, and I followed. He went downstairs to the door and it pulled open to the fire. Shutting it to keep the flames from spreading the faster he rushed around to the other side and went in through the girls' entrance to the Class Room building trying to get at the fire equipment. Meantime, after a glance, in which I saw the flames had...\nbegun to burst through the window above the door, I ran back into the main building to get a fire extinguisher. Simultaneously, my Office secretary appeared and I called her to phone the Fire Department. When I got to the door again, I saw that little glass was broken in the door and this was brought forcibly to my attention as the first stream of Pyrene fluid struck unbroken glass and I had to direct it carefully through a pane which was broken right next to the lock, and thence down toward what I thought to be the base of the fire.\n\nThe only significant difference, compared to the first time, was that it seemed possible that the fire had not been burning long enough to cause heat sufficient to break the glass in the doors. I told the Police this the next morning. Later, as I stood looking out one night about 1 A.M., that pane of glass seemed to stand out with a new significance, for I realized then, that it was right next to the lock, and if it were broken by anyone wishing to enter, the thing was easy.\n\nI cannot prove anything, of course, but that is a fact which does not easily fade out of my mind.\n\nThe other men on the Staff were on hand almost as soon as I, and they all knew the same sensation, namely that there was no fire anywhere else except just on the landing inside the door. From there it went across toward the right and climbed up the wall by the side of the door on what seemed the opposite side of where the fire occurred.\n\nThere was no sign of fire in the paint locker on the right of the doorway, nor in the boys' lavatory on the left. Both windows remained dark until the fire was well under way throughout the building. In fact, the window of the paint locker was broken open in order to get in before the fire reached the paints located therein.\n\nWe had been doing some staining, setting aside for the Official Opening, but the fire had been there several only two of them as only one boy was doing that work, brought in and were placed on a thick bench under the instructions of the Manual Training teacher. They were quite loosely laid up. I told the Police and the Fire Marshal this, but there was no sign of fire anywhere near that spot, nor in fact anywhere in the M.T. room until it had broken down through from the Class Room above. If you study the enclosed snap shots this is evident.\n\nDuring his investigations, the Fire Marshall dug up a waste paper basket from the ruins of the basement; it had been in the Boys' Lavatory to the left of the entrance. He said that there were remains of paper towels etc in it. He wanted to know if any of the boys had been smoking in the building. To the best of my knowledge, they had not.\n\nThe door of the Class Room building was always kept locked when no teachers were in it. It had been locked by the M.T. Teacher at 5:30 when he left, and again at 6:10 when the last teacher left. No boys were out of the building after supper, and certainly none were out late, for it would have been impossible for the supervisor to put the boys to bed the seniors at 8:30 and the younger ones earlier.\n\nI went out at once after he told me and found the whole paper basket. In it was one of these paper towels, and it was hardly scorched. The Police nor the Fire Marshal, so far as anything they said to me would indicate, thought much of this basket as the source of the fire.\n\nIt seems unreasonable to think that a fire could start in a waste basket six hours\u2014no, four hours\u2014after the last teacher left the building, and burn up sufficiently, with a steel bottom resting on a cement floor, to burn partitions through, without burning all the paper in the waste basket in the process. None but paper towels were used in the class room building, and these only by the Primary class. The Primary teacher told me she had sent only one boy down with a towel that day.\nFortunately I had inspected that basement corridor just before noon that day to see if any litter had been allowed to gather near that stairway, and I found it clean. Nothing was there except the remains of two old class-room desks, cast iron frames and maple seats, and I took particular pains to see if anything else had been allowed to gather. It was clean, nothing underneath the stairs at all save these desk frames, and two or three pieces of iron pipe lying on the floor farther out.\n\nThe engineer went that afternoon to get a piece of pipe, and he too looked underneath and found it clean. The reason for such inspection in that particular place was that it was not far from the door into the Manual Training Room, and I had given orders that no lumber or litter from that room should be allowed there at all. I had told the Engineer weeks before about this.\n\nThat afternoon, at 4, the Manual Training teacher superintended the sweeping of the basement, and it was left clean.\n\nI took particular notice too, when I first looked through the door at the fire, and while I was squinting the Pyrene in, that there was NO FIRE on the stems of this very ladder up to the class-room above. Hence it seemed to me that all leaders which might have established our blame for the school were eliminated.\n\nWhile there are no indications that any Indian set the fire, there is plenty of conviction upon the part of members of staff, especially our engineer, that it was an incendiary fire. I think it is only fair to say too, that I was deeply hurt by the attitude of the Indians, many of them who were watching the fire. One woman in particular, had a hearing smile on her face, and a great deal of amusement seemed to see it as a stunt, and to quip the mention of Mr. Ashburne to this as we stood talking together while the fire was in progress.\n\nAll along there has seemed to be some indefinite, but very real opposition to the school, and in particular to me. I have felt it ought never have been thought to try to reason it out or to locate it. It seemed to me, at least, that the Indians ought to be proud of the new school, and to swing in behind it wholeheartedly. I felt there was some dissatisfaction because I would not allow the local children out for such an event for a long time. They had chickenpox in the school and were under observation. Then I had never been used to it at Cowichan where the parents of local children never made any request to have their children and seemed to understand.\n\nI feel sure that it has been only a small number of the people here who have been really resentful, but they have been very active, as I now find. Two or three days before the fire, the Rev. Mr. MacLean, the local United Church Minister told me that he had been approached by Indians with a view to taking their grievances before the Board. I told him it was the last thing I could have had a good result to find. On Monday previous to the fire he told me that he had received a document setting forth their grievances, said that I was not interested in seeing it, but that I would answer them when they were presented to me.\n\nHe went to Victoria that day, and Tuesday night the school burned. That was the last straw, so I wired Mr. MacLean advising that Presbytery appoint a committee to investigate all charges. This was done and the committee came to listen on the Friday of that week.\n\nMr. Pitts came by me the morning of the day and seemed to feel that the Indians ought not to be allowed to attend the meeting etc. I said I felt they should. As the time for the meeting approached, Alex Thomas, whom I feel to be the ring leader, did not want to appear.\nAlberni Residential School\nUnited Church of Canada\n\nPrincipal\nREV. R. C. SCOTT, B.A.\n\nR.A.M.\n\nI am writing to inform you that the \"people\" had not been informed etc. I told him that he and the other two men who had signed the papers were here, and that he surely was willing to stand up to his signed word. As the chief who was one of the signers, was down at Sally's Point, five or six miles away, I told one of the staff to take the little truck and go for him. Thomas went along, but while he was there gave other Indians to understand that only the chief was wanted at the meeting. I have since found out that quite a group of people were not, and are not, favorable to the children being allowed out, and that they would have said so had they been allowed to attend the meetings.\n\nTo make a long story short, the grievances were such exaggerations and such untruths, that the committee had little difficulty in getting the people to see that they were unnecessarily alarmed, and that by coming to me all could be arranged amicably and that they ought to have done this on the start and not gone to others who were not concerned with the management of the school.\n\nI have had to allow a certain amount of permission to parents to have their children for a few hours on Saturday afternoon, and we were from today, intend to throw the building open to the Indian people to have their meetings. I say this in hope it will do good. In the evening I shall ask Mr. Ashbridge to come, and after showing some movies of what we did at Coqualeetza, (without stressing the fact that it is Coqualeetza, of course) I shall try to get them to see what can be done here. The visit of the King and Queen, to which our pupils at Sardis were attendants, I mean in attendance, will lend interest I am sure.\n\nI do hope that it may be possible to get a new Class Room block, if it is renewed as a frame building, of the sort we had in the one burned down, we could provide better fire protection OUTSIDE the block itself. Even if a booster pump were not given and a pipe line laid to the river, which would be the right thing to do, we could do effective work if we had the hose fittings and sufficient hose for the Alberni Fire Department hydrant. I presume if that Fuls Will proposition ever goes through, and there is talk locally of it again, we could get plenty of water in exchange for the right of way across the school property. However, a fire proof block would be best.\n\nI am on duty this evening and have had a lot of interruptions which have not been at all good for the sequence of subjects dealt with in this letter. Our new boat shop is well under way, and it will be a credit to our Manual Training Teacher and the senior boys, in addition to all that it will mean to those who come after them. I would like to make our boatbuilding department a real factor in the restoration of these West Coast Indians. I think it can be done, but more of that later through the usual channels.\n\nI am sending a copy of this letter to Major MacKay, although he is familiar with the contents after our conversations following the fire. By the way, Captain Barry was a great help to us in selecting the books which we needed to get under way, and in addition he donated about fifty dollars worth of his own books gathered here and there during his Inspectorship.\n\nRegretting the loss which we and the Department have suffered in this unfortunate occurrence, and saying how much I appreciate the help we have had right along from the Department, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I was on the point of removing the linoleum myself, driving it and having it stored in rolls awaiting the action of the Department. I have hesitated however, as there is always the danger of breaking it in taking it up and certainly it would be difficult to mark it in such a way that those who would have relay it would know just where each piece went. If the same men take it up who are afterwards to relay it, this difficulty will be obviated.\n\nI shall use every care to have the linoleum properly dried and stored. I shall also store properly the materials now being purchased by the Surveys and Engineering Branch in order that they may be available when required.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRCS/BW\n\nIndian Affairs.

Out of 509 sections in these radiators, 385 are in good condition. The others are cracked or have been very hot and liable to break very easily.\n\nI am forwarding this information in the hope that it may be of some assistance should the Department decide to renew this classroom building. I presume some member of the engineering staff will make a further investigation but the possibility of using some of these radiators might in this way be brought to their attention.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Commissioner MacKay, I may state, is at present at Ottawa, and it is my intention to discuss the subject matter of this report with him during his stay here.\n\nI regret to state that I am not in a position at the moment to say what provision, if any, can be made for the rebuilding of the classrooms in the estimates of this year. The destruction of the school by fire at this critical time, when we are putting forth every effort to conserve to the utmost extent possible the public funds at our disposal, has had a very depressing effect upon all of us. In addition to this, other schools destroyed by fire in recent years, such as the Anglican School in the Yukon Territory and the R.C. School at Albany, Ontario, have not been rebuilt, and it is going to be exceedingly difficult to seriously consider the rebuilding of the Alberni classrooms without giving due consideration to the rebuilding of the other schools. It is altogether likely, however, that this matter will be discussed and a decision reached at an early date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nReverend R. C.

Pratt, Esq.,\nPrivate Secretary\nMinister of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Pratt:\n\nI have a letter from the Principal of the Indian School at Alberni, the Reverend R. C. Scott, which reads in part as follows:\n\n\"I have before me the report of the Deputy Fire Marshall of Vancouver, under date of February 1st, and he has recommended that we should have at least two liquid chemical fire extinguishers on each floor, one at each end of the main corridor, including the basement. In the kitchen there should be one Soda and Acid and one C.T.C. extinguisher. I would be very glad indeed to have the Department comply with this suggestion. A Standard Fire Alarm system consisting of break fire alarm boxes and gates has been established in the main building. He recommends in addition, that no less than two hundred feet of 2\" Fire Hose with two shut off nozzles for the same with 3\" tips, be installed in a hose house within easy reach of the stand pipe of the Alberni Fire Department. He recommends that this stand pipe be moved back to about sixty feet of the wooden buildings. After our experience with that fire, I do not think it is necessary to move the stand pipe, as there was no wind at any time from heat. Of course the wind was away from it, and it might have been different had the wind been towards us. I do think that it is very important that two hundred feet of hose be supplied. We would be quite willing to build the hose house and to do any other work we could through our Manual Training Department, to assist in this installation. I would suggest too that this pipe which supplies the stand pipe be extended to reach the barn.\n\nIf we had only that hose, I feel sure we could have saved the building, for as I have already pointed out, the fire was only in its initial stages when we discovered it. The only blaze there was got up the wall and it was this fire that got away and could not be reached by our extinguishers\".\n\nIt is not -\nIt is not quite clear to me whether he was writing me personally and had taken the matter up officially with the Indian Department or whether he wished me to do so. The suggestions of the Fire Marshall seem to be reasonable and I would suggest that the equipment be obtained at once.\n\nI should also like to know what the prospects are of getting the school premises rebuilt this year.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nA. W. Neill\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMay 12, 1941\n\nIndian School at Alberni\n\nMr. A.W. Neill, M.P., has addressed the attached letter to me, in which is quoted part of a letter from the Principal of the Indian School at Alberni, Rev. R.C. Scott, advising of the report of the Deputy Fire Marshal of Vancouver.\n\nWill you please have special note taken and consideration given to the suggestions and recommendations of the Deputy Fire Marshal. Mr. Neill, you will note, states these seem reasonable and he suggests that the equipment be obtained at once.\n\nMr. Neill also asks what the prospects are of getting the school premises rebuilt this year.\n\nWill you please let me have a draft reply covering the submission.\n\n[Signature]\n\nM.J.F. Pratt\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nEnclosure. Lr. May 10.\n(We have retained copy).\n\nDr. McGill -\nFor draft reply as requested.\nOttawa, May 15, 1941.\n\nDear Mr. Neill:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of May 10, containing certain recommendations with respect to fire equipment that may be necessary at the Alberni Residential School, received by you from the Reverend R. C. Scott.\n\nThe officials of the Indian Affairs Branch inform me that when the Indian Commissioner for British Columbia visited Ottawa a few weeks ago they fully discussed with him the destruction of the classroom building at Alberni by fire and the measures that might be adopted to prevent the recurrence of fires in these buildings.\n\nThe officials now have before them a report on the fire by the Principal, a report and certain recommendations by Inspector Barry and a summary of these reports, with certain comments, by Commissioner MacKay. At the time of his visit here, however, the Commissioner was anxious to have an opportunity to study still further the Fire Prevention Act of British Columbia, with the object of making a number of definite recommendations with respect to the rebuilding of the school and fire prevention measures that might prove to be the most effective.\n\nThe recommendations made by the Reverend R. C. Scott appear to be reasonable and should, no doubt, form part of the general prevention plan.\n\nA. M. Neill, Esq., M. P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\nsummary of these will be sent forward to Major MacKay for his consideration.\n\nThe desirability of rebuilding the classroom structure at Alberni has been reviewed from time to time and was recently discussed with the Reverend Dr. Dorey, of the United Church. I regret to state, however, that no definite decision in respect to the matter has yet been reached. In the meantime, it is our understanding that the old detached Indian day school is being used as a classroom, together with certain classroom space that was available in the recreation rooms of the main building.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW. J. F. Pratt,\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nRAH\nOttawa, May 15, 1941.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nYou may remember that at the time of your visit here a few weeks ago we discussed very fully and in detail ways and means of safeguarding the buildings at Alberni from destruction by fire.\n\nWe had before us at that time a recommendation from Inspector Barry, that fire escapes be constructed at the main building. We were of the opinion, however, that such escapes were scarcely necessary and were never constructed at fireproof buildings in the province of Ontario. I am sending forward herewith, for your information, copy of a letter received by the Department from A. M. Neill, M. P. You will note that this letter is actually a summary of certain recommendations received by Mr. Neill from the Reverend R. C. Scott. It would be appreciated if you discussed these recommendations with your officers and let us have definite recommendations with respect to the steps which, in your judgment, should be taken to adequately protect from fire hazard the main building at Alberni and the new classroom building when erected. This suggestion is based on the assumption that the new building will not be of fireproof construction but will be somewhat similar to the building recently destroyed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nEncl.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.

Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Ashbridge:\n\nWith regard to our Boat Shop, I beg to say that in order to finish it properly, the following materials are necessary.\n\n1. Brick: enough to build a chimney at least 24 feet high. A conservative estimate would be 500 bricks. Mr. Kneen of 901 Upper Crescent, Port Alberni, has some second-hand brick on hand at $60 per thousand. I believe the regular price of new brick laid down in Port Alberni is $30 per thousand. The building of this chimney would be a good project for our senior boys. Mr. Huddleston has built houses including the chimney and is thoroughly competent to undertake this work if the Department would supply these materials. There would of course, be a small quantity of lime and sand required.\n\n2. Paint: There are 2500 square feet to be covered, and this would take, we estimate, in the neighbourhood of 10 gallons of paint to do a two coat job. We would recommend cream color, to correspond with the window trim of the main building. The former classroom building was cream colored. It would be necessary to have at least 1 gallon of green paint for the bottom of the walls from the water table to the ground.\n\n3. Shingle Stain: There are 1500 square feet of roof to be covered, and at $50 a square feet to the gallon, this would take 6 gallons.\n\n4. Electric Wiring: As this building has been put up at considerable expense to the Department for materials and as it is a fundamental unit in our educational programme, in order to safeguard it proper electric installation should be made. A local electrician whom I consulted, gives me an estimate of $75 being in the ratio of $50 for materials and $25 for labor. This would mean of course, not only proper wiring in the building itself, but wire for, and attachment to the power lines.\n\nWhile we can not this year undertake the building of a large fishing boat, we could build a number of row boats which would be fine practice for these boys. Before we can do this we will need to have the wiring done. I am however, going to build at least two flat bottom skiffs such as the fishermen use as tenders for their fishing boats. While these can\nMr. P.B. Ashbridge,\n\nApril 23rd 1948\n\nbe built without steam, it is better to have the steam and this of course would necessitate having the chimney. Consequently I would be glad if the Department could give favorable consideration to the above needs in connection with our Manual Training Work as soon as possible.\n\nThanking you I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.C.

Beatty Company, Limited, of Vancouver. Arrangements were made at the time with the Beatty firm that they would carry out the remainder of the undertaking comprising the application of the damp-proofing and relaying the linoleum in waterproof linoleum cement at a total cost not to exceed $297 when so directed by the Department.\n\nAs the best time to complete this work is during the vacation period the matter is drawn to your attention and I would suggest that it be given immediate consideration.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nMay 28, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 19th instant you may expend an amount of $151.39 in purchasing materials required to complete the boat building shop at the Alberni Indian Residential School. When forwarding the voucher for the above expenditure you should also send the purchase order and on the voucher you should state -- \"Pay from B.C. Special\".\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 21st instant I regret that there are no funds available for the purchase of the electric fan. As you are aware our appropriation has been reduced but at the same time the demands from all parts of the country are very numerous. In the case of the Alberni School we felt that we dealt very fairly with them last year in regard to purchasing equipment and consequently it was found impossible to include any amount in the current year's appropriation for a similar purpose.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nThe attached request from the Principal of the Alberni Indian Residential School for an electric fan, for use in the school kitchen, is forwarded for consideration. The cost of the equipment required would be approximately $70.00.\n\nMr. Scott was advised on a number of occasions last fall that he should make application for all the equipment required in order that same could be provided from the funds on hand, as no assurance could be given that funds would be available to any extent for new equipment in the fiscal year 1941-42. If funds have not been provided to meet such expenditures, it might be possible for Mr. Scott to purchase the fan from school funds.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to submit for consideration a request of the Reverend Principal of Alberni Indian Residential School for a fan and motor for use in the school kitchen.\n\nThis kitchen is really too small as you have noted, and gets intensely hot. Apparently a canopy would not overcome this, and I would respectfully recommend that this fan be installed.\n\nPrices for suitable equipment have been obtained by Mr. Scott, particulars of which are contained in his letter attached.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\n\nD. M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nAlberni Residential School\nUnited Church of Canada\n\nPrincipal\nREV. R. C. SCOTT, B.A.\n\nAlberni, B.C.\nMay 16th, 1941\n\nMr. P.B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Ashbridge:\n\nI have mentioned at times the fact that our main kitchen is too small and that the heat from the large kitchen range makes it unbearable during the late Spring, Summer and the early Fall. I found it very difficult to keep a cook last fall, and that was one of the reasons. Besides, I feel it is detrimental to the health of the pupils who work in the kitchen.\n\nI have had Mr. Ormond of the Ormond Sheet Metal Works up with regard to installing a canopy over the stove, but after going into it carefully, he has informed me that while a canopy would take away cooking smells and some of the heat perhaps, still it would not be at all effective in making the kitchen cooler and easier to work in. He suggested an electric fan. I have had other practical men look over the situation and they have all agreed that an electric fan would be a necessity. Consequently I got in touch with the Canadian General Electric Company of Vancouver by way of securing information which would give me something to suggest to the Department. Nothing of course has been done with regard to securing this equipment from this Company or any other, but I felt the Department would want to know first of all the approximate cost.\n\nOur Kitchen is 18'x18'-12' WAB, and the Canadian General Electric Company has given me quotation No.1830 as follows:\n\nOne Type CX Size 13\" Commercial Ventilator Fan\n110 Volts, 60 Cycle, single phase with a capacity of 1162 cu.ft. of air per minute.\nNet Price, fso.b. Alberni ........... $49.50\nMr. P.B. Ashbridge,\nMay 16th, 1941\n\nOne Size 15\" automatic shutter assembly\nNet Price, f.o.b. Alberni ........... $14.50\n\nOne Type CR-1061-B1A motor starting switch,\nwith overload protection\nNet Price, f.o.b. Alberni ........... $5.25\n\nThese prices are of course based on the sales tax,\nforeign exchange, customs tariff and other taxes\nin effect at the date of quotation. All of the\nabove equipment is fully guaranteed by the Canadian\nGeneral Electric Company for a period of one year\nfrom date against defective parts and workmanship,\nand will be repaired or replaced free of charge, f.o.b.\nthe Vancouver Warehouse at 1065 West Pender Street,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nThe above fan is mounted with a square\nmounting plate with outside dimensions 20\" x 20\".\nThis fan should be mounted on a wall with a round or\nsquare opening approximately 16\" wide. As one of\nthe kitchen windows is directly in line with the\nrange, we feel that the fan could be installed so\nas to use the upper part of this window for\ndischarging air without in any way interfering\nwith the light in the kitchen.\n\nI trust that the Department may see it's\nway clear to give us this equipment, as I feel it\nis fundamentally necessary, and I trust you may see\nyour way clear to recommend the same.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.C.

The absence of the pupils on vacation will now make this possible and is being undertaken within the next few days but will necessitate returning the Company's crew from Vancouver to Alberni, an item not anticipated in their original contract which was based on the entire basement being available. It is possible the Company may seek some adjustment in this connection amounting to approximately $50.00, but this is not certain.\n\nIt was found by the Company that the old linoleum taken up had been damaged to the extent of requiring an additional amount 35' x 6' for replacement, regarding which I wired you on the 29th ultimo, securing your approval on the same date. The cost is $68.97 F.O.B. the school.\n\nThe Company's representative informs me that when the hot water heating system was installed no provision was made for expansion or contraction, with the result that when it was closed down for the summer the contraction opened up some of the joints, causing a leakage which aggravated the damp floor condition.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nAlberni Residential School\nUnited Church of Canada\n\nPrincipal\nREV. R. C. SCOTT, B.A.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nFederal Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nRe Linoleum in Student Dining Room:\n\nI regret to advise you that the Linoleum in the Student Dining Room is going just the same as that which has been re-laid in the Play Rooms and Basement Corridors. This Lino was, or seemed to be, in so much better shape than that in the above areas that I thought it would be alright. It was not until the last couple of months that it seemed to go so badly. In place, I only found this week just before the Fred M. Beatty men came over. There was one long overlap along the seam under the tables on the North Side of the Dining Room which has only been saved from breaking by the fact that it is under the tables and does not have the traffic which is the case with the area along the aisle between the tables. Lately there has come a \"bulge\" right in the centre of the aisle leading in from the girls' side and this will likely break if not attended to.\n\nThe spot mentioned as being discovered last week, is just below the joint in the heating pipe running along the south wall. This leak is due doubtless to the fact that the hot water system is not needed for heating, and these particular joints may have been none too good at any time. But when the pipe has contracted it has caused a small \"drip\". This has got under the linoleum and the cement has rotted. While this particular spot is not large, and has only come during the last week, still it all adds on to the general condition.\n\nThe Linoleum in both kitchens seems to be standing up very well as there is a lot of heat in both areas.\n\nAs I have said above, this is not true of the Student Dining Room and I have to advise that if something is not done about it, the linoleum here will either perish or be broken. While funds are, I know, difficult to obtain, it would be money well spent to take care of this need as soon as possible.\n\nI called the attention of Mr Leigh of the Fred M. Beatty Co. to the\nAlberni Residential School\nUnited Church of Canada\n\nPrincipal\nREV. R. C. SCOTT, B.A.\n\nD.M.M. (2)\n\ncondition and he took measurements of the area concerned and ought to be able to give you a figure as to most were it possible to undertake the work.\nIf this is possible, it would be well to have the work done within the next two or three weeks to have everything in shape for the re-opening of School at the end of August.\nI may say that the men who are damp proofing the play rooms and basement corridors seem to have done a good job. The linoleum will be relaid right away and I hope the job will be most satisfactory.\nregretting to have to inform you as above, and trusting that it may be possible to have the work undertaken in the not too distant future, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. As Mr Ashbridge is not in his office today, I am taking the liberty of sending this letter direct and am sending a copy to him. I feel sure that he would agree with the need for attending to the condition fast developing in the Student Dining Room.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This constituted the first operation, which, with the supply of damp-proofing material to be applied later, was carried out at the end of the 1940-41 fiscal year at a cost of $526.00.\n\nCaptain Scott was advised of the arrangements made and was requested to certify that the work was carried out as called for.\n\nThe account from the Beatty people for the first operation, duly certified by Captain Scott and approved by Mr. Coleman, was received here on March 29th last, and payment was made on April 10th, 1941, from funds already transferred to this Service.\n\nThe agreement further provided that a second operation, consisting of the application of damp-proofing to all linoleum covered areas in the basement and relaying all linoleum in waterproof linoleum cement, was to be carried out when so directed by the Department, at a cost not to exceed $297.00.\n\nAs you are aware, funds for this purpose were recently provided, and on June 27th last the Beatty people were advised to proceed with the second operation as soon as arrangements convenient to Captain Scott could be made.\n\nWe also advised Captain Scott, under date of June 27th, regarding our action, and forwarded for his information a copy of our letter to the F. M. Beatty Company Ltd. This correspondence was acknowledged by Captain Scott under date of July 14th last.\n\nAs stated...........\n\nP. N. L. Phelan, Esq.,\nChief,\nTraining Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6434, File 877-5, part 7)\nAs stated in his letter of July 23rd to Major McKay, Captain Scott authorized a departure by the contractor from their agreement with the Department, in allowing the linoleum to remain in position in three areas which he considered to be \"all right\", namely the pupils' dining room, the main kitchen and the domestic science kitchen.\n\nMajor McKay's letter of August 1st to the Secretary of the Indian Affairs Branch states that the floor and linoleum in the pupils' dining room will be treated as called for in the agreement with the F. W. Beatty Company, but advises that arrangements could be made whereby this basement area could be treated at the same time as the others. He makes no reference to the kitchens.\n\nIt was intended that all items in operation No. 2 were to have been carried out continuously; but since other instructions were issued by Captain Scott, necessitating a second trip to Alberni for the workmen, a further charge as mentioned in Major McKay's letter is quite justified. Account must be taken however, of any work omitted under authority of your western officers or the school Principal.\n\nNo account for the second operation has yet been submitted, but upon receipt of same the matter of any adjustment in cost which appears necessary will be considered.\n\nRegarding the reported drip from the heating main passing through the pupil's dining room, I may say that the general contractors who built the school have several minor repairs to carry out at the school, which they advise us will be completed this month. They have been requested to investigate the drip from the heating main, and make whatever adjustments are necessary at that time.\n\nChief Engineer\n\nT.S. Mills\nOttawa,\nOctober 10, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 3rd instant and also letters relating to the construction of a door at the Alberni Residential School received by you from Rev. R.C. Scott and Indian Agent Ashbridge.\n\nThe desirability of constructing a door such as the one suggested in this correspondence was discussed very fully with the architects of the Department a few months ago. The architects were not persuaded at that time, in view of the fireproof construction of the building, that a door was necessary. The officials of this Division are of the opinion that the construction of this door may lead to a number of disciplinary problems. We have had a number of scandals at Indian residential schools during the last few years and we certainly are not anxious to do anything to create another at Alberni. It would be interesting to know what kind of a lock it is proposed to put on this door, where the key is to be kept etc. Our experience has been that Indian boys and girls are sufficiently ingenious to be able to open almost any door.\n\nHowever, in view of your recommendation we are prepared to authorize the construction of this door if you yourself are fully persuaded that the door is necessary and that the Principal of the school is prepared to accept full responsibility for the discipline of the pupils who may be affected. It\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nhas occurred to the officials here that if disciplinary problems multiply in the future the door, if constructed, might be rebuilt at a later date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nWest Coast Agency,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\nSeptember 30, 1941.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to submit the regular Agency Letter, covering conditions within this Agency during month ending September 30, 1941.\n\nSchools:\n\nThe Alberni Residential School was inspected and an improvement in the cleanliness was noted, with the exception of the boys' dormitory and storage closets, which were both dirty and untidy.\n\nThere were four girls and one boy confined to bed in the infirmary, the boy being suspected of tubercular meningitis and the girls with minor ailments.\n\nThe health of the school generally was good, although several were suffering from colds and one boy recovering from measles.\n\nDining room, kitchens, alleyways and storerooms were tidy and clean.\n\nDormitories (except the boys) were very tidy and clean, also bath and wash rooms.\n\nOuthouses were in good order and tidy.\n\nPupils in classrooms were attentive and being well taught.\n\nThere is no boys supervisor, and the appearance of the boys leaves very much to be desired, as they were very untidy in dress and dirty in appearance, and also showed great lack of discipline and courtesy.\n\nP.B. Ashbridge\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa.\nOctober 3, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am forwarding herewith a letter dated July 29th 1941 received from the Rev. R.C. Scott, B.A., Principal of the Alberni Indian Residential School, and Mr. Indian Agent Ashbridge's letter 6845/41/C dealing with the same matter, the construction of a doorway on the top floor of the Alberni Residential School to allow of communication between the boys' and girls' sides of the school in case of fire.\n\nIf reference be made to the report on this school forwarded with my covering letter 15/15/552 of March 12th 1941, it will be noted that Inspector Barry recommends the construction of this particular door.\n\nI should be glad to have the Department's authority to expend a sufficient sum in the construction of the doorway asked for by Rev. R.C. Scott, the estimated cost of which would be approximately $25.00, to ensure the protection of the children in case of fire.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6434, File 877-5, part 7)\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to refer to your letter of August 4th, 1941, in connection with opening of a doorway through linen closet on the top floor of the Alberni Residential School, to provide exit in case of fire.\n\nI inspected this today and would report that a doorway as described would be to advantage. The cost of this should not be very great, as it only involves the cost of door and frames, and the labour involved. Estimated cost would be approximately $25.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP. B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\n\nD. M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nAlberni Residential School\nUnited Church of Canada\n\nPrincipal\nREV. R. C. SCOTT, B.A.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nFederal Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI think that the Deputy Fire Marshall when making his inspection of the main building early this year mentioned the fact that there is only one exit from the top three dormitories. If I am not mistaken, Captain Barry also mentioned it. I think we discussed it here in the school.\n\nIf there were a fire or a smoke panic which involved either side of the school so that exit could not be made down one of the stairways, the pupils on the middle floor could cross to the side not involved, and find exit, but those on the top floor would not be able to get out at all.\n\nThis does not seem right. I feel sure that a doorway could be cut through the linen closet on the boys' side, to open into the dormitory on the girls' side. This would mean going through a tile wall only. Having the closet between the two dormitories would ensure privacy, and yet a satisfactory exit would be possible quickly in case of need. The closet in question is wide and roomy, and any clothing supplies would be to one side on shelves leaving the middle clear and unobstructed.\n\nIf the doorway were put through a wall giving access at both sides I am sure there would be a disciplinary problem at once for the temptation to \"tap\" out messages would at once present itself to the boys and girls. They try it even as it is now, through the main dividing wall, but it is so unsatisfactory that the practice is not at all general.\n\nThe only alternative would be to provide fire escapes down from the windows to the top of the roof leading to the assembly hall, and then down to the ground. This would be complicated and unsightly, and would present a temptation to climb up in order to gain entrance to dormitories from the outside. The suggestion above, if approved, would make the present staircases available on each side.\n\nRespectfully submitted:\n\nRCS/\n\nPRINCIPAL.\nOttawa,\nAugust 30, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe contents of your letter of the last instant with reference to the linoleum on the basement floor of the Alberni School was brought to the attention of the Surveys & Engineering Branch. I understand from them that they have given this matter every possible attention and that when the work is completed it should be satisfactory. Part of the trouble apparently arose due to the fact that the Principal authorized a departure by the contractor from their agreement with the Department in allowing the linoleum to remain in position in three areas which he considered it was not necessary to relay.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. P.B.

M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\n\nEncl.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nJan. 1st, 1942.\n\nMr. P. B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Ashbridge:\n\nI beg to inform you that the walls of the residence which were repainted during the late summer, are just as bad with discoloration as ever. In fact they seem to be worse. When left for a day two the fizzy outgrowth is quite heavy and the walls badly discolored. This takes place, of course on outside walls, and especially on those facing the East and South. There is much less on the west walls. I beg also to inform you that a serious leak occurred in No. 3 girls' dormitory during the last heavy rains just previous to this cold spell. bedding was wet, and pails had to be placed here and there to catch the drips. This is not only trouble at present, but there may be damage taking place to the roof.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRCS/ Principal.\nSir:-\n\nI have the honour to forward herewith report of Reverend Principal of the Alberni Indian Residential School re discoloration of walls in the residence and leak in the girls' dormitory.\n\nWith reference to the outgrowth Mr. Scott mentions, I am of the opinion that this is due to salt in the mortar or possibly in the tile, and may be overcome by painting the outside with waterproof paint.\n\nRe the leak in the girls' dormitory I would respectfully recommend that the roof be thoroughly examined by the contractors at as early a date as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP. B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\n\nD. M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\nP. O.

E. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\n\nD. M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nAlberni Residential School\nUnited Church of Canada\n\nPrincipal\nREV. R. C. SCOTT, B. A.\n\nMr. P. B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Ashbridge:\n\nFurther to our conversation with regard to turning the old barn into a Manual Training class room, I beg to say that I have had an electrician give me a figure on the cost of bringing the electricity from the Boat Shed across to the old barn. He assures me that the expenses ought not to be more than $50.00.\n\nIf we are to carry on our boat building programme there is no room for Manual Training in the Boat Shed. I feel that it is essential that we get our programme under way both in the Boat Shed and in the Manual Training Department. It is necessary for disciplinary reasons as well as for the benefit to come to the boys concerned. The loss of our Manual Training quarters in the classroom building is a serious set back and I feel that we must not allow it to check our programme, especially in view of the fact that the school is new. I feel it would be heartening to the native people as well as to ourselves to see a worthwhile programme being carried out.\n\nOne fundamental need is proper quarters for our Manual Training shop. I have had the roof of the old barn repaired in those places where there were small leaks and it will be plenty good enough for this year at least. There is a good cement floor and I have plenty of windows which can be installed by our senior boys and their instructors. I have already put up a partition for a paint and tool room and I have also provided a separate room in one corner where the boys may work at hobbies. Our Boys' Supervisor is an expert with a fret saw and has other worthwhile equipment. Our boys do totem pole work and one of them has made a small loom for weaving and another has made an electric lamp stand, using Indian design.\n\nI would appreciate it very much, if you, knowing the circumstances, felt that you could recommend to the Department that funds be provided not to exceed $50.00 for the bringing in of the electricity. All possible work will be done by our\n\nDecember 16th, 1941\nMr. P.B. Ashbridge,\n\nDecember 16th, 1941\n\nsenior boys and their instructors, and where necessary the services of an electrician will be secured so that the job may be properly done.\n\nThanking you in anticipation of your valued assistance, I am,\n\nYours sincerely\n\nR.C. Scott\nPrincipal\nWest Coast Agency  \nPort Alberni, B.C.  \nNovember 30, 1941.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to submit the regular Agency letter, covering conditions within this Agency during month ended November 30th, 1941:\n\nALBERNI RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nThis school shows a marked improvement over the previous month in the matter of cleanliness, fire drill, etc.\n\nA further report on matters affecting this school will follow.\n\nThe Secretary  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nOttawa.\n\nP.B. Ashbridge,  \nIndian Agent.\nNovember 28, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 10th ultimo with reference to construction of a doorway on the top floor of the Alberni Indian Residential School and to enclose herewith the Reverend Principal's undertaking, dated the 22nd instant, to accept responsibility for disciplinary problems arising out of this construction.\n\nThe installation of this door is being proceeded with.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to refer to your letter of October 30th with reference to construction of doorway on the top floor of the Alberni Indian Residential School, and to attach hereto letter received from Rev. R.C. Scott in which he accepts responsibility for the discipline of pupils who may be affected.\n\nI cannot see that such a door is altogether necessary, but it may be of value in case of panic, which again could be controlled by a good disciplinarian. However, such a doorway can easily be walled up again, should the Department so wish at a later date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\n\nD. M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nAlberni Residential School\nUnited Church of Canada\n\nPrincipal\nREV. R. C. SCOTT, B. A.\n\nMr P.B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\n\nDear Mr Ashbridge:\n\nReferring to our conversation of this morning, when it was brought to my attention that the Department would like definite undertaking in writing that I would be responsible for proper discipline in connection with the installation of an extra fire door on the upper floor of this school, I beg to say that I shall be glad to be responsible.\n\nI can quite understand the fears of the Department on this point, and generally speaking they are upon good ground.\n\nI would like, however, to point out several things in this connection and I feel that it may help to allay fears with regard to discipline:\n\n1. The two dormitories concerned, are those in which the smallest girls and boys of the school are quartered. This, in itself means much less risk or difficulty with regard to discipline.\n\n2. I do not propose to have any lock on this door, but two barrel bolts on the inside. As you know, this door will lead out of a clothes closet on the boys' side, so that there will be no direct access between the two dormitories. It will be no easier for boys and girls to communicate through this door than it is at present through the separating wall.\n\n3. There will be only the one key to the lock on this clothes cupboard, and it will be in the hands of the Boys' Matron. The lock can, however, be opened by any master key. As the Boys' Overseer, and the Girls' Overseer, and myself, each have master keys, there ought to be no difficulty in having this door opened should occasion arise. In addition, there is an extra master key always kept in my office.\n\nThese bolts will make the door secure at all times, and no one is ever allowed in that clothes cupboard, except when the matron or myself are there in connection with the work of the dormitories or re clothing.\n\nTo make doubly secure, however, I could place this cupboard on the list of places to be patrolled by our nightly fire patrol. This would take away all possibility of danger, it seems to me.\n\nWhile the building is fire proof, and this door may never be needed, still in the passing of the years, there is always the possibility that it might be necessary to direct traffic from one side to the other on the upper floor. As things are now, this would be impossible. With the door in access would be immediate and adequate.\n\nI trust that this will be satisfactory to the Department, and that the door may be installed as soon as arrangements can be made.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRCS/\n\nIndian Affairs.

Plommer, Esq.,\nGeneral Manager,\nCanadian Collieries (Dunsmuir) Limited,\n1431 Marine Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\nOttawa,\nMay 6, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose, for your information, a copy of a letter which has just been received from the Principal of the Alberni Indian Residential School. The Alberni Indian Residential School is situated at Alberni, B.C., and has a pupilage of 225 Indian children. This Department erected the building and pays per capita grant for each child in residence. You will note from the Principal's letter that he requires 4 carloads of stoker coal annually. I should appreciate your advising if arrangements can be made to ensure his receiving what he needs.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J. McG. Stewart,\nCoal Administrator,\nWar Prices & Trade Board,\nBirks Bldg.,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Ashbridge's letter of the 24th instant enclosing that of Reverend Principal of the Alberni Residential School with reference to securing priority on stoker coal for the heating of the School.\n\nThis is the first intimation that I have received that such priority would be required for the purchase of fuel for our Indian Residential Schools. It would be appreciated if you would advise me if you have any information on the subject as it is imperative that there should be no interruption in the supply of fuel for these institutions.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nenclos.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to forward application for priority in the purchase of coal for heating Alberni Residential School.\n\nOwing to the difficulty in obtaining coal locally, it is requested please that consideration be given this application, in the interests of the school health.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.

C. SCOTT, B.A.  \n\nALBERNI, B.C.  \nApril 22nd, 1942  \n\nMr. P.B. Ashbridge,  \nIndian Agent,  \nPort Alberni, B.C.  \n\nDear Mr. Ashbridge:  \n\nWe are finding it very difficult to get a supply of coal for our heating furnaces. We have to order a long time ahead, and in spite of this, we only got twelve tons out of the last car load, which had to be distributed between us and other institutions in Port Alberni. We are expecting to get part of another car load in the near future, but Mr. Golightly of the Breckman-Ker Company, says that owing to Government orders and priorities, it is going to be increasingly difficult to get stoker coal.\n\nI am writing to ask if it might not be possible for the Department to secure a place for us in priority arrangements somewhere, so that we might be assured of a supply. It takes about four car loads annually to supply our needs.\n\nI would appreciate it if you would take this up with the Department, making such recommendations as you think best.\n\nThanking you for your interest and co-operation,\n\nI am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.C. SCOTT  \nPrincipal\nMr. P.B. Ashbridge\n\nApril 22nd, 1942\n\nP.S.\n\nMr. Golightly is investigating the possibility of having Alberta coal brought in. This would cost $10.50 a ton laid down here, which is an increase of $3.00 per ton over the price we pay for B.C. coal. There is no assurance that we shall be able to get an adequate supply even from this source.\nOttawa,\nApril 1, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose, for your information, a copy of a letter received from the Principal of the Alberni Residential School. If you consider the equipment he requests is necessary, you may arrange for its purchase. When forwarding the account, you should attach a copy of your purchase order.\n\nIn purchasing fire extinguishers, I feel that the smaller types are handier and would be more useful than the larger types of machines.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to forward herewith, at the request of Rev. R. C. Scott, Principal of Alberni Indian Residential School, his acknowledgment of your circular dated February 19, 1942, file 150/65.\n\nIt will be noted that he requests additional Pyrene extinguishers and one hundred feet of water hose, which request I would respectfully recommend be granted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.

SCOTT, B.A.\n\nALBERNI, B. C.\nMarch 12th, 1942\n\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your circular letter under date of February 19th, File:150-65, enclosing copy of a circular letter with reference to precautions against danger of fire.\n\nI beg to say that this letter was read at the staff meeting the day after I received it, and it is now posted in a prominent place in my office.\n\nFire Drills are practised regularly both from the dormitories and from the classrooms, and a patrol is made at night with special attention to all rooms where there are electric outlets, stoves, irons, etc. Playrooms, classrooms and all areas occupied by pupils during the day, and of course kitchens and boiler room are all inspected. Our exits having crash handles, are always open from the inside. The extra fire door provided by the Department has been installed in the top floor so that there is access now to the stairway on either side should one of them become impassable because of smoke or fire.\n\nFollowing the suggestion in the second last paragraph of the circular letter, I beg to state that we need a large fire extinguisher of the Guardene type for our Manual Training classroom which has been constructed in the old barn. There is a good cement floor in this barn, but the construction is of course, wood. I would also like a Pyrene Fire Extinguisher for the Junior Classroom which is the\nDr. Harold W. McGill  \nMarch 12th, 1942\n\nold Day School building, and since the loss of our classroom building has been used for classes. It is heated by a stove, and while every precaution is taken to prevent fire, still there is a risk there even though it does not involve the main building in any way. I would like also to ask for another hundred feet of fire hose. The two hundred feet already supplied does not permit of water being thrown on the boat house building except from the front. We are not able to get around behind the building. If we had an extra hundred feet we could get right around the building, and could also reach the reconstructed Manual Training room, the farmer's cottage, the Boat Builder's cottage and the old Day School building mentioned above.\n\nOur present two hundred feet was secured through Marshall-Wells B.C. Limited, Vancouver in July last and is 2\u00bd inch unlined Linen Fire Hose.\n\nI would feel very much safer if the above equipment could be secured.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.C. Scott  \nPrincipal\n\nRCS/BW\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to submit herewith West Coast Agency Vouchers Numbers 558 and 559 covering expenditures on materials authorized by the Department for the Alberni Indian Residential School, together with copies of letters from the Reverend C. Scott, Principal of the school and Mr. Indian Agent Ashbridge.\n\nIt will be observed that Reverend Scott requests that the unexpended balance of the amount allowed for the fire door be applied on the cost of the fencing which exceeded the amount authorized by the Department.\n\nIf it is not too late in the fiscal year to make this adjustment, I would recommend that the Principal's application in this respect be favourably considered.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to enclose Vouchers Nos. 558 and 559, covering installation of fire door at Alberni Residential School, also for fencing as authorized, together with a request for consideration of further allowance for cost of fencing received from Reverend Mr. Scott.\n\nAs I cannot make the adjustment he suggests, I am passing it to you for your consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP. B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\n\nD. M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nP. O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nMr. P.B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\n\nRe: Grant for Fire Door and for Fence.\n\nDear Mr. Ashbridge:\n\nI have forwarded today under separate cover invoices in quadruplicate for the above improvements at the school. The amount allowed for the fire door was to be \"not more than twenty-five dollars\", and that for the fence was not to exceed $100.00.\n\nAs the work was all done by the school, the cost of the fire door has amounted to only $4.97, which leaves a substantial part of the twenty-five dollars over and above the cost of the materials. The fence however, has run a good deal over the $100.00. As the invoices show, the materials for the fence, lumber only, have cost $98.79. This leaves the cost of 90 posts and the nails, to be paid by the school.\n\nWith prices of food stuffs rising as they have, extra expense is very hard to meet, and if it were possible I would appreciate it if the Department would allow the balance of the $25.00 set aside for the fire door, to go against the cost of posts and nails for the fence. Actual amounts of these articles are as follows:\n\n| Item          | Quantity | Unit Price | Total Cost |\n|---------------|----------|------------|------------|\n| 90 posts      | @ .12\u00a2   |            | $10.80     |\n| 25 lbs. 5\" spikes | @ .08\u00a2 lb.|            | 2.00       |\n| 1 keg 2-\u00bc\" nails |        |            | 5.75       |\n\nThe nails I got at Carter's Hardware in Alberni, and the posts were supplied by Robert George, Indian, of the nearby\nMr. P.B. Ashbridge\n\nMarch 6th, 1942\n\nReserve. I might add we have no cedar on the school property.\n\nI would appreciate it if this request might be forwarded to the Department if you think best.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n\nRCS/BW\nEnclosure.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nLetter No. 410.C.42.\n\nOffice of the West Coast Indian Agency,\n\nMarch 9, 1942.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 559, amounting to $4.97 in favour of Lawrenson & Skipsey, P.O.

However, I feel it is only fair to you and to your Indian agents to state that it is becoming increasingly difficult to secure purchasing orders for these irregular purchases. Principals of residential schools and the field officials concerned should be constantly reminded that it is their duty to conform strictly to departmental regulations.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.

Marshall-Wells B.C., Ltd. at a cost of $51.56, and now wishes to be reimbursed for same, although such purchase was made without the authority of this Department.\n\nUnder the circumstances, I consider that the application might be considered subject to the Reverend Principal being informed that he must in future conform with the Department's requirements.

Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\n\nAugust 17th, 1942.\n\nDear Mr Ashbridge:\n\nI regret that owing to being away on holidays during the first part of July, and then having been alone in the office following my return, I neglected to write in for authority to purchase paints etc for repairs. These items were included in the estimates for this year.\n\nAs the only man I had to do the work was not back until the first of the month, this also seemed to delay matters until I found myself short of time for all the work which had to be done. Consequently, I must crave the indulgence of the Department in asking for consideration of these accounts, which I felt I had to incur if we were to get the work done before the return of the pupils at the end of the month.\n\nThere are other items which can wait, and I am attaching them, and they can come before the Department in the regular way. I refer to the painting of the front, at least, of the old Bay school building. You will remember this building was to have been taken down or removed. Fortunately nothing was done about it, and we have been using it since we lost our Class Room building, for a Class Room.\n\nIt is looking very drab and as we are likely to have to use it for some time, it really should be painted. The end is much worse than the sides. I am having the glass renewed in the front, and the two doors at the inner wall of the porch moved out to the outer wall so that only while school is in session will there be access to the porch or the cloak room behind it. I feel sure this will be beneficial in every way.\n\nIf the Department would be good enough to authorize the amount needed for paint, we shall do the work ourselves, if only the materials can be secured before the weather breaks.\n\nMeantime, we shall keep on with what materials we have, and get the Playrooms, corridors etc ready for the re-opening of School at the end of this month.\n\nI shall appreciate any recommendation you may feel free to make in connection with the above, and thank you in anticipation.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPRINCIPAL.\nALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nMaterials required for painting playrooms, corridors and parts of dormitories and lavatories.\n\nFollowing materials purchased from Marshall-Wells B.C.Ltd., at wholesale prices.\n\n3 gals.

No further cases have developed, and it is hoped that it is now completely cleared up.\n\nGirls dormitories, playrooms and classrooms were clean and tidy, as also were the grounds, kitchen, dining room and laundry. Boys' dormitories, classrooms and lockers were very dirty and untidy. It would seem that the boys' side of the building should be under the supervision of a woman supervisor or housekeeper, as no improvement is ever noted, although repeatedly brought to the attention of the Rev.

Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Alberni, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Ashbridge:\n\nI beg to bring to your attention, the fact that one of our high tension wires is down today in the field just in front of the school.\n\nThe first time this wire broke, the foreman for the National Utilities repair gang, said that the break was due to the intermediate pole between the transformer pole on the top of the hill and the first pole inside of school property, being too short, and this had a tendency to put more strain on the wires.\n\nAs there are 2200 volts on this line it ought to be attended to. The National Utilities Corporation inform me that the cost of a new pole, setting up, rewiring and connecting same, would be $53.00 plus tax.\n\nThis gentleman also said that he had informed those in charge when the line was first connected to the new school, that this pole was too short and that it was badly rotted at the base, but that nothing was ever done more than to make the temporary connection.\n\nI would appreciate it very much if this matter could be attended to by the Department, as I feel that it is hardly a right charge on the revenue of the school. I may say that the National Utilities take the ground that they are not responsible for the upkeep, as this pole is situated on school property.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRCS/BW\n\nIndian Affairs.

Under the circumstances I would appreciate receiving a full report from you regarding this matter. No doubt Mr. Ashbridge will be able to give you the information, if he has not already done so. Incidentally I may say that there is approximately $200.00 remaining in the current year's appropriation specifically earmarked for the Alberni School and which has not yet been used. Possibly there is something that they require. If so, you may arrange for its purchase.\n\nR.A.

C. LIMITED\n\nWRB: NMcB\nAccountant.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI have to refer to your letter of October 13th in which you request information with respect to the following items included in the estimates submitted by Mr. Indian Agent Ashbridge for the fiscal year 1944-45:\n\n\"Ground floor Lino or resurfacing $600.00\nWaterproofing portion of outside wall $200.00\"\n\nThese matters were looked into by me recently while at Alberni and I wish to advise as follows:\n\n1. It is doubtful if the linoleum on the boys' side of the ground floor should be replaced for, despite the action taken to waterproof the cement floor and other protective measures, deterioration of the material continues. This is particularly marked on the side referred to and appears due to moisture coming through the cement floor and water which finds its way under the linoleum when the rooms are washed out, so that unless these causes can be definitely eliminated it would seem to be a waste of public money to replace the present floor covering with linoleum or similar material. Some type of moisture resisting surfacing should be laid on these floors.\n\n2. Waterproofing the outside walls as suggested would not, in my opinion, eliminate the existing trouble. The white substance that appears on the outside face of the upper sections of the walls of the building probably comes from the mortar or brick, most likely the former as the brick used is regarded as being of good quality and resistant to moisture. It is not likely that any substantial increase of this substance on the walls will develop and what is there may in time drop off as part of it is hard and flaky and can be lifted from the surface easily.\n\n(over)\nWhat is much more serious is the condition of some of the walls of the dormitories on the top floor where moisture appears to be getting through from the brick wall to the plaster. I noticed that the top of the coping stone slopes inward towards the roof and my opinion is that much of the rain falling on this surface runs underneath this capping and down through the walls as the copper flashing, which I take is intended to prevent this, is loose in places and may not have been properly set in at the time of construction.\n\nI should like to suggest that the Surveys and Engineering Division be requested to investigate these matters and advise with respect to a suitable surfacing for the section of the basement floor referred to and also the measures needed to deal effectively with the apparent leakage from the coping stone into the walls of the building. In order to provide for the probable costs involved, I would recommend that the items in question be allowed to stand in the estimates.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nEX'D\n\nOttawa, October 15, 1943.\n\nMarshall - Wells B. C.

I enclose, for your information, a copy of his reply and may I direct your special attention to the last paragraph of his letter? I also attach a snapshot which Major MacKay forwarded.\n\nDirector.\nApril 3rd, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nRe: Indian Residential School, Alberni, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your notation on Dr. McGill's memorandum of November 16th, 1943, with which was forwarded data from the Indian Affairs Branch in connection with ceiling leakages and dampness under basement floor coverings at the above, this Service requested Mr. Webb to arrange for an inspection, and to submit a complete report.\n\nWe are now in receipt of a report covering two visits to the institution carried out by Mr. Warren on January 6th and January 26th, 1944 which may be summarized as follows:\n\n(1) Ceiling Leakages\n\nOur officer was taken by the Principal through Girls' Dormitories 3, 4 and 5 on the top floor of the building where intermittent leaks occur during heavy rainstorms. The leakage in Dormitory 3 is apparently active during rains from the south, that in Dormitory 4 during rains from the north, while in Dormitory 5, one leak is active during rains from the north, and another during rainstorms from any direction.\n\nMr. Warren made a careful examination of the felt and gravel roof covering, the felt roof flashings, the copper parapet flashings and the stone coping. He reports that there is no evidence of leakages in the felt and gravel roof covering, and while the copper parapet flashings have not been installed according to detail, they have been located by expansion and contraction in the parapet, they do not appear to be admitting water except at the flagpole over Dormitory No. 5. He suggests the flagpole should be removed.\n\nMr. Warren has advanced the opinion that the stone in the copings is absorbent, that due to the very heavy precipitation it has become saturated, and is transmitting water to the walls below. He states that while the brickwork at Alberni is of better quality and better laid than at a number of other British Columbia residential schools, some absorption is taking place in the walls themselves. Mr. Warren considers that all leakages, except under the flagpole, originate in the coping and upper walls, and that some of the water is being expelled at the upper ceilings.\n\nPercolation of dampness from above and a certain amount of absorption of surface water in the lower walls, is causing discoloration and efflorescence on the exterior brickwork in both the school and Principal's residence. While Mr. Warren saw no actual moisture on the inside of exterior walls the painted wall finish is damaged, and efflorescence is visible.\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6434, File 877-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nTo eliminate absorption, Mr. Warren considers that after cleaning off efflorescence, all exterior brickwork should be treated with a colourless waterproofing, similar to the Tremco, or Minwax product. To prevent infiltration through copings he suggests covering the coping stone with a copper flashing. As an alternative, in view of restrictions on the use of copper, he suggests that a plastic compound might be applied to the coping stones by spray gun, to a thickness of 1/8\". Mr. Warren states that the majority of brick buildings in Vancouver have suffered from water infiltration and have been satisfactorily treated by the method he suggests.\n\nMr. Warren estimates that to waterproof the brickwork, cover the coping with copper flashing, repair existing flashings, apply caulking at window frames, and to provide for engineering expenses, an expenditure of approximately $1000.00 would be required. If plastic compound were applied to copings, and copper omitted, the cost would be $700.00 less, or a total of $4400.00.\n\nIn view of the cost involved, and since in his opinion most of the trouble originates in the coping stones and penthouse wells, Mr. Warren recommends immediate consideration be given to completely waterproofing the penthouse walls, covering all copings either with copper or plastic compound, removing the flagpole, and covering over the recesses which it stands. He states that the work should be carried out in midsummer when the walls have had a chance to dry out. His estimate of cost for this work is $2200.00, or $1500.00 if plastic compound is used on the copings instead of copper. He considers the remainder of the work could wait until results were observed, and additional funds were available.\n\n(2) Basement Dampness\n\nMr. Warren inspected the basement accommodation where moisture is reported to be causing damage to the linoleum floor covering and reports that trouble is occurring in the Boys' Locker and Recreation Rooms, the Pupils' Dining Room and Bathrooms. In spite of waterproofing treatment applied three years ago to these areas, moisture is apparent when the linoleum covering is lifted. Where the cement floor finish has not been covered and where linoleum has been removed the cement gives no evidence of dampness. Mr. Warren is of the opinion that water is finding its way under the basement slab from sloping higher ground to the north and west of the building, but states he can give no assurance that conditions can be improved.\n\nHe suggests however that an intercepting ditch be dug and revetted at the toe of the slope, and that four catch basins connected to the existing drainage system be constructed north of the school to provide surface drainage. These works with attendant grading and landscaping will cost Mr. Warren estimates will cost approximately $930.00. He states that if this work was undertaken tests to establish the necessity of sub-soil drainage could be carried out at the same time.\n\nRegarding floor finish for rooms affected by dampness Mr. Warren has investigated and supplied costs for a number of products. He suggests however that no decision be made in this connection until exterior surface drainage has been carried out and results observed. Meantime he suggests the linoleum be removed and stored for possible future use. The floors cleaned and left bare. Mr. Warren estimates that to clean the floors, it would cost 2\u00bd cents per square foot plus $50.00 for moving furniture, amounting in all to approximately $162.00.\nOn the basis of the foregoing, the minimum total estimated cost for operations that Mr. Warren recommends should be carried out this summer would be:\n\n(a) Application of waterproofing to penthouse walls, repairs to existing flashings and treatment of copings with copper covering.................. $200.00\n\n(b) Surface drainage works............................. $50.00\n\n(c) Removing linoleum, cleaning floors etc., in basement.............................................. $168.00\n\n(d) Engineer's expenses and contingencies.............. $300.00\n\nTotal $3498.00\n\nIf a plastic compound were used on copings the total estimated cost would be $700.00 less, or...... $2792.00\n\nMr. Webb has concurred in Mr. Warren's suggestions and recommendations.\n\nUpon consideration of Mr. Warren's report, we may say that it confirms our opinion that water is being admitted at the top of the walls, and that in all coastal areas copings should be of copper in the future.\n\nRegarding the damp areas in the basement, it is possible that installation of surface drainage works would improve conditions; but in view of the cost involved without assurance of satisfaction, the expenditure is not considered justifiable. It is felt that until the results of leaving the cement finish exposed have been observed, this portion of the work should be deferred.\n\nIn view of all the circumstances, it is felt that during the coming summer, when the walls have thoroughly dried out work covering items (a), (c) and (d) in the above list of operations should be carried out omitting item (b).\n\nIt is felt that if resculking of window and door frames is necessary, it should be included in work carried out this summer. Mr. Warren's estimate for this item is $220.00\n\nOn this basis the total cost including supervision, would be approximately $2828.00, and it is considered advisable that this amount be made available to this Service by the Indian Affairs Branch. If wartime restrictions prevent the use of copper in the work the actual expenditure would be approximately $2200.00\n\nIf work is to be carried out, we should be authorized to purchase materials and engage labour to the best advantage locally.\n\nChief Engineer.\nOttawa, April 25th, 1944.\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Alberni Indian Residential School\n\nWith reference to your memoranda of November 19th and December 14th last relative to the above, this matter was referred to our Engineering and Construction Service and Mr. Warren has made a report based upon two visits to the school.\n\nAfter consideration of this report the Chief Engineer, Mr. Mills, has embodied his recommendations in a memorandum, dated April 3rd, 1944, copy of which is enclosed for your information.\n\nMr. Mills' recommendations are concurred in. In brief they are that the following work items should be carried out during the coming summer:\n\n(1) Application of waterproofing to penthouse walls, repairs to existing flashings and treatment of coping with copper covering .................. $2,200.\n\n(2) Removing linoleum and cleaning floors, etc. in the basement ......................... $ 182.\n\n(3) Recaulking of window and door frames ........... $ 220.\n\n(4) Contingencies and Engineer's expenses .......... $ 300.\n\nTotal ..... $2,882.\nIf this work is carried out, experience will show whether any further treatment of the exterior brick work with a waterproofing product is necessary and if the moisture found under the linoleum is coming up through the cement floor in the basement.\n\nIf you approve of this work being done, will you so advise us and also kindly have $2,882.00 transferred to our Engineering and Construction Service so that they may undertake it.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, April 28, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER,\n\nIn response to a request received by the Superintendent of Welfare and Training from the Chief Executive Assistant, I am sending forward herewith copies of memoranda relating to certain repairs which appear to be urgently needed at the Alberni Indian Residential School.\n\nDr. Dorey, in a letter dated April 20, 1944, expressed a desire to discuss with the Minister ways and means of dealing with the deficit that has accumulated at this school. Mr. W. R. Butchart, in his last audit report on this school, states that the net overdraft at the bank at that time amounted to $3,633.56 and that, in addition, there were other liabilities, including unpaid salaries for December, making a total of $5,351.74. The authorized enrolment at the Alberni School is 225 and per capita grant is at the rate of $170.00.\n\nI have reviewed, somewhat hurriedly, the audit reports on a number of our residential schools. I am disposed to think that a substantial number of our schools do not differ to any appreciable extent, so far as deficits are concerned, from the Alberni institution. In this connection may I refer to my memorandum to you dated November 25, 1943, and particularly to a letter received by the Chief of the Training Division from the Principal of the St. Mary's Indian Residential School, Mission, British Columbia, sent forward therewith.\n\nThe Principal of the St. George's Residential School, Lytton, B. C., where a per capita grant of $180.00\nis paid, stated in a letter dated December 26, 1942:\n\n\"I feel sure the Department realize that the present financial assistance we receive is quite inadequate to meet the needs of present day demands. The only way I know of to make that financial assistance suffice is to cut down on the food and clothing received by the pupils and put more boys to work instead of hiring extra labour. But we should not do these things; at least I would rather leave than do them. The 50\u00a2 a day which we receive as our per capita allowance seems altogether too small, compared with $2.00 per day or more allowed at hospitals.\"\n\nMr. W. R. Butchart, in his last audit report on the Sandy Bay Residential School, dated October 25, 1942, states:\n\n\"The cost of operation per pupil per year works out at $206.35, an increase of $26.03 over the operating costs for the preceding year. The rate of increase is even larger than this figure would indicate, as the average pupilage of 98.8 is up 9.2. The only apparent liabilities, other than August accounts, were arrears in salaries. At the end of August $1,250 was owing to the Oblate Fathers on account of the principal's and assistant principal's salaries. There was also an amount of $440 owing to the Sisters.\"\n\nThe per capita grant at this school is $165.\n\nIn his report on the Peigan R.C. Residential School, dated May 7, 1942, Mr. Butchart states:\n\n\"The cost of operation per day was up $4.38. The cost of operation per pupil per year was quite high at $224.50, an increase of $28.56. This increase may be traced to increased farm costs, clothing, etc. Per capita grant allowed at this school is $165.\"\n\nThere has been a substantial increase in the cost of providing food, clothing, education and shelter for Indian pupils at residential schools during the last couple of years. A rough estimate would place this cost at approximately $20.00 per pupil. I should point out that these deficits have been accruing despite the fact\nthat an additional $10.00 per pupil has been paid during the last two years. The records indicate that the Department has never at any time during the last 30 years assumed responsibility for a deficit at a residential school, and I am not at all sure that we should accept responsibility in the case of Alberni. It is just possible that the churches may be able to reduce these deficits somewhat when they receive the $15.00 per pupil cost-of-living bonus during the present calendar year. However, repairs are urgently needed at a number of our schools. The non-Catholic schools have experienced difficulty in securing the staff necessary to carry on. A very disturbing feature of our residential school work is the number of principals that have recently resigned: Rev. Father M. de Bretagne, Qu'Appelle School, Lebret, Sask.; Rev. Father J. P. Mackey, Shubenacadie Residential School, Nova Scotia; Rev. C. N. Middleton, Elkhorn Residential School, Elkhorn, Manitoba; Rev. R. T. Chapin, Brandon Residential School, Brandon, Manitoba; and Rev. R. C. Scott, Alberni Residential School, Alberni, British Columbia.\n\nThe suggestion has been made from time to time and emphasized in a memorandum dated May 31, 1940, prepared by the Superintendent of Welfare and Training, that an attempt should be made to maintain a number of residential schools where these schools are most urgently needed, even though we had to close a number of the older and more dilapidated schools in order to do so. This is a matter that might well be discussed with representatives of the churches at a conference called for this purpose.\n\nIn respect to conditions at Alberni, we have not, as you are no doubt aware, an inspector of Indian schools in British Columbia at this time. In view of all the circumstances, however, it might be advisable to have Mr. F. E. Anfield, Indian Agent at Bella Coola, who has had years of experience as a teacher and as principal of a residential school, make a thorough investigation of the school, in association with Indian Commissioner MacKay. Such investigation should undoubtedly be made and certain recommendations, with respect to the future, considered before a final decision is reached with respect to the best ways of dealing with the deficit.\n\nDirector.\nRef File 34/41/M.\n\nWest Coast Agency.\nPort Alberni.\n\nMr P.B.

I am sure that the principle is sound, because I understand that the Department has a rule that it cannot make payments to repair buildings belonging to the Church or to persons or to institutions, and I am quite sure that \"what is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander\" also: that is, that the Church should not pay money for repairs to Government buildings -- which is what we have done.\n\nI shall be glad to hear from you and Mr. Jackson in due course.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEnl.\nAttention of Mr. C.W. Jackson\n\nOctober 13th,\n1944.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Jackson:\n\nRe - Alberni Residential School\n\nYou will remember that some time ago I discussed with you the situation at Alberni, following on my discovery of the fact that during the period covered by the Auditor's statements for the years 1941 and 1943, $2,313.52 was paid out of the School account for Building and Repairs, and in the next eleven months, $217.90. Mr. Hoey can no doubt give you the Auditor's statements.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith -\n\n1.- Statement showing these items, and then those which are properly chargeable to Building and Repairs. According to our figures, there was expended $2,214.53, covered by invoices and receipts, for Building and Repairs, which properly should not have come out of the funds of the School.\n\n2.- A similar set of figures for the second period.\n\n3.- Vouchers covering these expenditures (under separate cover).\n\nYou will note that the bookkeeper has very carefully noted the full amount of the statement or invoice and the amount which is properly chargeable to Building and Repairs, and the purpose for which the money was spent. I am leaving these accounts in the original file.\n\nI am also sending you copy of the letter which we have received from Mr. Woollard, the bookkeeper of the School.\n\nWe trust that you will find these vouchers in order, and that we shall in due course be hearing from you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGeo.

C.\n\nRe: Repairs, Alberni School.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of October 7 and also a quotation received by Indian Agent Ashbridge from Mr. T. M. Petersen, sent forward therewith.\n\nIn view of the urgency of this matter, it will be satisfactory to the Department if you make the necessary arrangements, locally, for the repairs as outlined in Mr. Petersen's tender.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Ashbridge's letter of October 3rd, and quotation from Mr. T.

I would recommend that authority be granted for the expenditure of $90.00 for this purpose.\n\nD. M.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nI beg to advise that the Principal, Alberni Residential School, has requested some repair work to the smoke stack, which is in bad order, and will require 20 feet of 10 inch smoke stack and two cleanouts.\n\nI do not know if Mr. Warren made any arrangement regarding this work but I received quotations from T. M. Petersen of Port Alberni, which I enclose herewith. Kindly say if this work may be proceeded with.\n\nP. D. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\nOctober 10th, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nRe: Roof Repairs, Indian Residential School, Alberni, British Columbia\n\nAs you are aware, work is now being carried out at the above, to prevent water infiltration through the copings and parapet walls. When operations connected with resetting of copper flashings were started under the supervision of Mr. Warren, it was discovered that decomposition had begun in several areas of the wooden roof deck. Mr. Webb reported this matter, and was authorized by this office to carry out repairs to the roof deck to an amount of $185.00 which was possible from funds transferred to us for the project by Indian Affairs. He was requested to advise this office if this amount would be sufficient.\n\nWhen the known areas were opened up, Mr. Warren was able to inspect the underside of the whole roof deck, and found that extensive deterioration has occurred, adjacent to the parapets and pent house. Evidence of dampness is visible in other areas; but Mr. Warren is taking measures to prevent decay of the deck in these places by the installation of roof vents. While the felt and gravel roof was reported to be sound, repairs to the deck have necessitated lifting a considerable amount of the covering. Most of the needed replacement of deck tiles has already been carried out, and the felt and gravel roof remains otherwise unaffected. On the 29th ultimo, one area had still to be investigated. To cover the cost of all repairs required, Mr. Webb estimates an additional amount of $800.00 will be necessary.\n\nIt is recommended that this amount be made available by the Indian Affairs Branch for the work.\n\nWe expect to be advised shortly that all work on the roof and copings at the school has been completed.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOctober 19th, 1944.\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Roof Repairs, Indian Residential School, Alberni, British Columbia\n\nI enclose herewith a memorandum from Mr. Mills in regard to the above work and from which you will note that when certain sections of the roof deck were opened up, it was found that extensive decay had set in and that to replace the wooden sections affected, a further expenditure of $800 was required. In view of the conditions found our Engineer, Mr. Warren, had no choice but to make the necessary repairs and replacements.\n\nIn a discussion with Mr. Mills this morning he advises me that further details have now been received and that an additional amount of $600 will be sufficient to pay for the extra work. It will be appreciated, therefore, if this additional amount could be made available which would bring the total for roof repairs to $3,993.50.\n\nMr. Mills states that the construction details of the roof coping have been fully discussed with our Architect, Mr. Buck, and in future metal flashing work will be extended to prevent any similar occurrence. Our Architect feels that the original construction details were sound if first-class workmanship is obtained, but at the present time there is always the possibility of some defect in the stone coping work that may result in leaks and damages later on.\n\nDirector.\nInspection Schools:\n\nAlberni Residential School is still undergoing repair and renovation, but good progress is being made.\n\nMany pupils from West Coast points have overstayed the holiday and difficulty is experienced in having them re-installed.\n\nThe school is gradually improving in discipline and organization.\n\nSo far as repair work etc. allows, the School was found clean and orderly.\n\nP.B.

B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nThere has recently been considerable correspondence between this Office, Mr. Indian Agent Ashbridge and the Rev. A. E. Caldwell, Principal of the Alberni Indian Residential School, regarding requirements in the way of desks, beds, and mattresses at the School.\n\nFrom information received, it would appear that the authorized pupilage at the School is 225 and the present enrollment is 228. Beds in good order at the School number 201 and additional desks required total 24.\n\nMr. Ashbridge's letter of September 19th in this connection is attached hereto and, although it is stated that 23 mattresses are required for replacements, Mr. Caldwell recently informed me that it will be possible to do without these for another year. It will be noted that these requirements are based on a probable increase in the authorized pupilage but, aside from this, it would appear that there are not sufficient beds at the School to provide sleeping accommodation for the present enrollment.\n\nQuotations on beds and mattresses from Simmons Ltd. and the Restmore Manufacturing Co. are attached hereto, together with a quotation from the Clarke & Stuart Co. Ltd. on desks. The Globe Manufacturing Co. are unable to quote on the latter item. The requirements as listed in Mr. Ashbridge's letter have been revised somewhat, and may now be itemized, as follows:\n\n- 35 Beds, complete with mattresses, 30 x 72.\n- 24 Desk Units, No. 3.\nBased on the Restmore Manufacturing Co. quotation, the cost of the beds will be $618.75 (mattresses in ACB ticking) and on Simmons Ltd. quotation the cost would be $577.50 (Croydon Mattress) but, judging from the illustrations attached the Restmore Mfg. Co. Ltd. bed is somewhat better quality. The 24 desk units will cost $194.64, making a minimum cost of $772.14, f.o.b. Vancouver, for all requirements.\n\nAlthough no provision was made in the Estimates for this expenditure, I would recommend that some, if not all, of the above listed items be purchased, subject to the Department's attitude towards increasing the authorized pupilage at the School and providing funds are available.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa,\nOctober 31, 1944.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O.

(RG 10, Volume 6434, File 877-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nAttention of Mr. C.W. Jackson\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Jackson:\n\nYou will remember that some time ago I discussed with you the situation at Alberni, following on my discovery of the fact that during the period covered by the Auditor's statements for the years 1941 and 1943, $2,315.52 was paid out of the School account for Building and Repairs, and in the next eleven months, $217.90. Mr. Hoey can no doubt give you the Auditor's statements.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith -\n\n1.- Statement showing these items, and then those which are properly chargeable to Building and Repairs.\u2014According to our figures, there was expended $2,214.55, covered by invoices and receipts, for Building and Repairs, which properly should not have come out of the funds of the School.\n\n2.- A similar set of figures for the second period.\n\n3.- Vouchers covering these expenditures (under separate cover).\n\nYou will note that the bookkeeper has very carefully noted the full amount of the statement or invoice and the amount which is properly chargeable to Building and Repairs, and the purpose for which the money was spent. I am leaving these accounts in the original file.\n\nI am also sending you copy of the letter which we have received from Mr. Woollard, the bookkeeper of the School.\n\nWe trust that you will find these vouchers in order, and that we shall in due course be hearing from you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEnclos.\nAlberni, B.C.,\n\nDear Dr. Dorey:\n\nThe Invoices and Statements, with cheques showing payment, which are going forward today are the ones which make up the $2315.52 spent on Building and Repairs from March 1st, 1941 to Feb. 28th, 1943, and the $217.90 spent under the same heading from March 1st, 1943 to January 31st, 1944. Though you suggested we send invoices and receipts for building and repairs for the rest of this year, we cannot do this unless we secure duplicates from the firms, as we need the originals and the cheques for the Auditor. We shall be digging into them to see just what the expenditures were for a little later.\n\nAs Mr. Caldwell has mentioned in his letter, we have deducted some amounts as not really Building and Repair expenditures. This is particularly so with our accounts with hardware companies, and we have deducted such things as electric light bulbs. Also, the expenditures on the \"Dawn\" have been deducted, in so far as we could locate them. In other instances we have charged to Building and Repairs amounts which were put under Household Equipment on these invoices. This was partly necessary because an invoice would be marked a certain amount for B.& R. with no check marks showing which came into the amount. We have therefore marked what we now think is chargeable, and it has often made a larger figure, and often a smaller one. Therefore, though the Cash Book entries for this period (March 1st, 1941 - Jan. 31st, 1944) total $2551.42, the revised total is $2214.63. These deductions have all been indicated on the covering page for each invoice.\n\nWe have extracted from the cash book the name of the firm; the amount for Building and Repairs; and the House Equipment Manual Training and other expense if all paid by the same cheque and on the same invoice; and put the cheque number, its full amount, and the date it was issued. This is being sent in quadruplicate, and is an accurate statement of all expenses for B. & R. as checked by the Auditor. Because there were two audits, the extracts are in two sections.\n\nWe could have left all the invoices in this order, i.e. as in the extracts. But it would have scattered the invoices for each firm all over the place. Mr. Scott felt it would be better to do the final job with each firm's invoices together, and it has proven the best system. May I say here that Mr. Scott did a great deal to nail down invoices to particular jobs, and remark invoices where the B.& R. amounts were indefinite.\n\nI trust that these invoices are now in shape for the Department to consider a claim for a refund. Should there be other information required, I shall do all I can to supply it.\n\nSincerely,\n\n(sgd.) Clyde Woollard.\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n(RG 10, Volume 6434)\n\nFile 877-5, part 6\nWest Coast Agency - Alberni Residential School - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1938 - 1941\n\nFile 877-5, part 7\nWest Coast Agency - Alberni Residential School - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1941 - 1944\n\nFile 877-5, part 8\nWest Coast Agency - Alberni Residential School - Supplies - Accounts. 1944 - 1947\n\nFile 877-5, part 10\nWest Coast Agency - Alberni Residential School - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1947 - 1949\n\nFile 877-5, part 11\nWest Coast Agency - Alberni Residential School - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1950\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n(RG 10, Volume 6434)\n\nFile 877-5, part 6\nWest Coast Agency - Alberni Residential School - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1938 - 1941\n\nFile 877-5, part 7\nWest Coast Agency - Alberni Residential School - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1941 - 1944\n\nFile 877-5, part 8\nWest Coast Agency - Alberni Residential School - Supplies - Accounts. 1944 - 1947\n\nFile 877-5, part 10\nWest Coast Agency - Alberni Residential School - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1947 - 1949\n\nFile 877-5, part 11\nWest Coast Agency - Alberni Residential School - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1950\nDecember 21, 1944.\n\nPRECIS FOR THE CLERK OF THE PRIVY COUNCIL:\n\nRefund of $3,214.53 to the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada for expenditures at the Alberni Indian Residential School.\n\nOne copy of the Order-in-Council required for Indian Affairs Branch.\nOttawa,\nDecember 21, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nFunds are now available for payment of the accounts submitted by Reverend Doctor Dorey in connection with expenditures for repairs and improvements made from school funds at the Alberni Indian Residential School.\n\nThe amount requested for the period March 1, 1941, to January 31, 1944, is $8,814.53.\n\nIn discussing the method of payment with the Representative of the Treasury, he expressed the opinion that an Order-in-Council should be secured, as the expenditures were made by an outside organization and, in addition, the accounts cover a period of three years. Under these circumstances I enclose Memorandum to Council.\n\nActing Director.\nOttawa, January 4, 1945.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C.,\nBox 70, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd ultimo, enclosing account covering the cost of paint and materials purchased for repairs at the Alberni Residential School during the summer of 1944. I discussed this account with Mr. Hoey and it has been decided to return it, unpaid. It appears from the correspondence that no authority was given for this expenditure, and, as you are aware, it is simply impossible for us to control our appropriation if principals of residential schools assume authority for making expenditures that have not been authorized.\n\nFor your information, I may say that the Reverend Dr. Dorey, Associate Secretary of the United Church Home Mission Board, recently visited the Department, and it was decided to pay amounts covering expenditure incurred for repairs and improvements at this school during the period March 1, 1941, to January 31, 1944. These total $2,814.53. However, it was also distinctly understood that in paying these accounts it would not be a precedent for the payment of future accounts incurred without authority. I therefore return the accounts which you forwarded with your letter.\n\nEncl.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nCanada, Ontario.\n\nI enclose herewith West Coast Agency voucher No. 305, in the amount of $115.89, in favour of Mr. Caldwell, principal of Kibemi Residential School covering amounts paid for paint and materials required at the school during the summer vacation.\n\nI am also enclosing Mr. Ashbridge's letter of December 15th and letter dated December 4th from the principal of the school in explanation of the account. During the discussion referred to by Mr. Caldwell in his letter he was informed that if there was any outstanding accounts in connection with the school which might reasonably be charged against the Department he should submit full details so that Departmental authority might be obtained for the expenditure. It was not anticipated, however, that he could pay the accounts from school funds and later claim refund in the amount from the Department.\n\nHowever, inasmuch as all items on the accounts have been used in maintenance of the school building the voucher is recommended for payment.\n\nD.M.

Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\n\nRe: School Painting\n\nDear Mr. Ashbridge:\n\nI have your letter of Nov. 16th returning the vouchers for expenditure on paint. I regret that I evidently misunderstood the Commissioner when we discussed this matter and recognised the urgency of getting the paint job done before the children returned to school and while we had the available labour. I was under the impression that we were to pay for the paint and then submit the account to you.\n\nI have gone over the space covered by the paint and have attached a statement showing the detail of the work.\n\nI trust that the account will now be found satisfactory.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd) A.

It is to us a matter of some satisfaction to note that the Departments of the Government have the same problems that face the Board of Home Missions and that they try to solve them in about the same way, with, I should judge, about the same degree of success.\n\nI can assure you that we shall try to do all in our power to co-operate with you and the Department of the Treasury in the matters to which you refer. We should like you to know that we appreciate the fact that even Government officials believe that the reign of law does not always and inevitably supersede the operation of grace!\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nOttawa, February 8, 1945.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nRe: Repairs and Equipment - Alberni Residential School.\n\nMay I refer to your letter dated October 13, 1944, addressed by you to Mr. C. W. Jackson.\n\nYou may remember that itemized statements of expenditures made by the Principal of the Alberni School during the years 1941-42-43, were sent forward with that letter.\n\nIn view of the difficulty we have experienced since the receipt of that letter in obtaining the authority necessary before payments could be made, I have been wondering if you would care to emphasize when writing to the Principals of your Residential Schools the desirability of having all vouchers for expenditures at their schools submitted prior to March 31st in each fiscal year. The representative of the Treasury Board with whom I have discussed this matter expressed the hope that all such expenditures would, in future, be paid in full during the fiscal year in which they were actually incurred. He pointed out that it was exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to disburse Parliamentary appropriations at all equitably if the practice which appears to have been adopted during the last two or three years at Alberni became at all common.\n\nIn this connection, I pointed out to the official that conditions at Alberni have been somewhat unusual and that the\n\n.....destruction\ndestruction of the classroom building by fire had caused the Principal a great deal of annoyance and inconvenience. However, I promised him that the matter would be brought to the attention of the Church officials co-operating with us in the operation of our Residential Schools.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nReverend George Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary, Board of Home Missions,\nThe United Church of Canada,\nTORONTO 2 B, Ontario.\nREQUISITION FOR CHEQUE\nTO BE USED FOR ADVANCES OR AUTHORIZED PAYMENTS FOR WHICH THERE ARE NO ACCOUNTS\n\nDEPARTMENT: MINES and RESOURCES\nBRANCH: INDIAN AFFAIRS\nDATE: February 7, 1945\n\nAPPLICATION IS HEREBY MADE FOR THE ISSUE OF THE FOLLOWING CHEQUE OR CHEQUES:\n\n| CHEQUE No. | IN FAVOUR OF | AMOUNT |\n|------------|--------------|--------|\n|            | Board of Home Missions, United Church of Canada, 299 Queen Street West, Toronto 2B, Ont. - | $2,214.53 |\n\nSTATE BELOW WITH DETAILS IN EVERY CASE, WHETHER (a) STANDING ADVANCE, (b) ADVANCE FOR SPECIFIC JOURNEY\u2014ESTIMATING NUMBER OF DAYS, (c) OTHER ACCOUNTABLE ADVANCE OR (d) AUTHORIZED PAYMENT.\n\nPayment of the above amount was approved by P.C. 68/505 January 24, 1945.

It is thought this should be done before giving consideration to any alternative water supply for the school, such as the gravity supply from Heath Creek, referred to in Mr. Warren's report of December 11th, 1944, on a supply for Seshart Indian Reserve No. 1.\n\nPossibly by the exercise of care the school could reduce its water consumption materially without much inconvenience.\n\nDirector.\nMcLennan McFeely & Prior Ltd.\nPort Alberni, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe take pleasure in quoting on the following paints:\n\n| Item          | Quantity | Unit Price | Total Price |\n|---------------|----------|------------|-------------|\n| Flat Ivory Paint | 26 gals  | $3.85      | $100.10     |\n| Buff          | 19       | $3.85      | $73.15      |\n| White         | 3        | $3.85      | $11.55      |\n| Green         | 1        | $3.85      | $3.85       |\n| Turpentine    | 5        | $1.73      | $8.65       |\n| Boiled Oil    | 5        | $1.38      | $6.90       |\n| Boiler Black  | 2        | $1.86      | $3.72       |\n| Plaster Paris | 200 lbs  | $3.00 cwt  | $6.00       |\n\nAll prices quoted are F.O.B.

You no doubt have received my letter of March 14th, my file 30-15-9581, dealing in part with this matter.\n\nMr. Caldwell has been requested to make a check of the use of water over a period of three months and submit a report, following which the matter will come up for review by the Public Utilities Commission.\n\nIn the meantime, it might be a good move to have the Surveys and Engineering Branch investigate the possibilities of a supply from Heath Creek for both the school and the Reserve in case no important reduction in the rate is ordered by the Commission. Unless the cost would be prohibitive, it might be best to develop our own system.\n\nYour file is returned herewith.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nAlberni, B.C.,\nFeb. 14th, 1945.\n\nRev. George Dorey, D.D.,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. Dorey:\n\nI am enclosing copies of four letters regarding the water supply to the school. As you will see, we were paying a flat rate of $27.50 per month. The Town of Alberni, our source of supply, apparently passed a bye-law basing the rate on meter reading. Mr. Warren, from the Engineering Branch, spent a great deal of time here last fall trying to locate a water supply for the school and the adjacent reserve. It is apparent that the change in rate was known to him then, yet nothing whatever was said to me about it. The account for January, amounting to $100.40, was the first intimation I received of the advance.\n\nIf this matter is entirely in the hands of the Engineering Branch...that is, the matter of water supply for the school, is it reasonable for this Branch to obligate the school to such an item of expenditure without at least notifying us, or even to so obligate us with notification? Further, if the water supply for the school is one of the functions of this Branch, and if it alone is responsible to the Department of Indian Affairs for such supply, (as appears from the fact that the school was ignored in any negotiation) why was not a definite agreement made by this Branch with the source of supply at the time the school was built? Mr. Warren advises me that he knows of no such agreement. This places us at the complete mercy of our source of supply as to both the supply of water and the expense of such supply, and also places the school under the necessity of assuming, out of revenue funds, any obligation the Engineering Branch sees fit to burden us with. The whole thing looks \"screwy\" to me.\n\nThe local engineer for the Town water supply told me today that Mr. Warren told him that his investigations last fall into a separate source of water supply for the school and the reserve showed it would cost about $32,000.00 to put one in. Who was going to stand this expense? Certainly not the school. If, therefore, it was the intention of the Government to assume such expense to provide us with a water supply, why should not the Government assume the cost of the present water supply, at least over and above a reasonable cost which the school can afford to pay?\n\n(Signed) A. E. Caldwell\nIndian Residential School, Alberni.\n\nFeb. 3rd, 1945.\n\nMr. Warren,\n744 West Hastings Street,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Warren:\n\nI wonder if you have any record of any agreement entered into between the school and the Town of Alberni regarding water rates. We have apparently been paying a flat rate of $27.50 per month. Without notifying us (until they sent the January account) apparently a bye-law was passed establishing a charge by meter reading which puts our charge up to $100.40 for the month of January. Probably our summer consumption would be higher than the present, but we can figure on an expense of $1200.00 a year for water alone. This would be prohibitive to school finances.\n\nI scarcely think that the Department would make a definite hook-up to any utility without some agreement as to continuity and cost of supply, otherwise we are completely at the mercy of the vendor.\n\nWill you please advise me re this and whether it comes within the scope of your Department?\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(sgd.) A.E. Caldwell\nPrincipal.\nDear Sir:\n\nRegarding the new water rates of the Town of Alberni, we had some correspondence with the town a few months ago in which they advised us that there would be a new rate structure commencing the first of January this year. From that we gathered that your rate would be somewhat higher than you were paying last year. However, it was not realised that the increase now in effect would be as high as the account you have enclosed shows.\n\nWe have no information as to any agreement in effect between the Town and the Indian Affairs Branch. If there is such an agreement, most likely the Indian Agent or the Indian Commissioner would be in possession of a copy. I understand the school has been taking water from the Town of Alberni for at least 25 years so that any agreement would have been entered into prior to that time. Possibly if you would take up the matter direct with the Council, you might secure some alleviation owing to the fact that you convey the water from their pipeline to your property.\n\nThe consumption of water amounts to about 20,000 gallons per day or approximately 100 gallons per head. This would appear to be rather a high rate for a single building. Possibly it would be desirable to investigate the pipelines at the institution in order to determine if this high rate is due to leaks. A very small leak would run away with several thousand gallons per day and in the soil around the school such a leak would not be in evidence on the surface.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC.E. Webb\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\n\nper W.C. Warren.\n\nA.E. Caldwell, Esq.,\nPrincipal,\nAlberni Indian Residential School.\nFebruary 14th, 1945.\n\nMr. W.C. Warren,\nEngineering Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Warren:\n\nRe File 33615-1 Water Supply\n\nI have your letter of Feb. 6th, replying to my advice to you re the enormous increase in the water rates of the school in January - from $27.50 flat rate monthly to $100.40 meter rate for the month of January. I have been trying to get in touch with some responsible party in connection with the water supply from the Town of Alberni and just today succeeded in talking to Mr. McGillivray, who appears to be in charge of the water system.\n\nMr. McGillivray tells me that your computation of 20,000 galls a day, which seemed to me to be impossible (and which you said was \"rather high\") is not an excessive rate of consumption. In fact, he tells that the minimum consumption allowed on the system is 60 galls per day per capita. The consumption runs from that rate up to 500 galls per capita. Our rate is about 77 galls per capita, not including the farm stock.\n\nMr. McGillivray also tells me that he has been reading the meter attached just off the Town main pipe line, leading to the school, for the past six months, and that he had discussed the school water consumption with you. In your letter you say that there has been correspondence between your Department and the Town regarding the new rate structure commencing the last of January. As the school is apparently expected to discharge the expense of water supply out of the maintenance revenue, I cannot understand why we were not advised about the change, and the probable enormous increase in cost, until we received the January rate account.\n\nIt is the opinion of the town engineer that there is no pipe leak on school property and that the water consumption is not excessive. We may reasonably expect a somewhat larger consumption during the summer months. Therefore we can estimate a water expense of from $1200.00 to $1400.00 per year. With our present revenue this expense is prohibitive. If no agreement was entered into between your Department and the Town of Alberni when this present school was built and connected to the town water supply the school can have no guarantee of a continuous supply or a sustained rate. I do not know what department would have the function of establishing a utility agreement, but it seems to me that when we have a known and set income for maintenance purposes, we should also have a known and set rate on utilities.\n\nI mentioned the matter of some possible alleviation to Mr. McGillivray, as you suggested, by reason of the fact that we convey the water from the Town pipeline to our property, a fact of which I was not aware and which further obligates the school to the upkeep of this intake line, and responsibility for any leakages therein, but he said the rate\nstruck was by the Utilities Commission and approved by the W.P.T. Board. How this increase in rate can be reconciled with the war-time principle of the stabilization of prices, I do not know.\n\nI would be glad to have any suggestions you may be able to offer re the whole situation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(sgd.) A. E. Caldwell\nPrincipal.\n\nP.S. - It has further been brought to my attention that some of the Indian people resident on the Sheehaht Reserve, adjacent to the school, take their water from the school pipe line having outlet at the barn.

It is considered that a similar change would be desirable in the Alberni School Classroom Building. It is not thought that any other changes are necessary.\n\nThe original drawings can be used therefore, with only the small revisions in plans and elevations necessitated in the changed position of the cloak rooms.\n\nThe specifications however, must be re-written, as the original specifications cover the combined construction of both the Residential Building and Classroom Building.\n\nIn connection with the decision by Indian Affairs to proceed with work on the building this year, we may say that very little progress will have been made by March 31st next, and it is a certainty that practically all funds made available will have to be re-voted next year.\n\nHowever, unless instructed to the contrary, this Service will request Mr. Webb in Vancouver to have the site examined and a report prepared for the purpose of establishing whether the existing foundations, basement floor slab, or any of the subsurface drainage can be re-used in new work.\n\nA re-draft of the specification is now being written, subject to modifications that may be necessary upon receipt of our officer's report.\n\nIf our suggested action is approved, we will submit a list of newspapers serving the area, through which tenders for the project might be invited.\n\nT.S.

This building is only intended for classroom purposes and I am informed that many schools throughout British Columbia are not of fireproof construction. The proposed new building will have asbestos siding and will be heated from the main building. Consequently the likelihood of fire is greatly reduced.\n\nMy officials also point out that if any radical change were made at the present time, it would involve new plans and specifications and there would be a considerable delay in the completion of the building.\n\nHowever, I am requesting the Director of the Indian Affairs Branch to send a copy of your letter to the Indian Commissioner for British Columbia, in order that the matter may be again reviewed before construction commences.\n\nI, too, regret that we did not meet on my recent Coast trip but I enjoyed the visit and the weather was up to the Coast's best, for Christmas.\n\nWith kindest regards, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.

The original classrooms were of frame construction and burned down before the official opening and I trust that the new construction will be in keeping with the main building and be of fireproof design.\n\n\"The Residential School is beautifully situated and the most modern in Canada and I sincerely hope the Department will see fit to build a sufficient number of rooms to allow scope for the improved educational standards in which you have shown such a keen interest\".\n\nThe following are extracts from the Minister's reply to Mr. Gibson:\n\n\"I have discussed your suggestion with the departmental officials and they recommend that the same type of building be constructed as previously.

The inside faceings are badly crumbled and burned, but appear to be quite solid and firm. The basement floor slab could be used, and is in good order.\n\nAt the time of inspection it was raining and it had been raining for several days, but there was little or no water on the floor, which is completely open to the weather and which would indicate good drainage.\n\nIf the plans of the proposed new building are the same as the original I am of the opinion that much of the foundation could be used again.\n\nP.

As a consequence, it is doubtful if there will be much progress made on the erection of this building before the end of March. We are therefore placing an item in the Main Estimates for the fiscal year 1946-47 to ensure having funds on hand for this work.\n\nI understand that Mr. Webb has been requested to have the site examined and a report prepared for the purpose of establishing if the existing foundations, basement floor slab or any of the subsurface drainage can be re-used in new work.\n\nWe are interested in knowing the condition of the site on which the classroom block was erected.

C.,\n\nJanuary 22, 1946.\nVancouver, B.C.,\nJanuary 22, 1946.\n\nMemorandum to Mr. Webb:\n\nRe: Classroom Building, Indian Residential School, Alberni, B.C.\n\nFollowing your instructions of January 4, an inspection was made of the residential school building and the remaining foundations of the classroom building at the above mentioned school on January 7 to January 10.\n\nMr. J. D. Nicol, Chief Engineer of the Marwell Construction Company Limited, and Mr. W. Watt, President of the Acme Plumbing and Heating Service, were also at the inspection and their reports are submitted as appendices to this memorandum.\n\nClassroom Building - Indian Residential School, Alberni, B.C.\n\nThis building was erected in 1939-1940 by the Marwell Construction Company Limited of Vancouver, at the same time as the Residential School on the reserve which lies along the river approximately three miles from Alberni, as shown on Plan No. 1. The classroom building of frame construction was completely destroyed by fire in 1941, shortly after it had been completed. The only remaining parts of the building are the concrete walls, concrete basement floor and concrete footings.\n\nThis report will answer the questions asked in the letter from Mr. Mills, dated November 23, 1945.\n\na. \"Will it be possible to re-use any of the existing concrete walls or footings with safety?\"\n\nConcrete Walls\n\nThe walls were constructed 12 inches thick without any reinforcement being used. From the ground level to the top of the walls they are very badly cracked, especially\nnear the corners of the building, where some have opened up to one-half inch in places. In one place between window openings, the wall has crumbled so badly that it has completely disappeared.\n\nBelow the sill level of the windows to the level of the floor numerous cracks can be seen in the walls and they have been very badly pitted in large areas from the excessive heat of the fire to a maximum depth of four and one-quarter inches.\n\nFrom the above I have come to the conclusion the walls should be cut off at floor level, which is approximately two and one-half feet below ground level.\n\nAttached, as Appendix I, is the report of Mr. Nicol of the Marwell Construction Company, which agrees with the above conclusion.\n\nFootings\n\nThe concrete footings have not been harmed in any way by the fire; therefore, if the same type of frame building is to be reconstructed, they may be used with safety as before.\n\nConcrete Floor\n\nThe half of the floor which is nearest to the residential building is in quite good shape. The surface of the other half has spalled badly in quite large areas. It is believed that a new floor surface should be laid over the entire original floor.\n\nb. \"What demolition work, removal of debris, etc. will be necessary?\"\n\nThe basement has already been completely cleared of debris under the direction of the School authorities. The only work necessary now is the removal of the concrete walls as mentioned in Paragraph \"a\" above.\nc. \"Could new openings in concrete walls be cut with safety if required, for additional double doors in end walls?\"\n\nSince it is suggested that the present existing walls should not be used again, this question has not been dealt with.\n\nd. \"If, upon examination, existing concrete walls appear fit for re-use, report on what treatment would be required (if any) for re-surfacing.\"\n\nAs previously suggested, a new floor surface should be placed over the existing basement floor. No additional work is required on the footings. The balance of the concrete work should be removed.\n\nConclusions on Concrete\n\n1. Concrete walls to be cut off at the present basement floor level.\n\n2. New walls poured on top of cut-off, doweled to footing to increase strength.\n\n3. Present basement floor to be well cleaned with water and wire brush before new covering poured. Suggest a two-inch floor surface which would cover the new cold water supply pipes, which may be laid over existing concrete floor.\n\nThe existing floor could be grooved to hold these pipes. It is believed that it would be quicker to lay new pipes than to test and repair the ones now buried in the existing floor.\n\n4. Some water-proofing material should be placed on top of present floor and around the bottom of the new walls.\n\n5. New floor surface to be placed forming a water-tight joint around walls.\n\ne. \"Have any of the buried drainage lines been damaged, or become blocked?\"\n\nDuring the inspection of the classroom building it was raining especially hard and all drains were working with\nthe exception of one. It is believed this one, which is\nthe floor drain nearest the residential school, could be\ncleared very easily with a proper clean-out rod. It was\ntried by using a piece of pipe, but the block must be past\nthe first turn as the pipe wouldn't reach it.\n\nIt is believed all the soil drains do work as the\nsurface of the ground around the building was kept\ncomparatively dry, although there was quite a downpour at\nthe time.\n\nAll the toilet sewers are completely open and work\nwell.\n\nf. \"Provide a detailed sketch of the flow and return piping at\nthe boilers and circulating pumps in the Residential\nBuilding, showing all valves, air vents and piping sizes.\"\n\nShown on attached Plan No. 2.\n\ng. \"Make a careful examination of all existing cast-iron\nradiators. If any of these appear fit for re-use, prepare\na list showing the number of columns, number of sections\nand their height. This will be necessary in replacing any\nold units in new positions.\"\n\nAt the time of the inspection the radiators had\nbeen removed from the site of the classroom building and\nhad been stored under a shelter in a field approximately\n300 yards distant. This fact made it very difficult to test\nthem as they had to be carried to a water line by hand. Mr.\nWatt of the Home Plumbing and Heating Service suggested\ntesting one of them with 30 lbs. water pressure and then\nhaving the rest tested by a man on the site who was familiar\nwith boiler work.\n\nThe above was done. The radiator which was tested\non the day of the inspection was found to be in good con-\ndition. A few of the radiators were found to have broken\nor cracked columns caused probably when the classroom\nbuilding collapsed.\n5.\n\nAttached at Appendix II is a report from Mr. A. E. Caldwell, Principal of the Indian Residential School, indicating the results of the tests on the radiators.\n\nThose radiators, which are to be used again in the proposed new building, will require a complete scrubbing with wire brushes and sprayed with paint. At the present time they are in a very rusty condition.\n\nh. \"Provide a detailed sketch of the boxed trench or conduit through which supply and return hot water heating lines were carried to the Classroom Building. Give sizes, and type of insulation as used in construction, and state what amount of the boxed trench can be re-used, also state what additional piping, such as hot and cold water, electrical conduit, etc., was installed therein.\"\n\nThe conduit which contains the pipes running from the residential building to the classroom building is of a concrete box construction with 4-inch walls and floor, and with a 2-inch cedar plank cover. The attached Plan No. 3 shows the construction of this conduit. The only insulation used in the construction appears to be a lining of \u00bd-inch boards with a bituminous paper between them and the concrete. This information was furnished by the Marwell Construction Company, and it is borne out by inspection of either end of the trench.\n\nThe conduit appears to be in good condition, except for the six feet of it adjoining the remains of the classroom building. The lining of the trench for this six-foot distance has been charred badly from the heat of the fire, also the insulation on the pipes for some six feet requires replacement.\n\n1. \"Obtain pipe sizes for hot and cold water lines carried to Classroom Building, and show by sketch where they have been disconnected from system.\"\n\nAs shown on the attached Plan No. 4.\n\nThe following pipes are in the conduit:-\n1. One - \u00bd-inch hot water supply to classroom building, insulated with 3-ply asbestos air cell covering. This supply is shut off by a valve situated over the hot water boiler in the residential building.\n\n2. Two - 2\u00bd-inch return and supply for radiators in the classroom building. These two pipes are also insulated with 3-ply asbestos air cell covering. Both these pipes are shut off by valves in the boiler room of the residential school and are shown on the attached plan.\n\n3. One - 1\u00bd inch cold water supply to classroom building. This pipe is turned off by means of a valve situated at end of conduit in the basement floor of classroom building.\n\n4. One - 2 inch cold water supply which it is reported by the contractors was the fire protection supply for the building and is at maximum town pressure. This pipe also supplies water to the barn on the property, and is connected to the 2 inch main at some point between the two school buildings. There is a valve which can shut off this supply at the entrance of the conduit in the residential building, but it is left open so that water may be supplied to the barn. At the present time the 2 inch pipe has been \"plugged\" at the classroom end of the conduit, which allows a water supply to the barn to be maintained.\n\nNeither of the cold water pipes have any insulation on them through the length of the conduit. They are buried about one and one-half feet which gives sufficient frost protection in this district.\nj. \"Obtain from a reliable source, what boiler water temperatures should be carried under cold weather conditions, and upon what bases the heating piping sizes were determined, so that a proper balance may be established between the two buildings in the re-design of work for the new Classroom Building.\"\n\nThe attached letter from Mr. William Watt of the Acme Plumbing and Heating Service as Appendix III answers this question.\n\nFurther Information on Boilers\n\nThe hot water heating system is supplied by two \"Supreme Two Pass Steel Tubular Type Boilers\", size 42 inches by 84 inches by 57 inches, Nos. 3960 and 3961. Each has a horsepower rating of 31. These boilers are authorized for a pressure of 20 lbs. per square inch.\n\nThe engineer in charge of the boiler room at the school reports that the highest temperature at which the boilers were ever kept was 145 degrees during one very cold week.\n\nGenerally the boilers are kept at temperatures of 130 degrees in winter and 125 degrees during summer.\n\nThe hot water supply for the building is a steam boiler No. 44912, size 36 inches by 10 feet by 58 inches, with a horsepower rating of 35.5.\n\n[Signature]\n\nG.

The inner faces are spalled in many places to a depth of four inches. There are a considerable number of bad cracks and the re-use of these walls would not be deemed advisable. It is suggested that they be removed to the present slab level and re-built from there as the footing does not appear to be damaged.\n\nThe present slab is damaged in spots but by covering this with a two and one half inch concrete slab, taking provision for waterproofing, a first-class repair can be effected. Waterproofing would be best carried out by the use of Sternson's Ferrotite No. 600 in combination with No. 610, one providing the waterproofing and the other the bonding agent.\n\nWe trust you will find this in order.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMarwell Construction Co., Ltd.\n\nJ.

This is the right size of Mains required for the amount of radiation necessary to heat the Classroom to an inside temperature of 70\u00b0 Fahrenheit, when the atmospheric temperature is at zero. The Boiler water temperature should be carried around 130\u00b0 under cold weather.\n\nThe steam main was originally carried across basement ceiling and no doubt this would be done in the new building, and the hot and cold water piping for the plumbing fixtures which will have to be renewed could be carried alongside of the heating main in ceiling or basement to partition where fixtures are located.\n\nWe have put one of the radiators under a water test of 30 lbs. pressure and have found same O.K.

Whyte of the local office of the Surveys and Engineering Branch for a plan of the water system in the building but was advised that this had not been supplied to them by the Department. Col. Whyte subsequently informed me that he had made enquiry of the Contractor and others employed in the construction of the building but had not been successful in getting the plan and suggested that I contact the Department as no doubt the information required would be on file in the Surveys and Engineering Division at Ottawa.\n\nThe plans of the building we have here do not include information regarding location of the pipeline of the cold water system.

MacKay,\nCommissioner, Indian Affairs,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing a copy of a letter to the Engineering Branch which is self-explanatory.\n\nI may say that I knew nothing about the proposed increase in water rates by resorting to the meter reading system until I received the January account. The Town engineer informs me that the whole matter was discussed with Mr. Warren while he was here a few months ago, that Mr. Warren had been told what the meter reading of consumption was for the past six months, and Mr. Warren admits in his letter to me of Feb. 6th that the Town of Alberni had some correspondence with the Engineering Department advising of the proposed increase in rates.\n\nI certainly feel that the school should have had some intimation of this negotiation and correspondence when, presumably, the cost is expected to come out of school revenue. I do not know what Department is responsible for the water supply to the school, but I certainly think that some agreement, or some permanency should have been entered into by that Department with the Town of Alberni, or with whatever source our water supply came from, at the time of the building of this school.\n\nI would be glad if you would take this matter up with the Department of Indian Affairs. Obviously, there can be little hope of the recovery of the school from its present financial difficulties if we are to be confronted with unforeseen permanent increase in operational expenditure such as this. If the school is compelled to assume this expense, our only prospect, as long as war-time conditions continue, is of increasing deficit.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPrincipal.\n\nCopy\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nP.O.

March 14, 1946\n\nDear Mr. Caldwell:\n\nThe question of the increase in cost of water to the school has been referred to the Provincial Public Utilities Commission for review.\n\nThe Commission accepted the rate as set by the Corporation of the City of Alberni for filing. I may also say that the rate has been approved by the War Time Prices and Trade Board.\n\nDr. Carrothers, chairman of the Commission has advised Mr. Webb that the matter has been discussed by the Commission with the Department of Municipal Affairs and that they are in agreement that a check on the use of water at the school should be made and the matter reviewed at a later date.\n\nThe suggestion has been made that there may be unnecessary use of water at the school and a check should be made in order to find out if there is any wastage. Please arrange to have a careful check made of the use of water over a period of three months, at which time the Commission would be prepared to review the situation, giving consideration to all the facts.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

MacKay,\nCommissioner, Indian Affairs\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Basement water leakage\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReporting further on the telephone conversation with you recently relative to a cold water pipe leakage under the cement floor of the school basement and kitchens, I wish to advise that repairs have now been completed by L.A. Hanna, Plumber, Port Alberni.\n\nOn Monday, Feb. 11th, a leakage appeared from the cement wall of the students' kitchen, behind a built-in cupboard. The cupboard was removed and water leakage discovered from broken hollow bricks forming part of the side wall. This was traced to the cold water lead-in to the kitchen sink. A 3/4\" galvanized pipe evidently led from the water main and was laid about one foot under the cement floor. No plans were obtainable showing the cold water system. Mr. Ashbridge, the Indian Agent, was notified and he came to examine the leak on Tuesday afternoon. In the meantime a plumber had been called in, at Mr. Ashbridge's suggestion, to investigate the leak. The water appeared to be coming from under the floor and Mr. Ashbridge instructed that, if the leak was not found on Tuesday, no further work was to be done until instructions were received from the Engineer's Branch.\n\nNo instructions were received and the Commissioner's office was communicated with by phone, and instructions received to proceed with the repairs, pending search for plans of the water system.\n\nThe kitchen floor was dug up and the 3/4 inch galvanized pipe uncovered. Several leads were found; the pipe in question, about 15 feet in extent to the main, was found to be completely corroded from the outside, with a number of holes through which there was considerable leakage under pressure. The opinion of the plumber was that the nature of the ground which the leaking pipe traversed was responsible for the corrosion, although a similar pipe, leading from the main to the staff kitchen in the opposite\ndirection (about one foot of which was uncovered) did not appear to be similarly corroded.\n\nA copper pipe was installed to replace the one corroded and leaking, and the trench across the kitchen floor re-filled with cement.\n\nIn the absence of a blue-print of the cold water system, the following appears to be the operating of the system, as far as the pipes laid under the floor is concerned: The intake from the main supply comes through the outer wall in front of the school and then proceeds overhead into the boiler room. From there the main, a 2\" cast pipe, returns under the floor to the kitchens, with (as far as the kitchens are concerned) four 3/4\" galvanized lead-off pipes... one to the student's kitchen sink (the one repaired), one to the staff kitchen, one to the bake-room and one to the vegetable room. The latter three run in the opposite direction to the one just repaired.\n\nThe question arises, first of all, as to why these pipes were installed under the ground when there appears to be no necessity for so doing, and also, if it is the nature of the ground that has corroded the galvanized pipe just removed, the other similar pipes mentioned above will inevitably give trouble until replaced with copper piping.\n\nI may say, in explanation as to why the leakage first showed through the wall of the building, that the leaking water was apparently forced along the floor under the cement and found this outlet through several hollow bricks that had evidently been broken when built into the wall.\n\nTo remove the water from the floor of the basement, the kitchens and the distill room, it was necessary to dig down outside the wall to the tile drain, remove one tile, then put a hole through the wall to allow the water to escape.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n\"H.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, enclosing copy of communication received from Mr. Caldwell, with regard to the new classroom at the Alberni Residential School.\n\nI discussed the contents of both letters with the Director yesterday afternoon.\n\nThere is considerable merit in many of the suggestions contained in Mr. Caldwell's letter, but some of these would have very far-reaching effects and would involve increased expenditure and consequent increases in the per capita allowance. Possibly such increase will have to receive careful consideration in the near future, but at the present time we are not in a position to make any decision in the matter.\n\nWith reference to the request for a larger classroom building than the Department proposes to erect, we can see that such a building is probably necessary. However, we might just as well be frank between ourselves on the matter, and if such a radical change in plans and specifications were made at the present time, it is extremely doubtful if we would even have the building started this year. After all, four new classrooms should improve conditions, when it is taken into account that there is no classroom building available now.\n\nFrom Government decisions published in the newspapers, you are aware of the intention to push the erection of private homes and to curtail on the erection of public buildings. As a matter of fact, we only hope to obtain this year one third of the number of buildings that we had expected to erect on\nreserves throughout Canada during the summer of 1946. One of the buildings we did obtain is the classroom building at Alberni. As intimated above, the situation is that we either obtain four classrooms or we obtain nothing.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Alberni Indian Residential School\n\nI have your letter of January 30th, 1946, regarding the construction of a classroom block at the above noted school to replace the building destroyed by fire in 1941.\n\nAlthough I should like to see the new classroom building of fireproof construction, principally because of the added security we would have against a repetition of what occurred in 1941, I should say that what is really necessary is more classroom accommodation than was provided in the old structure.\n\nIf we are to provide for full school day instruction, which I should say is desirable, instead of the half-day system now in operation, the new building should have six or seven classrooms. In discussing this point with Dr. Morrison, Provincial School Inspector for the Alberni District, following his inspection of the existing setup in the spring of last year, he expressed himself very definitely in favour of a seven classroom block or wing, suggesting the division of the grades as follows:\n\n- Grade IA - 1 teacher\n- Grade IB - 1 teacher\n- Grade II - 1 teacher\n- Grade III - 1 teacher\n- Grade IV - 1 teacher\n- Grades V & VI - 1 teacher\n- Grades VII & VIII - 1 teacher\nIn order to give a modern school program, permitting full school days, it is difficult to see how we could get along with less than six classrooms with a total enrolment of 225 such as we have at Alberni. Should a seventh classroom be required, the space necessary for this could no doubt be provided from existing accommodation in the main building. In addition to classroom requirements, gymnasium and manual training accommodation should also be provided. These two latter divisions should probably be housed in a separate building well away from the classrooms in order to avoid interference with the work there.\n\nI enclose herewith a copy of a letter received from Principal Caldwell regarding the proposed new classroom block at Alberni.\n\nIt is most unfortunate that this Province continues to be deprived of the services of a School Inspector, especially at a time when consideration is being given to the important matter immediately before us and in view of the pressing need for school surveys in various Agencies preliminary to the construction of new schools, and other related matters. Without these services our teachers are not receiving the guidance so essential to their work and this office cannot have proper administrative contact with the schools, and the whole Indian education setup here is suffering as a consequence.

Glen in reply to an enquiry from Mr. Gibson as to the construction of the new class-rooms at the Alberni School. The Hon. Minister states that it is proposed to build the new class-rooms on the same plan and of the same construction as the former class-rooms, which were destroyed by fire in 1941.\n\nWe have laboured under great difficulties due to our lack of class-room space and we appreciate very much the intention of the Government to rebuild the class-rooms and to expedite the reconstruction.\n\nHowever, there are some phases of the matter that I respectfully suggest should be brought to the attention of the Government.\n\nDr. Morrison, the Provincial Inspector of Schools, when requested to make a survey of Alberni School conditions, which he did a year ago, expressed to me his opinion that the new class-rooms should be of fireproof construction similar to the main building, and that the needs of the school required that more class-room space than formerly should be made available.\n\nThe Hon. Minister states that the proposed new building would be heated from the main building and, consequently, the likelihood of fire would be greatly reduced. May I point out that the former class-room building was also heated from the main building. While we certainly do not anticipate a repetition of the fire of 1941, and while, under the circumstances, double precaution will be taken to prevent such repetition, would it not be economy and good insurance to reconstruct the proposed building with fireproof material, if\nsuch is available?\n\nIn the matter of the enlarging of the class-room space by increasing the number of class-rooms to six or seven, may I say that such enlargement will have a vital effect on the functioning of the Alberni School in its educational service to the Indians of British Columbia and in reflecting credit on the Government by the better facilities provided and the worthwhile results obtained.\n\nWith four class-rooms only provided, our pupilage of 225 could not possibly be given class-room instruction except on the half-day system which we are at present maintaining. My own Indian school experience indicates definitely that only the full day class-room instruction for the junior grades, one to three or four, provides sufficient grounding to carry the pupils through grades five to seven or eight, in which grades the half-day class-room, half-day vocational instruction, should be operative.\n\nIndian parents, themselves graduates of the Residential Schools, are becoming increasingly conscious of the advantages of High School instruction, and are requesting same with the expressed view of fitting the pupils for competition with the \"Whites\" in industry pertaining to reserve locality and also in occupations removed from the Reserves.\n\nAlberni school is at present conducting, under great handicap, grades nine and ten, and it has been anticipated that, eventually, full High School instruction could be made available. For several reasons, such as the inaccessibility of Public High School facilities to the reserve homes of the pupils, and the proven undesirability of Indian pupils boarding out in a City or Town Centre to attend Public High School, it would appear that affording High School facilities in the Residential School is the only satisfactory way to make these facilities available to promising and ambitious Indian pupils.\n\nObviously, the Indian High School student must compete in examination with similar Public School students and therefore must be afforded full-time class-room instruction.\nConfining our class-room space to four rooms as formerly would effectively bar the Alberni School for providing the High School tuition the parents are requesting, and which has a promising future, as instanced by the fact that not one of our grades eight and nine pupils failed to pass last term.\n\nI fully appreciate the desire for economy and expedition in the rebuilding of the class-rooms and the advantage of such expedition to our work at Alberni School, but may I earnestly request that the Government take cognizance of the immediate needs and the future possibilities and demands of Indian education in British Columbia, as here outlined.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n\"A.

Up to that time they had been paying a flat rate of $27.50 per month. When the Principal received the bill for January, he found that he was asked to pay $100.40. On February 30th, he communicated with Mr. Warren, 744 W. Hastings Street, Vancouver, of the Surveys and Engineering Branch of your Department, asking if he had any record of any agreement entered into between the School and the Town of Alberni regarding water rates; so that he certainly exercised due diligence in advising your Department about this matter after getting his bill. Mr. C.E. Webb, District Engineer, replied, stating:\n\n\"Regarding the new water rates of the town of Alberni, we had some correspondence with the town a few months ago in which they advised us that there would be a new rate structure commencing the first of January this year. From that we gathered that your rate would be somewhat higher than you were paying last year. However, it was not realized that the increase now in effect would be as high as the account you have enclosed shows.\"\n\n\"The consumption of water amounts to about 20,000 gallons per day or approximately 100 gallons per head. This would appear to be rather a high rate of consumption for a single building. Possibly it would be desirable to investigate the pipelines at the institution in order to determine if this high rate of consumption is due to leaks. A very small leak would run away with several thousand gallons per day and in the soil around the school such a leak would not be in evidence on the surface.\"\n\nMy first observation is that it seems a strange way of proceeding that the Town of Alberni should have discussed with the Department the\nthe setting up of a new rate structure, which the Engineer could see would mean an increased cost to the School, without the School being in any way notified. It would seem to me that we might expect that your Department would refund the difference between the $27.50 which they had been paying and the rate which the Department agreed to pay\u2014or agreed that the Town of Alberni should charge. It is the Department which made the agreement with the Town, and consequently I cannot see why the School should be asked to pay. I think it is high time that such a method of proceeding should be stopped. Either the Department is going to assume the responsibility which it incurred by making arrangements, by which the School is supposed to abide, or the Department should confer with the School before it makes such arrangements.\n\nIn any case, the Department's Engineer was not nearly as much exercised as the Principal\u2014which was natural. They had agreed lightheartedly that the School should be charged more, but they did not have to pay it, so why should they worry?\n\nMr. Caldwell wrote on February 14th to the Engineer and to Major MacKay. In his letter to the Engineer, Mr. Caldwell said that it was the opinion of the Town Engineer that there was no pipe leakage on the school property and that the water consumption was not excessive. I enclose copy of the letter which Mr. Caldwell wrote to Major MacKay and a copy of Major MacKay's reply, written in March.\n\nOn the 1st May, Mr. Webb of the Surveys and Engineering Branch wrote to Mr. Caldwell, suggesting that a check over a period of three months would be desirable and asking him to furnish copies of the accounts for the past four months\u2014which was done. On May 14th, Mr. Webb wrote to Mr. Caldwell, asking that he be kept informed in connection with tracing down a probable leak, and it was found at that time that they had a leakage of approximately a cubic foot a minute\u2014or to be exact ten cubic feet each nine and a half minutes. I understand that the leak has been found and the matter corrected.\n\nMay I point out that the water is conveyed from the town pipe line to the school by a pipe which has been put in at the expense of the Department, and consequently the town is not responsible for this. In the second place, may I point out that the Church cannot be held responsible for keeping this pipe in good repair\u2014that is one of the obligations of the Department.\n\nThirdly, it follows that the pipe, not having been in good repair and the Principal having advised the Department immediately he found that he was using an excessive amount of water, and the Department not having exercised very much diligence in the matter, we have a right to expect that we shall get a refund of a certain amount, to which I\nIndian Affairs Branch-\n\nI shall refer later.\n\nFinally, I want again to point out that the Department, through its Surveys and Engineering Branch, made the agreement with the Town of Alberni for the new rates, without any consultation with the Principal of the School.\n\nThe amount which we claim is $362.78 and is arrived at according to the following table submitted by Mr. Caldwell:\n\n| Consumption before repairs were made |\n|-------------------------------------|\n| January    | $100.40 |\n| February   | 91.10   |\n| March      | 106.50  |\n| April      | 114.80  |\n| May        | 108.70  |\n| Total for 5 months                   | $521.50 |\n| Average monthly consumption          | $104.30 |\n\n| Consumption after repairs were made |\n|-------------------------------------|\n| September   | 42.70 |\n| October     | 46.10 |\n| November    | 36.10 |\n| December    | 15.90 |\n| Total for 4 months                   | $140.80 |\n| Average monthly consumption          | 35.20 |\n\nAverage Overcharge per month before repairs - $69.10\n\nRebate due the School = $69.10\n\n$362.78\n\nWe shall be glad to know when we can expect a refund of this amount.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEncl.

(RG 10, Volume 6434, File 877-5, part 8)\nMarch 5th, 1946.\n\nMr. Hoey\n\nRe: Leak in Basement Floor,\nAlberni Indian Residential School.\n\nOn receipt of your memorandum of February 15th, immediate inquiries were made in regard to any plans that might exist showing cold water pipes under the basement floor.\n\nMr. Mills, Chief Engineer of the Engineering and Construction Service, advised that no plans showing any mains under the basement slab were ever prepared, since it was not the intention of this Service that water lines should be so located. However, to confirm this opinion, contact was made with Mr. C.R. Cornish, who was Resident Engineer when the new building was erected.\n\nAttached hereto is a copy of a memorandum from Mr. Mills, dated February 28th, which indicates that in the absence of cold water pipes under the basement slab, the leakage must be from sub-surface water under the basement. If this is the case, it would be necessary to install the drainage system for the site suggested by Mr. Warren about a year ago.\n\nBefore making a definite recommendation in this respect, however, Mr. Mills is getting a further opinion from Mr. Webb, District Chief Engineer at Vancouver.\n\nDirector.\nFebruary 28, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nRe: Indian Residential School,\nAlberni, British Columbia.\n\nIn accordance with your verbal instructions to Mr. Buck, confirmed by your notation of the 22nd instant on our memorandum of February 20th, regarding a reported water main leakage under the basement floor slab at the above school, Mr. Walker was requested by wire to contact Mr. Cornish and establish, if possible, whether or not water mains were laid under the basement floor slab of the residential building.\n\nIn a night lettergram, dated February 27th, Mr. Walker forwarded information on the matter. From the message the following is quoted:\n\n\"Mr. Cornish has no recollection of any water supply lines laid under basement floor slabs stop. Anti-sweat covering used on cold water main through basement so this line and branches definitely on ceiling stop No reason for taking any run under slab nor of any deviation from approved layout.\"\n\nThe water service at the school was in existence prior to the destruction of the original building by fire and the approved layout to which Mr. Walker makes reference, is one prepared by Mr. Cornish showing the recommended position outside the building for the wood stave branch line to which we have always assumed connection to the main building was made.\n\nUnder the circumstances we can offer no explanation of Commissioner MacKay's statement that a \"leak in the cold water system has developed under the floor.\"\n\nWe have plans which show cast iron drainage lines below the floor slab, but it is improbable that these are the cause of trouble. It is much more likely that subsurface water is finding its way beneath the basement slab, as mentioned in our memorandum to you dated April 3rd, 1944, summarizing a report from Mr. Warren, at which he suggested carrying out site drainage operations at an estimated cost of $930.00.\n\nIt is considered desirable to obtain an opinion from Mr. Webb on the matter before any action is taken by the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nChief Engineer.\nOttawa, March 6, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, SURVEYS AND ENGINEERING BRANCH,\n\nI desire to refer you to my memorandum of February 15, requesting that a copy of the plans of the water system at the Alberni School be forwarded to Indian Commissioner MacKay.\n\nI have just received another letter from Major MacKay, dated February 23, and evidently these plans had not reached him at that time. I enclose, for your information, a copy of a letter from the Principal of the School. This was forwarded to us by Commissioner MacKay.\n\nDirector\n\nEnc.\nAIRMAIL\n\nOttawa, March 6, 1946.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd ultimo, with reference to your request for plans of the water system at the Alberni School.\n\nOn receipt of your letter this morning, I phoned the Architect and it appears that they have no such plan at Ottawa. He informed me that he had wired to Mr. Webb and instructed him to interview you in regard to the matter. Possibly you have already heard from Mr. Webb.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nYour File 159-1-5\n\nFurther to my letter of February 15th in connection with the leak in the cold water system at the Alberni Indian Residential School, I am forwarding for your information a copy of Mr. A.

Mr. Webb was requested to supply an estimate for the work he considered necessary to rectify the condition.\n\nHowever, before Mr. Webb received our letter we were advised by the Indian Affairs Branch that under cover of a letter to them dated February 23rd, Commissioner Mackay had forwarded a report from the school Principal stating that repairs had been carried out. From the Principal's report the following is quoted:\n\n\"On Monday Feb. 11th, a leakage appeared from the cement wall of the students' kitchen, behind a built-in cupboard. The cupboard was removed and water leakage discovered from broken hollow bricks forming part of the side wall. This was traced to the cold water lead-in to the kitchen sink. A 1\" galvanized pipe evidently led from the water main and was laid about one foot under the cement floor. No plans were obtainable showing the cold water system. Mr. Ashbridge, the Indian Agent, was notified and he came to examine the leak on Tuesday afternoon. In the meantime a plumber had been called in, at Mr. Ashbridge's suggestion, to investigate the leak. The water appeared to be coming from under the floor and Mr. Ashbridge instructed, that if the leak was not found on Tuesday, no further work was to be done until instructions were received from the Engineer's Branch.\n\nThe kitchen floor was dug up and the 1\" inch Galvanized pipe uncovered. Several leaks were found; the pipe in question, about 15 feet in extent to the main, was found to be completely corroded from the outside, with a number of holes through which there was considerable leakage under pressure. The opinion of the plumber was that the nature of the ground which the leaking pipe traversed was responsible for the corrosion, although a similar pipe, leading from the main to the staff kitchen in the opposite direction (about one foot of which was uncovered) did not appear to be similarly corroded.\n\nA copper pipe was installed to replace the one corroded and leaking, and the trench across the kitchen floor re-filled with cement.\"\n\nJ.

The building of the school itself appeared to have suffered no ill effects, except for one crack in the ceiling of the junior girls' dormitory, which I believe was noticeable before, but a small amount of dust was shaken out of this and possibly enlarged to a slight extent; also dust was shaken out of other cracks which were previously noticed. The quarters of the Principal suffered several large cracks in most of the rooms, and also over doorways. The chimneys and machinery in both dwellings and school do not appear to be damaged.\n\nThe condition of the School on this last inspection was the same as on April 4th, still troubled with plaster falling off and decaying on all northern walls.\n\nN.W.

(RG 10, Volume 6434, File 877-5, part 8)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, June 25, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, SURVEYS & ENGINEERING BRANCH\n\nI enclose, for your information, copy of a report submitted to the Department by Mr. J. Coleman, Inspector of Indian Agencies for British Columbia, with reference to the Alberni Residential School. I would appreciate it if you would have one of your officers visit this school with a view to determining what steps can be taken to improve the conditions mentioned in the Inspector's report.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector,\n\nEnc.\nTo The Indian Commissioner for B. C.\n\nRe: Alberni Residential School\n\nI went over this school on the 4th ult. with the Principal and Acting Agent Garrard and would report that:\n\nFloors - A considerable portion of the basement concrete floor was without covering, the linoleum having been taken up as it had lifted in many places owing to the presence of moisture. I have seen this floor several times since the school was constructed and am fully convinced, contrary opinion notwithstanding, that the moisture found its way underneath the covering from the surface and not from underneath the concrete floor and foundation, this also being the opinion of the Principal, staff and former Agent.\n\nUnder these conditions I do not consider replacement or relaying the linoleum will be any more satisfactory than in the past, but that consideration should be given to an impervious covering applied and bonded direct to the concrete, the least expensive of which would probably be a Mulsomatic surfacing or the more expensive composition, \"tiles\" set in asphalt.\n\nWalls - Considerable damage has been done to the surface of the inside east walls, the south wall of the Principal's office where the plaster and undercoat have spilled off the wall over a considerable area, and also in the Principal's residence on the south wall, from moisture penetrating from the outside. In the upper floors this is due either to the recently installed copper flashing over the porous artificial stone coping, failing to reach to the outside lower edge of the coping by about 1\", consequently shedding the rain on this unprotected strip, or at the imperfect brick mortar joints, pointing on both, or a combination of these.\nThe inexpensive remedy would be waterproofing the exposed strip of coping and caulking its exposed joints. Pointing the brickwork will be a job of some magnitude and could perhaps be deferred until we are able to determine the results of treatment of the coping, or alternatively point only over the trouble spots, in addition to the coping treatment. The trouble in the Principal's quarters is also, in my opinion, due to the porosity of the artificial stone window sills and lintels and requires waterproofing with a suitable material such as Tremco No. 121 Waterproofing, and joints caulked with their compound or similar. As the inside plaster affected has considerable efflorescence, despite frequent brushing off, it may be found necessary to apply a seal-coat, a variety of which is also put out by the Tremco people, after the walls dry out and before refinishing. Sufficient of these materials, outside of pointing the brick joints, should not be expensive.\n\nThe spalling of the plaster in the Principal's office, as elsewhere, can only be remedied, in my opinion, by removal of the loose material and refinishing after ensuring a proper key for the undercoat.\n\nDrainage\n\nWhile in Alberni on this occasion Chief Shewish of Sheeshant reserve, whose village adjoins the school, complained vigorously against the drainage of the school's untreated sewage into an open drain through the village, creating at times an intolerable nuisance and a quagmire dangerous to small children, apart from the health aspects.\n\nI examined this with the Principal and Agent and found the Chief was fully justified in his complaint and it is hard to understand why this drain was located in its present position in the first place and why the former Indian Agent, as Health Officer for the reserve did not order its removal. Apparently the sewage is mostly scapy water but it is certain that it has been very offensive. The Principal stated that he sank almost to the waist on the reserve in ground softened by this discharge. There was absolutely no need to carry the drain to the edge of the village in the first place as it could have been taken in a direct line towards the river. Needless to say, this is a matter that should be remedied without delay regardless of cost.\n\nJ. Coleman,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nMr. P.B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent,\nAlberni, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRepairs to school building.\n\nThe following repairs are urgently required:\n\n1. BASEMENT FLOORS, including kitchens and students' dining room, also boys' playrooms.\n\nThe linoleum on the above mentioned floors had deteriorated due to dampness, and was removed in 1944. Estimates had been submitted for the re-covering of the floors in the summer of 1944 and again in the summer of 1945. It was decided by the Power and Water Bureau to delay the recovering until 1945 to determine whether the moisture which had spoilt the linoleum was caused by seepage up through the floor.\n\nTo date it has not appeared that any moisture is seeping through the floor. It would appear that the prime cause of the deterioration was the faulty cementing of the linoleum to the cement floor, permitting water to get under the linoleum when the floor is being scrubbed or when leakage occurred in water pipes. It is requested that the floors be recovered, preferably with some mastic substance, during the vacation months of July or August of this year, for the following reasons:\n\n(a) The amount of labour involved in keeping the cement floors clean in the kitchens and dining room.\n(b) The unsuitability of cement floors for the indoor playing of children, the playrooms requiring to be used extensively during the wet winter period.\n(c) The continual complaint of staff members who must work on these floors as to the tiring, and general bad effect on the feet and legs, so much so that it is difficult to find permanent staff for the work.\n\n2. RESIDENCE: Cracks in walls, and seepage of moisture through walls.\n\nDue either to the settling of the building, or to the vibration in the building caused by heavy logging trains passing just below the building, cracks are showing in the wall, in the dining room.\n\nAll along the outside walls, above the baseboard on the ground floor, moisture has seeped in, in some places taking the plaster completely off the walls. This is undoubtedly due to absorption of moisture either by the brick or stone structure of the walls or by absorption through the pressed coping stone running along the wall about three feet from the ground.\n\n3. MOISTURE through walls of Dormitories on top floors:\n\nThis condition was to a great extent remedied in the fall of 1945 by the covering of the roof coping with sheet copper. As no further moisture appeared the inside walls of the dormitories were painted last summer. When the present wet winter season was well advanced, however, moisture again appeared inside all walls with a North exposure (on the top floor only) and a white \"fluff\" formed on the plaster. It may be that moisture seeps through the brick wall.\n\nMay I request that these matters be investigated with a view to repair and remedy during the summer vacation.\n\nYours very truly, A.E.

M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nDear Mr. MacKay-\n\nThis will acknowledge your letter of September 19 re question of installing a three burning oil unit for the Alberni Indian Residential School:\n\nRecently Mrs. Unsworth of this staff was at the above mentioned school and noted the following:\n\n1. The two building heating units are Supreme 2 pass boilers of 31 H.P. rating used as hot water heating units at 20 lbs. per sq. in. pressure.\n\nEach is fired with a size 2 Iron Fireman Stoker.\n\n2. The domestic hot water is heated with steam circulating in a coil in the 1,000 gallon hot water storage tank. The steam is supplied by a Horizontal Return Tubular Eclipse Type Boiler rated at 35.5 H.P. and run at a pressure of 95 lbs. per sq. in. This boiler is hand fired with lump coal costing $12.40 per ton at the school.\n\n3. The kitchen stove is fired by an Iron Fireman DL.20 using stoker coal.\n\n4. That apparently there are at least four laundry days per week.\n\nIt is presumed that the reason for considering changing from coal to oil fuel is to attempt to lessen the fuel costs. In this regard the following will be of interest.\n\nStoker coal costs $9.45 per ton delivered at the school. The heat value of this coal is 11,500 B.T.U.'s per lb. or 24,300 B.T.U.'s cost 1 cent. Efficiency of coal for heating using stokers is estimated at 70% or 17,000 B.T.U.'s of useful heat for 1 cent.\n\nFurnace oil suitable for automatic burners such as would be needed in this school is quoted as 10.7 cents per gallon at the school. The heat value of this oil is 18,500 B.T.U.'s per lb. or 13,800 B.T.U.'s cost 1 cent. Efficiency of oil for heating is about 75% or 10,370 B.T.U.'s of useful heat for 1 cent. Therefore, cost of oil heating at the school will be 17,000 x 100% = 164% of coal heating.\nFrom the foregoing, it will be observed the cost of stoker coal would have to be $15.50 per ton to equal in useful heat value the cost of fuel oil at 10.7 cents per gallon.\n\nAutomatic fuel oil burners require less attention than coal stokers but with either type of fuel one attendant is necessary to look after the boiler room at this school. Therefore, there would not appear to be saving in labour in this case. Full hoppers on the coal stokers will run overnight except in the coldest weather.\n\nAt other schools it appears to be the practice to run the laundry only two days per week, and if this could be done at Alberni it would cut fuel costs as on other days the pressure in the Eclipse Boiler could then be kept down to 12 lbs. per sq. in. which is sufficient to heat the domestic hot water.\n\nAnother method of lessening the cost of heating the domestic hot water which might be considered is to install a separate hot water heater of the cast type (18 series) fired with an automatic coal stoker similar to Iron Fireman D.L.30. This stoker to be controlled by a thermostat in the hot water storage tank. A rough estimate of such a unit is $1175.00 installed in school. Such a unit would not, however, take care of the demand on laundry days and on those days it will be necessary to run the Eclipse boiler hand fired. However, for this method to be economical the Eclipse boiler should not be run more than an average of two days a week.\n\nOne other point in favour of coal is that the present coal stokers are in place and working, and have an installed value. If removed the sale value is less at least by the installing cost.\n\nWhile oil may be a little more convenient it is not more economical than coal when a boiler room attendant is needed for both as in this case.\n\nIf this information is not sufficient for your purposes, I will be pleased to arrange for a further investigation as soon as an engineer can be made available.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nD.

Unsworth of the Surveys and Engineering Branch, in connection with floor coverings in the dining room, kitchen and other portions of the basement of the school at an estimated cost of $3422.50, in addition to which materials will be required for general repairs costing approximately $450.00.\n\nA copy of my letter of October 4th to Mr. Acting Agent Garrard in this connection is enclosed, in which I suggested that the Principal might like to have the painting and minor repairs attended to and the girl's recreation room floor, kitchen and boy's lavatory floors and girl's lavatory floor, the cost of which would be approximately $1800. A copy of Mr. Garrard's letter of October 9th and enclosures referred to therein in reply are also enclosed, wherein it is suggested that if funds to the extent of $750.00, additional to the $1,675.00 available, could be provided, the matter of outside painting be left in abeyance, the work above mentioned be carried out and in addition the covering of the boy's playroom, exclusive of the store room, with asphalt tile be attended to. The above mentioned expenditures will not provide for repairs to the school residence referred to in Mr. Caldwell's letter of October 8th and covered in detail in Mr. Coleman's letter of May 8th to me which I discussed with you while in Ottawa. I am inclined to agree with the Reverend Principal's comments with respect to maintenance of this building and would recommend that if funds additional to the $1,675 available could be provided as much of the work as possible be carried out this year in the order suggested.\n\nFor D.

C.\n\nAlberni Residential School\nRepairs & Equipment\n\nWith reference to your letter of Oct. 4th, File: 216-18-5348 regarding repairs and material required for the Alberni Residential School, I have discussed this with Mr. Caldwell, and the enclosed is his report.\n\nIt is noted that Mr. Caldwell would prefer to have the boys' playroom floor covered instead of the painting outside. In your breakdown of items, the cost of outside painting allows $144.00. The covering of the boys' playroom, exclusive of store room, with asphalt tile, as estimated in Mr. Unsworth's memorandum, would be approximately $820.00, without supervision and contingencies. This would be $750.00 above the allotted amount, even if the outside painting was not included.\n\nMy recommendation would be to follow your suggestion, to which Mr. Caldwell agrees, that is to have the painting and minor repairs, kitchen floor, boys' and girls' lavatory floors attended to.\n\nIf additional funds are made available, the following would be the order of priority:\n1. Floor in Boys' wing, Store room, and Lockers.\n2. Main and Staff dining room, and passage.\n3. Dish washing unit.\n\nN. W. Gerrard\nActg.

The estimates included the minimum of repairs and equipment required this year. It was not anticipated that the covering of the floors would come out of the repair estimates as this requirement has been on requisition for more than two years, with nothing appropriated for this purpose last year.\n\nYou mention the Commissioner's suggestion that the painting and the covering of the kitchen floors would about cover the amount of the present appropriation. I have nothing better to suggest. As it is so late in the season for painting outside, with the probability of the rainy season starting anytime, I would prefer to have had the boys' playroom floors covered instead of the painting, as the boys will spend most of the winter in these playrooms. I do not know whether this substitution would remain within the appropriation.\n\nMay I point out at this time that more plaster has fallen from the walls of the residence sitting room, owing to the dampness. It is likely from the present appearance that the plaster above the baseboards on the outside walls of the residence will all be off before another year. I have had every representative from the power and water Bureau that has visited here in the last two years examine this condition and have myself reported it, but nothing has been done. The only concern I have is the economic waste in permitting a valuable building, such as this is to deteriorate with no fixed annual appropriation for upkeep. If the whole of the present requisition for repair and equipment ($4700.00) were spent on repairs alone, it would only represent about 2% of the cost of the building, and this is a small percentage for maintenance. I would be glad, in the interests of Government property, if you would please point this out to the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Garrard, Esq., Acting Indian Agent, Alberni, B.C.\n\nI would refer to your letter of September 10th in connection with materials required for minor repairs at the Alberni Indian Residential School. With some difficulty owing to the involved nature of your submission it has been ascertained, following receipt of further quotations from wholesalers in Vancouver, that the paint and the materials for the farmer's cottage and material for general repairs will cost approximately $450.00, and as the total amount available for repairs both major and minor to the Alberni School this year is only $1675 it is thought that the Principal might wish to review the question of repairs and equipment necessary in order that priority may be given to the repairs most urgently required.\n\nFollowing is a breakdown of the cost of repairs and equipment necessary:\n\nAmount Allotted...........................................$1675.00\n\nFloors:\nGirl's recreation 2.50\nStaff Dining Room (Remove Linoleum)\nKitchen and Boy's Lavatory 1124.00\nStorage room and Boy's Play room & Locker\nStaff & Main Dining Rooms,\nPassage, Boy's and Girl's entr. to dining room and area at foot of stairs\nGirl's Lavatory 2280.00 16.00\n\nPainting and Minor repairs:\nInterior wall paint 133.70 13.75\n\n$ 3574.95\nPainting & Minor Repairs (Cont'd):\n\nOutside paint 134.00\nBrushes 27.12\nFarmer's cottage-shingles & nails 59.50\nPlumbing & general repairs 9.90\nDish Washing & sterilizing unit 34.98\n\n$ 4767.50 $3092.50\n\nYou will observe that the amount of funds available will nowhere near meet the requirements for all repairs and possibly the Principal might like to have the painting and minor repairs attended to and the girl's recreation room floor, kitchen and boy's lavatory floors and girl's lavatory floor, the cost of these items being approximately $1600. Please discuss the matter with Mr. Caldwell as soon as possible and let me have his comments and your recommendation in duplicate, following which the matter will be referred to the Department. It might be advisable for the Principal to list all requirements in the way of repairs and equipment in order of priority on the chance that the Department might have additional funds available this year.\n\nFor D.

These refer to a report of Sept. 9th, regarding the replacement of the water mains at the Alberni School. We do not appear to have received a copy of this report.\n\nThe last information that we have on file regarding the water mains is Mr. Mill's memorandum of March 21st, 1946. On this memorandum there was a notation as follows:-\n\n\"Mr. Hoey - For your information. The action suggested in the last two paragraphs of Mr. Mill's memorandum has been approved, as it is very desirable that no water be carried in pipes under the basement floor. There is no record of this in any of our plans and we are asking Mr. Cornish, who was Resident Engineer during most of the construction work, to supply any information he has on this matter.\"\n\nWe are interested in knowing of the report which was obtained from Mr. Cornish.\n\nDirector,\n\nIndian Affairs.

In view of the existing difficulty in securing steel I would suggest that the latter be left in abeyance for at least the present fiscal year.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nWest Coast Agency\nAlberni, B.C.\nSept. 25, 1946\n\nD.M.

Undoubtedly they should be in a position where they can be observed without causing too great damage, and additional shut offs installed to facilitate repairs without cutting off the whole system.\n\nThis work, if it is to be undertaken, should be done in the School holidays; and as Mr. Unsworth recommended, would require the services of a competent plumber to inspect and submit proposals as to the most suitable way of having this done.\n\nN.W.

The drag saw is available at a cost of $247.50, and repairs to the electric motor cost $114.00. A. L. Caldwell's letter of February 26th, in this connection is enclosed, and if funds are available it is recommended that the necessary expenditures be approved.\n\nI might say, that we have been successful in arranging for a construction of a new outside case for the washer locally at an approximate cost of $55.00, which is $45.00 less than the amount authorized.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nFeb. 25th, 1947.\n\nMr. N. Garrard,\nIndian Agent,\nAlberni, B.C.\n\nRe: Special requisitions, 1946-7 appropriation.\n\nDear Mr. Garrard,\n\nHerewith are two special requisitions which I would be obliged if provision could be made for them out of the balance of the 1946-47 appropriation for equipment and repairs. An explanation follows.\n\nRewinding and repair of 5.H.P. laundry motor: This is the main laundry motor, and continuous dampness has deteriorated the wiring and the bearings until they must be replaced. This motor is, of course, used six days a week, and has been in service a long time. The whole operation of the laundry depends on the good condition of this motor.\n\nPower drag saw: The steam boiler, which is in continuous use for laundry and domestic hot-water purposes, is fired by wood, no provision having been made for an automatic stoker. We have wood on the property, but the continuous winter operations of one man and several boys can do no more than keep wood supply for this boiler. We have logs equivalent to approximately 1000 cords of wood piled on the right-of-way recently transferred from our property to the new Pulp Mill for the conveyance of water power. These logs are conveniently situated for \"bucking\" with a saw. A few weeks work with a power drag saw would provide us with a year's supply of wood for the steam boiler. This could be stacked and partially dried. Employment of local Indians to cut cordwood has entailed an expense of $2.50 per cord, if local Indian labour could be obtained. The purchase of this saw is therefore requested.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.E. Caldwell,\nPrincipal.\nAIR MAIL.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI am enclosing a letter dated February 27th, from Rev. A.E. Caldwell, in connection with the erection of three or four poles for the conveyance of electric power to the new class-rooms, and to the work-shop and barns at the Alberni Residential School.\n\nIt will be noted, that according to information received by Mr. Caldwell, no provision has been made in the contract for this installation. It is presumed that the Department will arrange to have the Surveys and Engineering Branch attend to this in due course.\n\nD. H.

The National Utilities inform me that this extension will require to be undertaken by the Department as the Utilities are not responsible for such installation on private property.\n\nI understand from the Government engineer who is in charge of the class-room construction that no provisions have been made in the contract for this installation.

In this regard Major MacKay writes as follows:\n\n\"The Principal has requested purchase of floor coverings for the dining room, kitchen and other sections of the basement in accordance with Mr. Unsworth's report dated September 19, 1946.\"\n\nReverend Mr. A.H. Caldwell, Principal of the Alberni School has also written as follows:\n\n\"In view of the fact that nothing has been done to the basement floor and that the remaining amount of the grant would do very little towards recovering these floors, may I request that the balance of the appropriation be spent on paint and also replastering of the walls in the residence where dampness has caused plaster to fall. No action has been taken regarding the overcoming of the dampness causing the falling of the plaster in the residence, although several reports have been made and the condition has been examined by three Department engineers at different times.\"\nWe do not appear to have received a copy of Mr. Unsworth's report to which Major MacKay refers.\n\nOur file does not indicate any previous correspondence regarding the condition of the principal's residence.\n\nWe are aware from previous correspondence, that there was some trouble in connection with water beneath the basement floors. We are anxious to know if this condition has been remedied; if not, what action you consider should be taken.\n\nYou will note that the principal considers that we should purchase a large amount of linoleum to recover the basement floors. We hesitate to do so unless we are assured that there will be no more trouble with the water.\n\nWe would appreciate it if you would let us have a complete report regarding the above matters.\n\nDirector\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, February 21st, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWe have your letter of the 13th inst., with reference to the Alberni Indian Residential School. The Department approves the following expenditures:\n\n1. Paint and materials for general repairs - $450.00\n\n2. New outside case for Beaver Laundry Washer - approximately $100.00\n\nIt has not been our practice to either purchase or repair trucks or cars at Residential Schools. Under these circumstances I am not prepared to authorize replacement of the engine in the school truck.\n\nRegarding the dish washing and sterilizing unit; we have not previously supplied this type of equipment. It is no doubt, most desirable to supply labour-saving equipment at our residential schools and we have recently brought the matter to the attention of the Minister. As soon as he makes a decision we will advise you further. In the meantime I regret that we cannot authorize purchase of the unit requested by Mr. Caldwell.\n\nWe are bringing to the attention of the Surveys and Engineering Branch, paragraph five of your letter and also the contents of the letter forwarded to Indian Agent Garrard by Mr. Caldwell.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nAIR MAIL\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nWith further reference to Mr. Neary's letter of July 17, 1946 advising that an amount of $1075. is available for repairs and new equipment at the Alberni School, I wrote you under date of October 11th recommending certain expenditures but do not appear to have received a reply.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Garrard has again written regarding this matter enclosing letters received from the Reverend Principal, copies of which are attached. Mr. Caldwell visited this office following receipt of Mr. Garrard's letter and asked that consideration be given to the following listed requirements at the School:\n\n1. Replacement of engine in the school truck - $350.20\n\n2. Paint and material for general repairs - $450.00\n\n3. New outside case for Beaver Laundry washer, Type V3240, wooden parts only. The cost of this replacement is not immediately available, but is roughly estimated at $100.00.\n\n4. Purchase of a steam dish washing and sterilizing unit. Mr. Caldwell is making inquiries regarding the cost of this unit and the information will be forwarded when available.\n\n5. Purchase of floor coverings for the dining room, kitchen and other sections of the basement in accordance with Mr. Unsworth's report dated September 18, 1946. Mr. Caldwell\nstates that laying the floor coverings will have to be held in abeyance until the school closer for the summer holidays, but it is considered that the materials should be purchased now to the extent of funds available, and that if funds to the amount of \u00a3460, which is the cost estimated by Mr. Unsworth, are not available and provision has not been made in next year's estimates a supplementary appropriation should be provided for this purpose.\n\nAs we are nearing the end of the fiscal year it would be appreciated if the Department would advise by air mail if it will be in order to proceed with items one to four, inclusive, providing the total cost does not exceed the amount of \u00a3175 which the Department has already advised is available.\n\nD.

He could not think of the address where this material could be obtained, but it is possible that he could find this.\n\nMr. Caldwell has advised me that he will be over in Vancouver shortly and will discuss these matters with you.\n\nN.

Garrard,\nIndian Agent,\nALBERNI, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Garrard,\n\nFurther to my correspondence of this date regarding the use of the appropriation of $1675.00, which was granted to this school for repairs and maintenance for 1946-47, I have submitted requisitions for emergency expense. In view of the fact that nothing has been done to the basement floors, and that the remaining amount of grant would do very little towards the recovering of these floors, may I now request that the balance of the appropriation be spent on paint estimated for, and also in the replastering of walls in the residence where dampness has caused the plaster to fall. In this latter connection please refer to my letter to you of October 8th last.\n\nI cannot emphasize too strongly that, for the good appearance and the economical upkeep of the school buildings, this painting and repairs should be done. If the paint is supplied now out of this appropriation, the work can be done during the summer vacation. No action has been taken regarding the overcoming of the dampness causing the falling of the plaster in the residence, although several reports have been made and the condition has been examined by three Department engineers at different times.\n\nI am anxious that this excellent building should not be permitted to deteriorate to such a condition as to be a discredit to the school and the Department. However, it is manifestly impossible for the school to undertake upkeep and repairs out of present school revenue.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nAlberni Indian Residential School\nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA\n\nPrincipal\nA.

Garrard,\nIndian Agent,\nALBERNI, B.C.\n\nRe: 1946-7 estimates.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to my letter to you of October 8th last complying with your request that we recommend to you the best method of spending the amount of $1675.00, an appropriation which had been granted by the Department on estimates for the year for repairs and maintenance amounting to $4787.56, I have heard nothing further regarding the disposition of this appropriation.\n\nI recommend that as much as possible be done on the covering of the basement floors. It is possible that the Department has been unable to obtain materials or labour for this work. It is now getting towards the end of the fiscal year and two emergencies have occurred which could take up a part of the appropriation.\n\nOne is the replacing of the engine in the Fargo truck which belongs to the school and which is in constant use. The truck has completely broken down mechanically, bearings being worn out and the crankshaft and other parts needing replacement. The Service man, Mr. Allen, has advised me that this truck was in poor shape mechanically when I took it over and he recommends putting a new engine (which is obtainable) in the truck, as being more satisfactory than making temporary repairs. I am submitting a requisition with the costs, with a request that this expense be taken out of the $1675.00 grant for last year, and that the necessary authority for the expense be granted as soon as possible so that the truck can be put in commission again.\n\nThe second emergency is for the replacement of the wooden water barrel of the larger laundry washer. The smaller washer required this replacement two years ago, and now the barrel of the larger washer has rotted through practically all round. These washing machines are in constant use. I am submitting a requisition for this also.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nAlberni Indian Residential School\nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA\n\nPrincipal\nA. E. CALDWELL\n\nALBERNI, B.C.\n\nFeb. 3rd 1947.\n\nMr. N. Garrard,\nIndian Agent,\nALBERNI, B.C.\n\nRe: Floor Covering (Basement)\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMay I again attract your attention to the condition of the basement floors in this school. As you know the linoleum was removed from the floors of the kitchens, the dining rooms and the boys playrooms more than two years ago. The two small playrooms, accommodating some 115 boys, all of whom are necessarily gathered there during the wet weather of the Coast winter, are, by reason of dust, a menace to the health of the boys. It is impossible to keep these floors clean.\n\nThe cement floors of the kitchens and the dining room are particularly hard on staff members who are compelled to work on these floors from six o'clock in the morning to seven at night. I have had a turn-over of seven or eight staff members in this Department since the beginning of the term, because of the physical strain of working on cement floors. This has been pointed out to Department and Power and Water Branch officials a number of times.\n\nI note that an estimate of $3400.00 has been made on the recovering of these floors. This item was not placed in the estimates for the current year as it was thought it would be taken care of out of last year's appropriation.\n\nMay I therefore request that a special estimate be placed before the Department for this work...... which is actually a building replacement project and, in my opinion, should not be classed as maintenance... so that appropriation can be made and the work done during the months of July and August 1947.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nMarch 17, 1947.\n\nRe: Residential School,\nWest Coast Indian Agency,\nAlberni, B.C.\n\nWith further reference to the subject of drainage at the above as outlined in our memorandum to you of December 28th last, it has become evident through subsequent correspondence with Messrs. Walker and Gurney that changes of which this office was not informed were made from the original drainage plans and specifications at the time the building was erected.\n\nIn view of the uncertainty as to the location of existing drainage lines, etc., within the building, it was decided to have Mr. Hargreaves of our Architectural Division carry out an examination of the drainage system, in addition to an inspection of the plumbing installation and heating system while on his present western trip.\n\nWe have now received a telegram from Mr. Hargreaves from Alberni in which he recommends the installation of new 6\" vitrified sewer line with manhole as previously suggested by Mr. Gurney, which would carry all laundry and kitchen waste (which at present discharges into a creek bed on the reserve) to a point where it could be connected with the effluent line from the septic tank which discharges into the Somass River. This would eliminate all school drainage from flowing through the adjacent Indian Reserve which has been the cause of complaints.\n\nMr. Brown, the contractor for the Day School building now under construction, has offered to install the proposed new sewer line complete for a sum of $1000.00 if authorized immediately. Mr. Hargreaves states that he considers the price reasonable, and he recommends the immediate acceptance of Mr. Brown's offer.\n\nNo funds have been made available by the Indian Affairs Branch for such work and it could not be completed before the end of the current fiscal year, but as the work is of an urgent nature and Mr. Brown's offer is contingent upon early acceptance, it is suggested that Indian Affairs be requested to authorize as soon as possible an expenditure up to $1,100.00 to cover operations and contingencies out of funds for the fiscal year commencing April 1st.\n\nUpon receipt of approval of this expenditure, we will wire Mr. Gurney to have the contractor proceed with the work.\n\nJ.M.

UNSWORTH\n\nC. E. Webb,\nDistrict Chief Engineer\n\nVancouver, B.C.\nSeptember 19, 1946\nVancouver, B.C.,\n19 September, 1946.\n\nMemorandum to Mr. Webb:\n\nRe: Floor Covering in Dining Room\nand Kitchen of Alberni Indian Residential School, Alberni, B.C.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn accordance with your instructions of August 8, 1946, file 35615-1, I visited the Alberni Indian residential School, 3 miles north-west of Alberni, B.C., on August 9th and inspected the dining room and kitchen floors, and other sections of the basement floor with the object of covering them with a suitable surface.\n\nThere are some 220 children and staff at this school. The dining room and kitchen are in the basement.\n\nOriginal Floor Coverings\n\nAt the time the school was built (1940) the basement floors were covered with linoleum and by October 1944 much of this linoleum was removed because of deterioration of the bond and linoleum. This was due to leaks which developed in water mains under the floor and also to the inherent characteristic of concrete to pass a very slight amount of moisture when laid on the ground.\n\nSketch 1, taken from Mr. Warren's Memorandum to Mr. Webb, re \"Repairs carried out at Alberni Indian Residential School and report on Inspections\" shows the condition of floor coverings in October, 1944.\n\nSketch 2 shows the condition of the floor coverings August 1946. Though the linoleum in the\nstaff dining room is still in place, it is bulged, torn and rotten and should be removed. The linoleum in the girls' recreation room is still fairly good and needs only re-cementing in a few places.\n\nA layer of linoleum cement is still on much of the floor in particular as indicated in sketch 2.\n\nThe uncovered floor in the boys' lavatory is very uneven and does not slope toward drains. The concrete floor in the boys' play room is slightly worn and tends to be very dusty.\n\nRecommendations\n\nIt is recommended that:\n\n1. The linoleum in the girls' recreation room be left intact and re-cemented where required. This re-cementing can be done by school maintenance. Estimated cost of linoleum cement 1 gal. @ $2.50.\n\n2. The linoleum be removed from staff dining room. Labor being supplied by school.\n\n3. A floor surface be laid of 4\" thick red quarry tile in 6\" squares, over cleaned concrete in the kitchens and boys' lavatory. The boys' lavatory floor is very uneven and does not drain toward floor drains. It will be necessary to chip this floor and regrade with respect to drainage before laying tile. (See sketch 3)\n\nThe estimated cost for this surface laid in school, including preparation of concrete surface, trimming doors, raising two water closets, etc. is $1124.00. (See Appendix I)\n4. A floor surface be laid of 3/16\" asphalt tile (similar to or of Ace-tex or Tremco asphalt floor tile) of brown color in storage room and boys' play and locker rooms, and of a light veined color in dining rooms, boys' and girls' entrance to dining room, and foot of stair cases and passage. (See sketch 5). The estimated cost for this surface laid in the school including trimming of doors is $2280. (See Appendix II)\n\n5. The girls' lavatory floor be painted with a good quality concrete floor paint. Area 210 sq. ft. (See sketch 5) 1 gallon @ $8.00 plus labor $16.00.\n\nSummary\n\n| Recommendation | Area | Surface | Estimated Cost | Appendix |\n|----------------|------|---------|----------------|----------|\n| 1              | Girls' Recreation | Present linoleum repaired | 2.50 |          |\n| 2              | Staff Dining Room | Remove linoleum | 0.00 |          |\n| 3              | Kitchen and Boys' Lavatory | 2\" red Quarry | 1124.00 | I |\n| 4              | Storage room and Boys' play & locker rooms | 3/16\" medium brown asphalt tile | 2280.00 | II |\n|                | Staff & Main Dining Rooms, Passage, Boys' & Girls' entrance to Dining Room and area at foot of stairs | 3/16\" light colored veined asphalt tile |          |          |\n| 5              | Girls' Lavatory | Paint | 16.00 |          |\n\nTOTAL $3422.50\nNOTES:\n\n1. Water must not lay on asphalt tiles.\n\n2. Asphalt tiles must not be washed with a lye soap. Tile manufacturers recommend a special soap at $2.50 per gal. in five gal. lots. They consider washing once a month ample in most cases.\n\n3. Asphalt tiles may be waxed with a special wax recommended by tile manufacturers. This wax costs about $3.75 a gal. in 5 gallon lots. Asphalt tiles can be waxed and polished to a high lustre, however, avoid polishing to a slippery surface.\n\nA.

The immediate trouble was rectified but was considered only temporary relief. Our proposed action in having buried piping replaced by overhead piping was approved in your memorandum of March 29th, 1946 and it was our intention to have our supervising officer on the new classroom building obtain estimates while that building was under construction. However September had arrived before we had an officer at Alberni, and in letters dated September 25th and September 30th, 1946 from Indian Agent Gerrard and Commissioner MacKenzie respectively, copies of which accompanied Mr. Hoey's memorandum to you dated October 8th last, both officers stated their opinion that the work, which would interrupt school routine, should not be undertaken until the summer holidays of 1947.\n\nJ.M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nAs it was known that our engineer Mr. Hargreaves would have to carry out an inspection in the West, as soon as arrangements could be made, no instructions regarding the matter were issued to our field officers. Mr. Hargreaves will obtain data on how much work will be involved, and will include an estimate of cost in his report. Recommendations will be forwarded and if approved, the necessary drawings can be prepared, and tenders invited. If funds can be made available, and the tenders received are satisfactory, work can be undertaken during the vacation period. Meanwhile, except for the inconvenience of shutting off the whole water supply system while minor repairs to taps etcetera are being made, no trouble is being occasioned.\n\n(c) Certain areas carrying heavy traffic, were originally covered with battleship linoleum. Evidences of decay and poor adhesion of the linoleum, led to the conviction that moisture was present below the slab. Some of the linoleum was taken up, following which evidence of dampness disappeared. The dampness in the slab may have been caused by leakage from buried piping, (not in accordance with specifications) or surface water finding its way under the slab. In any event it is not considered advisable to take any action on re-covering the concrete floors with any new type of finish until the sub-slab water lines have been replaced by overhead piping, and the result observed. We can suggest no date, at present when, under the circumstances, the floors should be recovered, since observation of results obtained by the removal of buried piping will take considerable time.\n\nIn this connection we are forwarding herewith a copy of Mr. Unsworth's report of September 19th, 1946, to which Mr. Hoey makes reference. Since Mr. Webb's covering letter states that copies were forwarded to Commissioner MacKay it is likely that other copies have reached the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\n(d) Water infiltration to the Principal's Residence, which has affected plaster and paintwork, is a matter that must be viewed and reported on by a waterproofing specialist. The most recent comment on this item was contained in a letter from Inspector Coleman to Commissioner MacKay dated May 9th, 1946, a copy of which accompanied Mr. Hoey's memorandum to you dated June 25th, 1946.\n\nIt is obvious that buildings of masonry construction built in coastal areas, where extremely heavy and violent rainstorms cause as great horizontal precipitation as vertical, special consideration must be given to waterproofing of exterior walls no matter what additional cost is involved. The residential schools at both Alert Bay in British Columbia, and Shubenacadie in Nova Scotia are examples of what can happen when such precautions are not observed. At Alberni where some precautions were taken, they were evidently not sufficient to prevent surface absorption finding its way through the bricks, or salt action from causing deterioration to brick and stone jointing.\nIt is our recommendation regarding future action at Alberni that:\n\n(1) Following Mr. Hargreaves return, and when drawings and specifications have been prepared, funds be provided to carry out the necessary modifications to the water supply and plumbing system which have already been approved, as well as any other repairs in that system which have become evident after six years of service.\n\n(2) Upon completion of (1), a reasonable period (probably a year) be allowed during which it can be determined whether buried piping has been responsible for dampness in the basement areas formerly covered by linoleum, or whether other causes become evident. During the observation period, funds should be made available for re-covering such areas, as have never been subject to dampness, with quarry tile, asphalt tile or other covering as approved. Use should be made of the interval, to make sure all evidence of dirt, grease, or old linoleum adhesive is removed from the cement floors. Not until such areas as were formerly affected by dampness, have been satisfactorily treated should they be covered by any type of material.\n\n(3) It will not be possible to defer the repairs to plaster and paintwork, made necessary by damp walls, until the cause of trouble is remedied. Even at the risk of having to repeat such repairs it is not reasonable to subject the school principal to the conditions reported.\n\nInvestigation of a means of protecting all exterior walls from continued infiltration of moisture will be undertaken as soon as possible, but as previously stated, the investigation and, if funds are made available, rectification of the condition will be a lengthy and probably expensive procedure.\n\nAn estimate based upon data secured at the building, and from drawings which will be prepared by Mr. Hargreaves will be forwarded to you, in connection with the water supply system as soon as it can be prepared.\n\nIt must be pointed out again however, that the volume of work which faces our inadequate Architectural staff, and which includes the Indian Affairs and National Parks 1947-48 programme, must be borne in mind when considering the time factor.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nEncl.\n\nMr. Hoey: 18\n\nRe your memorandum of March and previous correspondence and for your information, copies of Mr. Webb's letter of September 24, 1946 and Mr. Unsworth's report of September 19, 1946 herewith Mr. Mills' recommendation concurred in.\n\n21/3/47\n\nIndian Affairs.

Our Chief Treasury Officer has already been advised that $12,500 of the 1946-47 Appropriation is to be made available again to your Branch as soon as possible.\n\nOTTAWA, April 1st, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n11/4/47\n\nRe - Alberni Indian Residential School\nVote 76-64-877\n\nIn connection with the above project, the Indian Affairs Branch made available to this Service the sum of $32,438.00.\n\nEstimated expenditures to be paid from the 1946-47 appropriation is $19,928.00, leaving an unexpended balance of $12,500.00. This unexpended balance may now be released to the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nIt was anticipated that the contractor would have been able to complete this project within the 1946-47 fiscal year, but due to the existing condition in the building materials market, even though he has no control and the failure of supply houses to make deliveries, as promised, the school will not likely be completed before the latter part of May.\n\nTo complete the contract, therefore, funds will be required from the Indian Affairs 1947-48 Estimates as follows:\n\nBalance of payments on contract including extra work orders and holdback - $14,350\nContingencies and supervision - $1,435\n\n$15,785\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nJ.M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nI am enclosing herewith Reports of the inspections of boilers and machinery made by Mr. J. E. Halsall, Boiler Inspector of the Dominion Department of Public Works, at the Alberni Indian Residential School.\n\nCopies of Certificates covering the Boilers at the above-mentioned School are also enclosed.\n\nCopies of the aforementioned enclosures have been forwarded to the Indian Agent concerned; and Certificates have been sent to the Principal of the Alberni School for posting in the boiler room at the School.\n\nThe Agent has been requested to take up with the Principal any remarks in the Reports on Boilers and Machinery that should be brought to his attention.\n\nFor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nApril 11, 1947.\n\nMemorandum\n\nRe: Alberni Indian Residential School\nVancouver Island, B.C.\n\nIn accordance with our memorandum of February 4th, 1947 to Mr. Walker, our Mr. Hargreaves visited the above school and carried out an inspection of the mechanical services on March 13th and 15th inclusive. The following summary outlines the result of these investigations:\n\nThe main drain from the building, excepting the sanitary line to the septic tank, at present discharges into a slough on an adjacent Indian reserve. The proposed diversion, outlined by Mr. Walker was studied at the job and found to be practical. Following approval by the Indian Affairs Branch, on recommendation by this Service, instructions have been issued to have this work carried out by the Contractor building the new Classroom building, thus taking advantage of Mr. Brown's favourable price of $1000, as well as to have the additional advantage of Mr. Gurney's supervision.\n\nRegarding the plumbing at the school, that part of the cold water main, serving the various fixture groups, was found to be buried in cinder fill under the concrete slab. Portions of this line have given trouble, due to rapid corrosion occasioned by the sulphuric content in the cinder fill attacking the water lines. These temporary repairs have caused great inconvenience to all concerned and this condition of rapid deterioration will become progressively worse.\n\nMost of the hot and cold water risers to the fixture groups were found, after much difficulty, buried in masonry partitions; and in only a few cases were valved.\n\nComplaints were received regarding the lack of hot water. The storage tank was found to be ample in size but the coil capacity was found to be entirely inadequate. While it was not possible to remove the coil for minute inspection, it can be conservatively assumed that it can heat water at the rate not in excess of 200 gallons per hour. A steam line from the high pressure boiler serves this coil through a pressure reducing valve and the pressure carried is in excess of good practice, 25 pounds per square inch being noted on the gauge. On account of the lack of hot water, high pressure lines have been connected to the laundry washers to help heat the water. This practice will shorten the life of these items of laundry equipment.\n\nJ.M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6434, File 877-5, part 8)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nThe high pressure boiler is in relatively good condition except for normal requirements concerning brick work replacements in the furnace.\n\nWith the addition of a stoker under this boiler and a proper sized indirect heater, the hot water shortage could be overcome.\n\nMany other items, dealing with floor coverings, suspected infiltration of moisture through the basement floor slab, were investigated and full details obtained. Since the latter are items apart from the mechanical requirements, it is felt that a separate commentary dealing with such other matters would be in order. This will be supplied in the near future.\n\nOur recommendations are summarized as follows:\n\n1. Provide a new set of cold water mains and branch mains suspended from Basement ceiling.\n\n2. Connect existing cold water risers to the new cold water main breaking into partitions where necessary and valving branch connections.\n\n3. Connect hot water risers to existing hot water main at basement ceiling and provide valves for branch connections.\n\n4. Provide new stoker for existing high pressure boiler and replace fire brick where necessary. The use of a stoker would permit the use of similar fuel for all boilers instead of two varieties as at present.\n\n5. Provide new indirect steam fed heater in storage tank, giving capacity to heat water at the rate of 1000 gallons per hour.\n\n6. Connect high pressure steam line through existing pressure reducing valve to this heater.\n\n7. Connect existing temperature regulating valve to this hook-up.\n\n8. Move stairs in Boiler Room to permit installation of stoker.\n\nThe first three items above, are those which were approved in Mr. Hoey's memorandum of March 29th last. The remainder are the outcome of our officer's inspection. It is felt however that all operations should be carried out at the same time, and that approval of the additional items should be obtained.\n\nIf funds for the work can be made available, drawings and specifications could be prepared and tenders obtained during the summer holiday period.\n\nChief Engineer.\nMay 16th, 1947.\n\nMr. Hoey\n\nRe: Alberni Indian Residential School\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of May 7th relative to the above, the statement attributed to the Principal of the School that no inspection had been made is not understood as Mr. Hargreaves of our Engineering and Construction Service made an inspection March 13th to 15th, inclusive.\n\nEnclosed, for your information, is a copy of Mr. Mills' memorandum, dated April 11th, last, reporting upon Mr. Hargreaves' inspection.\n\nIt is recommended that the work covered by the items numbered 1. to 8. in Mr. Mills' memorandum be proceeded with.

As you are probably aware, the new sewer has been constructed with manhole and grease trap from the boiler room to the outlet from the septic tank. This was supplied at a cost of $1,028.08.\n\nOn May 31st, we transferred an amount of $3,300. to the Surveys and Engineering Branch in order that they might carry out the following work:\n\n1. Provide a new set of cold water mains and branch mains suspended from Basement ceiling.\n\n2. Connect existing cold water risers to the new cold water main breaking into partitions where necessary and valving branch connections.\n\n3. Connect hot water risers to existing hot water main at basement ceiling and provide valves for branch connections.\n\n4. Provide new stoker for existing high pressure boiler and replace fire brick where necessary. The use of a stoker would permit the use of similar fuel for all boilers instead of two varieties as at present.\n\n5. Provide new indirect steam fed heater in storage tank, giving capacity to heat water at the rate of 1000 gallons per hour.\n6. Connect high pressure steam line through existing pressure reducing valve to this heater.\n\n7. Connect existing temperature regulating valve to this hook-up.\n\n8.

Gurney\nAsst. Engineer.\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAlberni Residential School is situated on the south bank of the Somass River about 1 1/2 miles west of main business section of the City of Alberni. The corporation limits of the City of Alberni extend along the north bank of the river to a point about 300 yards west of the Residential School. During the past few years residences have been constructed along the north bank to the Alberni City Limits. A children's playground and swimming beach has been opened just inside the city limits and a short distance up stream from the Residential School sewerage outlet. Residents of houses built along the north bank have been observed bathing in the river in front of their property almost the whole distance to the main section of Alberni.\n\nThe Opetchisht Indian Reserve adjoins the grounds of the Residential School to the west and the children from the Reserve often swim in the river about 200 yards to the west. A dairy farm occupies the property to the east of the School and from what can be learned no swimming is allowed in the river along this section of the south bank.\n\nGENERAL SANITARY CONDITIONS\n\nFrom careful observation and from inquiries it is learned that all houses adjoining the Somass River from Port Alberni to the western limits of Alberni are either equipped with outside latrines or septic tanks. Almost without exception the effluent from the septic tanks is discharged into the Somass River without any other treatment. Several houses built on floats are anchored along the north bank and these float-houses are served with outside latrines which empty directly into the Somass River.\n\nThe District Health Department Sanitary Officer has been interviewed and the existence of these latrines and effluent outlets were pointed out to this officer. It was further pointed out that while these sources of contamination were allowed to exist it seemed useless to construct the expensive treatment beds suggested by this officer.\n\nThe existence of these other sources of contamination were admitted. From my conversation with the inspector it was gathered that the sewage disposal problem in both Alberni and Port Alberni was deplorable. It was admitted that his Department were not making much progress in cleaning up such nuisances in Alberni. It was gathered that when the Health District was organized, the City of Alberni made a stipulation that the City would not be required to make any monetary outlay to assist in remedial measures. It would seem that authority in this matter is limited to interviewing householders in an attempt to have these parties agree to correct the nuisances voluntarily.\n\nPROVINCIAL REQUIREMENTS\n\nThe Sanitary Inspector was of the opinion that the Indian Affairs Branch should construct a tile disposal field patterned after the sketches attached. It was brought to the Inspectors' notice that certain features of this type of disposal would be difficult to overcome and an endeavour was made to get additional information on alternative systems which would be acceptable to his\nacceptable to his Department and which would be the cheapest and most satisfactory to this Department. No information on this subject could be obtained but the Inspector promised to write to the Sanitary Engineer of his Department and obtain his opinion. At time of writing this report this information has not been received.\n\nDISPOSAL BED.\n\nAn investigation was made into the possibility of constructing a disposal bed as recommended by the Provincial Board of Health B.C. on property at the Alberni Residential School.\n\nThe only ground available for a bed of the size required lies between the school building and the Somass River. This land is shown in red on the map attached. The Board of Health requires 70' of tile per five persons. Figured on this basis it will require 3500 feet of tile and laid out in runs of 100' which is the longest run possible will require an area 200' x 175'. The ground available comprises the choicest piece of garden land on the school property and is under constant cultivation as a kitchen garden.\n\nThis land lies about 7' above high tide level and during the spring floods and winter rains is frequently flooded. The sub-soil consists mainly of fine sand. The black top soil is about one foot deep.\n\nThe main objections to construction of a disposal bed are as follows:\n\n(a) The possibility of the surplus sand excavated spoiling the land for garden purposes.\n(b) The periods of high water and floods which would cause the system to be inoperable.\n(c) Fine sand filtering into and plugging up tiles with result that the bed will become useless.\n\nDISCUSSION.\n\nIt is thought that the discharge of effluent into the Somass River by the School sewage system presents a far smaller menace to Public Health conditions in the district than other pollution entering the river closer to those places frequented by swimmers.\n\nIt is considered very unlikely that if it was agreed to construct such a system that labour and material could be secured in the district for the purpose. From experience here this past few months it will be understood that labour and materials are practically non-existent. This disposal bed would require all hand labour and labour willing to perform this type of work is not available. It is estimated that construction of this bed would cost $3600.00 if labour was available.\n\nRECOMMENDATION.\n\nFrom the information received and investigation made it is recommended that construction of the disposal bed be held over for at least one year. It is thought that some method of disinfecting the effluent with chlorine or some other method of treating the effluent could be recommended which would be not only cheaper but less liable to failure.\n\nIt is believed that if this matter discussed with the Department of Public Health at a higher level no objections would be made to the foregoing proposal.\nSTATE OF COST OF POSITIVE OUTLET DISPOSAL SEC\n\nLabour:\n\n3750 lin. ft trench - 935 cu. yds hand excavation @ $1.25 cu.yd. 535.00\nbackfill and grade surplus material 535 cu.yds @ 1.00 535.00\nplace gravel filter 140 cu yds at 1.00 cu.yd. 140.00\nlay 7000 4\" tile @ 6\u00a2 ea. includes handling 560.00\nlay 140 4\" vitrified tile at 20\u00a2 28.00\nallow for connection to present effluent outlet 50.00\n\nMaterial:\n\n7000 lin.ft 4\" field tile @ 13\u00a2 ea. 910.00\n70 4\" vit. head @ 51.60 112.00\n70 4\" vit. pipe @ 1.80 84.00\n140 cu. yds gravel backfill at 2.50 per cu. yd. 350.00\nimprove access site 35.00\nEngineering and supervision, inc. expenses 500.00\n\nTotal: 2422.00\nMr. Hoey\n\nFor your information, please.\n\n21-8-47\n\nAugust 19, 1947.\n\nMemorandum\n\nRe: Floor Coverings, Indian Residential School, Alberni, B.C.\n\nA notation dated the 21st ultimo on Mr. Hoey's memorandum to you on July 16th, 1947, requests a report on Mr. Hoey's request for an opinion on what action should be taken on the School Principal's further urging for floor re-covering.\n\nYou will recall that in our memorandum of March 20th, 1947, to which Mr. Hoey makes reference, we stated our opinion that none of the basement floors should be re-covered before the piping changes, on which Mr. Gurney is now obtaining tenders, had been carried out and a period of observation of the effect of the changes had elapsed.\n\nIn this connection, attention is directed to Item (2), page 3, of our memorandum which suggests certain action that might be taken by the school authorities in preparation for new floor coverings, but no purpose will be served by taking any action before renewal of the piping has been carried out.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nJ.M.

The Department of Mines and Resources Engineer, who is in charge of the new class-room building, had received instructions from his Department at Ottawa to await instructions about further work at the school. Presumably this further work referred to the boiler room improvements and also the re-covering of the basement floors, which, I understand from the letter referred to above, had been turned over to the Engineering Branch for action.\n\nTo date the Engineer has had no further instructions and nothing has been done about the boiler and Engine room repairs.\n\nAt Sept. 1st the steam boiler will need to be in constant use and any repairs, together with the installation of the self-stoker, will be undertaken at some inconvenience. The brick-work of the boiler must be immediately repaired. This should be done at the installation of the self-stoker.\n\nWill you please go into this matter so that as much work as possible can be done before the school term starts.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, August 18th, 1947.\n\nMajor D.

I have discussed this with Mr. Caldwell and he now wishes to have 12 tables and 18 benches of this type for use in the Boys' and Girls' playroom in the evenings when these rooms will be used for library and study hall purposes. I consider the tables satisfactory for this purpose and that the inexpensive benches would serve temporarily until they could be replaced by chairs. I recommended their purchase at the cost advertised as follows:\n\n| Item     | Quantity | Cost |\n|----------|----------|------|\n| Tables   | 12       | $3.95 |\n| Benches  | 18       | $1.00 |\n\nTotal: $65.40\n\nThe Department was requested to grant authority for the purchase of desks for the Alberni Day School in our letter dated August 20th and the Residential School will have sufficient desks if the tables recommended for the primary room as previously recommended are supplied.\n\nR.F.

Tables and chairs are cheaper and in keeping with modern methods. It was the intention of the Principal to equip all of his classrooms with tables and chairs but the School has sufficient desks for the other classes and the large expenditure required to do this does not seem justified.\n\nThe typewriter is to be used for instructional purposes with some of the Grade 9 pupils.\n\nThe film strip projector would prove very useful but, in view of the large requisition from this School, I believe its purchase should be deferred.\n\nThe six tables recommended are to take the place of those which the Principal intended to construct after the Department had supplied expensive material and equipment, the purchase of which I do not recommend.\n\nR.

These would hold towels, shoes, sweaters, books for after school study, etc. You are aware of the present unsightly condition where no lockers are available.\n\nThe making of the lockers would be a project of the manual class.\n\nWe would require 2000 feet of clear cedar lumber of widths 10\" and 12\".\n\nI have received a quotation on this material, (which can be obtained) from Bloedel, Stewart and Welch, Ltd. The price is exceptionally reasonable... $125.00 per Thousand Feet, Board Measure... or $250.00 in all.\n\nI would be glad if you would pass this on to the Commissioner's Office with your recommendation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, October 23, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M.

Under the circumstances replacement by a unit with a larger motor would appear to be preferable to incurring expensive repairs.\n\nMr. Gerrard's letter of October 16th and communication from the Principal dated October 15th are enclosed and if funds can be made available I would recommend that the Department approve an expenditure of $304.75 for the purchase of a new Gilson Air-cooled Condensing Unit complete with motor on the understanding that installation and any other costs will be met by the school management.\n\nD.

In view of the fact that the Surveys and Engineering Branch are responsible for the construction of this building, there is little action that can be taken by this Branch with regard to the bankruptcy of the contractor concerned.\n\nHowever, in view of the fact that we are doing considerable construction of school buildings, we would be interested in hearing the final outcome of this case.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6434, File 877-5, part 10)\nOttawa, November 24, 1947.\n\nMr. Hoey\n\nRE: Alberni Indian Residential School\n\nReference is made to the contract that was let to Mr. W. O. Brown in the matter of the construction of the above noted school. Our file record in this transaction is as follows:\n\n(1) Under date of the 29th August, 1947, the Canadian Western Woodworkers Limited of Victoria advised Indian Affairs that they had supplied the contractor with millwork, etc., to the amount of $3,463 and to date had been unable to receive payment.\n\n(2) The Surveys and Engineering Branch discussed the matter with Mr. K. R. Daly on September 25th who advised that the Department had no strictly legal responsibility.\n\n(3) That the Surveys and Engineering Branch requested their local representative to investigate and suggest to the unpaid sub-contractors that they get together and submit a statement giving the status of their accounts.\n\nWe discussed this matter over the telephone with Mr. C. H. Buck, Chief Architect, on the 21st instant who informed us that the creditors have been organized and appointed a Receiver and that Mr. W. O. Brown is to be declared \"in bankruptcy\". We also understand that Senior Departmental Solicitor, Mr. K. R. Daly, is dealing with the matter on behalf of the Department.\n\nIf any further action is required by the Engineering and Construction Division, please let me know.\n\nDirector.\nTRANSFER BETWEEN ALLOTMENTS\n\nAPPLICATION IS HEREBY MADE TO THE SECRETARY, TREASURY BOARD, FOR THE FOLLOWING TRANSFERS WITHIN:\n\nVOTE: 1947-48\n\n| NAME OF PRIMARY | AUTHORIZED AMOUNT | PROPOSED DECREASE | PROPOSED INCREASE |\n|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|\n| Construction of Buildings and Works | | | |\n| (a) British Columbia - | | | |\n| West Coast Agency: Completion of classroom block at Alberni Residential School | -- | $16,000.00 | |\n| Prince Edward Island - Lennox Island Agency - 2-room school and residence | $18,000.00 | $16,000.00 | |\n\nDEPARTMENTAL EXPLANATION\n\nWhen our 1947-48 Estimates were being prepared, our surveys and Engineering Branch was supervising the construction of a 4-classroom block at the Alberni Residential School. It was anticipated by the Engineers that this work would be completed and that all the accounts would be in by the end of the fiscal year. However, due to a shortage of materials this building was not completed in time to make final payment out of our last year's appropriation. Therefore we request that a part of the amount authorized for the Lennox Island two-room school be used instead for this purpose. We have not been able to make any satisfactory arrangements with the contractor for the construction of this latter school.\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nAPPROVED\n\nAPPROVED\n\nBRANCH HEAD\n\nDEPUTY HEAD\n\nMINISTER\n\nNOTE: APPROVAL OF THE MINISTER IS REQUIRED ONLY WHERE A QUESTION OF POLICY IS INVOLVED.\n\nTREASURY COMMENTS\n\nAccording to the Accounting Records there is no objection to these transfers being made and the application is therefore submitted for the approval of Treasury Board, as required under Section 25 of the Consolidated Revenue and Audit Act.\n\nCHIEF TREASURY OFFICER\n\nFOR COMPTROLLER OF THE TREASURY\n\nT.

(RG 10, Volume 6434, File 877-5, part 10)\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nThe attached requisition covering the supply of fire hose, belting, beds, mattresses and pillows for the Alberni Residential School is being referred to you without calling for tenders as the expenditure will obviously be in excess of $1000 and I am doubtful in view of the expenditures already incurred at the Alberni School whether funds are available. I may say that the fire hose, pillows and mattresses are required as replacements and it is altogether likely that the supply of these items, with the exception of the fire hose, could be left in abeyance until next year if the Department has insufficient funds to meet the cost.\n\nIn view of our previous experience at the Alberni School I feel that the fire hose should be supplied immediately if at all possible. If funds are available tenders will be called for in Vancouver if you wish.\n\nD. F. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nDecember 22, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O.

I also enclose a copy of Indian Commissioner MacKay's reply to Mr. Caldwell.\n\nIn connection with these floors I would refer you to Mr. Mills' memorandum of March 20th, 1947.\n\nI would appreciate it if you would let me know as soon as possible what action you intend to take in regard to the floors.\n\nActing Director.\n\nPP/MGD\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Alberni Residential School\nYour file 159-1-5 (WT 1)\n\nWith reference to Mr. Hoey's letter of December 12th and telephone communication from Mr. J.L. Gibson, M.P., with respect to repairs to the floors and walls at the Alberni Residential School, this matter has been the subject of frequent correspondence with the school Principal and the Department during the past three years. The question of replacing the linoleum on certain sections of basement floors apparently was taken out of the hands of the local officers of the Survey and Engineering branch but was investigated by an official of that branch from Ottawa early this year, reference Mr. Neary's letter of March 3rd last. As a result of the investigation by an official of the Engineering branch, Ottawa, it apparently was decided that a period of about one year should be allowed to elapse following changes to the plumbing under the cement floor slab to determine whether the buried pipe, now disconnected, was responsible for dampness in the basement areas formerly covered by linoleum or whether other causes would become evident.\n\nWith regard to the question of waterproofing the outside walls of the building, this matter was brought to your attention in my letter of July 7th in response to which Mr. Neary advised that no arrangements had been made for waterproofing the outside walls this year.\n\nMr. Caldwell, the Principal of the school is greatly\nconcerned regarding the condition of the basement floors and the effect on his kitchen and dining room staff, his most recent letter of November 17th in this connection being enclosed for your information, together with a copy of my letter of December 5th to him. You will note that the matter has been taken up with the local office of the Survey and Engineering Branch who have agreed to carry out as soon as possible a further examination with a view to determining whether or not it would be advisable to lay new linoleum at the present time and also to investigate and report with respect to waterproofing the outside walls to prevent seepage.\n\nMr. Gibson has not yet been in communication with this office but should an opportunity offer I will advise him of the steps being taken to remedy the conditions complained of at the Alberni School.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nendis.\nDec. 5, 1947.\n\nDear Mr. Caldwell:\n\nRe: Kitchen, Dining Room and Playroom Floors\n\nReplying to your letter of November 17th, the Surveys and Engineering Branch will carry out as soon as possible a further examination of the Alberni School buildings with a view to determining whether or not it would be advisable to lay new linoleum on the above mentioned floors. The problem of seepage through the walls will also be looked into at that time.\n\nWith regard to the memorandum dated March 20th last wherein it was recommended that on completion of changes to the plumbing installation a period of one year be allowed during which it could be determined whether the buried piping was responsible for dampness in the basement areas formerly covered by linoleum, this recommendation did not originate in the local office of the Dominion Water and Power Bureau but apparently in the Ottawa office of that Branch. As a matter of fact Mr. Webb's office had no knowledge of the memorandum until I wrote to them under date of November 25th last. The most recent recommendation from Mr. Webb's office is contained in a report by Mr. Unsworth dated Sept. 13th, 1946, to the effect that certain floor coverings be laid. Since that time the matter has apparently been entirely out of the hands of the local Dominion Water and Power Bureau office who, as far as I can see, have done everything possible to\nsecure suitable floor coverings and any delay in not looking into the matter further cannot be attributed to any lack of action on their part.\n\nMr. Webb has requested me to assure you that he fully appreciates your difficulties and is anxious to do what he can to assist in having the necessary repairs and improvements attended to.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

Allan, with which was enclosed a copy of correspondence from Mr. A.E. Caldwell, School Principal, and Indian Commissioner MacKay, on the subject of the above; our Chief Architect states as follows:\n\n\"It has not yet been definitely determined, notwithstanding the contrary opinion of laymen, whether the leakage of sub-floor water supply lines at the Alberni Residential School, which has now been stopped, was the sole cause of the dampness that appeared in the concrete basement floor slabs.\n\nIt is therefore recommended that no action be taken to permanently finish the floors, from which linoleum was removed, until the spring run-off has shown conclusively whether or not any moisture is liable to penetrate beneath the floor slabs through or under the concrete footings of the external walls.\n\nIf upon examination during that period no dampness is apparent in the concrete floor slabs, it is proposed that the slabs be prepared to receive flexible asbestos-asphalt floor tile laid in accordance with a specification which will be furnished by our Architectural Section.\n\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nBooth Building, 165 Sparks St.,\nOttawa, Ont.\nIf, on the other hand, it is found during the spring run-off that the floor slabs are again showing signs of moisture, it will be evident that there is an infiltration of water from the outside of the building and precautions would have to be taken to prevent such ingress before work in connection with the re-surfacing of basement floors is undertaken.\n\nIt is our intention to request Mr. Webb of the Dominion Water and Power Bureau, Vancouver, to keep himself informed in regard to the condition of the basement floor area and to assign one of his engineers to make inspections as necessary during the coming spring and to report to this office in order that we may issue instructions for whatever action is indicated to be carried out as soon as possible thereafter.\"\n\nDirector.\n| DATE   | SERVICE                                      | AMOUNT |\n|--------|----------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 1948   | VOTE 516,12,415                               |        |\n| Jan. 6 | Bedroom furniture for room to be occupied by Alberni Indian Day School teacher | 137.40 |\n\nComm. letter September 26, 1947, file 16-11-4\n\nRECOMMENDED\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

The Principal complains that he has considerable difficulty retaining kitchen staff because of the cement floors.

One worm has completely gone and that boiler had to be discontinued today. The other is also badly worn and will not last long. In the meantime we are carrying on with the one boiler, which is nearly adequate as long as mild weather continues.\n\nThese worms are for the Iron Firemen Stoker, Size 2, Serial number ... 19077. The agents are Canadian Sumner Iron Works, 3550 East Broadway, Vancouver.\n\nMay I request that both of these worms be replaced immediately as an emergency.

Re: Basement Floors & School Walls\n\nDear Mr. Garrard:\n\nI have a copy of a letter re the above matters from Mr. Arnell, Commissioner, forwarded by you for my information. I note that no action is to be taken with a view to correcting the floor conditions until the change is made in the water pipes and until the \"Spring run-off\".\n\nWill you please advise Mr. Arnell and ask him to convey to the Director of the Lands and Development Branch, that the under floor pipes have now been cut off and it would seem that there is now no further possibility of moisture affecting the floors from that source.\n\nAs far as the Spring run-off is concerned, we have had an unusually heavy wet season. The school yard has been flooded in places since last November and there is no frost in the ground. I am attaching an item from the \"Vancouver Province\", which would indicate that moisture conditions at Alberni are much as to cause comment.\n\nFrom March 1st it can be expected that these conditions will improve with the beginning of a dry period. Conditions for determining the moisture causes in the floors and walls could not be better than at the present time.\n\nIt will be most opportune to renovate the floors during the vacation months of July and August. May I request therefore that investigation of the conditions be made and remedial measures decided upon so that the work may be proceeded with.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n\"A.B. Caldwell\"\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nI am enclosing herewith Report of the inspection of Boiler No. 8960, made by Mr. J. E.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 9th instant regarding the floors at the Alberni Residential School, the Lands and Development Services Branch early this week recommended that the following be installed:\n\n\"Asphalt tile is available both in \"Greaseproof\" and \"Standard\" qualities. Asphalt tile has excellent wearing qualities and is resilient, moisture proof and low in maintenance and repair costs. It requires no special standard of cleanliness and may be polished with any liquid wax approved for asphalt tile, e.g., \"Glo-coat\" which requires no buffing.

It is hoped that the expenditure will not exceed this amount.\n\n[Signatures]\n\nDirector\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRe: Alberni Indian Residential School,\nBasement Floor Covering.\n\nIn accordance with our instructions, Mr. Gurney has investigated the question of covering basement floors of this building with linoleum, after applying \"Aquella\". In our opinion, Mr. Gurney's estimate of $3000 is low and we anticipate that the same trouble would recur if great care is not taken.\n\nThe alternative of asphalt tile has therefore been studied, and accordingly, under authority of Mr. Hoey's Memorandum of May 19th we have obtained the following data.\n\nAsphalt tile is available both in \"Greaseproof\" and \"Standard\" qualities. Asphalt tile has excellent wearing qualities and is resilient, moisture proof and low in maintenance and repair costs. It requires no special standard of cleanliness and may be polished with any liquid wax approved for asphalt tile, e.g. \"Glo-coat\" which requires no buffing. Dark colours are recommended; they are cheaper and easier to keep clean. The application of aquella is optional, since the tile would be laid, by an approved applicator, over waterproof primer and asphalt cement.\n\n\"Greaseproof\" quality (which is higher in price) need only be used in the kitchens and the dairy - a total of 72 square yards. Elsewhere \"Standard\" quality is recommended: both qualities in dark colours 3/16\" thick.\n\nOn the foregoing basis it is recommended that authority be obtained to have this work put in hand under Mr. Gurney at a cost of about $3,800.\n\nR.A.

This matter had previously been reported upon by District Inspector of Schools R. F. Davey.

It would be appreciated if you could obtain details on the type of sink recommended for this school and forward such details here in the form of a requisition which can be submitted to the Departmental Purchasing Agent. From past experience, it is likely that the purchase of this equipment will exceed your five hundred dollar purchasing authority.\n\nBernard E.

I would appreciate it very much if you would have this situation reported upon by one of your appropriate officials and, if possible, have funds provided in the Supplementary Estimates for the installation of modern sanitary dish-washing equipment.\n\nThanking you, I am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

Brown, of Port Alberni, British Columbia, the General Contractor on the job, had made no payment to you on your account for millwork, our Superintendent on the work was instructed to investigate the contractor's standing with all subcontractors and supply firms. It was established that while the contractor had received payment for all work completed up to that time, he had failed to use the funds in meeting his obligations on outstanding accounts to a number of firms for materials and supplies under the contracts.\n\nFurther payments by the Crown to the contractor were withheld until the creditors advised the Department that they had appointed a receiver to act in their behalf, and in a letter dated October 23, 1947, bearing the signatures of all known creditors including your own, the Department was advised that Mr. H.O.K. Housser, 108-Fourth Avenue South, Port Alberni, had been appointed to act in that capacity.\n\nYou are doubtless aware that the Crown recognizes the General Contractor only, on a project, and that subcontractors or supply houses are responsible for protecting their own interests, insofar as their financial relations with the General Contractor are concerned. However, the prerogative held by the Department to pay funds due a General Contractor who has defaulted in his payment to creditors, directly to those creditors, through a receiver agreeable to the creditors, was followed, and following Mr. Housser's appointment with Power of Attorney for the creditors, all funds due Mr. Brown still under our control were paid directly to Mr. Housser for distribution, proportionate to the amount of the creditors' claims.\n\nUnder date of March 10, 1948, Mr. Housser advised this office that all funds had been distributed.\n\nIt is realized that under the circumstances, creditors were not paid in full, but Mr. Brown having been paid the greater proportion of his contract price directly, and the balance of the total contract price having been distributed to the creditors through their appointed receiver, the connection of the Department with the contract is now terminated. Any further recovery of funds by the creditors is dependent upon either mutually agreeable arrangements with Mr. Brown or by legal action against him.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nE.E.

This expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter, File No. dated\n\nVoucher No. 484 Date 29 July 1948\nA contract was let to Messrs. Irvine and Reeves of Port Alberni, B.C., early in March of this year for plumbing and heating repairs, Alberni Indian Residential School. Efforts to secure a firm price contract were unsuccessful due to the fact that in repair jobs of this nature it is difficult to determine, beforehand, the exact amount of work necessary. There were two bids on a cost plus basis, and upon the advice of our engineer, Mr. Gurney, it was decided to let the contract to Irvine and Reeves on the basis of cost plus ten percent (10%). On February 19th of this year, a wire was received from our engineer, Mr. Gurney, stating that Irvine and Reeves estimated the cost would be $4,500.00 and the contract was drawn up on the basis of that amount.\n\nSection 3, Clause (a) of the Contract reads as follows:\n\n\"To pay the Contractor the cost of the work as defined in Schedule A hereto attached, which cost as so defined is hereinafter referred to as the cost of the work, but unless authorized by the Minister not to exceed the sum of $4,500.00, which sum is hereinafter referred to as the estimated cost of the work\".\n\nWe now have final accounts from the Contractor showing that work performed by Irvine and Reeves will total $5,906.90. The increased cost is due to factors outside the control of either the Contractor or this Division. There was a sharp rise in tradesmen's wage rates, and in the cost of material subsequent to awarding the contract, as well as additional items which could not be anticipated but which became evident as the work progressed.\n\nWe will therefore require approval for the amount of the increased cost ($1,406.90) over the original estimated cost of $4,500.00 before final payment can be made on the Contract.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nWill you kindly obtain the necessary approval.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, September 2, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\nLANDS and DEVELOPMENT SERVICES BRANCH.\n\nRe: Alberni Indian Residential School.\n\nAttached for your information is a copy of a letter received from Indian Superintendent Garrard and also a report from Mr. Gurney together with the account from Bailey Electric for the installation of a fire alarm at the above school.\n\nAs this work was carried on under the supervision of your Officials, we are referring the account to you for attention.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, September 2, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\nLANDS and DEVELOPMENT SERVICES BRANCH.\n\nRe: Irvine and Reeves Contract,\nPlumbing and Heating Repairs\nAlberni Indian Residential School.\n\nWe have your memorandum of August 11th with reference to the above and it is noted that the total cost of the work will be $5,906.90 which is an increase of $1,406.90 over the original estimated cost. If you consider the charges made by the firm are proper, we approve payment of same.\n\nAs the Alberni Residential School is a comparatively new building, we hope that the repairs that have been completed during the present summer will obviate the necessity of any major expenditure for this school for some time.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP/RR.\nWest Coast Agency,\nAlberni, B.C.\n\nAugust 11, 1948.\n\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to the enclosed Account from Bailey Electric which was forwarded to this office from Ottawa.

An inspection has been made accompanied by the school Principal and all items covered by this contract have been completed satisfactorily.

Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nSeptember 16, 1948.\n\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY\n\nTHE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to report:\n\nThat in the 1947-48 estimates of the Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, funds were provided for carrying out repairs and replacements to the plumbing and domestic water systems in the Indian Residential School at Alberni, British Columbia;\n\nThat drawings and specifications were prepared by the Department, and calls for tenders were issued, as a result of which two tenders were received, both quoting a price of cost plus ten per cent (10%) for materials and labour. It was recognized that due to the character of the work, the total cost would not be known until operations were underway;\n\nThat upon analysis, it was considered to be in the best public interest to accept the tender submitted by Messrs. Irvine and Reeves of Port Alberni, British Columbia, whose approximate total cost of the work was Four Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($4,500.00);\n\nThat approval of the acceptance of the said tender was issued by the predecessor of the undersigned, and a contract was awarded to Messrs. Irvine and Reeves limiting the cost of the work to the approximate estimate of Four Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($4,500.00) plus a fee of ten per cent (10%);\n\nThat as the work progressed, additional essential repair items became necessary which together with increases in the cost of labour and materials, and including the Contractor's fee of ten per cent (10%) has increased the cost of repairs to the school to Five Thousand, Nine Hundred and Six Dollars and Ninety Cents ($5,906.90) which, after making provision for supervision, will involve a total expenditure to the Department of Six Thousand Three Hundred Dollars ($6,300.00);\n\nThe undersigned, therefore, has the honour to recommend that the work having been completed by the contractor, and accepted as satisfactory by the Departmental supervising officer, that authority be granted for payment of the additional cost not exceeding One Thousand Three Hundred and Fifty Dollars ($1,350.00), the approximate amount by which the total cost exceeded the expenditure originally approved by the then Minister of Mines and Resources, the said additional expenditure to be met from the appropriate vote of the Indian Affairs Branch 1948-49 estimates (Vote 772, Indian Education) Department of Mines and Resources.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nMinister of Mines and Resources.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nPurchase Order No 17167 B\n\nCanadian Sumner Iron Works Ltd., P.O.

B. Neary,\nSuperintendent, Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nBooth Building,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Col. Neary:\n\nRe: Equipment of Alberni Indian Residential School\n\nUpon leaving the Alberni school, Miss McCready wrote and asked if it would be possible for an increase grant to be given to this school to cover the salary of a second cook in the main kitchen, as one cook is doing the cooking for 240 children and finds it difficult to keep the necessary food records needed in the survey because of lack of time. It is almost impossible for one cook to prepare the food for this number of people without any extra duties.\n\nThere is a bread slicer in the school but it is antiquated and unsatisfactory; thus it is not used and the bread is sliced by hand. The slices are not uniform in size and therefore it is difficult to keep proper records of size of serving of bread eaten.\n\nAn electric mixer for a school this size is very desirable for mixing cakes, cookies, mashing vegetables, etc. It is impossible for women or children to mix or beat the quantity of food that is required for 240 children.\n\nI believe Miss Lock spoke to you about these requirements on the telephone last week. No doubt you have given them consideration and will be writing us regarding them shortly.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nL. B. Pett, Ph.D., M.D.,\nChief, Nutrition Division.\nDecember 23, 1948.\n\nDear Dr. Pett:\n\nRe: Equipment for Alberni Indian Residential School.\n\nI regret that your letter of November 6th was mislaid and not previously answered.\n\nAs the end of the current fiscal year is approaching and as our expenditures at the Alberni Residential School this year have been quite heavy we are unable to provide the funds for supplying a bread mixer and an electric mixer, at the present time.\n\nWe intend to write to Indian Commissioner Arneil instructing him to forward a requisition for this equipment about April 1, 1949.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Munday\nSuperintendent\nIndian Agency\nTwo Years\u2014Two Scholarships\n\nBy LYN HARRINGTON\n\nShe's done it again!\n\nFor the second year, Judith Phyllis Morgan of Kitwanga has won the $150 scholarship presented through the B.C. Indian Arts and Welfare Society of Victoria by the University Women's Club. Judith submitted the required four paintings from the Alberni Residential School where she lives.\n\nThe scholarship is presented as a memorial \"to honor the Indians who had given their lives for Canada in the Second World War, and to assist native craftsmen to maintain high standards and to build up a thriving industry for their people.\" The scholarship carries with it two weeks of study at the Provincial Museum under trained anthropologists.\n\nThe fairy tale atmosphere about it is that Judith never had an art lesson until the beginning of last year. And then to win a scholarship is enough to make anyone believe in happy endings. But she did it twice\u2014twice proof if any is needed that her talent is no mere flash in the pan.\n\nEven if she hadn't won it, Judith would have gone on with the art work in which she has been engaged for years. Her paintings are taken en masse from the stories of the West Coast natives, and chiefly of the Tsimsian tribe. The masks and headdresses worn by her subjects are the ceremonies she saw as a youngster home is famous as the village of totem poles. There Emily Carr painted and used to play with the children she came to know and love. She wrote about in her book,\" said Judith. There are 13 boys and girls in the Morgan family, the eldest who is a veteran of World War II.\n\nOne delightful thing about Judith Morgan is that she is completely composed as before a daughter of the totem house. Taking her with the first ladies of the province and prominent and outstanding Canadian painters such as Lawren Harris, Judith maintains that quiet dignity displayed in an 18-year-old schoolgirl.\n\nHer paintings are taken en masse from the stories of the West Coast natives, and chiefly of the Tsimsian tribe. The masks and headdresses worn by her subjects are the ceremonies she saw as a youngster.\n\nJudith Phyllis Morgan is a coming artist of her race.\n11th January, 1949.\n\nMr. W.S.

Caldwell, wherein he makes representations for conversion of the barn which is not now used, into a gymnasium.\n\nAlthough we were at first inclined to reject this proposal on the grounds that funds for new construction were extremely limited, subsequent investigation by School Inspector Levey revealed that space in the main school building formerly used for recreational activities had been converted for classroom use, leaving absolutely no recreational space. You will recall that although we had contemplated the erection of a four-classroom block at Alberni this year, it was decided to defer construction for another year in order that the funds appropriated could be transferred for other more urgent school construction projects. Under the circumstances, as the school has relinquished for classroom use space previously used for recreational purposes and as there is no prospect of additional classroom space being provided this year, I am of the opinion that Mr. Caldwell's request for conversion of the barn is reasonable.\n\nThe total cost of converting the building should not exceed $5,000.00. I would recommend that the Department favourably consider an expenditure of this amount from the classroom block appropriation. If this recommendation is approved, further details will be secured with regard to the material and labour necessary and the proposed arrangement for having the work carried out.\n\n[Signature]\nW.S.

Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\nRe Conversion of Barn to Gym.\n\nDear Mr. Arneil,\n\nI have had an estimate made by a good carpenter, a man who was for a time our Manual Instructor, John Loewen, on the renovation required to convert the barn which we are not now using into a Gymnasium. I do not need to dwell on the urgent necessity for such playing accommodation at this school. The present very small space provided within the school building is altogether inadequate, especially during the wet winter months.\n\nThe building is 34 feet by 80 feet. The roofing requires renewing and the roof struts strengthening. The loft floor will be removed and a floor rebuilt on the cement ground floor. The present cement floor will require to be levelled by wood floor joists.\n\nThe carpenter has estimated the material to be required and is charging daily carpenter wages for himself and one helper. His estimate of the time necessary for labour seems to me very reasonable. The total cost would be $4516.15.\n\nI am enclosing a list of labour and material which Mr. Loewen has submitted. I would be pleased if this work could be done during the summer.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nI have had expert opinion on the strength of the building and am assured that the 12 buttresses, six on each side outside, anchored in cement, will give all the strength necessary.\nEstimate re renovation of Barn for Gymnasium.\n\nMaterial and Labour involved:\n\n- 2 x 6 Ceiling joists.\n- 2 x 6 Rafter Studs.\n- 1 x 6 Tongue and Grooved for walls, ceiling and ends.\n- 2 - 2' x 2' Ceiling ventilators with trap doors.\n- Remove Loft Floor.\n- 4 - 4' x 6' end windows.\n- Remove loft entrance projection.

Arneil,\nCommissioner for Indian Affairs,\nVANCOUVER, B.C. Re. Gymnasium.\n\nDear Mr. Arneil,\n\nI have yours of the 20th Inst re the manner in which the work of renovation of the barn for the purpose of providing a gymnasium can be carried out.\n\nI have discussed this matter with Mr. John Loewen, who, I may say, is a first class man and takes a great interest in the school, and he says that, in our own interest, it would be better to have the work done by contract as he estimated, as that would ensure the work being done as quickly as possible.\n\nI went over his figures with him when he made the estimate (which you have with the plans) and, in my own opinion, his estimate of the cost of labour was a bare minimum of the time necessary to do both the breaking down of the floors, etc., and the rebuilding.\n\nHowever, if you think it is preferable to have the work done by day labour, with the materials supplied, it should not make much difference, except that there is the prospect that the estimate made may not cover the job.\n\nYou will recall that the extra $500.00 placed in the estimates is for a furnace and lighting, not included in Mr. Loewen's estimate.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Gymnasium - Alberni Residential School\n\nYour File 877-5 (E1)\n\nFollowing receipt of Mr. Phelan's Army Signals Message of October 13th, I discussed at some length with Mr. Caldwell his proposal for converting the Alberni School barn into a gymnasium. In his letter of April 16th, a copy of which was forwarded to you, he outlines the proposal in some detail and has now provided a plan which is being forwarded to you under separate cover which indicates further the amount of work necessary.\n\nMr. Caldwell has available to do the work a Mr. John Loewen, formerly an employee of the School, and although we consider that it might be easier to secure approval of the proposal if the work was done on a day labour basis, he is of the opinion that this would increase the cost over $5,000.00, with which opinion I concur. Mr. Loewen is prepared to complete the conversion on a firm contract basis for $4,510.15, which amount includes both labour and material, apart from the necessary heating and wiring installations. Mr. Caldwell is of the opinion that these facilities can be installed separately for less than $500.00 which will keep the total cost below the $5,000.00 approved.\n\nMr. Caldwell's letter of October 22nd and another copy of Mr. Loewen's estimate are enclosed and I would ask you to please advise if an arrangement for carrying out of the work on a firm contract basis by Mr. Loewen can be approved and if any additional information is required.\n\nW.S.

Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Alberni Residential School\n\nIncluded in the list of school construction projects for next year is a four-room classroom block for the above-mentioned school. We are under the impression that this new block will be heated from an individual heating system in the basement. The object of District School Inspector Davey's memorandum of February 18th attached is to bring to the attention of the Department the proposed erection of a hostel to accommodate the high school population now in residence at the residential school and to suggest that the heating system installed in the new classroom block be sufficiently large to take care of the heating requirements of the hostel when it is built in 1952.\n\nThe pupilage and staff accommodation required in the hostel as set out by Mr. Davey will give you some idea of the size of the building for which the heating system in the new classroom block will be required to provide.\n\nW. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nFebruary 18, 1930.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRe: Hostel, Alberni Residential School\n\nI have recently had an opportunity to discuss with Mr. Caldwell the type of hostel which should be constructed to serve the high school population now in residence at the Alberni Residential School. There are now 14 pupils in residence at the school who are attending the Provincial High School. It is expected that there will be 24 attending next year. This allows for at least five dropping out before going to high school, and the indications are that this number will continue to increase rapidly for the next four years. It would appear that we should plan a building that will accommodate 50 children, which number will be reached in five years or less.\n\nThe preferred type of building is one which would provide bedrooms to accommodate two students. Since this building will house both sexes it is required that the sleeping accommodation for each group be separated so that each of the two sections will accommodate approximately half of the enrolment.\nIn addition to the sleeping accommodation, there will be required a common dining hall, preferably one equipped with tables for four, a common kitchen and a common sitting room and study hall. It is suggested that the basement, or part of it, might be fitted as a large rumpus room.\n\nSince the heating unit at the Residential School will have to be increased to provide for the new class-room block it is suggested that the new boiler be sufficiently large to provide heat for the hostel as well.\n\nIn addition to housing the pupilage, the building should also provide accommodation for a small staff of one cook, two supervisors and one general assistant. It would be desirable also to have two spare bedrooms provided.\n\nIt is believed that the general construction should be a one story frame building. I do not feel that anything in the nature of a fire-proof building should be used as this type of construction is both expensive and inflexible for a scheme which is experimental.\n\nThis information is being supplied at this time so that draft sketches may be prepared in order to have the final set of plans completed for the beginning of the 1951-52 fiscal year.\n\nR.F. Davey,\nInspector of Schools.\nAIR MAIL\n\nMarch 2nd, 1950.\n\nMr. W.S. Arnell,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nAlberni Indian Residential School\n\nReference your 16-11-3 (159) of February 24th.\n\nIncluded in our Estimates is a sum of $60,000.00 for the erection of a classroom block at the above school. We note that a further sum will have to be included in our next year's Estimates for the erection of a small hostel.\n\nIt might be advisable for you to have your engineers draft a sketch of the type of building which will be needed for these high school pupils. This sketch can then serve as a basis for the drawings to be prepared by our architects.\n\nI am writing to the Department of Resources and Development today concerning the classroom block, and am also pointing out to them the need for a hostel at a later date.\n\nBernard F.

In the meantime there was a considerable leakage through the ceiling of the kitchen. The pipe had to be exposed by cutting through the cement wall between the kitchens, the installation of a new pipe with a greater than right angle bend to prevent further blocking. A \"Y\" outlet was also installed to make the pipe enclosed in the wall easy of access.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPAY TO: Al's Electric,\n408 3rd Avenue South,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\n\nVote: 516.09.615\n\nDATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT\n---|---|---\n1950 | March 17 Repairs to electric Motor at the Alberni Indian Residential School | $74.30\nAuth: Commissioner's letter dated Jan 27/50 File 15-11-4\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 506\nR. 145\nVoucher No. 308\nDATE: 17 March 1950\n\nIndian Affairs.

Moore, Indian Agent, Duncan, B.C.\n\nAll the correspondence was forwarded by Indian Agent Moore and we have been in communication with him since that time. For your information I may say that Mr. and Mrs. Elmer Campbell recently visited Mr. Moore's office and gave the following information:\n\n1. Robert Richard Campbell originally Baptized a Roman Catholic on December 1st, 1939.\n\n2. Later Baptized into the United Church on October 4th, 1946.\n\n3. Elmer Campbell originally Baptized in Washington, U.S.A., a Methodist in 1915. Later rebaptized a Roman Catholic at Kuper Island on June 24th, 1926, when he was sent to the Kuper Island School by Mr. Lomas, in error.\n\n4. Mrs. Elmer Campbell was Baptized a Roman Catholic on August 25th, 1918.\n\nIn his letter, Indian Agent Moore added the following:\n\"The error was made by Father LeClair in his communication of November 8th, last, when he stated that Elmer was Baptized at Kuper Island in June, 1946, it should have been June, 1926. Campbell was quite incensed over this affair and particularly the way in which he - as he puts it - \"has been kicked around by the department officials\". In the first place, when he was sent to Kuper Island by Mr. Lomas when his religion was not a Catholic, hence his Baptism as a Roman Catholic at Kuper Island. He also states that he does not attend the Roman Catholic Church, here, nor has done for several years, and then only on very rare occasions. His wife also stated that she has not attended the Roman Catholic Church for years.\"\n\nIn view of the above, this Branch is inclined to feel that we will be obliged to approve the admission of the boy to the Alberni Residential School.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Pupils from the Prince Rupert, Nass River, Skeena River and Hazelton points will return on August 29th. Will you please convey these arrangements to Mr. Phelin? The Union Steamships have advised me that they will not neglect to reserve accommodation in future at the time usually arranged, that is, from June 25th to 30th, on the homeward trips of the pupils.\n\nIt is unfortunate that the Union Steamships provide the only means of conveyance for these pupils, but they have, until the lapse of this year, been very solicitous of the requirements of this school in transportation that is not easily arranged, considering the very heavy tourist traffic and the movement of cannery workers just at the times that we need transportation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nAlberni Indian Residential School\n\nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA\n\nALBERNI, B.C.\n\nJuly 19th 1947.\n\nRe: School Vacation.\n\nDear Mr. Garrard,\n\nI have your letter of recent date containing an extract from a letter from Mr. Phillip Phelin, wherein he enquires re an irregularity in the vacation leave for a number of pupils of this school. May I request that you report the following circumstance to Mr. Phelin.\n\nSome 70 of our pupils are from points on the Northern coast of the B.C. mainland from Bella Bella to Prince Rupert. Both from the Alberni School, and earlier, from the Coqualeetza School, transportation for these pupils to and from their homes has been provided for many years by the Union Steamships Company of Vancouver, the only company to call at some of the points to which the pupils must be conveyed. Reservations have always been kept by this company between the 25th and 30th June, on the homeward journey, and between the 25th and the 31st of August on the return journey.\n\nThis year, however, unknown to me, not only had the company made a change in their schedules, but the Passenger Agent at their Vancouver office had been changed. When I visited Vancouver the first week in May to arrange for the usual transportation, I found that the usual accommodation had not been reserved for the Alberni School. The Alert Bay School had just completed arrangements to have their pupils transported northward on June 26th. The tourist traffic had booked up accommodation from June 15th throughout the season, and extra accommodation had to be found for Cannery employees leaving Vancouver at the latter end of June.\n\nI tried to book passages on the Canadian Pacific Steamships of the dates required, but they were also fully booked. The only date that could accommodate the pupils for Butedale, the Skeena River, and the Hazelton district was June 11th, and for the Bella Bella and the Bella Coola pupils on two boats leaving June 30th. The only alternative to accepting these dates was to send the pupils a half-dozen at a time through the month of July and into August, and\nEach group would, of course, require to be escorted. I do not see what other alternative was open except to take advantage of the earlier dates open.\n\nWe had had a recent school inspection by Mr. Davey, and I immediately arranged to have all class-room tests completed by June 10th, and this was satisfactorily done.\n\nI do not think the suggestion that the pupils could have been returned by August 15th would have met with any appreciable response from the parents, as many of the older pupils work at fishing and at the canneries until it is time from them to return to school at the end of August. The travelling distances in respect to the Northern group of pupils is so great that it is expedient for all the pupils to return together under escort sent from the school.\n\nI may say that the evacuation of the other pupils proceeded normally, with the exception that the same difficulty of transportation to the Northern coast of Vancouver Island was experienced. The C.P.R. Steamships are only operating one boat on the summer schedule instead of the usual two, and the only date available for pupils was June 13th. Also, some of the local pupils were on their annual trek to the berry farms of the States, and the children of these parents were permitted to accompany the parents when requested. The request was made in only a few instances. Other pupils whose parents had gone to the States arranged to meet the pupils who were later escorted to Victoria, en-route to the States.\n\nI may say that I have been assured by the Union Steamships that such circumstance will not occur again, and I trust that the present circumstance, which was undoubtedly beyond my control, will be overlooked.\n\nJust yesterday I met Rev. Father Mulvihill, of the Kekawis School, and he enquired as to the above matter of vacation dates.

E. Caldwell, Principal  \nAlberni Residential School,  \nALBERNI, B. C.\n\nDear Mr. Caldwell,\n\nThere are a number of Indians of this Agency who should be sent to a Residential School and I am going to list, below, those who are members of the United Church.\n\n| NAME               | BORN          | GRADE COMPLETED |\n|--------------------|---------------|-----------------|\n| JOHNSON, Bruce Solomons | March 11, 1932 | 4               |\n| JOHNSON, Louise    | Jan. 21, 1932 | 4               |\n| JOHNSON, Rena      | May 4, 1937   | ---             |\n\nThese are the children of Jonathan Johnson and I have already written about them on April 16th concerning the medical troubles experienced in the family, since that time two small children have died in the hospital but there are still seven children in the family and this is obviously far more than the father is capable of looking after.\n\nMULDOE, Peter Earl.  \nMay 16, 1936.  \nMULDOE, Perry Kenneth.  \nJune 26, 1934.  \nMULDOE, Sadie.  \nJune 14, 1932.\n\nThese are the children of Peter Muldoe and his wife, who have altogether nine children. The Sadie and Samson are Lottie's children by a former (Common Law Union). In caring for this large family, this woman has an almost impossible task; I feel that it would be greatly to the benefit of the children, as a whole, if these four could be sent away for their education.\n\nWESLEY, Roy Phillip.  \nNov. 13, 1932.  \nWESLEY, Allan David. June 24, 1934.\n\nThese are the children of David Wesley and his wife, of Kitseguila, who have nine children to care for! Allan David Benson went to live with the Wesley's upon the death of his father in 1945 and was placed in grade one at the Kitseguila School during the 1945-46 academic year. Unfortunately the record of our day schools in the Bahine Agency has been anything but happy in recent years and during 1946-47, through lack of a teacher the Kitseguila school was not opened at all, so this boy, among many others had no opportunity of any schooling during the past twelve months.\n\nBROWN, Vera  \nMarch 20, 1938.  \nBROWN, Lena  \nSept. 10, 1939.\n\nThe parents of these children, Abel Brown and his wife, Violet, have had eight children since 1932, of whom four have died. The mother herself has been treated for T.B., recently and although, not at present, in the hospital, has been advised not to overwork. These instructions, of course, only be followed if a part of her family were removed.\n\nIn the above applications the children would, of course, only be sent following a satisfactory medical examination.\n\nCOPY\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6435, file 877-10, part 7)\nIt is to be hoped that you can accommodate some of these children who are, only a few, of many who might profitably be sent to a residential school. If you can accept them and turn out as good products as you have made of many of the pupils from this Agency, it would be a service of great value to all concerned. You will be interested to know that a former pupil of yours, Margaret Harris, is writing this letter, having completed her Commercial and come to work in the Agency office here.\n\nUpon receipt of your reply I will take immediate steps to have applications completed and Medical examinations proceeded with.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. V. Boys,\nIndian Agent.\nMemorandum:\n\nFor File.\n\nThe attached letter was forwarded under cover of Indian Agent Boys' communication of August 13th on file 165-0-10. The reply to Mr. Boys' letter is also on file 165-0-10, see letter dated August 29th, 1947.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nAttached please find application forms for the following pupils admitted to the Alberni Indian Residential School, Alberni, B.

I had not anything very particular to trouble you about, but I yearned to tell you what I thought about the Indian affairs of the spring.... Fancy Guy Williams, whom I know personally very well, who is a clever boy, but not a good boy and who knows no more about religion of any sort that the man in the moon, standing up to represent the 'unattached Indians of BC', so many of whom are real Catholics....nothing could be more cynical.....\n\nAs for the 'Native Brotherhood' and their brief, it was just a hole and corner affair managed very well by Mr. Kelly.....most of the officers did not know what was in it until it appeared.....nothing could be more 'democratic'........\n\nOne of the prominent members of the organisation, a Catholic 'of sorts', told me that he agreed to no religious teaching in the schools, not that he was against it at all, of course he wasn't, but that he wanted to give the priests and Sisters a jolt....which of course they need........\n\nMost of the officers of the Brotherhood, whom I have met recently have been very apologetic about the brief, explaining everything in the finest fashion. There is a very real danger of Communist penetration among them, I have this on the very best authority........\n\nIn spite of the fact that I have read Hansard through I have been feeling very worried about the outcome of things, but I was quite a little relieved when I saw your appointment in the paper the other day.....all my prayers and congratulations go with you.\nIf it would not worry you too much to give me a few remarks about the general situation, I should be most grateful.\n\nNow I have something I should like to have your advice about. Josephine Hazel Tait...age 9.....daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Tait of Cloose, V.I., a baptized Catholic has been admitted to the ex-methodist school at Alberni. Mrs. Tait is a Catholic and was married in the Church to her husband a non-Catholic.\n\nThe mother allowed the child to go to Alberni, partly because she did not realise all that was involved, partly because the half brother, a non-Catholic was going there. Mrs. Tait is very anxious that Josephine should be transferred to Christie School.......'Quid faciendum'.....I did not mention the matter to Mr. Tait, but of course he has made the promises'........\n\nI shall not speak to the Agent until I hear from you. Unless I am much mistaken, he is a very wooden gentleman. Of course you may be sure that your confidence will be respected.\n\nImagine the hullabaloo if a Catholic school had a corresponding protestant.....\n\nA letter would catch me at the following address:\nConvent of the Sacred Heart, Point Grey, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nThe new Bishop has kept me on the same job...so far......What with Indians and whites, I have not much time for joy riding........\n\nPlease keep me in your prayers and ask God that I may be able to do something for the Indians before I die. Personally I should like to retire to a reserve and try my hand there.....May be I should be a dreadful failure. Actually I am on my way to visit Nootka and Christie School.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nJ.H. Bradley.\nOttawa, November 29, 1947.\n\nDear Father Bradley:\n\nI have for answer your letter of November 9. Having been present for practically all of the briefs presented to the Parliamentary Committee, I feel that the men selected for the Committee are really very industrious and sincere in their efforts to improve the lot of these native people. Some of the presentations, of course, have been rather radical and some indeed very impracticable. However, I feel confident that the members of the Committee will be able to sift the grain from the chaff and arrive at a suitable revision for the Indian Act. Insofar as Indian Education is concerned, a great deal has transpired that of course does not appear in the published proceedings. This Sub-committee has yet to make its report to the Committee, and I hope that their deliberations will prove satisfactory to those most interested in Indian education.\n\nThe delay in answering your latter has been due to the fact that we have had to dig back into our files concerning the Tate children. There has also been some confusion because we have a family of Tate children also attending the Alberni Residential School. The application form for Josephine Tate states that she is the daughter of Henry Tate and Jane Bob; that she was born on October 15, 1938; and that the religion is United Church of Canada.\n\nTherefore she was admitted to the Alberni residential school. As you are probably aware from previous rulings, the Department of Justice has decided that the father of the child is the one who will decide the religion in which the child should be reared. This has led to many controversies with regard to the\n\nReverend Father J. L. Bradley,\nConvent of the Sacred Heart,\nPoint Grey, Vancouver, B. C.\nadmission of children to our residential schools and we have many voluminous files dealing with such cases. Your remarks concerning the Hullabaloo if a Catholic school had a corresponding Protestant ...... is pertinent; for we have had several such cases. The main point is whether Mr. Henry Tate is the father of this child. You make a statement concerning a half-brother who is also attending the residential school, which would indicate the possibility that Josephine is not the daughter of Henry Tate. However, I will expect to hear further from you, clarifying this particular point - which, as you can see, is most important.\n\nI sincerely appreciate your congratulations and good wishes upon my appointment and I sincerely hope that I will be able to fulfill your expectations of me in this position.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

The facts as he presents them are as follows:\n\n(a) That she is the daughter of a marriage between a Catholic mother and a non-Catholic father.\n\n(b) That she was born on October 15, 1938 at St. Joseph's Hospital, Victoria, British Columbia and baptized by the R.C. Priest there.\n\n(c) That she was baptized on August 11, 1946 according to the Rite of the United Church of Canada.\n\nAs you are probably aware, the Department of Justice has a ruling in such instances. The ruling is to the effect that the father can decide the denomination in which he wishes the child concerned to be raised.\n\nCould I please be advised as to the father's wishes in this instance.

As you are probably aware we have a Department of Justice ruling with regard to children who are baptized in different denominations. The ruling is to the effect that the father can decide the denomination in which he wishes the child concerned to be raised.

Neary, Esquire,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Neary,\n\nIf I remember rightly, I acknowledged your last very kind letter about Josephine Hazel Tate, age 9 of the Nitinahlt Band. The child had been admitted to the Alberni school and entered as 'United Church of Canada'. I had every reason to believe that she has been baptized as a Catholic. On receiving your letter, I made further enquiries through Mr. N.W. Garrard, Indian Agent at Alberni. I have just received a letter from Mr. Garrard, dated Feb. 10, '48. Apparently the parents were married by Fr. Th. Gurkus on Dec. 29,\n1937.\n\nJosephine was born on Oct. 15, 1938 at St. Joseph's Hospital, Victoria and baptized by the priest there. Mr. Garrard remarks 'without the father's consent', but of course, the father, who is a non-Catholic, had given his consent that all the children should be baptized and brought up in the Catholic Faith, when the marriage took place.\n\nJosephine was again baptized, with the father's consent on Aug. II, 1946 according to the rite of the United Church of Canada......as a prelim. I suppose to be admitted to the Alberni School.\n\nI wonder if anything further can be done.\n\nPlease accept my best wishes for the new year. I should be very grateful for a prayer.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nJ.H. Bradley.\nJanuary 28, 1948.\n\nMr. N.W.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nRe: Vacation, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. Neary,\n\nThe greater proportion of the pupils of this school require to be transported to their homes by steamer; to Bella Bella, Bella Coola, Kitimat, the Skeena and the Nass Rivers and Prince Rupert and inland points to Hazleton by the Union Steamships, Ltd., and to the West Coast of Vancouver Island by C.P.R. Steamships.\n\nThe Steamship Companies have always been very considerate in providing accommodation, but, owing to the heavy passenger traffic at the end of June caused by staff going out to the coast canneries and the fisheries, there is great difficulty in fixing dates that coincide with the regulation closing of the school. Transportation of the Alert Bay pupils by the Union Steamships also complicates the arrangements.\n\nI have had the application for transport with the Union Steamships this year since March 1st, and have just received the sailing dates on which the pupils can be accommodated. There will be two trips on the inner coast, one on June 23rd, from Campbell River (on Vancouver Island) to Prince Rupert, and the other on June 25th, from Campbell River to Bella Coola. This will necessitate concluding our classes a few days earlier than the scheduled date of June 25th. Last year, owing to particular congestion of traffic on the Union Steamships line, accommodation had to be taken on June 11th, with the alternative of transporting the pupils in small parties during July and August. This caused an enquiry from the Kakawis School, which school has not the same transportation difficulties, as to whether Kakawis could get permission to close early also. I am glad to say that this was explained and the explanation accepted by the Principal of the Kakawis School at that time.\n\nMay I request the sanction of the Department in accepting the above dates for the transportation of the pupils this year?\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nMay 11, 1948.\n\nMr. W.P. Pruden, Supt. of Indian Agency,\nBella Coola, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of April 22nd, the Department approves the admission of the following children to the Alberni Indian Residential School:\n\nHannah Livingstone,\nFlorence Carpenter,\nWilliam Carpenter,\nJohnny Benson White.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\nDella Coola, B.C.,\nApril 22nd, 1948.\n\nDept.

These applications are recommended for approval on the following grounds.\n\nHamah Livingstone - This child's mother and step-father move around from place to place a great deal and she has not had much opportunity to attend school. It is thought that she will have a better chance in residential school.\n\nFlorence (Bonnie) and William Herbert Carpenter - These children are now motherless and the father finds it rather hard to look after his large family and work at the same time. They will have better care in residential school than at home in the village.\n\nJohnny Benson White - although this child's parents are a good type of people there is rather a heavy load of unfortunate relatives living in the home including two sub-normals. It was therefore thought wise to give this boy a better environment for a year or two.\n\nW.P.
