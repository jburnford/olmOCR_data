It is noted that this teacher has had one year at the Ontario Agricultural College in Guelph but has had no teaching experience in Canada. However, due to the shortage of teachers we are prepared to accept his services at the rate of $118.00 a teaching month on a temporary basis until June 30, 1947. At this time we can review the teacher situation to ascertain if a more suitable teacher is available. During these months we will also have a more adequate opportunity to assess Mr. Petersen's teaching ability.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nVery Reverend M.

He also states that the schoolhouse is now too small for the Reserve, that the roof leaks and the house needs repainting, and that there are several panes of glass broken.

The teacher holds no certificate and is reported as not being up to the standard.\n\nThe Department would like you to place a thoroughly qualified teacher in charge of this school after the summer holidays, as there is no doubt that the falling off referred to by Mr. Dearness is due to the inefficiency of the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Secretary\n\nRev.

In reply I beg to say that Miss Emerson, the teacher employed after Miss Beatty's removal, resigned somewhat suddenly on account of ill health, and we were informed by the Rev. Mr. Vollrick that an Indian had been appointed to keep the school going for a few days until a proper teacher could be secured. We found it unusually difficult to get the kind of teacher we wanted, and consequently the school remained in charge of the Indian much longer than we intended. An appointment has been within a few days past, the particulars of which I will forward.\n\nConcerning Miss Beatty, I would say that we found her, on the whole, an efficient teacher, but she proved to be such a disturbing element in the mission in other respects that after long forbearance we were compelled to discontinue her services.\n\nI am\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nThe Honorable the Super't General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA 2nd July 1897\n\nSir,\n\nI have to inform you that Miss Lillian Grey of Seaforth, Ont. has been appointed by the authorities of the Methodist Missionary Society as teacher of the Onida No. 1 Indian school.\n\nActing Secretary\n\nA.S.

Mr Williams has sent in an application, a copy of which I enclose herewith, and if it meets with the approval of the Department, I think it would be well to give him a trial.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours Obedient Servant,\n\nThe Secretary of the Indian Department,\nOttawa.\n\nGeneral Secretary.\nTo Reverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant, stating that Miss Gray, the teacher of Omeida School No. 1, has just asked to be relieved early in November on account of impaired health, and recommendin' that the appointment be given on trial to Levi Williams, a well educated Indian.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, although Mr. Williams is so well recommended, as he holds only a high school entrance certificate, the Department would prefer obtaining the services of a teacher holding a certificate of a higher grade, at least a third class. Miss Gray, the teacher, holds a second class certificate; and it was believed that the falling off in school previously to her taking charge was owing to the inefficiency of her predecessor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

Beatty for Columbia\nthe diploma and medal awarded by the Exposition\nto the Oneida No. 1 Indian school for\nexcellence of school work.\n\nIn the above connection the undersigned begs to say that the diploma and medal were received through the Department of Agriculture in December '96 and sent to Agent McDougall with instructions to have the diploma neatly framed and hung in the school-room and the medal to be shown to pupils and then kept in his charge.\n\nMiss Beatty first applied for these articles in June '97, after she had left the school. She was informed that as the diploma was awarded to the school, the Department did not think it would be justified in taking it away and giving it to her, although it was through her exertions that the prizes had been obtained.\n\nSince then Miss Beatty has renewed her application on two or three occasions, the last time through Mr. Calvert, M.P., in March '98, when a reply to the above effect was sent him.\n\nI do not think that the diploma and medal should be taken away from the school and given to\nto Miss Beatty, as they were awarded to the school\nand not to the teacher.\n\nThe Agent should be written to about the\ncondition which she reports the diploma received from\nthe Colonial Exhibition to be in.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Brewer\nOTTAWA, 7th February, 1900\n\nMadam,\n\nI... to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo regarding your application for the diploma and medal awarded by the College of Idaho for Indian school teaching; however, I regret to inform you that the Department still adheres to the decision previously given you in this matter, and it will not hand over the diploma and medal to you as it considers them to be the property of the school.\n\nI may add that it will be useless for you to make any further applications in this direction.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

Sutherland,\nIndian Agent.\n\nSir. Dept.,\nIndian Office,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to bring to your attention the present situation regarding the school facilities on the Onida Reserve. A new school was recently opened on consideration of the need for better educational facilities.\n\nWhen I recently inspected the new school, I found that at Onida No. 2 School there were 51 children on the roll, though only 33 were eligible for school attendance and thus entitled to receive an education. However, due to the fact that the school is located in a remote area, many of the children have had to acquire additional burdens such as working during the harvest season or attending other schools further away.\n\nThe current school facilities are not sufficient to accommodate all the children who attend. In order to provide better educational opportunities, another school should be established closer to the center of the Reserve, where more children can benefit from its proximity.\n\nI would appreciate your guidance on this matter and any suggestions you may have to improve the educational facilities on the Reserve.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nOctober 3rd, 1928.\nAccording to the census taken recently the Oneida Reserve is in the vicinity of schools only whereas the combined reserve is in the vicinity of schools.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\nOttawa, October 9, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your l-7 of the 3rd instant, urging the establishment of a third school on the Oneida Reserve. Your representations will be given consideration when our estimates are being prepared, and, at the first opportunity, an officer of this Department will make a report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

This matter was discussed with Mr. Inspector McGowan who considered that a third school was required and recommended same. It will not be necessary for an officer of this Department to visit the reserve at the present time. You will be advised when funds to erect the new building are available.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nA. D. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNansey, Ont.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF MR. INSPECTOR V. J. THOMPSON\nDATED MAY 23RD, 1930, ON HIS INSPECTION OF\nONSIDA NO. 2 INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nThere should be additional school accommodation. In May a school census was taken by the Agent; there were 115 children of school age on the Reserve at the time. To do effective work 4 teachers would be required instead of 2.\nI would further inform you that last spring I had the truant officer of the Oneida schools submit to me a list of children of school age on the Oneida Reserve and there were 126 and there are only 2 schools on this reserve with a seating capacity of 72 and you can readily see that if all the children were forced to attend school they would be unable to be accommodated with seats and the teachers wouldn't be in a position to give satisfactory service when having 60 or more pupils to teach and I made a report to the Department some time ago when I recommended another school for this reserve, also with a seating capacity of 35 pupils, and which would give the agent a chance to force all children to attend school when they could be accommodated, which it is not possible to do at present.\n\nAn additional school would also relieve the present teachers of too large an attendance as they are unable to give much time to them all, and the pupils are not progressing as they should as I consider a teacher cannot handle any more than from 25 to 30 Indian pupils and show results.\nMuncy, Ont.\nSeptember 15th, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nRe: New School, Oneida Indian Reserve.\n\nI would again wish to bring to your attention the very unsatisfactory school situation on the Oneida Reserve of this Agency and request your consideration to the early erection of another Day School on that Reserve. When I recently sent my estimates to the Department for the fiscal year 1932-33 (also for the past three years) I included an item of $4000.00 for such a building and this school is at present much more needed than ever before.\n\nWhen recently compiling a list of those living on the Oneida Reserve, it was found counting all persons that there are 1067 inhabitants and over 130 children of school age, besides more than 80 pupils that are at present in Mount Elgin School and there are only two day schools with seats for 75 pupils to take care of this number of pupils, with the result that a large number of children are on the Reserve that are or have not been going to any school.\n\nTo-day I made an exception of these schools and found 38 pupils in Oneida No. 2 and 33 pupils in Oneida No. 2, and the teacher of Oneida No. 3, has had as high as 48 in one day and this means that 10 pupils have to double up in a single seat, this school has 51 on the roll. Oneida No. 2, has had as high as 44 in one day, meaning that 7 pupils have to double up in single seats and new pupils are being added to the roll with no proper seating facilities, and not doing justice to the teacher & chance and about 30 to 40 pupils is enough for each school, if the children are to receive the proper attention. Kindly make every endeavor possible to secure the early erection of another school at least on this Reserve and which reserve should have four schools to properly accommodate all school children.\n\nsecretary\nDept of Ind. Affs.\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.D. Moore, Indian Agent.\nOttawa, September 21, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, regarding school facilities for the Indian children on the Oneida Reserve, and recommending the erection of another day school building.\n\nIn reply I have to say that we will have no funds this present year to erect a building, and it is very doubtful if the amount required can be provided for the coming year. The requirements at this Reserve will be noted, and when our Estimates are being prepared for the next fiscal year, consideration will be given as to whether funds for the purpose can be provided or not.\n\nRegarding the seating accommodation at the No. 2 and No. 3 Schools, I shall be pleased if you will state if there is accommodation for a further number of desks in each of these schools. If so, you should state the size number of such size of extra desks which you would recommend be supplied for each school. Any new desks should be of the same type as those at present in the school. It is possible to note, stamped on the metal parts of the name of the manufacturer. If you consider that desks at each of these schools would help to facilitate in providing seating accommodation, you would be favourably disposed to placing an order when we have full information as to what is needed. You should also state the address to which the desks should be shipped.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L.

The two schools at present in operation only provide seating accommodation for about 73 pupils and, in addition, a large number of the children live at a considerable distance from these schools.\n\nIn view of the above conditions, the Agent is unable to enforce attendance owing to lack of accommodation.\n\nBesides the children who attend the two schools at present, there are about 65 children from this reserve in the Mount Elgin Residential School.\n\nIt will be seen, therefore, that the building of at least one new school on the Oneida Reserve is really required.\nMunsey, Ont., Feb. 12, 1955.\n\nI would acknowledge receipt of your letter of February 7th regarding a monthly report on affairs at this agency.\n\nI am going to submit for your consideration a number of suggestions that I would consider necessary for the future health and advancement of the Indians of this agency and while the whole will cost money, it may be good investment in the long run and would eliminate the belief of these Indians that they are a forgotten people and will receive no assistance from this office and the Department.\n\nRe School conditions.\n\nAs has been reported to the Department many times the school situation on the Oneida Reserve of this agency has never been to the advantage of these people. For while we have a population of about 800 on the Caradoc side, we have four schools there, whereas on the Oneida side with a population of nearly 1000 we only have two schools and the result is that we have more pupils than can be accommodated and have had to place nearly 60 Oneida children in residential schools, many of whom could have remained at home if day schools were available. The Oneida Reserve really should have two more day schools and in this way the children of that reserve could be brought on a par with the children of the Munsey and Chippewa Bands, who are progressing more rapidly than their neighbors.\n\nBy the erection of two new schools on the Oneida reserve it would allow a teacher in the vicinity of 30 pupils each and due to the Oneidas retaining their Indian habits so much this number is all that a teacher could give attention to for many pupils start school without knowing a word of English and the teachers have a hard and trying time with beginners. There are children on the Oneida reserve that have never been in a school due to lack of accommodation and are neglected by the part of the present. If more schools were available drastic action would be taken by this office to force all children to attend and the truancy act enforced, which is not possible at the present time. School conditions on the Munsey and Chippewa reserves are in a very good state at present.\n\nIf new schools are being contemplated at this agency I would suggest that consideration be given to having a teachers residence attached to the school, so that school garden supervision could be given, also close attention to government property.\n\nA. D. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\nIt is hoped that your reply will be both detailed and definite, in order that further correspondence will not be necessary.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Egey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nA.D. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncy, Ont.\nOttawa, October 22, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is considering including in the estimates for 1934-35 provision for a new one-roomed day school on the Oneida Reserve. This would provide accommodation for 35 to 40 pupils.\n\nIn order that we may have full information, I would appreciate an early reply to the following questions:\n\n1. Is a site available or will it be necessary to purchase a site? In either event you should state the size of the site you consider necessary and the general condition of the land, viz: whether level or sloping. You should also mention the direction in which you consider the building should face.\n\n2. Would you recommend provision of living quarters for the teacher?\n\n3. Could drinking water be easily obtained on the site recommended by you?\n\n4. Would you recommend construction by contract or by day labour?\n\n5. Do you consider a full basement necessary?\n\nIn addition to the information requested above, you should also give any other particulars that you consider would assist the Department in planning the building.\n\n(It is hoped that)\nfurnace could be installed to provide heat for both classroom and residence but if no residence is supplied then a foundation only would be necessary and the classroom could be heated by a coal furnacette.\n\nWith regard further information as to this building, I would suggest to you the design of the Cape Croker No.1 Indian Day School, which building has accommodation for 35 desks and also has room for four manual training benches and I know of no better design than this building of which there must be a plan at the Department. Fort Elgin School at Cape Croker is of the same design and should you request any further information, I would be pleased to submit it on request, and trust that the information given will be of some assistance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.D. Moore, Indian Agent.\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nKMC\nMuncey, Ontario.\nOctober 25, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI would acknowledge receipt of your letter 7-5-1 of October 22nd, with reference to including in the estimates provisions for a new one-room day school on the Oneida Reserve and in reply to your inquiries would report as follows:\n\n1. The most suitable site available is on the North half of Lot 20, Concession A, and located West of Oneida Road No. 1, being lands owned by Solomon Schuyler and which would have to be purchased from the Indians. Ten acres would be a satisfactory size allowing for a large playground and also sufficient land for a school garden. This land is quite level and is not far from the River Thames and would have excellent drainage at the rear of the Lot. In my opinion the school would face North-East by South-West and looking toward the County Road running past the Lot.\n\n2. I would recommend a four-room teacher's residence being attached to the school as a resident teacher could do much more good in the locality of the school than a non-resident teacher and could give better supervision to the care of the building as well as supervising school gardens etc.\n\n3. The Indian residences adjoining all have good surface wells and I can see no reason why water could not be obtained from the same method on the school lot and failing to obtain it, water could be obtained from wells within one hundred yards of the school lot.\n\n4. If a properly qualified carpenter foreman was obtainable, this school could be erected by day labour in the same manner as the Medical Superintendent's residence with mostly Indian labour and I feel sure that such a foreman can be obtained.\n\n5. In view of the fact a teacher's residence is recommended, I would consider a full basement necessary so that a\n7-5-1.\n\nOttawa, November 9, 1937.\n\nMr. Hardie,\n\nIn our appropriation for the fiscal year 1938-39, we are making provision for an amount of $1,000.00 to erect a day school with one classroom and teacher's living quarters attached on the Reid reserve, Grandoc Indian agency, province of Ontario. I am bringing this matter to your attention now in order that we may have plenty of time to decide on what is required and in this way we should be able to be in construction as soon as weather conditions permit in 1938.\n\nI would appreciate your submitting a sketch plan for our approval. To assist in preparing the plans, I supply the following information:\n\n1. Classroom should accommodate 40 pupils.\n2. A full basement should be provided.\n3. A furnace to burn coal should be installed.\n4. The teacher's living quarters should form part of the building.\n5. Our Indian Agent recommends that a qualified carpenter-foreman be engaged and the building erected by day labour.\n\nAs soon as you forward the sketch plan, I will submit it to our Agent for his consideration and will then advise you if we desire any changes to be made.\n\nDirector.\nNovember 26, 1937.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nRe - Proposed Day School and Teacher's Residence, Oneida Reserve, Caradoc Indian Agency, Ontario.\n\nAs requested in your memorandum of November 9th, I am forwarding herewith a sketch plan of a building that it is considered by our Architects will meet your requirements at the above site.\n\nIf the plan is satisfactory, will you kindly have it initialled and returned here. If any changes are desired, will you return the plan with various notations covering the changes made thereon. Preparation of more detailed plans can then be proceeded with.\n\nYou will note that during the past year there has been an increase of from 20% to 25% in the cost of building material and the Chief Engineer estimates the cost of the proposed building, with hot air heating and coal burning furnace, at $7,750. It is noted that $6,000 has been included in your Estimates for 1938-39.\n\nIn order that the Engineering and Construction Service will have complete information in preparing a design of this building, I am enclosing herewith two copies of a 'Building Data' form and would be very glad if you would have these completed and return one copy for our records.\n\nDirector.\nSurveys and Engineering Branch\nEngineering and Construction Service\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\n\nPROPOSED BUILDING DATA\n\nNAME OF BUILDING: Day School and Teachers' Residence.\n\nLOCATION: Omaida Indian Reserve.\n\nCaradoc Indian Agency.

D. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncie, Ont.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMuncey, Ont.\nDecember 27th, 1938.\n\nDear Sir: Attention Mr. R.A. Hoey,\n\nIn acknowledging receipt of your letter 7-5-5 of December 20th, concerning the report made by Inspector Smith on his recent visit to the new school No. 1, Indian Day School, I would advise that on Nov. 14th Mr. Smith mentioned the drains and pump when he made a quick visit to this office and November 16th I visited the school and with a lead pencil opened the drains and allowed the water to go away. These drains are the ordinary floor type and sediment had gathered around the holes in the drain plate. To eliminate this in future two slop pails were supplied so that no refuse need be pored down these drains.\n\nThe pump at the school like all others in the close locality of the school and on account of the very mild and dry fall, did go dry at times and this well being new and built in the dry season has not reached its full capacity and ten pails will dry it at times and it is hoped that during the wet season it will fill up and give a sufficient supply for all needs. It was also learned that when the local Indian wells went dry that they early in the morning and before the teacher and caretaker were on the job, did go to the school well for their daily water supply and when the teacher would wish water for the school and residence the Indians had drained it. This well should provide plenty of water after it has been given a chance to establish a reserve supply during the wet season.\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

This was confirmed by our supervising engineer, and the contractor. Weeping tile drainage was, therefore, not considered necessary. The foundation walls were covered with two coats of tar pitch, as waterproofing; and, as the building was twenty-five feet above the water level of the Thames River, it is difficult to state the reason for water infiltration as reported.\"\nIt is of course most undesirable that in the new schools there should be trouble with water in the basements, and our Architects have been instructed to give consideration to providing for drainage, not only around the foundation walls but also from the basement floor itself, in future schools.\n\nMr. Dudley, of our Architectural staff, will be in Western Ontario in a few days and we are asking him to make an inspection of the Oneida school.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nMay 13, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI forwarded a copy of your letter of April 18 to the Surveys & Engineering Branch. The engineer who was in charge of the construction of this school does not know any reason why there should be water in the basement as he states the usual water proofing precautions were taken.\n\nHowever, the fact remains that water does accumulate in the basement and Mr. Dudley of the architectural staff, who expects to visit Western Ontario in the near future, will make an inspection of the Oneida No. 1 school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Upon investigation with the school teacher, it appears that during the flooding of the basement this spring, the water entered through the wall stonework lines which obviously are construction joints formed by interruptions during the pouring of the concrete slab.\n\nAs the water level in the walls in the district was exceptionally high this year, it would appear that the flooding of the school was due to water in the soil and can only be prevented by rapid drainage of the soil around the building. It is considered that the installation of a 6\" drainage tile drain around the building will provide the drainage required to prevent flooding under such circumstances.\n\nEnclosed hereto is a plan in duplicate, for transmission to the Indian Affairs Branch, for their information and for their Agent in carrying out the proposed work.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.M.

I have been informed that this teacher has one child of her own who will be living in the residence with her and apparently neither Mrs. Wallace nor the child wish to use the same toilets as the Indian pupils attending the school. The estimated cost of a sanitary closet complete with pipes, elbows etc., would, with installation, be about $12.00.\n\nMrs. Wallace, the teacher, also requests that the Department provide her with a garage for her car. There is no garage at this school as a similar request from the former teacher of this school was not approved in your letter 7-5-1 of Sept. 13th, 1938. The new teacher intends to keep her car at the school throughout the term and is of the opinion that a garage should be supplied. A garage of metal construction such as was supplied at Lower Muncy and Back Settlement schools would, in my opinion, be most satisfactory and the estimated cost of same would be $100.00.\n\nI would wish to be advised if the Department approves of the above expenditures and if so, instructions regarding purchase of same would be appreciated.\n\nMrs. Wallace has also asked for permission to occupy the residence about one week in advance of the opening of school on October 1st and I would wish to be advised if this would meet with the approval of the Department. An early reply would be appreciated so that I may inform the teacher of the Department's decisions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. W. McCracken\nIn Charge\nCaradoc Agency.\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 2, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of August 28, you may expend an amount of $12.00 in installing a sanitary closet in the teacher's residence at the Oneida No. 1 Indian Day School. You may also allow Mrs. Wallace to occupy the teacher's residence about a week in advance of the opening of the school on October 1.\n\nIt has not been our practice in recent years to provide a garage at any Indian day school. Under these circumstances, favourable consideration cannot be given to the request of Mrs. Wallace for a garage at the Oneida No. 1 School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. M.

Wallace, teacher of the Oneida #1 Indian Day School, has again requested me to ascertain if the Department will approve of supplying her with a garage for her car.\n\nIn this connection I would refer you to my letter of August 26th, 1941, and Departmental reply 7-5-5 of September 26th, 1941, in which it is stated that approval of this expenditure could not be given. I advise Mrs. Wallace of the Department's decision but she has again appeared at this office suggesting that some second-hand garage or small building be provided for her use which would not be as expensive as a new garage. Mrs. Wallace has a car of quite recent manufacture and to avoid its deterioration she would appreciate some sort of garage for it as a protection against wind, sun, snow and rain.\n\nThis teacher is of the opinion that a second-hand garage or small building might be obtainable for approximately $25.00 and I would wish to be advised if the Department would approve of this expenditure providing we can locate such a building. If funds are available I would recommend that Mrs. Wallace be provided with a garage at an estimated cost of $25.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. W. McGracken,\nM. W. McGracken, In Charge\nCaradoc Agency.\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nNovember 3, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo with reference to the erection of a garage at the Oneida No. 1 School.\n\nAt the present time it is definitely not our policy to provide a garage for a teacher or an Indian day school. We will readily appreciate that if we build a garage at one school we would have similar requests from practically all of them.\n\nSince Mrs. Wallace was appointed teacher of this school the Government has provided a cost-of-living bonus and, as a result, Mrs. Wallace will receive $15 more salary than she originally expected. Besides, she has very comfortable living quarters and I do not feel that it is our responsibility to erect a garage simply because she purchased a car for her personal use.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Practically all the supplies which were purchased last year were used last winter. The supplies as listed on the enclosed Requisition should be sufficient to last for a period of fourteen weeks commencing December 1st, 1941. A hot cocoa drink would be given to the pupils four days a week, and soup would be prepared once a day for four evenings. It will be whether the Department intend to approve supplying school children with hot lunches during the winter months of 1941-1942 would be appreciated, at a total estimated cost of $140.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

This I regret has not been decorated and weather conditions at this season of the year are not favorable for this type of work. This is not neglect, but I am sure you will appreciate our difficulties with present day strained labour conditions. We have to operate on a \"catch as catch can\" policy in securing labour capable of performing even the most menial jobs.\n\nThe amount involved in the teachers' residence, namely $ 60.00 will shortly be returned to the Receiver General for credit. The amounts mentioned on other jobs were all more or less approximate.

Down, Indian Agent, Muncey, Ont.\n\nI have before me reports on the No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3 Oneida Indian Day Schools. Inspector Smith, in his report on the No. 2 School, states:\n\n\"Three or four fence posts in front of the school have been broken off and the fence is practically down.\"\n\nA reference to the No. 1 School reads:\n\n\"The doors of both the closets are off and lying on the ground. The teacher states that they were off on the opening of the school in September, were put on once and were again taken off. Nothing has been done about it since.\"\n\nThe officials here realise that our agents are experiencing a certain amount of difficulty in securing the help necessary to undertake repairs at Indian day schools and agency buildings throughout the Dominion. Nevertheless, the inspector's reference to the condition of the closets at the No. 1 School is somewhat disturbing. I have always taken the position that instruction in cleanliness and neatness is just as important at an Indian school as the teaching of any other subject, and I have been particularly insistent, throughout my stay with the Department, that outdoor closets should be kept clean, comfortable and in a good state of repair. Such work, I feel, should be fundamental in our educational scheme of things. It would be very much appreciated, therefore, if you would take the steps necessary to have these repairs undertaken at the earliest possible date. If Indians smile have formed the habit of removing these doors or in any way impairing departmental property, the matter should be discussed with the R.C.M.P.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMunczy, Ontario,\nDec. 15th, 1943.\n\nIndian Affairs' Branch,\nDept of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter dated December 16th in reference to Public School Inspector Smith's report on Oneida Indian Day Schools. I regret that these adverse reports are necessary and feel that much correspondence could be saved if the inspector conducted visits once or twice a year, contact our local Office and discuss problems to our mutual benefit. I am however, sure that you will appreciate the difficulties that I am, with many others, experiencing in securing labour for the many jobs that need attention.\n\nIn regard to the fence posts at No. 2 I have to advise that every year and throughout the year, there is a certain amount of repairing of fences due to the fact that they get off and let the wire down. It is regretted that Mr. Smith should have called at the school before we had a chance to repair them. It is most difficult in these strained days, to get any of our work done and we usually have to wait the other fellow's convenience. I have been waiting four months for electrical repairs to Agency buildings and each time I contact the electrician I am told \"in due time\".\n\nAs to the toilets at No. 1 both the teacher and I have become very much concerned about the wanton destruction of not only school property but personal property. Some person or persons deliberately slashed the tires of the teacher's automobile and generally played havoc with the inside. All efforts so far to learn the names of the guilty parties have failed. The pupils deny any knowledge of such destructiveness and I believe they are telling the truth. It is thought to be the work of a gang of boys of sixteen or seventeen. We no sooner get things repaired than they are torn down again. Whoever is responsible for this wantonness is operating not only within the confines of the Reserves but also in the village of Munczy. Our Departmental Nurse's private car has been stolen and damaged twice; stores and houses have been broken into and articles stolen. Three weeks ago 32 chickens were stolen from the Mt. Elgin Residential School. Two weeks ago Mr. Lockwood's store was broken into and $25 worth of goods stolen. One week ago three garages were broken into and windows smashed in cars; and two pairs of shoes stolen from Mr. Lockwood's car. These shoes were recovered, scattered throughout the Reserve. Even the Chippewa Council Hall received attention, windows were\nbroken and electric fixtures literally torn from the walls. Several Indian homes have been entered and goods and supplies taken. It is not only discouraging but disgusting, when everything possible is being done for their comfort, to have them do such things. The doors of the closets have been put back on three times, the last time with bolts instead of screws.\n\nThe R.C.M.P. and Provincial Police have been working on these reported cases and it is thought that the same persons are responsible both on and off the Reserves. All this may have no bearing on this particular school but we think it has. In any case it will serve to give you some idea of the character and minds of some of these people and when I say that the Cariboo Agency is the toughest assignment I have ever had, it is no exaggeration. However, you can be assured that during my term of administration everything possible is being, and will be, done to keep all buildings in a good state of repair with special emphasis placed on cleanliness.\n\nIn conclusion may I ask, \"Have I, at all times, the authority to go ahead and make all minor repairs without first submitting the requirements to Ottawa for consideration and approval?\"\n\nGeo. W. Down,\nINDIAN AGENT.\n\nG.WD/BC\nOttawa, December 20, 1943.\n\nThe Commissioner, Royal Canadian Mounted Police,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI am sending forward herewith copies of correspondence relating to conditions at the Oneida No. 1 and No. 2 Indian Day Schools, at the Caradoc Agency, Ontario.\n\nIn view of the rather disturbing information contained in Indian Agent Down's communication of December 15, it would be appreciated if we could have from you a report on the alleged outbreak of lawlessness at this agency.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nEncl.\nOttawa, December 20, 1943.\n\nMr. G. W. Down, Indian Agent, Muncey, Ont.\nRe: Condition of No. 1 and No. 2 Indian Day Schools.\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 15th instant and to thank you for the information contained therein. We are today communicating with the Commissioner of the R.C.M.P., with respect to the outbreak of lawlessness at your agency.\n\nWe note the enquiry sent forward by you in the last paragraph of your letter. In view of the limited funds at our disposal in this critical period, it is always advisable to secure departmental approval for any repairs that may be undertaken at Indian day or residential schools. If, however, you feel the necessity of incurring a small expenditure for the replacement of a door on an outside toilet, or incidental expenditures of this character, no difficulty will be experienced in the payment of such small accounts.\n\nR. A. Roy,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nToronto, Ont., Dec. 29, 1943.\n\nThe Commissioner, R.O.M. Police, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Conditions at Oneida Indian Reserve\n\nWith reference to the Asst. D.C.I.'s memorandum in the above connection under date of the 22nd instant and enquiries referred to therein, it is desired to point out that certain deprivations referred to in paragraph three of Indian Agent Down's report of the Indian Affairs Branch, under date of the 15th instant, have already been reported on by Cst. Needham, in charge of Muncey Detachment.\n\nIn this connection your attention is kindly drawn to Cst. Needham's report of 24-11-43, Re: Lloyd Burch (Indian) Juvenile, Muncey, Ontario, Section 3 Juvenile Delinquency, and B.E. & Theft, Ontario Provincial Police case \"O\" Division File #43T1380/257, concerning the theft of 32 chickens from the T.E. Algin Residential School, such matter has already been reported on, and your attention is drawn to another Detachment report of the 7th instant Re: Samuel Simon (Indian) Chippewa Indian Reserve, Ontario Theft of chickens, Section 570, C.O.C. \"O\" Division File #43T672-2/1.\n\nIt will therefore be seen that some of the complaints have been satisfactorily disposed of, but Cst. Needham is being instructed to submit a full report covering the destructiveness which is now apparently being perpetrated on the reserve, by young teen-aged Indian youths.\n\n(P.W. Schutz) Supt.,\nCommanding \"O\" Division.\nROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE\nHEADQUARTERS\n\nOTTAWA, January 5, 1944.\n\nRe: Conditions At Oneida Indian Reserve, Ont.\n\nFurther to your letter of December 20th last, in connection with the above, enclosed is copy of a memorandum dated the 28th ultimo, received from the Officer Commanding this Force at Toronto, dealing with the general conditions on the Oneida Indian Reserve.\n\n2. Reports covering the conviction of Samuel Simon, Section 370 of the Criminal Code (Theft of Chickens), and Molly Birch also charged with theft of chickens, Section 370, were forwarded to you on the 18th and 23rd of December 1943. A further report may be expected in due course covering the alleged outbreak of lawlessness on the reserve in question.\n\nH. Armitage, Insp.,\nAssistant Director,\nCriminal Investigation.\n\nTo: The Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nEncl.\n5. I might point out that no complaints have been received at this Detachment to date in connection with some person or persons deliberately slashing the tires on the teacher's automobile, nor has any complaint been received in connection with any damage done to the schools on the Ossipee Indian Reserve. All complaints being received at this Detachment are given prompt attention especially with any lawlessness on the Reserves, complaints originating off the Reserves are immediately turned over them to the Ontario Provincial Police who are given every assistance and cooperation by members of this Detachment.\n\n6. In conclusion I would like to point out that since taking over this Detachment I have given every assistance and cooperation to Indian Agent G.W. Down, and also his predecessor Mr. A.D. Moore, in the suppression of lawlessness, especially on the Reserves, and will continue to do so in the future. It is the opinion of the writer that the recent outbreak of lawlessness mentioned by Mr. Down, has now been stopped, with the arrest and conviction of SIMM, BURCH and BROCK.\n\nN.B.I.\n\nHANDED OVER.\n\nTHE COMMISSIONER:\n\n1. FORWARDED. It will be noted from Cat. Needham's report that the majority of the complaints made by Indian Agent Down of Muncey, have been investigated, and since the arrest and conviction of the three young Indians mentioned in this report, there seems to have been some abatement in the amount of lawlessness which have been perpetrated on the Onida Reserve.\n\n2. It might be mentioned that in Agent Down's report to his Department concerning the theft of shoes from Mr. J. Lockwood's car, and which he stated had been stolen throughout the Reserve, the shoes were actually located within 50 yards of the automobile from which they had been stolen. It would appear that young Burch has been responsible for quite a lot of the incidents reported on by Mr. Down, and it is felt that Cat. Needham is carrying out his duties with due diligence, ably assisted by the Ontario Provincial Police on any matters affecting Indians outside the Reserve.\n\nNaturally enough, if any complaints received by Agent Down or myself, the Departmental staff on the Reserve, are not referred to Cat. Needham, he probably has no means of knowing about them which precludes his following the cases up at the earliest possible moment. In the circumstances therefore, it is not considered that matters are in any way getting out of hand at Muncey in relation to the number of complaints reported, and it is considered that Cat. Needham has the general situation pretty well under control. CONCLUDED.\n\nToronto (F. W. Schute) Supt.,\n11-1-44 Commanding \"O\" Division\n\nD.\nWith reference to the above, and further to memorandum of Insp. G.S. McCollum dated 29-12-43, together with copy of letter forwarded by Indian Agent O.W. Down, to the Indian Affairs Branch, Dept't of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, Ont., on Dec. 15th, 1943.\n\nAs indicated in Mr. Down's letter, there has been an outbreak of lawlessness in this district during the past several weeks, and the writer, together with Prov. Sgt. J. Fulton, Stratford, Ontario, has been successful in bringing to a conclusion all complaints received, both on and off the Reserve. The following being a brief summary:\n\nLloyd JURCH (Indian) Juvenile, Amosybuta, Sec. 3 Juvenile Delinquents Act, B.C. & Theft (Please see report dated 7-12-43). This Indian was convicted and placed on probation for B.C. & Theft, from Lockwood's General Store, Amosybuta, Samuel SLAM (Indian) Childless aged 16, Theft of Chickens Sec. 370 C.C. of C. (Please see report dated 7-12-43). This Indian together with Lloyd JURCH and Hubert GROSSBICK (Indians) were arrested by the writer and later convicted for the Theft of thirty chickens, from the Mount Algoma Indian Residential School. In addition, JURCH was also convicted by the Court Provincial, on several charges of attempted theft of automobiles and the breaking and entering of one private home and one private garage, all these offenses taking place in the village of Amosybuta. I might point out that the 12 pairs of shoes that were stolen from Mr. J. Lockwood's car, were recovered by the writer and Prov. Sgt. Fulton, within 50 yards of the car from which they were stolen, and not scattered throughout the Reserve, also that the only car window that was broken, was the no draft window on Mr. Lockwood's car.\n\nNo complaints of any kind of lawlessness has been received at this Detachment since the arrest and conviction of SLAM, JURCH and GROSSBICK, who no doubt were responsible for most if not all of the lawlessness referred to by Mr. Down.\n\nIn connection with the reference made by Mr. Down, of the theft on two occasions of Mrs. Morrison's private car, I might point out that an attempt was made to steal this car on two occasions by Lloyd JURCH, but he only managed to get the car approximately 500 yards from the garage on both occasions having backed the car out of the garage on the starter, and then making an attempt to cross the ignition wires to get it started. Two Indian homes were also entered by JURCH; however, the complainants, Mrs. Dennis Fisher and Mrs. Mary Delaney, did not lay any charges; these cases however, were brought to the attention of the Magistrate, who took them into consideration when passing sentence.\n\nCONT'D ON PAGE 2.\nROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE\nHEADQUARTERS\n\nEX'D.\nOTTAWA, January 13, 1944.\n\nRe: Conditions at Oneida Indian Reserve, Ont.\n\nFurther to our letter of the 5th instant, in the above connection, attached is copy of our Muncey Detachment report dated the 3rd instant, dealing with conditions in general on the Oneida Indian Reserve.\n\nYour particular attention is drawn to paragraph 2 thereof. It would appear that since the conviction of the Indian youths referred to therein, conditions have improved somewhat on this reserve and the situation appears to be under control.\n\nF.A.

Down, Indian Agent,\nMUNCEY, Ontario.\n\nThe following is an extract from a recent report received from the Public School Inspector regarding the Oneida No. 1 School:\n\n\"The urinal is broken loose in the boys' toilet, the pump is not working and the door knobs on the two outside doors are not in working order.\"\n\nPlease make immediate arrangements for the necessary repairs.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nI have your letter of November 5th, with regard to repairs at the Onside No. 1 School, and note the Inspector's remarks. I am reminded of another Inspector who, a few years ago, after a urinal had been installed and operating successfully for several years and was still not giving trouble, reported to Ottawa that the hole was not large enough. I took two men out to look over the situation and do whatever was necessary and we were all three definitely of the opinion that it was a matter of \"opinion\". It would appear that some Inspectors are more concerned with doodle-bugs than they are with the education of children and that they have not yet awakened to the realization of material and labour short supply. However, being what I am, a civil servant which is almost a criminal offence in this Caradoc Agency, and the continual petty complaints, many of which by-pass this Office, I sometimes feel like \"blowing the lid\".\n\nI am wondering if the immensity and responsibility of the work at the Caradoc Agency is realized and appreciated, especially as I am without a Farm Instructor and a clerk? However, in view of the defects mentioned and I can assure you, as is always the case, everything is being done to keep all buildings in repair; but under present short supply conditions, for which I am not responsible, it is annoying to have responsible men report such things to Ottawa. The pump he mentions was away being repaired. If the Inspector would discuss such minor trivial repairs with local officials, much annoyance, correspondence and respect for his views would be saved.\n\nWith the new school, new road, repairing the old school, heating buildings, supervising and operating the Mt. Elgin Farm lands, individual Indian farm requirements, murders, vandalism, robberies, and an ever increasing Office routine, might I suggest that the Inspector be advised that in future such matters\nshould be taken up with local Officials who will at all times co-operate and make necessary repairs as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeo. W. Down,\nINDIAN AGENT.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDep't of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nGMD/JA\n\nSince dictation I have been advised of vandalism at No. 2 Oneida Indian Day School, where damage has been done to cut buildings, also Bear Creek, where the school has been broken into and boards ripped off the fuel shed.\nLOCKWOOD BROS.\nGroceries - Meat - Dry Goods\nOwens - Hardware\n\nMarch 23rd 1915\n\nW.

The expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter, File No.: Necesitated\n\nVoucher No.: 262\nDate: June 4/47\nMuncey, Ontario,\nJuly 26, 1947.\n\nInspection Report\nOneida No. 1\nIndian Day School\n\nThis is a comparatively new frame school (Teacher's Residence attached), with full basement and hot air furnace, built in 1938.\n\nSince completion there has been nothing done in the way of interior or exterior re-decorating. You may therefore expect that it begins to look shabby; in other words it is past due for complete re-decorating.\n\nI also examined the floor closely which appears to be softwood, and is wearing badly. The only thing to save it would be a covering of battleship linoleum or some other such material. The area, by measurement, including the two annexes, is approximately 850 square feet. These, of course, are major jobs and will have to be considered in the very near future.\n\nThe minor repairs, which I am endeavouring to have completed before school reopens, are as follows\u2014\n\nNecessary replacement of window glass\nRehanging of door in basement\nRepair of outside approach handrails\nRepair of outside steps\nRepair of doors on toilets\nNew, complete, lock set on classroom door\nOne gallon paint for new woodwork\n\nand I trust my action meets with your approval.\n\nWith regard to major repairs please do not ask for estimates. At present I cannot find any person interested enough to drive into Muncey to even look at a job. I can only suggest that whatever you approve that I be given authority to proceed, and I will do my best to get these jobs under way.\n\nGeo. W. Down,\nINDIAN AGENT.\nMuncey, Ontario,\nJuly 28, 1947.\n\nTwo or three years ago Mr. Doucet, in my company, inspected all Day Schools of the Caradoc Agency and he will perhaps recall conditions and some of the comments and suggestions at that time. Since then we have passed through a difficult period and I realize that our buildings, owing to many circumstances particularly shortages of materials, shortages of labour and insufficient funds\u2014all of which were beyond our control, did not improve with the years. Even when small allotments were provided it was difficult to proceed beyond the hopeful stage. It was with this thought in mind that I recently visited all schools and made thorough inspections as to major, and immediate minor repairs. I also feel that I should make a statement as to River Settlement School, and Back Settlement School.\n\nIndividual reports are attached, hereto. In submitting them it must be kept in mind that I cannot promise anything in the way of any repairs. Labour shortage and material shortages are still factors to be considered but I will do my best if given authority to proceed.\n\nGeo. W. Down,\nINDIAN AGENT.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept' of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nGWD/EC\n\nEnclos\nOttawa, August 5th, 1947.\n\nMr. Geo. W. Down, Indian Agent,\nMuncey, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 28th ultimo, regarding Onside No. 1 School, we approve your making arrangements for the minor repairs required.\n\nWe also approve any other repairs that you consider necessary at this building, keeping in mind our purchase regulations.\n\nBernard Y. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMuncey, Ontario,\nAug. 12, 1947.\n\nYour File 7-7-7 WT1)\nOneida No. 1\n\nI wish to refer to the last paragraph of your letter of August 5th. Does this mean that estimates must be received and forwarded for consideration? If so I regret that I cannot proceed under the regulations. As I pointed out in my correspondence it is difficult to get any person or firm interested enough to drive in to Muncey to give estimates. In fact I am invariably met with a flat refusal and the statement \"we do not have to drive 25 miles these days to give estimates and we do not have to drive 25 miles to do our work\" - rather a nasty statement but conditions today are such that tradesmen are not looking for jobs.\n\nI can only suggest that I be given authority to purchase materials, if possible, when and where available and hire help, if possible, to do the work where and when available; otherwise all such jobs which may be termed major must be abandoned until Departmental regulations can be complied with. Even with such authority I cannot promise the work will be done. The pressure on the labour situation is terrific. The same conditions would apply to Oneida No. 2 School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeo. W.

Canon Prewer, relative to the building of small school buildings on the Letagami & Bleas Reserves for the Indians.\n\nOn my annuity trip I went into this matter fully with these Bands and they are very anxious that something should be done along the lines suggested that their children might be educated and I wish to recommend that the Department give these requests serious consideration.\n\nThese bands have become fairly well established and the move towards a school would encourage them to remain on the reserves instead of scattering all over the North country as they have been in the habit of doing the past number of years and getting broken up in several small little groups with no self appointed leader, and which is very bad practice both socially and otherwise for the different bands and were a small school erected there would be suitable teacher to teach the children it would be an incentive for them to remain on the reserve and allow the men to go out and trap and hunt, which is the only manner of making a living these Indians in this Agency seem to know.\n\nWaiting your instructions I beg to remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) T. J. Godfrey.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER FROM REV. CANON PREWER,\nSpecial Missionary, Western Moosonee Mission,\nSudbury, Ont., August 2nd, 1934.\n\nOrig. on 65-3-1.\n\nThe Indians on the Matagamah Reserve, situated\n17 miles north of the village of Gogama, on the C. N. Railway,\nask for a building to be erected to serve as a school-house,\nwith a room attached for the accommodation of a teacher, as\nexpeditiously as possible.\n\nThey point out the fact that they have quite\nwillingly conformed to the Department's regulation and have\nmoved back on to their reserve, not without a good deal of\nlabour and sacrifice, and that in the very near future there\nwill be something like 30 families settled there, where most\nof them have already constructed tidy little log houses and\ncleared and planted their gardens.\n\nThere are 25 children of school age resident on the\nreserve, and by next spring this number will be augmented\nby 10 more. They agree to do a great deal of the work them-\nselves, voluntarily, and propose that a log building be\nerected, but lumber for flooring and other purposes will be\nrequired, together with windows and doors, and the whole\ncost may mount up to about $750.00.\n\nThey would like the sanction of the Department to\nthis proposition at once and for work to commence before the\nweather becomes too cold and the season becomes too far\nadvanced, so that the building is completed before they have\nto leave for their trap-lines. Most of the families, with\nchildren, will reside on the reserve all winter, while the\nmen attend to their trapping.\nFebruary 5, 1935.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. O.R.B.,-\n\nMETTAGAMI: To assist in the erection of school building with rooms attached for living accommodation of teacher - $750.00\n\nThere are 26 children of school age. In the erection of a building, the Indians have agreed to do a great deal of the work themselves, voluntarily, and they propose that a log building be erected, but lumber for clearing, windows, doors and certain other material will have to be supplied. This school is in the Chapleau Agency, and Mr. Agent Godfrey would, no doubt, be able to arrange for a suitable site. He would also arrange with the Indians to do the greater part of the labour. It might be necessary to use the services of a White foreman.\n\nThe Anglican Missionary for the district reports that the Indians themselves state a log building for school purposes would be satisfactory and that, as they will do a great part of the labour, voluntarily, the amount above stated would be sufficient to carry out the work.\n\nThis reserve is situated 17 miles north of the village of Gogama, on the C. N. R.\n\nFunds for the purpose, to the above amount, are included in the Estimates for the fiscal year 1935-36.\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. Duthie\nJune 10, 1935.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Indians of the Matagami Reserve on the C. N. R. Railway are asking for the erection of a building to serve as a school house with room attached for accommodation for a teacher.\n\nI understand that there are 23 children of school age on this reserve. It has been suggested that the building be built of logs and that the Indians would perform the necessary labour.\n\nI would ask you to kindly furnish the department with your views on the establishment of this school, and the best procedure to be followed in case same is erected.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\n[Signature]\n\nH. J. Godfrey, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChapleau, Ont.\nReplying to Official letter of June 10th, #65-3-5, relative to the building of school houses for the Indians on the Metagami, and Elias Reserves, I beg leave to report as follows on the matter.\n\nOn these reserves there would be children of school age to the number of 20 with many more coming along of younger age which possible in the course of another year there would be at least 25 children on each of the reserves of school age.\n\nWhile on my trip paying treaty I examined the proposed location for the buildings and have decided on what I considered proper locations with plenty of space for playgrounds.\n\nThe Indians have agreed to do all the unskilled labour and it would be necessary to have a skilled workman to do the necessary work to be done by a good carpenter; there is also the matter of certain regulations laid down by the Educational Department which will have to be complied with; this necessarily will increase the cost; there is also the teachers quarters which have to be taken care of as there is no suitable place for the teacher to live as it would be impossible for to secure a teacher who could live at one of the Indian homes but going into the matter carefully I believe the buildings could be erected complying with the regulations of the educational department including the teachers quarters and the preceding amount $1400.00 this amount would include the painting, and stove for to take care of the heating.\n\nThe Indians are very anxious to have the work go ahead in fact so anxious are they that they are now at work clearing and stumping the grounds, and I would strongly recommend that this work be proceeded with at once while the nice weather is on so that no loss of time may be experienced, and as both these schools are Department of some distance from the railway all material has to be Indian Affairs taken in by water route which makes it necessary to get Ottawa, Ont. the material on the ground in good weather.\n\nWaiting your instructions on the matter I remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAgent.\nDear Sirs:\n\nWhen Mr. Indian Agent Godfrey made his treaty payments this year, on the 24th of June, at Ross and at Matagamah, he advised both bands that your department had finally acceded to their requests for the erection of day schools on their reserves.\n\nThe Indians were greatly pleased with the department's decision, and agreed to start at once to clear the sites and get out the heavy foundation timber, slopes and cedar posts, and received permits from the Forestry Branch for the burning of all brush etc. The Don Larkes Lumber Company at Ross loaned the people a horse to pull the stumps and the logs, and the Poupoura Lumber Co., of Gogama offered a team for the Matagamah people's use.\n\nOwing to the fact that Mr. Godfrey is so far removed from the source from which material for building would have to be secured, he asked me to try and get an estimate of the amount of material required and the approximate cost.\n\nKeeping in view the requirements as laid down by the Provincial Education Act, as to light and floor space for schools to accommodate an enrollment of from 25 to 30 pupils I was forced to the conclusion that a building 30x30 would be required, with an entrance to serve as a cloak room, and an annex at the rear 20x12 to serve as quarters for a teacher would be necessary.\n\nI find after getting in estimates of costs of material, and by employing one capable man as carpenter, that such a building could possibly be erected for somewhere about $1400.00. It would mean however that some of the work would have to be done free of cost by the Indians themselves. The cost of freighting in the materials, especially to Matagamah, a distance of 17 miles will come somewhat high. I have already got an estimate of this cost, and I believe it will take fully two weeks before all material can be assembled, which will then be summer quite far advanced. I have hoped the buildings would be in readiness for use by Sept 15th.\n\nI have been in communication with Mr. Godfrey regarding this matter and he advised me that he had no further word as to what the Dept. was prepared to do. In his thought it is advisable for me to take up the matter with you.\n\nI have a plan drawn of the building it is proposed to erect, which I am enclosing, but I have not gone into detailed specifications.\n\nThe height of the walls would be 8' ft. It shall be of frame, sheeted inside and out with ship-lap cove ed over with asphalt paper, inside, outside with 'pop siding and inside with wainscoting up to windows and the upper part with V joint lumber. The roof would be sheathed with ship-lap and covered with No. 1 roofing material, which would be of brick.\n\nI am most anxious to see these buildings erected, as I expect to have to go West as far as Calgary in September and would like to know that they are an assured fact before I leave. This is my excuse for taking up the matter with you. Believe if your department is agreeable, that I can guarantee a very strongly constructed and serviceable building for the price mentioned, and shall await with expectation upon your decision.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs School Files (1920-1960), Volume 618-5, Part 1\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nSeptember 5, 1935.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Bushard,\n\nIt is proposed to build a small Indian Day School for the Indians of the Matagami Indian Reserve on the C.

This would mean, however, that part of the work would have to be done, free of cost, by the Indians, themselves.\n\nConsideration will be given to providing the funds required - approximately $1,800 - in the Estimates for the coming fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

In any event, it is unlikely that the work will be proceeded with at Elzas.\n\nYou might again refer this matter to the attention of the Department about the middle of May, next, at which time we will, no doubt, be aware if funds to erect the school building at Metagami are provided.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

In forwarding this estimate, it should be kept in mind that the Department will be unable to consider the building of a school on this reserve unless the cost of both material and labour will not exceed $1,500.\n\nNo funds are available this year for the erection of a school at Kapuskasing.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT. J. Godfrey, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChapleau, Ont.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nDuring my recent visit to the Mattagami Reserve in company with Indian Agent Godfrey and Canon Prager we visited the site of the Day School on that reserve.\n\nThe Indians have cleared the ground and have finished the foundation by raising heavy cedar posts and placing the main sides in position.\n\nCanon Prager informs me that he will send in an estimate of the cost of the building in a few days and I would recommend that construction be commenced as soon as possible. The Canon is quite prepared to supervise the purchase of the necessary material and he is of the opinion that the Indians can do all the necessary work with the assistance of one white carpenter.\n\nThere are 32 children of school age on the reserve and the Indians are very anxious to see the school completed.\n\nThere is a sawmill at Togo, about 6 miles from the reserve where the rough lumber etc., can be purchased at a cheap rate. The Department estimate of $1500 for the cost may be sufficient, but if not the cost should not exceed $1700.\nWESTERN MOOSONEE MISSION\nCanon Brewer\nSPECIAL MISSIONARY\n\nSudbury, Ont., June 27th, 1936.\n\nTo J. Godfrey Sagr.,\nIndian Agent,\nJapleson, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to the erection of a Day School on the Indian Reserve at Matacanah, which place we visited yesterday in company with Mr. Murray of the Lands' Branch of the Department of Indian Affairs,\n\nI prepared and forwarded a suggested plan, with rough modifications, to the department about a year ago. I had secured costs of material, labour, transportation, etc., and figured that this style of building could be put up at a cost of about $1,500.00; but I rather think that we could not build for that figure at the present time as cost of material has gone up, and stocks of squared lumber, which were then lying, and easy of access, in the lumber Company's yard, at Ogunna have all been sold.\n\nI believe, however, that a building, to conform to the Department's requirements can be erected at a cost not to exceed $1,750.00. This would include painting and the proposed quarters for the teacher as shown on my plan.\n\nIf the department is satisfied to authorize the erection of such a building, I shall be prepared to see to its erection, employing only one skilled carpenter, and giving the Indian men the other work. I will contract to build the school or see that it is put up by day labour, plus the regular 15% for my services, to cover travel, etc. I would like to have the plans back.\nI beg leave to acknowledge Official letter No.65-3-5 of June 4th, and upon visiting the Ketagami Reserve last week in company with Mr. Bury, of the Department, and looked over the site for the school which is quite satisfactory, but in going into the cost of the erection of the building of which the main part of the labor would be done by the Indians but it would be necessary to hire a Carpenter to take charge and direct the work as there is no man among the Indians who is capable of doing the work or taking charge of the work.\n\nWhen the estimate was given last year it was made up from cost of material at Gogama, and now that this Mill has been burned down and the lumber Company moved away material is much more expensive and the building could not be built for the sum of $1,500.\n\nSince returning home I have received a letter from Rev. Cannon Prever, relative to this building, and I am enclosing it for your perusal, possibly the building could be erected for $1750.00 but I consider Cannon Prever's rather costly for his supervision as he visits Gogama weekly and it is only 20 miles to the reserve, and he would not have to visit the Reserve more than at the most three times, the only other work he would have to attend too would be the ordering of the material from Sudbury, and it would appear that his asking $156 is rather out of the way, and if the Department cannot expend more than as stated it will be out of the question to erect it for $1,500.\n\nWaiting your instruction I remain:\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent.\nGogama, Ont\n5th May 1937\n\nT.J. Godfrey Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChapleau,\nOnt.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI and the Metagami Indians would be interested to learn just what the Department of Indian Affairs intends in regard to the erection of an Indian School on the Metagami Reserve.\n\nSome years ago, when the Indians were instructed to remove themselves from Gogama and to take up residence at Fort Metagami, the Department promised that a school would be constructed on the reserve.\n\nThe Indians accepted this arrangement and left Gogama. They prepared the site for the school and constructed a foundation. So far nothing has been done about the school and, in the meantime, quite a number of children are growing up without the benefit of schooling.\n\nWe would ask you to obtain a definite reply or promise from the Department as soon as conveniently possible. The Indians have kept their part of the bargain and it is up to the Department to keep its part.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJames Ward,\nChief Metagami Ojibways.\nChapleau May 8th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to official letter No.65-3-5 of June 4th, 1936, and the building of a school for the Indians on the Ketagami reserve Chapleau Agency I beg leave to enclose letter received from the Chief Jas. Ward of this band asking that something be done regarding a school for the children on the reserve.\n\nAs I will be making my annuity trip to this reserve in June I would like to be in a position to advise the Indians what they may expect in the way of a school being erected for them.\n\nI would like to mention that these Indians have settled on the reserve and are very contented except that the lack of a school for the children is causing them some worry.\n\nIn your letter last year it was pointed out that the sum of $1,500 might be available, but as this had to cover the cost of quarters for the teacher as well it was barely sufficient to meet the cost of the building necessary to take care of the needs and the matter was left to stand; and if you will advise me whether the Department will consider the erection of the school this year or not I would be grateful to know that I might explain to them while on my trip to them in June.\n\nThere is also the matter of the school for the Indians on the Kapuskasing reserve for the Brunswick Indians they are also asking for the erection of a school.\n\nWaiting what information you can give me I beg to remain;\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 13, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 8th instant, with reference to the erection of a school on the Metagami Reserve.\n\nIt is not found possible to provide any funds for the erection of this building during the coming summer.\n\nIn the letter from Chief James Ward, he states that the Indians have prepared a site for the school and constructed a foundation. When you visit the reserve, you should ascertain the size of the foundation and its condition and you should, also, obtain definite information regarding the probable cost of erecting a school. You should, also, ascertain the number of children of school age and where a teacher could reside in the event of a school being built.\n\nOn your return, you should write to the Department and an endeavour will be made to secure the necessary funds in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1938-39.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM.

Bury wrote as follows in July, 1936: \"The Indians have cleared the ground and have finished the foundation by sinking heavy cedar posts and placing the main sills in position\". Please let me know the size of this foundation and its condition. If you consider the foundation mentioned by Mr. Bury is not suitable, would you recommend a basement?\n\nOur file also indicates that there will be approximately 30 children of school age. You should state if this number is correct.\n\nDo you consider it necessary to provide living quarters for the teacher and, if so, would the present foundation be sufficiently large to permit the erection of a building containing living quarters?\n\nDo you consider the building should be erected by contract or by day labour under a competent firm? If you prefer the latter method, please let me know if there are Indians who could be employed.\n\nI presume that wood will be used as fuel\n\n(and do you consider)\nSir,-\n\nI beg leave to acknowledge receipt of Official letter #65-3-5 of November 4th, relative to the proposed school on the Ketagami Reserve.\n\nThe foundation mentioned is hardly suitable for the placing of a suitable building; for a school as it is only four logs hewn and placed upon a few Cedar posts not number enough to hold the building, the size being 10'x 40' with some clearing around the site but not sufficient for protection, the building could either face east or south whichever most desirable, and I would recommend a Cement basement if a wood furnace is used for heating if stove to be used for heating a Cement wall would be best.\n\nThere should be living quarters provided for the teacher as there is no accommodation whatever as the school is 20 miles from the settlement of Gogama and by water, would recommend separate quarters for the teacher small building or room built to back of main school building.\n\nWould recommend the building being erected by contract, and there are some Indians who could assist in the work but are not mechanics but very handy workmen.\n\nI would recommend that there be a basement sufficiently large for a wood furnace with heater pipe to teachers quarters, with only surface foundation for main part of building with basement only sufficiently large enough to accommodate the furnace with some further space for wood.\n\nThere are about 30 children at present time of school age, this might increase once the school was erected as there are families living off the reserve who would return once the school was established.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept.

The information contained in the second paragraph of your letter indicates that a much larger site should be cleared. Would it not be possible to have the Indians do this work without cost to the Department during the coming winter, in order that there may be a sufficiently large site available next Spring for the erection of the new school.\n\nPlease let me hear from you in connection with this suggestion as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

I would appreciate your forwarding a sketch plan of the building that you consider suitable, in order that we may submit it to our Indian Agent, who is in charge of the Matagami Reserve.\n\nIn preparing the plan, please note the following:\n\nFirst: That the school be erected on the Matagami Reserve, which is 20 miles from Gogama, Ontario. Materials would have to be hauled from Gogama by water.\n\nSecond: The Department desires a building with: (a) basement, (b) classroom to accommodate between 30 to 40 pupils, (c) living accommodation for teacher.

Do you consider that the Board of Trade is recommending the erection of a log building and are you of the opinion that the Indians would give their services free of charge for the erection of a school on this Reserve?\n\nThis information has not previously been supplied to me from your office and in view of the rather definite statement made by the President of the Gogama Board of Trade the Department wishes to receive from you a complete report outlining your views on the matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

The Indian Agent stated that he had arranged for this clearing work to be done by the Indians last winter and nothing was done. I would suggest that at least $150.00 be spent in clearing and underbrushing adjacent to the site. This is outside the necessary clearing to be done by the contractor but he should not be asked to clear the whole school yard area. Indian Agent Godfrey is going to try and obtain at least a similar amount for additional clearing.

Reserve Day School after the forest fire that passed through there.\n\nWhen in paying Annuity money I had the chance to thoroughly examine the school, and it is simply due to the good work of the Indians that it is standing at all; the fire went all around it, and by carrying pails of water from the well the Indians kept the building from any other damage than that caused by smoke and heat.\n\nIt had been well cleaned up by some of the Indian women and I am enclosing some small accounts in their favour.\n\nThe paint all round the building had been badly scorched, is all curled off and will have to be scraped off and repainted. I might say here, that although from the specifications I have in the office, that the building should have had three coats of paint when built, I would say from my own experience that it is doubtful if it had two; there is no sign of any priming coat; even some places that the fire did not affect so much is also peeling off, and it looks as though a coat of gloss paint was all that it got; however, it will now take about five gallons of flat white and five gallons of gloss white to give it sufficient protection from the weather.\n\nI have enquired here and find that I can get a good grade of paint delivered to Gogama at the price of $3.90 per gallon, brushes also will be needed if the Indians are to do the work, of which I think\nthey are quite capable, and I would suggest the purchase of four brushes, 4\" wide at a cost of $1.95 each.\n\nIf I had your authority to purchase these items, also to hire Indians to do the work, I think I can arrange to get it done satisfactorily; I intend visiting this reserve again about the end of the month, and could make any necessary arrangements then.\n\nPlease let me know what you desire to have done here, as it certainly should have some protection while the weather is warm.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nF.

Mathies\nAgent\n\nDATE: May 10, 1947\nOttawa, December 2, 1947.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have for answer your letter of November 28th. Unfortunately the Department some years ago decided against the policy of providing money for Christmas treats. At that time we were being overwhelmed with requests for assistance and in some instances the Indians could have raised a little money themselves to provide for their treats.\n\nIn certain of our more isolated schools we are providing a small grant for noon day lunch. A search of our files seems to indicate that although your school is receiving a supply of vitalized biscuits you are not in receipt of this grant for the purchase of lunch supplies. Therefore, we are prepared to make a grant of up to $3.00 a month for November and December of 1947 and January, February and March of 1948 for this purpose.\n\nIt is understood that your school supplies have gone forward and should have reached you by now. We are arranging to forward a football, a softball and softball bats (the latter for use in the Spring). We do not provide boxing gloves or skates. We are also requisitioning for some crepe paper which I hope will reach you in time.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nAupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev.

Working a 10 hour day at $0.75 an hour, the cost would be $225.00.\n\nI might point out here that before the painting can be done, all the outside wood work will have to be scraped, which accounts for the estimated 15 days it will take to do the job.\n\nTrusting this meets with your approval.\n\nJ.

It is noted that the work will be done by Indians and that the paint required is on hand.\n\nIf you require an advance for labour, you may forward a request about 15th April, 1949, on which date we expect to have funds available from the appropriation for the fiscal year 1949-50.\n\nPP/ST\n\nBernard F.

If you have not received the account, you should let me know. An immediately reply would be appreciated.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nPovin\nTORONTO I,\nJuly 6th, 1949.\n\nMR.

Eaton Co. with an account for paint for Mattagami Day School attached.\n\nThis invoice apparently covers paint supplied last summer for Mattagami Day School.\n\nA requisition for this paint was sent from this office July 14th 1948. The receipt of the requisition was acknowledged by 65-3-6(2.1) of July 19th 1948 from B.F. Neary. The paint was received at Mattagami in August last summer, but today we had not received a copy of the invoice except the one enclosed.\n\nWe do not have a copy in this office of the purchase order for this paint and I am therefore forwarding this account for you to check against the original purchase order and if correct enter for payment.\n\nJ.L.

Whitney,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nChapleau, Ontario.\n\nRe: Mattagami Indian Day School\nYour File: 76-3-92 (65)\n\nWe have your letter of July 13th enclosing letter and account received from T. Eaton Company. In connection with the above, I would refer you to your letter of February 25th which reads as follows:\n\n\"Re: Purchase Order 32454\n\nReplying to your form letter concerning the above. This is to advise you that the items covered by this purchase order have been received and the invoice passed for payment covered by voucher #770(65) December 31/48.\"\n\nWe replied to that letter in our communication of March 12th to which no reply has been received.\n\nPlease review our letter of March 12th and if we were correct in assuming that some of the items on the T. Eaton account were included on your Voucher 45(65) for $49.36, they should be deducted from the attached account and a Voucher covering the balance should be forwarded. However, if there is no duplication...\nyou should forward a voucher for the full amount, because we are unable to find any record of having received it previously.\n\nPP/SP Attach.\n\nBernard F.

Henry\n\nWhile paying treaty at Matogami Reservation early this month, the state of repair of the steps and porch to both entrances of the school was drawn to my attention. I found the railings broken, the steps rotting and the flooring in a very unsafe condition.\n\nTo do this repair work, it will be necessary to purchase approximately one hundred and twenty-five feet of porch flooring, one hundred and eighty feet 2 x 4 and fourteen feet 4 x 4 and the necessary nails, etc. Mr. William Moore, an Indian of this reservation is capable of doing the necessary repair work at a wage of $70 per hour.\n\nI would request your authority to purchase the necessary material and hire Mr. Moore to do the work. I feel that this work should be done at once as the platforms are unsafe to the point where Nurse Bartlett went through a narrow escape of serious injury on a recent visit to the reserve.\n\nJ. L.

Whitney,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nChapleau, Ontario.\n\nRe: Metagami Indian Day School\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 21st instant, the Department approves your making the necessary repairs to the step and porch to both entrances of the above school. It is noted that you can secure the material and labour and can engage Mr. W. Moore, an Indian, to do the work. Please keep the cost as low as possible.\n\nPP/ST\n\nBernard F.

I find secondly that the amount of $99.49 on Voucher No. 4565 is for part of the materials included in the above purchase order.\n\nThe paint, etc., listed on the enclosed invoice account W-2100 is the balance of purchase order No. 458-5-21 and to my knowledge, it has not been submitted prior to this time.\n\nI am, therefore, enclosing Voucher No. 4565 for the amount of $99.49 in favour of T.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, signing it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grants will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days' attendance of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

It would be preferable to have them delivered some two weeks before that date, if possible. The Department recognizes that it is difficult to crate these goods to avoid breakage, but would ask you to give your best attention to this. As there is a Church of England school at this point also it is necessary that the address should be clearly given.\n\nYour account for these goods, in duplicate, with receipt certified by Revillon Bros., should be forwarded to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMessrs.

Goodwins Ltd. told us that they were for Albany. We presume that these goods are the ones mentioned in your folio 30297/4 and in our letter to you dated April 12th.\n\nWe tried to refuse delivery of these desks, as we do not wish to transport them uncrated to James Bay. Goodwins Ltd answered that they were unable to keep them any longer in their store, and absolutely refused to pack same. The goods were left on our hands under the strongest protest.\n\nWe have them stored momentarily in our office at Montreal.\n\nWe wish to ask you to give your instructions to Goodwins Limited, to have them taken back at once and properly packed. If these desks and seats are not crated securely by the above date, inside of a few days, we will not transport them to James Bay, as we do not wish to see them smashed to bits on our steamer, during the trip North.\n\nFurthermore, we beg to advise you that we will ship them to Ottawa, if Goodwins Ltd go on refusing to crate them or to take them off our hands.\n\nWe have no place for them here, their storage on the wharf uncrated being, of course, out of the question.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nRevillon Freres Trading Co., Limited.\n\n[Signature]\n\nVice President\nMontreal, July 2/13.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nGoodwins Limited of this City, brought to our office in Montreal, the following quantities of double desks and seats:\n\n- 2 double desks\n- 2 double desks\n- 1 double desk\n- 2 double desks\n\nThese desks and seats are uncrated and unmarked.

The Department regrets that they are not satisfactory. I have to ask you to be good enough to render them and keep the desks for the two schools, Fort Albany and Bersimis, separate and mark on each of the accounts the school for which the desks were intended.\n\nIt is also noted that you have six rear seats in the account presumably for the Fort Albany School whereas only three were ordered by the Department.\n\nIt is also noted that the account for moving the desks from Revillion Bros., to your warehouse and back again, $4.00, is charged to the Bersimis School, whereas it should be included in the Fort Albany account.\n\nI would also ask you to be good enough to state whether you prepaid the railway freight on the Bersimis desks, as, if so, the shipping bill should be attached to the account.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Boarding School.\n\nKindly forward your account, in duplicate, to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMessrs. Hurd & Co.,\nSparks St.,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 15th, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to transmit herewith an account of $16.00 from Mr. Smith's Limited, for which they are pressing the Department. The account is for four desks which it is claimed belong to Sister Edward for use in the Caughnawaga school. It has not been found possible to trace in the Department any order for these desks. If authority was granted for purchase, you may attach the account to voucher forms and certify thereto, provided the desks were received in good order, after which you could return it to the Department. The authority for purchase should be noted on the face of the voucher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Secretary.\nOttawa, February 15th., 1917.\n\nSirs,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 3rd February and the accounts therewith submitted, in regard to which correspondence has been had with you; and in reply I beg to say that your account of $18.00 for four desks which were sent to Sister Edward for use at the Indian School on the Caughnawaga Reserve, has been sent to the Indian Agent, Mr. Brossard for his certificate. When it is returned to the Department, duly certified, the matter of payment will be given consideration.\n\nYour account of $49.00 for clocks, desks, etc., delivered to the Hudson's Bay Company for transportation to Fort Albany, James Bay, should have been certified by the Officer of the Hudson's Bay Company to whom the goods were delivered. This fact, I may say was pointed out to you in letter of the 12th May, 1916, (File No. 127,453-4), when the order for the goods was given, with a view to the adjustment of this matter, it is desired you will procure a receipt from the Hudson's Bay Company effecting that the goods charged for in your account of $49.00 delivered to them for transportation to Fort Albany, which you should send to the Department. When it is received, payment of your account will be considered.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMessrs. Goodwin's Limited, Aest.

If possible, he should obtain competitive prices for the purchase of any material used in the work.\n\nI will be pleased if you will instruct the principal as to the requirements of the Department regarding the vouchers necessary in order to make payment of the amount provided.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

These expenses cover work done and material purchased together with freight on the latter.\n\nThe figures have been sent to me by the Principal of the School and as I have to prepare the account in its definite form Mr Ferrier before leaving said that my signature was sufficient to certify said account.\n\nI have already visited Kenora School and will be kept busy upon the return of Rev.

It is necessary, in order to satisfy the requirements of the Auditor General, and to carry out the established rule of the Department in making payments of this kind, that a certificate be received that the work of moving the building and the completion of the additions and repairs has been satisfactorily performed, before payment of the amount appropriated for the purpose can be made.\n\nKindly have the authorities in charge of the work forward properly itemized accounts, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of any material required and for the labour employed. Receipts should be obtained in duplicate for the amounts paid out to the individual labourers employed, and these should show the number of days each was engaged and the amount paid per day.\n\nAs soon as we are assured that the work has been satisfactorily completed and the accounts received in proper order, payment will be made up to the amount provided by Parliament for the purpose.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev.

Gen. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nMy Dear Mr. Scott:\n\nAs a sequel to our conversation of recent date, I take the liberty to request the reconsideration of the decision contained in your letter of July 6th, regarding the amount of $2567.49 for expenses incurred up to March 14th, 1922, by the management of Fort Albany Indian Boarding School, in connection with the moving of the building to a new site and reconstruction of same.\n\nYour letter states that in order to satisfy the requirements of the Auditor General and to carry out the established rule of the Department, it is necessary, in order to reduce the amount provided for in the Estimates ($6,000.00) that a certificate proving completion of the work be filed with the Department.\n\nKindly allow me to tell you that a grant was asked from the Department on account of our inability to meet such an expenditure and therefore we expected the amount appropriated to be paid as the work was going on. Though our men have been working steadily during the present year we do not expect the work to be completed before the Fall of 1923; consequently the amount voted for would not be used for the purpose intended during the fiscal year (1922-23). As His Grace Bishop Hall\u00e9 already impressed upon you the transfer and rebuilding of the school are works of pressing necessity.\n\nI understand that the Department is governed by rules established upon experience and wisdom. However, do you not think that in a case like the present one an exception should be made? I leave the whole matter to your judgment and, as you are perfectly conversant with the situation of Fort Albany, so effective in its work but so far remote from civilization, I am convinced that you will follow the course most appropriate to the benefit of the school and the advantage of the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJoseph [Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nOttawa, Oct. 19, 1922.\n\nMemorandum.\n\nHonourable Charles Stewart:\n\nIn the Main Estimates 1922-23 for Indian Education, there was an item of \u00a38,000 to assist the Albany Mission (in C.) Indian Boarding School with their expenses in moving to a new site and to help to pay the cost of certain additions and alterations. Accounts for labour, gasoline and freight amounting to \u00a32953.42 have been presented. May I have your authority to issue a cheque to the Provincial of the Order in Montreal.\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nHonourable Charles Stewart:\n\nIn the Main Estimates 1922-23 for Indian Education, there was an item of $2,000 to assist the Albany Mission (H.C.) Indian Boarding School with their expenses in moving to a new site and to help pay the cost of certain additions and alterations. Accounts for labour, gasoline and freight amounting to $294.75 have been presented. May I have your authority to issue a cheque to the Provincial Secretary of the Order in Montreal.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nRECONSTRUCTION:\u2014An amount of $8,000.00 was voted at the last Session as a bonus towards the reconstruction of this school which has become imperative. In fact, I am told that the school is a menace to the lives of the inmates with the consequence that the Staff and children have moved to other quarters (the fathers' rectory) and are carrying on the work the best they can. The work of reconstruction has begun and it was intended to complete the work in the Fall of 1923. Through some misfortune it is now foreseen that the work will not be completed at the stated time but only in the course of the following year. I take the liberty of asking that whatever part of the grant which will remain unpaid at the end of the present fiscal year stand over for the next in order that the school receive the full amount so generously given by the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nTelephone: [Signature]\nListe :\n\nUn jeu de tennis :\n1) Filet (net)\n2) Balles (2 doz. d'argent)\n3) Raquettes (4)\n4) Bandes (pour marquer les bornes de la table de tennis)\n\nBallons (marque : Association)\n6 enveloppes de cuir avec leurs versos et aoutines\n6 versos de cuir chaque en plus des 6 autres.\n\n2 Rugby.\n\nBalles :\n1) en caoutchouc (plaine, et de plus)\n2) autres balles (pour le jeu de paume ordinaire)\n\nTotal : 2 dozaines - assorties\n\nPoids : approximativement 0.5 \u00e0 0.4 Q\n\nN.B.

Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nPlease find enclosed tenders from 3 firms for a complete sawmill installation for Albany Indian Boarding School.\n\nAs you are aware a sum of $8,000.00 has been voted at the last Session of Parliament for the transfer and rebuilding of the above school on a better site. It is a matter of prime necessity for the preparation of lumber in view of the construction of the school that a sawmill outfit be sent on the grounds. After the construction of the school it will be kept in use for its benefit.\n\nWe had thought at first that a crude-oil engine would be more advantageous but the freighting of oil would entail too much expense. A steam engine is suggested by reason of greater economy and also of greater utility as it could be used later for laundry, heating and other purposes. A boiler of 40 H.P. was needed but the freighting company (Re-villon Freres Trading Co.) has refused to accept such a heavy weight and we have been obliged to consider the purchase of two 20 H.P. Most of the tenders quote on the machines of \"La Compagnie Manufacturi\u00e8re F.X. Bertrand\" of St Hyacinthe which are of very high standard. Those machines are very well known to Rev. Fr Jodoin O.M.I., who has been active in the field for tenders to cover exactly what is needed in the school.\n\nI take the liberty of stating that Rev. Fr Jodoin strongly recommends Faivre & Laroche's tender above all others. Kindly note that this firm allows 6% discount whilst the others allow only 7%.\n\nAs the material must be shipped without delay I would kindly request you to give your immediate attention to this matter and advise me of any decision reached by the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJoseph [Last Name]\nCOPY\n\nTELEGRAM\n\nMar. 23, 1923 11 a.m.\n\nSt. Hyacinthe, Que.\n\nThe Purchasing Dept. of Canada,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDISCOUNT GIVEN ON QUOTATION TO REVEREND FATHERS\nORLATS ARE TEN PERCENT ON ENGINE, TEN PERCENT ON\nBOILERS, TEN PERCENT ON SMOKE STACK, TEN PERCENT\nON SAW MILL, FIVE PERCENT ON SAW, FIVE PERCENT ON\nRUBBER BELT, TEN PERCENT ON COUNTERSHAFT AND PULLEYS\nTEN PERCENT ON CONVEYOR ADVISE IF TELEGRAM RECEIVED.\n\nF.X.

X. Bertrand Manufacturing Company, St. Hyacinthe, que., purchase amounting to $2,904.00.\n\nIt would appear that this matter had been under consideration by your Department for about a month. If it had been submitted to this Commission in the first place, a complete list of names could have been supplied from whom to call tenders. The largest manufacturers of complete saw mills have not been asked to quote on this requisition.\n\nIt is further noted that this material must be shipped without further delay; this leaves us no other alternative but to authorize purchase as recommended by you.\n\nOn taking this matter up with the Messrs. F. X. Bertrand Company we have been able to have their quotation reduced $294.10, which now makes the total cost $3,509.90.\n\nAssistant Director\n\"A\" Division\nSEND the following message subject to the terms printed on the back hereof, which are hereby agreed to.\n\nRev.

I may add that it is necessary, in order that shipment be made by the 10th of April, that these supplies arrive at Pugwash in time to go forward by Revillon Freres' steamer.

In discussing this matter with the Pares Oblats we have pointed out the risk of shipping at so late a date. If this machinery arrives at Parwan after the departure of our scows, not only can we not take it down to Albany, but there will be nobody at Pagwa to unload such heavy packages, hence there will be serious demurrage charges, or arrangements must be made to have the machinery carried back and stored for a year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nREVILLON FRERES TRADING CO.

X. Bertrand Company of St. Hyacinthe, Que. The first two items of $20.00 each are the exact amounts we were called upon to pay to the Railway Company for engine service.\n\nThese goods were to have been shipped by our scows to the Roman Catholic Mission at Albany, but doubtless you will have heard through the Rev. P\u00e8re Jodoin of the P\u00e9res Oblats that owing to the unusually low stage of water in the Saguenay River this Spring it was impossible to transport the supplies this year. Indeed, we were not able to transport anything like 50% of our own Posts' trading supplies by that route and were obliged to ship a large proportion of our goods back to eastern Canada and send them around to the James Bay by boat. It was impossible, owing to the weight and nature of the sawmill equipment, etc., for us to handle this freight on our boats, and consequently the goods will not be sent down until the Spring of 1926.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nREVILLON FRERES TRADING CO.

Carri\u00e8re O.M.I., Principal of Albany Mission Indian Boarding School has requested me to place before the Department a very important need for his institution.\n\nUntil now only wooden beds and straw mattresses have been used at the School and the Reverend Principal states that the situation has become almost unbearable from an hygienic standpoint. He therefore asks for 30 iron beds complete and I presently transmit his request. If the Department is agreeable to such a demand they should be shipped as soon as possible to the following address:\n\nRev. Fr. L. Carri\u00e8re O.M.I.,\nAlbany Mission,\nc/o R\u00e9villon Fr\u00e8res Trading Co.,\n134 McGill Street,\nMONTREAL, P.Q.\n\nThe shippers could make arrangements as to the kind of packing necessary with the Revillon Company.\n\nHoping that such a reasonable request for such a needy mission will be granted, I remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJoseph [Name]\nOttawa, February 15, 1924.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, in which you request that 30 beds and mattresses be supplied to the Albany Mission Indian Residential School. In reply I am pleased to state that the Department will arrange for the purchase of this equipment and will have the goods delivered to the Rev. Principal's Office of the Revillon Freres Trading Company, 134 McGill St., Montreal. The Department considers that the school authorities should be responsible for the freight from that point. Please advise me without delay if this arrangement is satisfactory and, if so, the Department will purchase immediately.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev.

Guy, O.M.I.,\nUniversity of Ottawa,\nOttawa, Ont.\nAuditor General's Office, Canada\n\nOTTAWA, February 26th, 1924.\n\nSir,\n\nCheque No. 751 issued on May 11th, 1923 and charged against your vote for Indian Education is for the payment of $190.11 to Moose Manufacturing Company, Limited, for 4 tents, 1 folding camp cot, and 12 pairs blankets, purchased on April 27th, by Rev. Father Guy of the University of Ottawa, and shipped to Rev. P. V. Jodoin, Pagwa, Ont. According to a notation on the account these supplies were for the Albany Mission Roman Catholic Boarding School.\n\nI should like to be advised as to whether this purchase was authorised by you before being made. How far are the authorities under whose auspices the Indian schools are conducted authorised to incur liabilities on behalf of your department? In every case of this nature the departmental authority should be quoted.\n\nThere is no certificate on the voucher as to the receipt of the goods or the fairness of the prices, as called for by Section 45 of the Audit Act, the only evidence of its having been examined in your department being the initials of your accountant. A definite certificate as to price and receipt of goods should be given, and as this payment is charged against your Education vote, the voucher should bear evidence of having been examined in your school branch.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nJWR/LVT\n\n[Signature]\n\nAuditor General.\nRev.

Jodoin, I take the liberty of sending you the enclosed account for goods ordered last year for Albany Indian School. This account covers material and exchange pieces in connection with some machinery ordered by the Department in view of the construction of a school at Albany.\n\nRev. Fr.

Aubrey)\n\nAt Albany, I had an interview with Father Carriere regarding the building of the new boarding school on the Yellow River, about one mile from the junction of the Albany and Yellow Rivers \u2014 five miles distant from the present site. No building has yet been done but a small clearing has been made and about sixteen hundred logs taken out. Father Carriere informed me that it was not their intention at present to build. The machinery which the Department shipped to them has not yet reached Albany, but is lying at Pagwa River Crossing pending transportation as soon as there is suitable water for navigation.\n**ACHET\u00c9 DE BOURNIVAL & CIE**\n\nManufacturiers et Agents G\u00e9n\u00e9raux\n\n| QUANTIT\u00c9 | PRIX | MONTANT | MONTANT TOTAL |\n|----------|------|---------|---------------|\n| 1        |      |         |               |\n| 1        |      |         |               |\n| 1        |      |         |               |\n| 1        |      |         |               |\n| 11       |      |         | $14.00        |\n\n**CONDITIONS:**\nAucune r\u00e9clamation ne sera consid\u00e9r\u00e9e, \u00e0 moins qu'elle soit faite sur r\u00e9ception des marchandises.\n\nFactures sujettes \u00e0 trait\u00e9, \u00e0 moins d'entente contraire.\n\n---\n\nExp\u00e9di\u00e9es le 29 avril 1924 par CAN.EXP.CO.\n\n\u00c0 REVILLON FR\u00c8RES, PAQUETTE, ONT.\n200-210 NOTRE-DAME EST\nMontr\u00e9al, 5 mai 1924\n\nM.

Father Villeneuve, Provincial of the Oblate Missionaries, and Rev. Father Carri\u00e8re O.M.I., Principal of Albany Mission Indian Residential School, what I consider distressing appeals on account of the financial condition of the School and Hospital of Albany Mission, in James Bay.\n\nFollowing an interview with you in this matter and acting upon your advice, I take the liberty of presenting the case before you, for your personal information and in view of obtaining a substantial help if such is available.\n\nIn the course of last month I examined the books of the Provincial Administration of the Oblate Fathers, acting as agents for His Lordship Bishop Hall\u00e9, and noticed that they show a deficit of $426.30 in 1923, October 1st of $3087.25 and from January 1st 1924, to October 1st, 1924, an amount of $2456.32, making a total of $7977.87, from January 1st, 1922 to October 1st, 1924. These deficits exist in spite of the Government grants and even though His Lordship and the Oblate Missionaries have literally begged from different quarters and gave to the institution $391.50 (vis: $1934.00 in 1922, $1650.50 in 1923, $1807.00 to October 1924). Of course those last amounts do not include salaries of the Rev. Fathers and Brothers, as they did not receive any. I may even say that the Rev. Fathers and Brothers have gone so far as to work as laborers for the trading Companies, cutting hay for their cattle. The salaries thus earned were simply deducted from the expenses necessitated by the transportation of merchandises for the School.\n\nSome years ago, two of our devoted brothers were drowned and one of our fathers was taken out of the water in an exhausted condition (he has never recovered since) upon arriving from a fishing expedition undertaken for the sole purpose of securing food for the children and staff.\n\nTwo years ago, all the merchandises destined to the School were sent to Pagwa, Ont., from Montreal, but lack of water obliged us to ship same back to New Liverpool Town, N.S. by train, thence to Albany by boat, involving an outlay of $1956.32, as vouchers attached readily show.\n\nThree years ago, I obtained from the Department that a sum of $8,000.00 be included in the Esti-\nmates, as a contribution for the reconstruction of the School. Of that amount, over $4,000.00 have already been paid for machineries and incidentals. Sad to say, the machineries are still at Pagwa, as lack of water in 1923 and 1924, prevented the Revillon Fr\u00e8res Trading Company from floating down the river, thus delaying them. By the way, I may presently say that special arrangements are being made by the Revillon Fr\u00e8res Trading Company to assure the delivery of the machineries next Spring.\n\nThere are on file at the Department, accounts for salaries (with duly signed receipts) to the amount of $2722.00, which are still unpaid. Those salaries cover the cutting of logs, clearing and preparing of land, in view of the construction of a new School building, at a short distance from the present location. The initial expenses and difficulties discouraged the efforts of our men and halted the plans of our Superiors. So the latter inquired into the possibility of making substantial repairs to the present building in order to prolong its duration for a few years. An expert engineer and practical builder was sent from Montreal to Albany, and through his skill and the labour of his two men and our own employees, the existence of the present building has been assured for a few years, pending the intended reconstruction. That work, consisting mainly in the reinforcement and strengthening of the foundations, renewal of floors and draining of surroundings, was carried out at an expense of over $1,700.00 including transportation charges, for which, we did not ask a single penny from the Department.\n\nMoreover, a receipted account from the Bertrand Company of St Hyacinthe, for $412.25, in payment of various pieces and extra parts, in connection with the machineries already paid by the Department, but unfortunately left over at Pagwa, has been refused to be paid by the Department, on the ground that the machineries themselves had not reached Albany Mission. Yet, we have paid for this account, as can be seen on the file at the Department.\n\nFinally, His lordship Bishop Hall\u00e9, considering the immense difficulties under which the members of the staff were laboring and the dangers to which they were exposed during their distant expeditions, decided in spite of his poverty, to buy a boat with gasoline engine. To his dismay, he was finally obliged to pay the sum of $4,400.00 to cover the expenses of purchase and freighting of the boat.\n\nThose are a few of the items explaining the reasons of the heavy deficit which is burdening the School of Albany Mission and discouraging the Right Reverend Bishop and his auxiliaries. Yesterday, I was receiving a letter from Rev. Father Carri\u00e8re, C.S.S., Principal of the School, making known his anxiety; he simply said that bankruptcy is staring at him in the face if the Government does not come to the rescue.\n\nIn view of such a situation, I therefore ask, in the name of His Lordship Bishop Hall\u00e9, of the Provincial Administration of the Oblate Missionaries and the devoted Fathers, Brothers and Sisters in charge at Albany Mission, that certain accounts above referred to be paid by the Department, in order to allay the financial situation and encourage the staff to continue the carrying\non of their present philanthropic and educational work.\n\nI therefore beg to suggest the payment of the following accounts:\n\n1o-Enclosed vouchers for extra transportation of merchandise in 1923, viz; $463.87 and $432.45.\n\n2o-Accounts for salaries as per statements and receipts on file for the sum of $2722.00. I beg to say that payment of those salaries had been authorised by the Superintendent General approving a Memorandum signed by you and assuring authority for the payment of $2923.92 for such salaries and other items. I would add that I understand that the cleared land is being used for cultivating purposes for the benefit of the school and hospital.\n\n3o-Account for $412.25 from Bertrand & Cie., for exchange pieces and extra parts. This receipted account is on file at the Department.\n\n4o-Accounts for $586.99 and $14.00 from Bournival & Co herewith annexed, for machineries to be used in the shop for repair purposes and piping for the same purposes.\n\nPayment of the above could, in my opinion, be justified, and would prove a boon to the School and practically save it from bankruptcy. You will note that no financial help is requested for the payment of the boat ($4,400.00) nor for the heavy expenses incurred in the making of substantial repairs to the present school building (over $1,700.00) which shows the earnestness of our efforts to cooperate not only morally with the Department, but also financially.\n\nNow, Dear Mr Scott, I leave this whole matter in your hands. You are aware of the extreme difficulties encountered in our Missions of Hudson Bay. Our aim at the Albany Mission School is to civilize the Indians and I can say that our influence is far reaching and therefore is a great factor in the success of the work carried on by your Department.\n\nHoping that you will give my request a favourable consideration, I remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nFebruary 25, 1925.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHonourable Charles Stewart,\n\nThere has been brought to my attention the serious financial condition of the N. C. Indian Residential School at Albany Mission, James Bay. Transportation costs for this school are very heavy and low water in the Albany river has of late meant some extraordinary charges in this connection.\n\n33,688 pounds of freight were shipped from Montreal to Pauca (west of Hearst) in 1923. The low water in the Albany river held up this huge shipment, which contained their year's supplies, and it was necessary to return 10,884 pounds of food and clothing from Pauca and ship it by steamer to the Hudson's Bay from Liverpool, N. S. 5,160 pounds of machinery, which was not particularly urgent, remained at Pauca and in the fall 9640 pounds of gas and oil, which was fairly urgent, was sent on by snows.\n\nThere is on file a receipted account for transportation from Havillan River for \u00a31936.32. $1093.39 was the extra cost of returning the goods from Pauca and shipping them via Liverpool, N. S. I wish to recommend that the Department refund to the school authorities this last amount. This payment would give them some relief in connection with their financial difficulties.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOFFICE OF THE\nDEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL\nOTTAWA\n\nFebruary 23, 1925.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHonorable J. Leclerc Stewart,\n\nThere has been brought to my attention the serious financial condition of the ... C. Indian Residential School at Albany Mission, James Bay. Transportation costs for this school are very heavy and low water in the Albany river has of late meant some extraordinary charges in this connection.\n\n30,000 pounds of freight were shipped from Montreal to Pargu (west of Hearst) in 1923. The low water in the Albany river held up this heavy shipment, which contained their year's supplies, and it was necessary to return 1,000 pounds of food and clothing from Pargu and ship it by steamer to the Judson Bay from Liverpool, N. S. 5,568 pounds of machinery, which was not particularly urgent, remained at Pargu and in the fall 940 pounds of gas and oil, which was fairly urgent, was sent on by boat.\n\nThere is on file a receipted record for transportation from Revillon Freres for $1,174.00, and the extra cost of returning the goods from Canada via them via Liverpool, N. S. I wish to recommend that the Department refund to the school authorities this last amount. This payment would give them some relief in connection with their financial difficulties.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n1st March 1922\n\n2nd do\n3rd do\n4th do\n5th do\n6th do\n7th do\n8th do\n9th do\n10th do\n11th do\n12th do\n13th do\n14th do\n\nsame as above less J.

The low water in the Albany river held up this huge shipment, which contained their year's supplies, and it was necessary to return 14,804 lbs. of food and clothing from Pagwa and ship it by steamer to the Hudsons Bay from Liverpool, N. S. 5158 lbs. of machinery, which was not particularly urgent, remained at Pagwa and in the fall 9646 lbs. of gas and oil, which was fairly urgent, was sent on by steamer. $1,093.39 was the extra cost of returning the urgent supplies from Pagwa and shipping them via Liverpool, N.

The extraordinary freight charges, amounting to $1093.89, are being assumed by the Department, and I am allowing $2772 for labour in connection with the new building. In addition, the F. K. Bertrand account for machinery parts, amounting to $412.25, is being paid.\n\nThere is enclosed a cheque for $4227.64, which reimburses the school management for these expenditures. The other items mentioned in your letter were more or less regular current costs and should be charged to the per capita grant. I trust that with this help the school will be able to finance satisfactorily for some time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Jos.

Jodoin O.M.I. to thank you most heartily for the kind and most effective consideration given to the request I made on their behalf in favor of the Indian Residential School of Albany Mission, James Bay.\n\nI have assured His Lordship and the Reverend Father that you took at heart to help the poor school and did all that could possibly be done for its benefit. The result of your generous efforts are highly appreciated and will save the school from what seemed to be unavoidable bankruptcy.\n\nIt is therefore a great pleasure for me to convey the thanks of the Episcopal and Provincial Administrations to yourself and to the Superintendent of Indian Education who has given you valuable assistance in dealing with this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, May 30th, 1925.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nReferring to that portion of your letter of the 14th instant, relative to the account which you submitted to the amount of $6,360 for freight charges from Pagwa to Albany and Attawapiskat and to Fort George on sawmill equipment for the use of the Catholic schools and missions at these points, I beg to say that this Department, in official letter to you dated March 31st, 1923, agreed to pay the freight charges from Pagwa to Albany on the equipment for 1 sawmill ordered from Messrs. F. X. Bertrand Co., St. Hyacinthe, and shipped by that firm to Pagwa in April, 1923, in our No. 146122 C.P., for Albany Mission. I have, therefore, to request that you will forward your account, in duplicate, covering the cost of the freight charges from Pagwa to Albany on the one sawmill equipment. When this account is received, consideration will be given to its payment.\n\nRegarding the freight charges on the two other sawmills which were sent to Attawapiskat and Fort George, I beg to say that it is presumed that these were ordered by the Catholic Church authorities, and you should look to them for payment of the freight charges.\n\nThe account which you forwarded to the amount of $6,360 is returned herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMessrs. Revillon Freres Trading Co., Ltd.,\nMontreal, P.Q.\nTo Freight from PAGWA RIVER to ALBANY on one Saw Mill outfit including bricks, 2 boilers and all necessary Machinery for ALBANY & R.O.

B. Burgess Mfg. Co., St. Hyacinthe, in February, 1924, for the Albany Mission Residential School. This was forwarded to Pagwa, Ont. to be transported by Revillon Freres by canoe. Owing to low water during the spring of 1923-24 it was not possible to have this machinery sent forward until the spring of 1925. The Department agreed at the time this equipment was forwarded to Pagwa to pay for its transportation from that point to Albany where it has now been safely delivered. Revillon Freres have completed the freighting satisfactorily and are entitled to payment therefor of the above amount.\n\nNOTE.\u2014Post Managers are required to take the earliest opportunity to fill in the last two columns in order to discover the gross profit to be made on these supplies.\nJune 6th, 1925.\n\nRevillon Fr\u00e8res\nTrading Company Limited\n134-16 Gulf Street\nMontreal\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe duly received yours of the 30th ult., file No. 44-2-5 in connection with freight charges on sawmill equipment taken down for your account and delivered to the R.C. Mission at Albany. We have gone very thoroughly into this matter and now find that our invoice No. 1125 which read, \"Freight on two sawmill outfits, one each for Albany and Attawapiskat R.C. Missions\" was in error and that the whole of that outfit, with the exception of two or three hundred pounds of machinery, constituted the lumber and other necessary equipment for one sawmill delivered at Albany. There were two boilers with this sawmill outfit, one engine and all necessary bricks, etc., for lining the boiler house, etc. The enquiries we have made show that the gross weight of this outfit was between 42,000 and 48,000 lbs. and the loading of our scows indicate that it was closer to the latter weight than to the former. However, we have revised our charge to read, \"Freight on 42,000 lbs.\" and enclose herewith our invoice No. 1125 for $2960, which we trust you will find correct and will be able to pass for early payment. We have cancelled our original charge for $5860.00.\n\nIn connection with the charge for the sawmill outfit taken to Fort George, we regret having embodied this in our previous invoice, but are pleased to advise you that the R.C. Mission, through the Rev. P\u00e8re Obiata in Montreal have arranged to pay us for this outfit, which was less than half the size of the outfit sent to Albany.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRevillon Fr\u00e8res Trading Co. Limited.\n\nSecretary-Treasurer.\nTwo years ago, the Department ordered sawmill equipment for the use of the Albany Mission Indian Residential School. This was very heavy and, due to low water, was not sent out from Pagwa by Revillon Freres until this spring. Their account for freight is now to hand and amounts to $2940. There are no funds specially provided for this purpose; but I wish to recommend that the account be paid, so that we may be prepared in the event of future shipments.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, July 18th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI am submitting, herewith, my report on the annuity payments throughout Treaty Nine, James Bay District, for 1927.\n\nI visited the site of the new Roman Catholic Boarding School. It is about three or four miles up the Albany river from the present school and the site seems to be a good one. The foundation is dug out and at present they are busy putting in a saw mill. It will be some time before this school will be completed.\n\nH. H. Awrey.\nThe Brothers have been busy on the work of erecting the new school building, which is farther up the Albany river than the location of the present quarters. All lumber has to be sawn by hand and the lime, etc., required for the foundation has to be burned locally. They expect to have this building ready in the summer of 1930, and, when completed, it will provide accommodation for 70 pupils.\nNovember 25, 1929.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nFather Guy and Father Saindon visited the Department today and announced the destruction, by fire, in July of this year, of practically all the materials on the new site of the Albany Indian Residential School. The only equipment which has been supplied by the Department which was saved was the motor. Counting some labour for the excavation, foundation (unsuccessful) a sawmill and the whole of the stone and gravel, the total loss has been approximately $13,000. This does not include the freight on the machinery. The total loss was in the neighbourhood of $20,000, counting the freight costs.\n\nFather Saindon plans to rebuild in 1930 and 1931. At present, there are 10 Brothers getting out logs. The Oblate Fathers were able to purchase a second hand sawmill at a price as yet undetermined; but they require about $2,700 more for machinery and repairs. In addition, there will be required cement coating in the neighbourhood of $1,200; building paper, hardware and finishing material, $5,000; painting inside and outside, etc., $1,000; and finishing, $2,000. They plan to have seven extra Brothers go in next summer to assist with the reconstruction.\n\nThe Oblate Fathers are asking the Department for a grant for next year and one for 1931, to assist them in the reconstruction of this school. $10,000 to $12,000 is the figure mentioned as being necessary before they can complete the work.\nI have already bought parts of sawmill at the Revillon Freres Trading Company, whose factory is an undetermined price.\n\nFor your information I am sending under separate cover photos of the destroyed sawmill and plans of the proposed building which will accommodate 70 children.\n\nThe Oblate Missionaries are willing to proceed immediately and assume the necessary responsibilities.\n\n10,000.00 in\n\nJ.

It is very regrettable that the new school buildings have received this serious setback.

In the case that you favor the proposition of adding those improvements, the total grant for 1931 should be carried to $20,000.00.\n\nI am confident that with that amount we shall be able to carry on the work and complete the school to the satisfaction of the Department.\n\nI hope that our endeavours shall meet with successful issue this time.\n\nThanking you for your kind sympathy and help, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

He also advised to pump the water in the building by means of a compressed air steel tank.\n\nThe estimate for the heating and water accommodation, altogether with the freight of material for same, amounts approximately to five thousands.\n\nI forgot to ask Mr. Orr about the electric light equipment. Electricity would be very much appreciated in a building of the kind; it would prevent the risks of fire and many other inconveniences.\n\nThe Lister light system with its motor burning crude oil is less costly and less expensive to operate, and gives general satisfaction. After information, I am told that this light outfit costs $4500.00.\n\nBefore the votation of the annual budget, I have thought it more convenient to submit to your consideration if such improvements are...\nOttawa, January 27, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, with reference to your proposals for the new Allonby Indian Residential School.

All the accessories required to renew the\nmotor, carriage etc., have also been bought.\n\nA new shingle mill has also been purchased to answer\nthe purpose of making house all the roofing for the new houses\nat Albany. Three hundred bags of cement have been shipped to make\ngood foundation for the new school.\n\nThirty four thousand feet of Insul Board have been\nshipped on the snows for a lining outside, inside and ceiling\nthis year.\n\nExperts in building houses deem that such material is\nrequired in construction to make a house warm, hygienic and com-\nfortable. All these materials have been shipped via Pagma River\nto the care of Revillon Freres.\n\nThe navigation conditions of this year have been most\nfavorable. We hope that all the freight will reach destination\nin good condition and due time.\n\nActually sixteen Brothers are occupied floating logs\ndown stream of the Albany river. Six thousand logs and frame\npieces have been cut this past winter.\n\nAs soon as temperature permit the saw-mill will be\nrebuilt and the cement work started.\n\nAs the hospital accommodation now existing at the old\nsite answers the purpose, Doctor B.H. Hamilton suggests that the\nbuilding of the hospital wing at the new site be postponed to\nnext year. He prefers that we carry on the building of the school.\nWe fully agree with his decision.\n\nThe Department may rest assure that we will carry on\nthe building work as rapidly as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

Scott\nDeputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs\nBooth Building\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am pleased to inform you that a considerable amount of work has been done last summer at the Albany Residential School.\n\nAfter the breaking of the ice, during the early days of June, sixteen Brothers helped by Indians have been occupied at rebuilding the steam saw-mill which, after one month, was in operation. Subsequently, the concrete foundation of the school has been laid. Five thousand logs have been brought to the Mission by water-way; the frame of the new building raised, and a large quantity of boards dried and planed.\n\nThe Principal of the School, Reverend Father Bilodeau O.M.I., was expecting today up the frame, a lining of boards outside, and to saw the shingle for the roof this fall.\n\nThe total amount of building supplies and parts of machinery bought this year is $677.84; freight charges for transportation of same are $425.03. The total of expenses is $1102.87. In order to cover part of the cost incurred this year, I would be very grateful to you if\nthe appropriation considered in your estimate of last year, could be granted.

McGINNIS,\n\nThe Roman Catholic Indian Residential School at Albany on James Bay has outlived its usefulness and the Oblate Order has agreed to erect a new building at a cost of approximately $40,000.00, provided the Department will grant $20,000.00 towards the undertaking. An amount of $25,000.00 has been included in the main estimates for Indian education for the current fiscal year 1930-1931, and it is hoped to place $10,000.00 in the estimates for 1931-1932, and $5,000.00 in the estimates for 1932-1933. Plans and specifications for the proposed building have been prepared by the Department architect, accommodation for 50 pupils being provided. The building is to be constructed on a concrete foundation and heated by a central unit. There will be modern plumbing, sewage disposal and electric light.\n\nIn view of the remote location of Albany it is considered advisable to have the building constructed on a day labour basis under the supervision of the church authorities, who are in a position to secure economic labour and can arrange the freighting of materials at minimum cost.\n\nDr. Scott wishes you to prepare a memorandum to council authorizing the Department to assist as indicated above.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, January 10th, 1921.\n\nHis Excellency\n\nThe Governor General in Council,\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to report that the Roman Catholic Indian Residential School building at Albany on James Bay, in the Province of Ontario, has fallen into disrepair, and is no longer suitable for use.

MURPHY\n\nThe Indian Residential School referred to in the enclosed recommendation to Council was commenced by the Oblate Order in 1906, at Albany on the James Bay. During the past few years, they have had 40 to 45 Indian children in residence whose work appears to be well established and of considerable usefulness to the band of Cree Indians on the Bay. The old buildings are no longer suitable and are badly located. A new site has been selected and there has been started a new main building, of frame construction, on a concrete foundation. Plans and specifications were prepared by the Department Architect, to provide for a central heating unit, modern plumbing, sewage disposal and electric light. Accommodation for 50 children is being provided.\n\nThe cost of the building will be at least $40,000. The Department has been asked to make grants totalling one-half of the expenditure, and last year, P.C. 86, dated January 16th, last, authorised a first grant of $5,000. The work is being done on a day labour basis, under the supervision of the Church authorities. This year, construction is going forward rapidly - the Church expecting to spend at least $20,000. Authority is required for the payment of a $10,000 grant. The Church authorities will submit receipts showing an expenditure of at least twice this amount this year.\n\nDuncan C.

The Department would be grateful if you would examine the equipment and batteries and give an estimate of the cost of putting the whole in good condition. It is intended to ship this plant, on about June first, to the Alberni Indian Residential School, on James Bay, provided it can be reconditioned at a moderate cost. When your estimate has been received, the Department will give further instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Will you please arrange to have this equipment properly crated and shipped to the Lister-Brunston Company, Winnipeg. Please prepay the freight. The batteries will have to be very carefully packed and crated, or the transportation company will not accept them for shipment. Any work in this connection, that cannot be done by the school carpenter, will be paid for by the Department, upon receipt of the usual voucher. You shall also send an account to the Department enclosing the freight receipt. Please let the Department know when shipment has been made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

In the first place, we are obliged to use the big engine for laundry work as there is no provision made for motors to handle the laundry. Secondly, it is evident that the Spencer plant is in a very poor state of repair and at the present time they are unable to generate enough electricity to handle both this School and the town of Lytton. This fact was discovered only after the line was installed; hence at the moment we are obliged to use our engines to give us light, as heretofore, and until the necessary repairs are made to this generating plant, we shall be obliged to hold our engines in case emergency arises.\n\nJust as soon as we are able to relieve ourselves of the engines, I will inform the Department to this effect, but, at the present time, we cannot do without them.\n\nI trust you will find this explanation satisfactory. - You might from your end bring pressure to bear upon the Spencer Company in hurrying them with their repairs, and also to obtain from them a guarantee of regular service.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\nA.R. LETT\nPRINCIPAL\n\nA.R.L.W\nRev.

I shall be pleased if you will give the Department as early an estimate as possible of the date when you will be able to dispense with the use of the generating plant and ship same as requested in letter of the 3rd instant. You might take this matter up with the power company and ascertain from them definitely when they will be able to supply a continuous quantity of power for use at your school and can guarantee a regular service.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The School cannot at this time meet that expenditure, and I wish you could see what provision could be made in regard to financing this change.\n\nI have written to the laundry people in Vancouver and have held off answering your correspondence hoping that I should have some definite price on this change to forward to you. But to date I have not received same and I felt you would be waiting for some information on the matter.\n\nColonel Spencer is also taking up the matter of the possible change of the motors with the Company direct in Vancouver; and the delay, no doubt, is due to the fact that they are obliged to get their information direct from the factory in the East.\n\nI should be glad if you could see your way clear to finance this change in the laundry when we can, without hesitation, ship the engines.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\nA.R.LTT\n\n[Signature]\n\nAHL/NW\nOttawa, March 9, 1932.\n\nRev.

It is noted that, with electrical power, it will be necessary to have a motor installed on each of the machines in the laundry. You might advise the Department of the type and full particulars of the motors required. When we have this information, consideration will be given to authorizing the supplying of the equipment required in the operation of the laundry machinery.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

We thought you would like this information in order that the shipment may be traced.\n\nAt this time of the year it is easier for us to overhaul plants, as soon as the roads are passable, our men do a lot of outside work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

In reply I have to say that this school is now being connected up with the lines of a power company in Lytton and it was not possible to ship the generating plant until the school was supplied with power. It is hoped that the Principal will be able to ship the plant to you in the very near future, as he has been instructed to do so as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Lett, Principal of the St. George's Indian Residential School at Lytton, B.C., arrived June 1st.\n\nIt will be necessary for you to advise us just what you require in the way of repairs. The apparatus seems to have been designed for the parallel operation of a 3 and 6 Kilowatt generator set. Will you please let us know if you want them turned out to operate in the same manner, or if you require each set to work automatically separately, or each to be manually controlled.\n\nThe plants themselves will require considerable overhauling. There appears to have been a deposit in the water which has placed a coating on all the circulating water parts, of from 1/8\" to 1/4\". The water tanks require renewing, and most of the piping will have to be renewed. The valves can be cleaned up.\n\nHowever, if you will give us the information asked for, we will be able to submit a price by return mail.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.A. LISTER & CO. (CANADA) LTD.\n\n[Signature]\n\nCRM/Mo\nJune 9, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 3rd instant, with reference to the lighting plant shipped you by the Reverend Principal of the St. George's Indian Residential School at Lytton, I would ask you to advise me of the cost of putting this plant in perfect working order.\n\nIt is desired that the two generators work in parallel and be fully automatic. A new battery will, of course, also be required.\n\nIn submitting the cost of the repairs I would ask that you kindly make it out in detail giving as much information as possible. As soon as this information is received you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nF. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nThe H. A.

This will, of course, take considerable time to fix up, and we believe the fittings, pipe and connections should be destroyed. Also, the tanks are useless to send out on new work. They are rotted at the water line so badly that one can make a hole with their finger without injury to the finger. Also, whoever took down the Plant, disconnected the boards, all the small piping, bus wires, which will take a long time for reassembling.\n\nThe 6 K.W.

Ce sont des dol\u00e9ances que vous savez entendre bien sourire depuis que vous \u00eates entr\u00e9 au D\u00e9partement, mais cela ne doit pas, il me semble, me tenir de vous exposer notre embarras. La construction de cette \u00e9cole est d'une grande importance puisque c'est la seule \u00e9cole indienne pensionnat de toute la province. Les Indiens de Wenonah, Opinaw, Attawapiskat y envoient leurs enfants, soit d'une distance de 300 milles. Il nous en arrive parfois de Port-Hope, d'Ogoki.\n\nC'est \u00e0 travers mille difficult\u00e9s que nous construisons \u00e0 cause de la distance et ces circonstances de lieu o\u00f9 nous nous trouvons, car il nous faut aller chercher les mat\u00e9riaux \u00e0 une grande distance. Il y a actuellement 12 Fr\u00e8res Coadjuteurs attach\u00e9s \u00e0 cette mission, et occup\u00e9s \u00e0 la construction.\n\nNous avons install\u00e9 une scierie m\u00e9canique \u00e0 vapeur pour pr\u00e9parer le bois n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 cet \u00e9tablissement, mais malheureusement cette scierie a \u00e9t\u00e9 incendi\u00e9e en 1928. Nous avons d\u00fb la remplacer par une autre qui actuellement nous rend de grands services et diminue consid\u00e9rablement le co\u00fbt de la construction. Cet incendie cependant nous a consid\u00e9rablement retard\u00e9 dans la marche des travaux.\n\nLe corps central de l'\u00e9cole est actuellement habit\u00e9. Le syst\u00e8me de chauffage qui consiste en une irradiation de vapeur \u00e0 basse pression est actuellement en fonction. L'\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 est aussi install\u00e9e.\n\nCette \u00e9cole pourra recevoir 100 enfants quand elle sera termin\u00e9e. Elle co\u00fbtera approximativement $125,000.00.\nApr\u00e8s entente verbale avec le regrett\u00e9 B.T. Ferrier, surintendant des \u00c9coles indiennes la moiti\u00e9 des d\u00e9penses devaient \u00eatre fournies par le D\u00e9partement. Quinze mille dollars nous ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s. Dix mille dollars nous avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 promis pour l'ann\u00e9e derni\u00e8re, mais cette approbation a \u00e9t\u00e9 renouvel\u00e9e. Me flan\u00e7ant \u00e0 cette somme que j'\u00e9tais dans le cas de recevoir, parce que je ne me suis jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 notifi\u00e9 de l'octroi de celui-l\u00e0, j'ai achet\u00e9 tout le mat\u00e9riel pour poursuivre les travaux et rendre l'\u00e9cole habitable. Les d\u00e9penses se chiffrent \u00e0 pr\u00e8s de 12000.00 cette ann\u00e9e au total de 12000.00 pour l'ann\u00e9e derni\u00e8re.\n\nIl est \u00e0 noter que je n'ai pu rembourser les frais de la d\u00e9pression actuelle. Vous comprendrez vous-m\u00eame que les secours advenant de la charit\u00e9 sont presque totalement taris.\n\nCependant, il nous faut continuer le travail commenc\u00e9, parce que, en discontinue, une foule de mat\u00e9riaux serait perdus. Mais nous ne pouvons aller plus loin sans secours, parce que nous avons l'allocation accord\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole nous permet tout juste de vivre avec la plus grande \u00e9conomie. Le personnel de l'\u00e9cole est pauvre et il faut le soutenir. Tous mes missionnaires sont sans aucun salaire, ni r\u00e9tribution. Nous sommes heureux de faire notre part dans cette \u0153uvre de civilisation, mais, vous le comprenez, il nous faut le soutien de la vie.\n\nNous donnons notre enti\u00e8re coop\u00e9ration au D\u00e9partement pour cette \u00e9cole et nous esp\u00e9rons que le secours n\u00e9cessaire ne nous sera pas refus\u00e9. Je le sais, votre D\u00e9partement est li\u00e9 par la crise actuelle et il vous est difficile de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 toutes les demandes et \u00e0 tous les besoins; toutefois, je serais heureux d'attirer votre attention sur mon grand embarras financier.\n\nIl me faudrait acheter certains mat\u00e9riaux qui seront transport\u00e9s l'\u00e9t\u00e9 prochain, mais dans les circonstances je n'ose le faire. Je passerai au D\u00e9partement vers la fin de mars et je vous communiquerai plus de pr\u00e9cisions sur ce dernier point.\n\nJe souhaite que vous puissiez trouver quelques milliers de Dollars, comme vous le d\u00e9sirez vous-m\u00eame, pour nous aider \u00e0 solder une partie de la dette.\n\nJ'aime \u00e0 croire que ces quelques renseignements vous seront utiles et vous mettront au courant de notre situation.\n\nJe vous remercie d'avance de ce que vous ferez pour nous et veuillez me croire, Monsieur le Docteur,\n\nVotre tout d\u00e9vou\u00e9,\n\nT.E.

These\nphotographs will give you an idea of the work already done, un-\ntil you can judge for yourself, since we will have the honour\nand the pleasure of your visit next Summer. I may say that it\nmight be possible for me to take you myself to Albany; that is\nif you have another engagement at the time.\n\nThe object of this letter is to inform you of our\nfinancial difficulties. These are complaints you must hear\nquite often since your arrival at the Department, but that\nmust not, it seems to me, prevent my explanation of our em-\nbarrassing situation. The construction of that school is of\ngreat importance since it is the only Indian Boarding School\nof the whole West Coast. The Indians of Weenisk, Opengow,\nAttawapiskat send their children there, being at a distance\nof 300 miles. We sometimes receive pupils from Fort Hope\nand Ogoki.\n\nIt is through a thousand difficulties that we build\non account of the distance and the circumstances of our loca-\ntion, because we have to get our material from a considerable\ndistance. There are at present 12 co-adjutor brothers attach-\ned to this Mission, and busy with the construction.\n\nWe had installed a steam lumber saw mill to prepare\nthe necessary timber for that building, but unfortunately that\nsaw mill was burnt down in 1928. We have to replace it by\nanother which at present renders us great services and dimin-\nishes the cost of the construction. That fire has, however,\ndelayed the course of the work considerably.\n\nThe central part of the school is now fit to dwell\nin. The heating system which consists of low pressure steam\nradiation is now functioning. Electricity is also installed.\nThis school could receive 100 children when it is completed. It will cost approximately $125,000.00.\n\nAfter a verbal agreement with the regretted Mr. R. T. Ferrier, late Superintendent of Indian Schools, one half of the expenditure was to be provided by his Department. We have already been paid fifteen thousand dollars. Ten thousand dollars was promised us for last year, but that appropriation was cancelled. Relaying on this sum, which I was certain to receive because I was never notified it had been cut off, I purchased all the material to continue the work and render the school habitable. The expenditure will amount to about $12,000.00 this year and more than that for last year.\n\nI had to borrow that sum and I could not reimburse it on account of the present depression. You will conceive for yourself that the relief coming from charitable sources are almost totally exhausted.\n\nNevertheless, we must continue the work started, because if it was discontinued, a number of materials would be lost. But we cannot go any farther without help, because the grant given to the school allows us barely a living with the strictest economy. The staff of the school is numerous and we have to sustain it. All my Missionaries are without salaries or remuneration. We are happy to do our part in this task of civilization, but you will understand, our livelihood is to be sustained.\n\nWe give our entire co-operation to the Department for this school and we hope that the necessary help will not be refused. I know that your Department is bound by the present crisis and it is difficult to answer to all the requests and all needs; however, may I be permitted to draw your attention on my great financial perplexity.\n\nI would have to purchase certain material which will be brought over next Summer, but under the circumstances I dare not do it. I shall be at the Department at the end of March next and I will communicate with you more precisely on that last point.\n\nI wish that you may find a few thousand dollars as you wish it yourself, to help us to settle a portion of the debt.\n\nI like to believe that this information will be useful to you, and will acquaint you with our situation.\n\nI thank you in advance for what you may do for us and believe me, Dear Doctor.\n\nYours devotedly\n\n(Sgd.) T. R. Saindon, O.M.I.,\nVic.-provincial.\nherewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nForm No. 149\nDecember 7, 1932.\n\nDear Father Saindon:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, requesting further assistance towards the cost of the erection of the new Indian Residential School at Albany.\n\nThe Department was unable to obtain any appropriation during the present fiscal year to reimburse you for the expenditure incurred. Before our books close for this fiscal year, at the end of March, next, there may be a balance on hand from which an additional payment can be made. However, I can give no definite assurance in this regard. Our Estimates for the next fiscal year are in course of preparation, and favourable consideration will be given to including an item towards the cost of constructing the building and its furnishing.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nVery Rev.

January 16th, 1935.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Ind. Affairs\nSouth Block,\nOttawa - Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe session is opening in a few weeks and it is about the time that appropriations are voted for different Departments. As it is not probable that I will be given the occasion of residing in Ottawa before that time I have thought advisable to send you the estimate of expenditures for the coming financial year at the Albany Residential School.\n\nTo complete the school it would be very much appreciated if an appropriation of $10,000.00 could be granted. The following material is to be bought:\n\n1.- Fire protection is to be secured, the equipment consists in fire escape stairs, a small motor with a pump and hoses.\n2.- As only country lumber is had and such wood is not suitable for interior finishing it is desirable that the interior be completed with some other material. We intend to buy 50,000 feet of cypress.\n3.- The electrical and heating plants have to be completed.\n4.- Nails, glass, paint, etc., are to be needed.\n5.- Furnitures are also badly wanted as classroom desks, teachers' desks, chairs, blackboards and other articles.\n6.- Indian labour will be required.\n7.- Freight for this supply has to be figured.\n\nIt is expected that the yearly expenditure shall amount to approximately $12,000.00.\n\nThe late R.T. Perrier had promised to grant the amount of $6,000.00 towards the building of the Albany School. Fifteen thousand have already been paid. Twenty thousand are still to be paid on the principal bought. Money has been borrowed at the rate of six per cent.\n\nAn appropriation of $10,000.00 had been expected for the past financial year, but owing to circumstances the appropriation was not voted. We would be very grateful to the Department if $6,000.00 is granted this year. I think that if such allowance is granted we will not need any further help.\n\nThe construction has begun in 1928, but owing to great difficulties the work could not be done in less time than we have done it. We are very anxious to see the establishment completed. We already have demand for more children than we can receive at the present time.\nthe school is completed 100 children could be put up easily.\n\nIf I bring stress on the subject of the grant you will easily understand it is on account of the hard times we all have to pass through. We have tried to economize as much as it was possible. All the work has been done by the Brothers who do not touch any remuneration.\n\nWhen the building is completed we expect that the Department will be pleased with it, because it is built according to regulations and on a modern plan approved by the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT.E. Lamden, S.M.I.,\nAct.-prov.\nOttawa, February 1, 1933.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th ultimo, requesting that provision be made in our Estimates for the coming fiscal year for a further grant towards the cost of the erection of the new Indian residential school at Albany, and giving an estimate of the cost of completing the building and furnishing same.\n\nIn reply I have to say that it was necessary to cut our Estimates severely, and I regret that it was not found possible to provide any further grant to assist towards the cost of the building. Owing to the present financial situation, it may be necessary to give serious consideration to a curtailment of our Indian school work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nSecretary\n\nRev. T. E. Saindon, O.M.I.,\nNoosonee,\nJames Bay,\nOnt.\nNovember 10, 1933.\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nWith reference to the request of Rev. Father Saindon, O.M.I., Vicar Provincial of the Oblate Order, for a further grant towards the cost of the construction of the Albany N.C. Indian Residential School, I would say:\n\nThe Oblate Order agreed to erect a new school building during the years 1930 and 1931, at a cost of approximately $40,000, provided the Department would grant $20,000 towards the undertaking.\n\nAn amount of $5,000 was included in the estimated N.C. Indian Education for the fiscal year 1930-31 and a further amount of $10,000 was included in the estimates for 1931-32. It was also intended to place $6,000 in the Estimates for 1932-33, but this amount was not provided. The total amount we have paid towards the cost of the building is, therefore, $15,000. This was paid as follows:\n\n$5,000 under authority of P.C. 86, dated January 15, 1931,\n$10,000 under authority of P.C. 2502, dated October 13, 1931.\n\nBesides, we supplied the school with an electric lighting plant, which was transferred as being surplus to requirements at the St. George's Indian Residential School, Lytton, B.C. The cost of freighting and repairing this plant was $1,397.66.\n\nThe building was erected on plans and specifications prepared by the Department Architect. The building is of frame construction, on a concrete foundation and heated by a central unit. There is full plumbing, sewage disposal, and electric light. In view of the remote location of Alberton, it was considered advisable to have the building constructed on a day labour basis, under the supervision of the church authorities, who were in a position to secure economical labour and arrange the freighting of materials at a minimum cost. It was found that the cost of the building exceeded the original estimate, and the church authorities have expended approximately $60,000. I am not aware of the definite cost in the erection of the building.\n\nPoor Copy\nbuilding. This information does not appear on our files. There is accommodation for 100 children.\n\nDuring the past two years, Father Saundon has made repeated requests for a further grant to the amount of $10,000 towards the cost of construction. There is no doubt that the Department promised the church authorities that this further amount would be provided. This amount was included in the first draft of our Estimates for Indian Education during the past two fiscal years but was not allowed.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp: Poor Copy]\nNovember 20\n\nThe Honorable the Vice President,\n\nI enclose a memorandum from Mr. Rutherford with regard to contribution by the Department towards the cost of the construction of the Albany Rd. Indian residential school.\n\nFrom a recent conversation with Reverend Father Saindon I acquired the impression that his request was for grants sufficient to make a total of $30,000.00. As is evident from the memorandum we have definitely obligated the extent of at least $25,000.00. As $15,000.00 has already been paid, I would recommend that the sum of at least $5,000.00 be included in the estimates for the coming year for a further grant to this extent.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent\n\n[Stamp]\nNovember 10, 1933.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nWith reference to the request of Rev.

D. Sutherland  \nDepartment of Indian Affairs,  \nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWhile in Albany I inspected the R.C. Res. School building and classes.\n\nThe building is far from finished; it is still in a rough state both inside and out. The stairs are temporary and the two fire escapes are temporary and built of wood. I would advise that the fire escapes be changed at once.\n\nThere are two class-rooms with a teacher in charge of each. The present class rooms are small but I believe these are to be moved to other rooms when they are completed. The pupils are divided into four grades: the two senior grades in one room and the juniors in the other.\n\nI consider that the children in the respective grades are doing fairly well and are being taught to speak and write English as well as Cree. The children are well advanced in Arithmetic, Reading, Writing and Spelling; they read from sight and not from memory.\n\nThe greatest fault I find is that the children will not speak out, and that you have difficulty getting them to answer questions although they know the answer; this is a common fault with all the Indians in this Agency and seems to be due to their shyness.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.L.

In fact, the school would require an outside lining to strengthen the frame; the floors are single and need doubling to prevent the dampness to come up from the cellar; the ceilings are only temporary; storm windows should also be had; hot water system would also be most appreciated, at least, in some apartments.\n\nReport of the conditions at the Albany Residential School was made to the Oblate Board and a grant to carry on the work was asked, but the answer of the Board is the following: \"We have financed the construction as far as $10,000 were contributed with the understanding that the Department would reimburse that amount, which has not yet been done and the money is tied up without interest. We are ready to co-operate to the limit of our abilities and to carry the heaviest part of the burden, but we regret to say that, owing to present economic circumstances, we cannot go any farther.\"\n\nI had hoped that through the strictest economy we could squeeze a few hundred dollars on the regular allocations to carry on the work during this coming Summer, but the crops were spoiled by early frosts, the fishing, due to the early coming of the winter, also failed. Consequently, expenses are running higher than it had been expected and no credit balance shall be left.\n\nI am honestly at a lost about the means which should be taken to go ahead with the construction which really needs being carried on.\n\nIt would be deeply appreciated by the Oblate Fathers that the $10,000 would be reimbursed. The co-operation of the Department to carry on the necessary improvements would be also highly appraised.\n\nThe aforesaid improvements would amount to approximately $5,000.\n\nThis is the present situation which I have thought of my duty to bring to your attention, trusting that it is only by the mutual co-operation of both parties that a betterment can be contemplated for the coming year at the Albany Residential School.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, April 9, 1934.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, with reference to the Albany Indian Residential School.

I regret that no provision has been made for this purpose in our current year's Appropriation.\n\nThe Department has, however, provided in the Estimates for the fiscal year 1934-35 an amount of $5,000, being a further payment towards the cost of the school.
