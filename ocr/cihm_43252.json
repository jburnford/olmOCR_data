He should avoid listening to the opinions of interested and designing characters, who offer advice unsolicited. Many, especially single females and unprotected persons, have suffered from want of proper caution in this respect.\n\nThose desirous of obtaining employment will find it to their advantage to accept the first offer, even if the wages should be less than they had been led to expect, as until they become acquainted with the country their services are of comparatively small value to their employers. Persons seeking situations as Clerks, Shopmen, &c., (FOR WHOM THERE EXISTS NO DEMAND) and Mechanics who experience difficulty in obtaining employment in their respective trades, should accept the first offer that presents itself sooner than remain idle.\n\nEmigrants who have settled destinations should remain about the city as short a time as possible after arrival. Farm laborers should proceed at once into the Agricultural Districts, where they will be certain of meeting with employment suitable to their habits; and those with Families will also more easily procure the necessaries of life, and avoid the hardships and distress which are experienced by a large portion of the poor inhabitants in our large cities during the winter season. The Chief Agent will consider such persons as may loiter about the ports of landing to have no further claims on the protection of His Majesty's Agents, unless they have been detained by sickness or some other sufficient cause.\nGOVERNMENT EMIGRANT AGENTS.\n\nQuebec ..................

C. BUCHANAN, Chief Agent.\n\nGovernment Emigration Office, Quebec, April, 1863.\n\nPROTECTION TO EMIGRANTS.\n\nThe Imperial and Provincial Passenger Acts provide, as far possible, against frauds and imposition, any instance of which should at once be made known to the nearest Emigrant Agent.\n\nThe Provincial Passengers' Act provides that Emigrants may remain on board forty-eight hours after the vessel's arrival, (except in cases when the vessel has a mail contract) and that they shall be landed free of expense, at proper hours; that no person, without a license, shall influence passengers in favor of any particular steamboat, railroad or tavern; that tavern-keepers shall have posted, in some conspicuous place, a list of prices to be charged for board, lodging, &c., and they will not be allowed to have any lien upon the effects of a passenger for board and lodging, beyond five dollars\u2014about one pound stg.\n\nThe personal effects of emigrants are not liable to duty.\n\nEmigrants arriving at Quebec, holding through tickets for their inland transport, and desiring to obtain information, may delay their journey for that purpose, as the Railway or Steamboat Company to whom they are addressed will take charge of their luggage until they are ready to proceed.\n\nDEMAND FOR LABOR.\n\nThere is always a large demand for farm laborers and female servants; to this latter class, specially, Canada offers great inducements, and every hard working\nrespectable girl is sure to do well. Boys and Girls over 15, Carpenters, Masons, Bricklayers, Blacksmiths and Shoemakers are also wanted.\n\nAVERAGE WAGES.\n\nFarm labor.................. per month, from $8 to $12, with board and lodging.\nFemale servants.............. \" \" $2 to $5,\nBoys, over 13 years.......... \" \" $2 to $8,\nGirls, \" .................... \" \" $1 to $3,\nMechanics.................... per day \" \" $1 to $1.50, without board.\n\nTradesmen found with board and lodging get little more than half the above rates of wages.\n\nFarm Laborers on their first arrival would perhaps not obtain the above wages on Farms, but after being a few months in the Country, when they learn to chop they will obtain them.\n\nDISPOSAL OF CAPITAL.\n\nEmigrants possessing capital, say from \u00a3200 to \u00a3500, are advised to purchase or rent a farm with some little improvement upon it, instead of going into the bush at once. Parties desirous of investing may obtain from 8 to 10 per cent, for their money on mortgage.\n\nA word of advice is offered to the Emigrant coming to Canada with a small capital. He would act wisely, if, instead of buying land\u2014as is often done\u2014before becoming acquainted with its character and the kind of labor required in a new country, a proceeding invariably leading to the incurrence of debt, payment of interest, and entailing various other embarrassing expenses, he were to invest his money in the Savings' Bank, hire a log shanty for his family in some neighborhood affording a good prospect of employment, and work at Wages for a year or so, thus gaining the knowledge and experience necessary to realise independence. Such a course is not deemed degrading in Canada, and it is sure to result in ultimate good. Let it be borne in mind that all families coming to Canada, whether they be possessed of \u00a3100 or \u00a31000, must fail, unless they come determined to labor themselves; and it may be asserted without fear of contradiction, that the head of a family who pursues this plan will, at the end of a few years, be far in advance of him, no matter what his capital may be, who has not taken to the axe and the hoe. A determination to work, carried out with spirit and consistency will bring with it a degree of prosperity cheering to contemplate, and not to be surpassed in any other part of America.\nImproved Farms may be purchased at from 5 dollars to 50 dollars per acre, according to situation and extent of improvement; or rented, with or without the option of purchase, at from 1 dollar to 4 dollars per acre.\n\nCROWN LANDS.\n\nSeveral millions of acres of surveyed lands are always in market, and the prices fixed at which intending settlers can acquire them, upon application to the respective Crown Land Agents. The prices of Crown Lands vary, from 70 cents, to 2s. 11d., or 3s. sterling cash, to one dollar, or 4s. 2d. sterling, an acre, on time, according to locality.\n\nCrown Lands in Upper Canada are sold for cash, at 70 cents, (2s. 11d.), an acre, and, on time, at one dollar an acre, one fifth to be paid at the time of sale, and the remaining four fifths in four equal annual instalments, with interest at six per cent. on the purchase money unpaid. On the north shore of Lake Huron, and at Fort William on Lake Superior, lands are sold on time, at 20 cents, or 10d. sterling, an acre. All Crown Lands in the newly surveyed territory are subject to settlement duties, and no patent in any case (even though the land be paid for in full at the time of purchase) shall issue for any such land to any person who shall not by himself, or the person or persons under whom he claims have taken possession of such lands, within six months from the time of sale, and shall from that time continuously have been a bona fide occupant of, and resident on the land for at least two years, and have cleared and rendered fit for cultivation and crop and had under crop, within four years at farthest from the time of sale of the land, a quantity thereof in the proportion of at least ten acres to every one hundred acres, and have erected thereon a habitable house, and of the dimensions at least of sixteen by twenty feet. Timber must not be cut without license, except for agricultural purposes.\n\nLAND REGULATIONS.\n\nLand adapted for farming purposes can seldom be obtained from land companies, speculators or private individuals, under twenty shillings an acre. The Canadian Government, being desirous of preventing the acquisition of large tracts of lands by private companies or private individuals, for the purpose of speculation, have coupled the sale of the Government lands with such conditions as to prevent undue or improper advantage being taken of their liberality in offering farming land at a low rate. Every purchaser must become an actual settler. This simple condition drives out of the field a host of speculators.\nIn addition to the Free Grants, Government lands are sold either in blocks, or in single lots of 100 acres, to actual settlers.\n\nLands in blocks are sold in quantities varying from 40,000 to 60,000 acres, at 50 cents. (about 2s. sterling) per acre, cash, in Upper Canada; and in Lower Canada, at from 18 cents and upwards, according to situation; on condition that the purchaser cause the block to be surveyed into lots of from 100 to 200 acres each, on a plan and in a manner to be approved by the Government; and that one-third of the block be settled upon within two years and a half from the time of sale\u2014one-third more within seven years\u2014and the residue within 10 years from the time of sale.\n\nThis requirement will be dispensed with as to any portion of the land which at the last mentioned period is found to be unfit for settlement.\n\nThe settlers must have resided on their lots for two years continuously, and have cleared and cultivated ten acres of every 100 acres occupied by them, before they can get absolute titles.\n\nAbsolute titles will be given to the purchaser on payment in full of the price, and of his having resided at least two years on his lot and cleared and had under cultivation ten acres of every 100 acres occupied by him.\n\nDIRECTIONS TO EMIGRANTS AND OTHERS WISHING TO PURCHASE CROWN LANDS.\n\nEmigrants and others desirous of purchasing Crown Lands should make application to the respective local Crown Land Agents, who are required by law to furnish all applicants with correct information as to what lands are open for sale.\n\nThe Government Emigration Agents at Quebec, Montreal, Ottawa, Kingston, Toronto and Hamilton, will afford information and advice to emigrants respecting the best means of reaching the localities in which they intend to settle. If the lot has not yet been advertised, and placed at the disposal of the agent, no sale of it can be made until that is done, unless the applicant is in actual occupation, with valuable improvements; in that case he may, at his own expense, procure the services of the agent, (if the lot be within the jurisdiction of one) to inspect it, or furnish him satisfactory evidence, by affidavits of two credible and disinterested parties, or the report of a sworn surveyor, to enable him to report to the Department the following particulars, viz:\u2014\n\nThe whole time the lot has been occupied; by whom now occupied; the nature and extent of the improvements owned by applicant, and whether there are any adverse claims, on account of improvements made by any other party on the same piece or parcel of land.\n\nIf the lot is public land, but not within the jurisdiction of any agent, in\napplication should be made direct to the Department, applicant being careful, the order to avoid delay and prevent unnecessary correspondence, to transmit at the same time the evidence by affidavit or Surveyor's report, as above stated.\n\nThe same rules should be observed by applicants to purchase Public Lands situated in the old settled Townships, with these additions: that in cases where the applicant occupies improvements made by his predecessors on the lot, he should show by assignment or other evidence, how he obtained possession of them, and that he is now the bona fide owner of the same. The present full value of the land per acre, exclusive of improvements, should also be stated by the agent, the surveyor or deponents, as the case may be. All papers necessary to substantiate the applicant's claim or right to purchase, if the application is made direct to the Department should accompany the first application.\n\nAll assignments, whether by squatters or purchasers, must be unconditional to be recognised by the Department.\n\nApplications for information relative to the dates of Patents and the names of Patentees should, invariably, be made to the Provincial or Deputy Provincial Registrar.\n\nParties writing to the Department should give their Post Office, the date and number of the last letter (if any) they received from the Department on the subject. They should, if they can, state whether the lots they write about are Crown, Clergy, or School lands. Each letter should be confined to one subject; the signature should be distinctly written, and the letter addressed to \"The Honorable the Commissioner of Crown Lands.\"\n\nEvery applicant for Letters Patent for lands, should state his christian name at length, with his occupation and residence, as these must be stated in the Letters Patent.\n\nEXPENSE OF CLEARING AND PUBLIC CHARGES ON LAND.\n\nThe cost of clearing wild lands is about from 12 to 14 dollars per acre. The expense is, however, greater in the remote districts, in consequence of the difficulty of procuring laborers; but this work is generally done by contract. The only charge on land is a tax which seldom exceeds 1d. per acre. It is applied to local improvements alone, in which the persons taxed have a direct interest.\n\nCAPITAL REQUIRED BY INTENDING SETTLER.\n\nThe capital required to enable an Emigrant family to settle upon a Free Grant Lot, or enter upon the occupation of the wild lands of the Crown, has been variously estimated. It should be sufficient to support his family for the first 18 months, and provide for the expenses of clearing the land.\nmonths, until he can get a return from his land; and although much will depend upon the parties themselves, in no case should it be less than \u00a350 currency.\n\nThe following is a careful estimate of the quantity and cost of provisions required for 12 months for a man and his wife, and three young children, and also a list of articles required by settlers going into the bush. The prices are attached at which they can be purchased at the villages near the settlements:\n\n8 barrels of flour, at \u00a31 15s. per barrel........\u00a314 0 0\n2 \" of pork, at \u00a33 15s..................7 10 0\n80 bushels of potatoes, at 2s. per bushel......8 0 0\n30 lbs. of tea, at 2s. 6d. per lb...............3 15 0\n1 barrel of herrings..........................2 0 0\n\u00bd \" of salt.....................................0 7 6\n\n\u00a385 12 6\n\nSEED.\n\n20 bushels of potatoes, at 2s. per bushel.......2 0 0\n3 \" of wheat, at 7s. 6d. \" ..................1 2 6\n10 \" of oats, at 2s. \" ......................1 0 0\n\nCost of seed....................................\u00a34 2 6\n\nOTHER NECESSARIES.\n\n1 Axe...........................................\u00a30 8 9\n1 Grindstone.................................0 7 6\n1 Shovel.......................................0 1 10\n2 Hoes, at 3s. 6d. each......................0 7 0\n3 Reaping-hooks, at 1s. 6d. each..............0 4 6\n1 Scythe.......................................0 5 0\n1-inch Auger.................................0 5 0\n1-inch-and-a-half Auger.......................0 7 6\n1 Hand saw....................................0 7 6\n2 Water pails, at 1s. 6d. each...............0 3 0\n1 Window sash, and glazing...................0 5 0\n1 Bake oven...................................0 5 0\n2 Pots, at 5s. each..........................0 10 0\n1 Kettle.......................................0 5 0\n1 Frying-pan.................................0 3 0\n1 Teapot.......................................0 2 6\n6 Small tin vessels, at 4d. each..............0 2 0\n\n\u00a34 10 1\n\nCarried over.................................\u00a344 5 1\nBrought forward ........................................ \u00a344 5 1\n\n3 Large tin dishes, at 2s. 6d. each .................. 0 7 6\n6 Spoons, at 2d. each .................................. 0 1 0\n6 Knives and forks ...................................... 0 5 0\n3 Pairs blankets, at \u00a31 5s. per pair ................. 3 15 0\n2 Rugs for quilts, at 2s. 6d. each .................... 0 5 0\n2 Pairs of sheets, at 3s. per pair .................... 0 6 0\n1 Smoothing iron ....................................... 0 2 6\n1 Pig ..................................................... 0 15 0\n\n\u00a3 5 17 0\n\nTotal ........................................................ \u00a350 2 1\nAdd one cow ............................................... 5 0 0\nHay for ditto, 1st year ................................. 3 0 0\n\nCurrency .................................................. \u00a358 2 1\nOr Sterling ................................................ \u00a347 0 0\n\nFREE GRANTS.\n\nCOLONIZATION ROADS.\n\nGovernment has opened several great lines of road on which free grants of one hundred acres are given to actual settlers. The conditions of location are:\u2014That the settler be eighteen years of age. That he take possession of the land allotted to him within six months. That he build a log house 16 by 20 feet. That he reside on the lot and clear and cultivate 10 acres of land in the course of four years. Members of a family having land allotted to them may reside on a single lot, thereby exempting them from building and residence on each location.\n\nThe roads in Upper Canada are:\u2014\n\n1st. The Ottawa and Opeongo Road, which runs east and west, and will connect the Ottawa with Lake Huron; Resident Agent, T. P. French, Clontarf. Route, by Grand Trunk Railway and Ottawa River, or railway to Ottawa City, thence by stage and steamer to Farrell's Landing.\n\n2nd. The Frontenac Road, running North of Kingston, through the County of Frontenac; Resident Agent, James Spike, Deniston. Route by Grand Trunk Railway to Kingston.\n\n3rd. The Addington Road, running north and south, through the County of\nAddington; Resident Agent, E. Perry, Tamworth. Route, by Grand Trunk Railway to Napanee.\n\n4th. The Hastings Road, running nearly parallel to the Addington Road, and connecting the County of Hastings with the Ottawa and Opeongo Road; Resident Agent, M. P. Hayes, Madoc. Route, by Grand Trunk Railway to Belleville.\n\n5th. The Burleigh Road, running through the Townships of Burleigh and Anstruther; Resident Agent, Joseph Graham, Peterborough. Route, by Grand Trunk Railway to Cobourg and Peterborough.\n\n6th. The Bobcaygeon Road, running from Bobcaygeon, between the Counties of Peterborough and Victoria, north, and intended to be continued to Lake Nipissing. Resident Agents; for southerly portion, R Hughes, Bobcaygeon; for northerly portion, G. G. Boswell, Minden. Route, by Grand Trunk Railway to Cobourg and Peterborough, and thence by steamer to Bobcaygeon.\n\n7th. The Victoria Road, running north through the County of Victoria to the Peterson Road; Resident Agent, G. M. Roche, Lindsay. Route, by Grand Trunk Railway to Port Hope and Lindsay.\n\n8th. The Muskoka Road, running from Lake Couchiching to the Grand Falls of Muskoka; Resident Agent, R. J. Oliver, Orillia. Route, by Northern Railway from Toronto to Barrie, thence by steamer to Orillia.\n\nBy means of these roads access is obtained to Townships recently surveyed by Government and now open for settlement. They are chiefly of excellent quality, and well adapted, in respect of soil and climate, to all the purposes of husbandry.\n\nThe roads in Lower Canada are:\n\n1st. The Elgin Road, in the County of L'Islet, about 35 miles long, from St. Jean, Port Joly, to the Provincial line, and that part of the Tach\u00e9 Road, from the County of B\u00e9cancour to that of Kamouraska, inclusive, about 100 miles. Resident Agent, S. Drapeau, St. Jean, Port Joly.\n\n2nd. The Matapedia Road, from Fleurian to River Restigouche, 46 miles; and that part of the Tach\u00e9 Road, from the County of Kamouraska to that of Rimouski, about 100 miles. Resident Agent, J. B. Lepage, Rimouski.\n\n3rd. The Temiscouata Road, from Rivi\u00e8re-du-Loup to Lake Temiscouata, Resident Agent, L. N. Gauvreau, Isle Verte.\nFREE GRANT ROADS.\n\nHASTINGS ROAD.\n\nAgent: M. P. HAYES, Madoc.\n\nIn this agency there are 290,000 acres for sale in the townships of Tudor, Lake Cashel, Wollaston, Limerick, Faraday, Dungannon, Herschel, Monteagle, McClure, Wicklow, and Bangor. The country within the boundaries of Limerick, Wollaston, Dungannon, and Faraday, is the region where the waters divide, and consequently the height of land between the Ottawa and rivers running into Lake Ontario. It cannot, therefore, be otherwise than rough. Still there are many tracts of good arable land to be met with, and the very roughest of it would make good pasture land, having water in abundance.\n\nMonteagle is represented to be superior land, thickly and heavily wooded, and the surface undulating. The Hastings road forms a direct line of communication through this agency, and is connected by the Peterson line with the Opeongo road.\n\nTotal number of applications for land in 1862.................. 600\nNumber of Free Grants allocated................................. 30\nNumber of Lots sold.............................................. 39\n\nOf the applicants about one-third were Emigrants of the season\u2014Germans and English. Only seven families became actual settlers. Of these, four took free grants, and three purchased lands. There are some improved farms for sale in this district, the price of which is regulated by the quality of the land, locality, and the nature and extent of improvements. Their value ranges from 2 dollars up to 25 dollars an acre, the latter being the value of good land within easy distance of the villages.\n\nIn his report to Government for the year 1861, Mr. Hayes says:\n\nThe total number of settlers in possession of lots is 377, and their national origin is as follows:\n\n| Country       | Number |\n|---------------|--------|\n| England       | 54     |\n| Ireland       | 167    |\n| Scotland      | 41     |\n| Canada        | 74     |\n| Germany       | 25     |\n| France        | 2      |\n| Nova Scotia   | 1      |\n| New Brunswick | 1      |\n| Orkney        | 3      |\n| United States | 9      |\n\nThe number of acres cleared, and in process of clearing at the close of 1861,\nwas 3641, showing an increase of 960 acres during the year. The number of acres under crop and pasture in 1861 was 2681.\n\nThe following table shows the crops and other industrial products of the free grant settlers during 1861:\n\n| RATE. | VALUE. |\n|-------|--------|\n|       | Dols.  | Dols.  |\n| Spring Wheat | 10,200 bushels, | 0 80 | 8,160 00 |\n| Fall Wheat | 228 \" | 1 00 | 228 00 |\n| Oats | 10,345 \" | 0 25 | 2,586 25 |\n| Peas | 1,338 \" | 0 40 | 555 20 |\n| Barley | 200 \" | 0 60 | 120 00 |\n| Rye | 203 \" | 0 50 | 101 50 |\n| Potatoes | 29,250 \" | 0 25 | 7,312 50 |\n| Hay (Timothy) | 459 tons, | 10 00 | 4,590 00 |\n| Hay (Marsh) | 88 \" | 6 00 | 528 00 |\n| Turnips | 29,120 bushels, | 0 20 | 5,824 00 |\n| Maple Sugar | 1,427 lbs., | 0 10 | 142 70 |\n| Ditto Molasses | 400 gallons, | 0 75 | 300 00 |\n| Potash | 119 barrels, | 30 00 | \u00a3570 00 |\n| Shingles | 320 M., | 1 00 | 320 00 |\n| Sawn Lumber | 300 M. feet, | 8 00 | 2,400 00 |\n| Potash Barrels | 200 | 1 00 | 200 00 |\n| Straw | 1,000 tons, | 4 00 | 4,000 00 |\n| Deer killed, say | 200 | 4 00 | 880 00 |\n| Furs, estimated at | | | 1,500 00 |\n| Fish, taken in lakes and rivers, say | | | 400 00 |\n| Garden Produce, say | | | 500 00 |\n\nTotal value of year's products.............. 44,218 15 dols.\n\nCATTLE OWNED BY FREE GRANT SETTLERS.\n\n| 1859. | 1860. | 1861.

The buildings on the road include 1 flour mill, 3 saw mills, 4 stores, 5 taverns, 1 schoolhouse. Those erected in 1861 are chiefly large substantial barns, and dwellings of a good class.\n\nThe season of 1861 was not so favourable for agricultural operations as that of 1860. The spring was comparatively late, and from a scarcity of rain in the early months of summer the crops suffered, particularly hay and pasture.\n\nWheat was generally thick on the ground; a good plump grain, and entirely free from fly.\n\nOats gave a large yield, and were generally heavier and better than those grown on the front townships.\n\nPotatoes are the great staple of the new townships, and they certainly are much finer and more abundant than in the older settlements. I regret to say that the rot appeared to some extent on the lower part of the road. It did not extend above the centre of the second range of townships, and the cases are not numerous where it spread to a large extent.\n\nTurnips were very extensively cultivated, and gave large yields. They are becoming a very important article of produce for winter fodder.\n\nHay was not a very good crop, owing to the want of sufficient rain in the early part of the season, which prevented a heavy growth of grass.\n\nIt is now nearly six years since the Hastings road was first opened for settlement. The soil and climate have, therefore, been fully and fairly tested. The main outline of facts may be thus briefly stated:\u2014Some 300 poor men with seldom any means beyond their ability to labour, have settled upon these lands, previously a wilderness, and in five years have accumulated round them the real wealth and property represented in the above tables, besides supporting themselves and their families during that period.\n\nA very low estimate of the value of permanent improvements, and farm implements owned on the road, gives $406 dollars as the average value of each settler's property. This result must be considered highly satisfactory when it is borne in mind that many of the most successful settlers entered upon their lands only so few years ago with little or no capital.\n\nFanning mills and threshing machines have been introduced very generally, and most of the older settlers have a good supply of farming tools and implements.\n\nThe same freedom from disease and crime which marked the earlier years of the settlement, has, I am happy to say, continued during 1861.\n\nThe nearest vacant free grant lots now are about 50 miles from Madoc, but the best settlement I have is still further north, at and near the intersection of the branch road with the Hastings, and along the eastern branch, connecting with the Madawaska river. I agree with you in thinking that, as a generally rule, it is\nbetter for emigrants to buy farms with small clearings from the earlier settlers than to go a long way back into the woods the first year, and I generally advise them to do so; but their success depends much more upon their individual fitness or unfitness for the work than upon any external condition. I find that those who succeed best are those who go in with little or no means except their labour; they work quietly and steadily on their land and in four or five years become quite independent. On the other hand, those who have some capital generally idle away a great part of their time, and when their money is gone they are dissatisfied with the country. In fact, unless a man has been brought up to labour he has no business in the woods. If he has been brought up to it, and is willing and able to work, he can do better than in any other way that I know of.\n\nWe have some very good land now open for settlement in the townships of Cashel, Limerick, and Wollaston, about 30 miles from Madoc, and comparatively easy of access. The land is turning out much better in these townships than we expected, and I have no doubt that they will support a large and thriving population before many years.\n\nThe crops in general are not quite equal to those of last year, but are fully up to the average.\n\nRoute.\u2014By Grand Trunk Railway to Belleville, 888 miles, fare 3 dollars 50 cents; thence by stage to Madoc, 26 miles, fare 1 dollar.\n\nCOUNTY OF ADDINGTON\u2014ADDINGTON ROAD.\n\nAgent: EBENEZER PERRY, Tamworth.\n\nReports that there are about 200,000 acres for sale in this district. Price per acre 70 cents, or 2s. 10d. sterling, cash, or one dollar (4s. sterling) if paid by instalments.\n\nOne-third of the land is broken with granite interspersed with limestone. The soil is a rich sandy loam, timbered with maple, birch, beech, butternut, elm, ash, basswood, pine, hemlock, cedar, and a little oak. This is a very healthy location; no fever or ague; the soil productive, and all the settlers on good terms with one another. There are ten school-houses opened in various districts. Religious services every Sunday in different places. Many saw and grist mills are in full operation, and the waters abound with fish.\n\nNot more than a few gift lots remain on this road that are fit for settling on, unless the settlers would purchase Crown Lands in the vicinity; the distance from Tamworth to the gift lands is about 50 miles.\n\nThe settlers, who are for the most part Irish, Scotch, English and Germans, frequently seek employment during the harvest time in other settlements, and consequently there is no demand for immigrant labor. The country is too recently settled to have many improved farms upon it, but lots of 100 acres, with from five\nto fifteen acres cleared, can be got from 50 to 150 dollars, subject to payment of the government purchase money. If all the instalments have been paid the lots range in value from \u00a330 to \u00a350 sterling.\n\nMr. Perry further says:\u2014\"I concur in your views that it is better policy for Emigrants to purchase when improvements have been made. Emigrants when massed together are not the best pioneers, their habits and training unfit them for clearing land, the science of chopping is scarcely ever learnt to perfection by a man after 30. Emigrants succeed well if mixed with Canadian settlers, they soon learn how to chop and log from them, they are more industrious and frugal than the great mass of Canadians who generally seek a home in the forest for the excitement of wild sports, while the emigrant has come to make a home for his family. All the emigrants in my district are prospering.\"\n\nFrom Napanee to the Crown Lands, the distance ranges from 17 to 70 miles. From Kingston a daily line of stages to Tamworth, 37 miles, and the Addington Road runs north 62 miles up to the Madawaska River, all the lands are within 10 miles of the Addington Road.\n\nRoute by Grand Trunk Railway or steamer to Kingston, 340 miles, fare 3 dollars 75 cents, or to Napanee 367 miles, fare 4 dollars; thence by stage to Tamworth.\n\n---\n\nTHE BOBCAYGEON ROAD.\u2014COUNTY OF VICTORIA.\n\nAgent: RICHARD HUGHES, Bobcaygeon\n\nMr. Hughes, the agent for this road, sends in the following report of the progress and present state of the settlements under his charge:\n\nAll the Free Grants on the Bobcaygeon Road, (except a few which are considered unworthy of settlement) as far as Bell's Line, a distance of nearly fifty miles, as the road runs, from Bobcaygeon, have been taken up, but some have been forfeited by non-fulfilment of conditions, and are now vacant, they are however few and scarcely worth mention.\n\nHowever, the Department of Crown Lands have sent out a Provincial Land Surveyor and party, to lay out the Free Grants along the road for some distance beyond Bell's Line. These lands and those in the neighbourhood are said to be pretty good. A contract has been entered into for the construction of the road. Ten miles have been underbrushed, a considerable amount of chopping done, and the contractor intends to finish as early as possible in the spring. The boundaries of the Free Grants will then be defined, and they will probably be prepared for settlement as early as emigrants will arrive, so that some can be accommodated on this road with Free Grants and any quantity of lands for sale which may be required in the townships bordering on the road.\nThose who have gone in as settlers, both on Free Grants and on the purchased lands, are generally well pleased with their own prospects and those of the whole settlement, but still, a difference of opinion does exist; there is no doubt a good deal of rough rocky land, but one thing speaks favourably for the settlement, those who sell out, do so generally for a good price, to the emigrant, or to others who wish to purchase improved farms with buildings on them, and almost invariably buy again and commence the world anew on another farm. I consider this the best way for the emigrant to procure a farm when he has means.\n\nAnother thing in favour of the settlement is, that although the first ten miles of the road, (which commences at Bobcaygeon, seven miles south of the first Government lands, either for sale or gift) is generally rough and stony; and although a good deal of opposition was made to the scheme of opening the lands by the Government at all, on account of the popular opinion being that they were altogether unworthy of settlement. The following statement, which I take the liberty to copy from my report to the Honorable the Commissioner of Crown Lands, will show that they are not altogether unworthy of notice:\n\n| Number of Free Grant lots located south of Bell's Line with actual settlers. | 271 |\n| Whole number of settlers on Free Grants, including families | 783 |\n| Houses built | 137 |\n| Barns and stables | 79 |\n| Horses owned | 14 |\n| Working oxen | 206 |\n| Horned cattle | 79 |\n| Pigs | 235 |\n| Number of acres cleared | 1438 |\n| Do. chopped but not cleared | 440 |\n| Under crop | 998 |\n| Value of crops raised on the Free Grants | $30,777 10 dollars, making an average of over thirty dollars for the crop raised on each acre. |\n\nThere are about 300,000 acres for sale in the townships of Galway, Somerville, Cavendish, Lutterworth, Snowdon, Anson, Minden, Hindon, Stanhope and Sherborne. Galway is well watered, and although undulating and stony in places, has intervening valleys in which the soil is deep and fertile. The township swarms with beaver.\n\nThe land in Lutterworth is in general undulating and intersected with numerous small lakes. There are excellent water privileges in the immediate vicinity of Gull Lake.\n\nMinden is a good township, and is being fast settled with an industrious and intelligent class. The soil is generally composed of a sandy loam, in some cases resting upon a substratum of clay and gravel, and is of good depth. Hindon is well adapted for settlement. For small craft, an almost unbroken water commu-\nnication from Lindsay to within half a mile of its eastern limit, affords intending settlers a readiness of approach, not often found by those seeking homes in newly surveyed districts. A large proportion of good land is found in the south-eastern, central, and western portions of the township. In this Agency the advantages of the Bobcaygeon road are incalculable to the settlers.\n\nThe number of applications for land in 1862 was 200 and 98 lots were sold.\n\nThere are several improved farms for sale and to let; the price of an improved farm with 12 or 15 acres cleared is about from 200 to 400 dollars per 100 acres.\n\nScarcely any demand for labor.\n\nRoute by G. T. R. to Port Hope 437, fare 4 dollars 50 cents; thence to Bobcaygeon, via Lindsay, by rail and steamer, 75 miles.\n\nBURLEIGH ROAD.\u2014COUNTY OF PETERBOROUGH.\n\nJOSEPH GRAHAM, Peterborough, Agent for Burleigh Road.\n\nThe land in the townships on the Burleigh Road is generally very good, nearly two-thirds of it being adapted for settlement. Price per acre, 70 cents, or 2s. 10d. stg., cash, or 1 dollar on time. Quantity for sale 200,000 acres, 480 hundred acre lots were disposed of by the Agent last year, some to English Emigrants with ample means to clear their farms.\n\nThere is a very fair demand for agricultural laborers in the County of Peterborough. Wages vary from 8 to 16 dollars a month; female domestics get from 4 to 5 dollars a month, with board. Plenty of improved farms may be purchased in the County for from \u00a32 to \u00a310 sterling per acre, according to the quality of soil and locality. A few might be rented at from 8s. to 15s. sterling per acre.\n\nA road is completed as far back as the rear of the Township of Burleigh.\n\nRoute.\u2014By Grand Trunk Railway to Peterborough, via Cobourg, 459 miles, for 5 dollars 50 cents.\n\nMUSKOKA ROAD.\n\nAgent: R. J. OLIVER, Orillia, Co. Simcoe.\n\nMr. Oliver in a report received from him the 24th January, 1862, thus writes:\n\nThe Muskoka Road is the most westerly, and the last towards Lake Huron of several free grant or colonial roads, running nearly north and south, from the border settlements of Upper Canada, to a road running at right angles from Ottawa city to the upper part of Lake Huron at Sault Ste. Marie, in a direct line to the Red River settlement.\n\nThis road commences on the river Severn, which empties from Lake Couchiching, or Lake Simcoe into Lake Huron, was placed under my charge in August, 1861, which was then being intended. The land is found to be located at a weekly mill is at 249, ditto German, 600 ; ditto 200 ; ditto 35 ; poultry.\n\nThe villages, &c., on the road, &c., only. To the lot, four years.\n\nThe Muskoka, through the last, since land was bought lots before as follows: French 14; one lot pigs 75 ;\n\nThe share Emigrant. The Muscoo, formerly directed 50 milcs. contiguous to the county's South route to Toronto, travel, and etc.\n\nFrom water;\nAugust, 1859, with about 19 miles of road to the great falls of Muskoka, on which were 137 free grant lots. The first portion of the road is being intersected with large belts of rock, but the soil is good, and much better land is found in the rear, bounding Sparrow and Muskoka lakes. 72 of these lots are located, presenting in many cases good clearances and buildings. A lumber mill is at work on the road, a school house built, and one about to be built, with a weekly mail, soon to be made a tri-weekly. The total population on the road is 249, divided as follows:\u2014Irish, 116; Scotch, 65; English, 43; Canadian, 19; German, 6; Improvements\u2014houses, 54; shanties, 37; barns, &c., 28; acres cleared, 200; ditto chopped, 100; stock comprises: cows, 10; cattle, 30; horses, 8; pigs, 35; poultry, 300.\n\nThe value of produce grown the past harvest, including molasses, sugar, shingles, &c., amounts to $5,282.25 dollars. There are three taverns, and as many stores on the road. Religious services are regularly performed by Protestant denominations. All males 18 years of age are entitled, to 100 acres, for a fee of 5 dollars only. To clear 12 acres in four years, build a house 16 by 20, and to reside on the lot. These conditions entitle the holder to a clear deed at the expiration of four years.\n\nThe Crown Lands under my charge, comprise four townships, Morrison, Muskoka, Draper, and Macaulay. The colonial road before mentioned runs through these townships. The Crown Lands came into my charge in October last, since which time 6,060 acres have been disposed of. A great portion of this land was occupied by squatters, who had made considerable improvements on their lots before they came into market. The total population on Crown Lands is 421, as follows: Irish, 139; English 88; Scotch, 112; Canadian, 13; German 53; French 16. Improvements\u2014houses 44; shanties 72; barns, &c., 28; outhouses, 14; one lumber mill at work. Stock comprises: horses 8; cows 68; cattle 70; pigs 75; poultry 200; last harvest return, $7,262.20 dollars.\n\nThe settlement presents the following summary:\u2014Population, 670; houses, 78; shanties, 109; barns, &c., 60; live stock, 330; year's produce, $10,532.75. Emigrants, 15 families: Irish, 3; English, 8; German, 2; French, 2; 64 souls. The Muskoka Road is extending from the great Fall of Muskoka in a north-western direction to a harbour at Parry's Sound on Lake Huron, a distance of about 50 miles. The land and timber improves very much on this new road, and is contiguous to a chain of four lakes. By striking a bee-line from the harbour on Parry's Sound to Ottawa City, through the country now opening up, will show this route to be 200 miles shorter than the one now open by way of Collingwood and Toronto, and 170 nearer to Montreal. This is an important saving in western travel, and one that must make the settlement a valuable one.\n\nFrom this village to the settlement is 14 miles, 12 of which can be travelled by water; two boats run daily in summer, and in winter either by road on lake shore\nor on the ice. The settlement can be reached from Toronto in one day, either in winter or summer. It will be seen, therefore, that the access is both rapid and easy. No difficulty has yet arisen in obtaining work for emigrants, either at road making or clearing, the former supplied by contractors, the latter by settlers, with means to enable them to hire to get their lands cleared as fast as possible. This will undoubtedly continue. Men capable of building log houses, &c., obtain in some instances one dollar per day and rations, the usual rate is from 75 cents to 4s. sterling a day, without rations.\n\nThe prevailing quality of the soil is light with a mixture of sand, having in large districts a subsoil of grey clay. There are also heavy clay bottoms, having a loamy surface. The lands are exceedingly well timbered and watered by lakes and rivers, with fish in abundance and excellent mill sites. Grain and root crops of all kinds yield well. Partly improved farms are always to be had in the neighbourhood, suitable for a person of moderate means; but the class of settlers most desirable are those who are accustomed to work, with small capital to purchase a necessary outfit of farming utensils (which at first are simple) and provisions for sustenance until after a first crop is realised. Money is of little use here unless muscle is brought into play, for the most unfortunate are those who entertain romantic ideas of bush life, thinking that nothing is required beyond their means but a little pleasant relaxation. All such are victims in new countries, and cannot hope to succeed. The hard-working, industrious, and thrifty labourer, or small farmer of the old countries are such as in the course of a few years make for themselves a comfortable homestead and independent living. I can already point to such as promise this in the district under my charge, while the older settled townships adjoining furnish examples by the hundred of those who commenced penniless, but, by perhaps first hiring out for a year or two accumulated a few dollars, which, being invested in a yoke of oxen, a few implements, and in taking up some of the unoccupied land have been enabled after the lapse of a few years to enjoy their hard-earned position, as Lords of their Manors, without a care to disturb them. In no other pursuit is the result so surely and steadily arrived at, and the Severn and Muskoka districts offer to the emigrant a sure reward for toil voluntarily undertaken.\n\nThere are about 150,000 acres of land for sale. Price 70 cents., or 2s. 10d. sterling, an acre, cash.\n\nRoute.\u2014By Grand Trunk Railway to Toronto, distance 500 miles, fare 5 dollars, then by Northern Railroad to Bell Evart, then steamer to Orillia\u201487 miles.\nOTTAWA AND OPEONGO ROAD.\n\nAgent: T. P. French, Clontarf.\n\nIn this agency there are 250,000 acres open for settlement in the following townships:\n\nIn County of Renfrew: Townships of Algona, Brudenell, Grattan, Radcliffe, Sebastopol.\n\nIn District of Nipissing: Sherwood, Hagarty and Richards.\n\nThere is much land of good quality in the township of Algona. About two-thirds of the township is well adapted for settlement and well wooded.\n\nThere is a large, prosperous settlement of Englishmen in the township of Brudenell, adjoining the free grants, and it is anticipated that the Prussians, a hard-working, thrifty, and seemingly honest people, who are fast acquiring a knowledge of our language, and of the habits of the country, will receive a considerable increase to their numbers.\n\nSebastopol: The whole township is remarkably well watered, and the water invariably good. All the lakes abound with salmon trout, and other varieties of fish. The settlers in the township have a ready market for all kinds of produce at the lumber shanties in the immediate vicinity.\n\nThe three agencies above-mentioned comprise a portion of what is termed the Ottaw\u00e1 territory in Upper Canada, and contain large tracts of fertile land. The different descriptions of timber prevail separately in particular tracts, and afford a convenient territorial division of the country. The first of these natural divisions is what has been called the white-pine country, from the prevalence of that kind of timber, of which it contains the finest forests, interspersed with tracts of hard wood land. It is generally arable and of a good quality throughout, much of it being equal to the best lands in the western peninsula in every respect. The county of Renfrew is included in this tract.\n\nWestward of this lies the red pine country, so called from the prevalence of that kind of wood. The soil of this division is generally a poor sand, more or less gravelly, and in parts the surface is rugged and rocky, but interspersed with tracts of good land.\n\nThe third natural division is the hard-wood country, so called from the prevalence of that description of timber, associated with belts of white pine. It comprises an area of upwards of 7000 superficial miles, and contains the head-waters of the rivers Madawaska and Petawawa, the flow into the Ottawa, and of the Muskoka and Maganetawan of Lake Huron, and the whole of the south river of Lake Nipissing.\n\nThe intending settler should bear in mind that large tracts of rough land, if covered with valuable pine timber, much increase the value of a country for settlement by giving the settlers on the adjoining good lands a higher price for their produce than if these pine lands did not occur.\nThe undermentioned figures are the result of the Agent's inquiries as to the extent and value of the crop raised upon the free grants on this road in 1861:\n\n| Item                          | Quantity | Unit Price | Total Value |\n|-------------------------------|----------|------------|-------------|\n| 9724 bushels of Wheat         |          | 1 00       | 9724 00     |\n| 13362 \" Oats                  |          | 0 30       | 4008 60     |\n| 1149 \" Barley                 |          | 0 60       | 689 40      |\n| 64 \" Indian Corn              |          | 1 00       | 64 00       |\n| 829 Bushels of Peas           |          | 1 00       | 829 00      |\n| 20596 \" Potatoes              |          | 0 35       | 7207 60     |\n| 12847 \" Turnips               |          | 0 10       | 1284 70     |\n| 424 tons of Hay               |          | 8 00 per ton | 3392 00    |\n| 600 \" Straw                   |          | 3 00       | 1800 00     |\n| 2766 lbs. of Sugar            |          | 0 12 per lb.| 343 92      |\n| 102 gallons of Molasses       |          | 1 00 per gal | 102 00     |\n| 298 barrels of Pork           |          | 16 00 per brl.| 4736 00   |\n| 68 \" Potash                   |          | 20 00      | 1360 00     |\n| 4841 lbs. of Soap             |          | 0 10 per lb.| 484 10      |\n| 12429 bushels of Ashes        |          | 0 5 per bshl.| 621 00     |\n\nMaking ........................................... 36746 32 dols.\n\nThe great usefulness of this road as a highway to the lumbering regions of the Madawaska and Bonnech\u00e8re is evidenced by the fact that travel over it is steadily increasing. Three new schools have been put into operation quite recently, making the number of new schools now open upon the road seven, which are established upon the free school principle, and although unpretending establishments, they are eagerly availed of by the settlers for the education of their children.\n\nNIPISSING, DARLING AND LAVANT ROADS.\n\nMr. Snow, the Superintendent of these roads, sends in the following report, dated Hull, 26th February, 1862:\n\nThe Nipissing Road commences in the township of North Sherbrooke and running a westerly course, is intersected first by the Frontenac and Madawaska Road, at 23 miles; next by the Addington Road, at 40 miles, and lastly by the Hastings Road, at 72 miles; to which point the line has been surveyed. This road is now completed to the Addington Road\u201440 miles. On and in the vicinity of the road constructed, about 90 settlers are located. They are chiefly men with large families who owned small farms in the other townships, lying to the east or south, which they have disposed of at a high price. This money has enabled them to purchase land in the new townships sufficient for themselves and their sons. As yet no emigrants have located in this section, except a few Germans in the neighbourhood of Miller, the owner of Clarenville Roads.\n\nThe road containing a portion of the Nipissing Road is completed this year when completed, it will be of great benefit to the settlers, as it will facilitate communication between the townships and the outside world. The road is now being constructed by the settlers themselves, and it is anticipated that it will be completed in the near future.\n\nEXTENSION OF THE KING'S ROAD.\n\nA new extension of the King's Road appears to be contemplated, from Lennoxville to the head of the lake, a few score miles distant, the object being to facilitate the transportation of crops and other goods from the lake to the town.\nbourhood of the Addington Road. In the township of Denbigh, Abinger and Miller, there is room for extensive settlement on good land, as also in the township of Clarendon, which is traversed both by the Frontenac, Madawaska and Nipissing Roads.\n\nThe Lavant and Darling Road starts in the township of Darling and maintaining a south-westerly direction, crosses the township of Lavant, and intersects the Nipissing Road at its 14th mile in the township of Palmerston. When completed the length of this road will be about 21 milcs. Five miles of it are finished; when completed it will shorten the route between Ottawa City and the new townships, intersected by the Nipissing Road, for which purpose it was originally projected. The lands suitable for settlement along the first ten miles of its course are chiefly occupied, and several beginnings have been made further southward, in anticipation of the road being opened. With respect to improved farms, my opinion coincides with yours, that it would be much better for the emigrant, if his means allowed it, to purchase a farm upon which some improvements have been made, instead of going immediately, without experience, into the woods. In this part of the country, and in the old settlements contiguous to the road under my charge, improved farms are generally held at too high a rate to come within the reach of the emigrant, prices ranging from 12 to 80 dollars per acre, and at the present very few are in the market.\n\nThe agency of the lands on and in the vicinity of these roads, is divided among several agents, among which I may mention Mr. McPherson, of Kingston; Mr. E. Perry, of Tamworth; and Mr. Harris, of Renfrew.\n\nEXTRACTS FROM REPORTS OF AGENTS OF CROWN LANDS.\n\nWESTERN CANADA,\n\nKINGSTON, PART OF FRONTENAC, LENNOX AND ADDINGTON.\n\nAgent: James McPherson,\u2014Office: Kingston.\n\nAccording to a report recently sent in by Mr. McPherson, about 165,000 acres appear to be still open for sale in different parts of the Counties of Frontenac, Lennox and Addington at 70 cents an acre, cash, or 1 dollar on the usual time. A few scattered lots throughout the older townships are sold at a valuation, there being no set price. The soil in many parts is of a very fertile description; the crops grown are large and no district in Upper Canada offers better inducement to the Settler. Portions of the land are timbered with Maple, Beech and other\nwoods of heavy growth, whilst others are unfit for cultivation, being broken with Hills, Rocks, and Lakes.\n\nIn Olden, excellent crops of wheat, oats, Indian corn, potatoes and turnips have been produced, but the land, generally, is better adapted for grazing than other kinds of husbandry.\n\nPalmerston is generally well adapted for agricultural purposes. It is traversed by the Mississipi road as well as by the line of the Lavant and Darling road. Along the first mentioned road the settlement is progressing rapidly. The entire township is well watered by creeks and springs. The Mississipi river affords an incalculable amount of water power. In Miller, the land generally is rolling or undulating, traversed by numerous brooks and streamlets of excellent water. The facilities afforded for transport by the Mississipi and Frontenac roads, passing through a healthy section of country, the land tolerably good, building materials in abundance, a sufficient supply of water power for manufacturing purposes, a ready market for the surplus produce of the settlers, and employment for themselves and terms during the winter months at the lumbering establishments, serve to render Miller and the adjacent Townships as desirable a field for settlement as this part of the country affords.\n\n14,789 acres of land were sold by the Agent last year to 86 emigrants of the season, being an average of 171 acres a piece; they were nearly all English, Irish, and Scotch, and brought an aggregate capital of about 40,000 dollars. There are 40 or 50 improved farms for sale in the district, the prices of which range from 8 to 40 dollars an acre. In the summer season a good demand generally exists for farm laborers. Wages from 8 to 12 dollars a month with board according to efficiency. Early in the spring good ploughmen are required. After the crops are in the ground laborers are not wanted until the 1st of July or beginning of harvest; after harvest is over there is no demand for them at all. Servant girls are in great request amongst the farmers for milking and farm house work; wages from 2 to 5 dollars a month. Little or no demand for mechanics, and none for persons unaccustomed to manual labor.\n\nRoute.\u2014By the Grand Trunk Railway or Steamboat, to Kingston, 340 miles, fare 3 dollars 75 cents; by daily stage to Frontenac, Lennox or Addington.\n\nCOUNTY OF VICTORIA.\n\nAgent: G. M. ROCHF, Lindsay.\n\nThe quantity of land pertaining to the Crown open for sale in this Agent's division, and subject to actual settlement, is 200,000 acres, in the Townships of Carden, Laxton, Dalton, Digby, Oakley, and Ryde.\n\nIn Carden and Laxton the soil is composed of a sandy loam, varying in depth from one to two feet to stratified limestone rock of a soft crumbling description.\nDigby.\u2014The great body of the Township is high rolling land. In the intervening valleys, the soil is deep, rich, and fertile. Portions of the Township are of the limestone formation. There are numerous sites where machinery could be effectually worked by water power.\n\nDalton, in a lumbering point of view, possesses great advantages, being well watered by three rivers, on which there are several falls and rapids. The Township is settling rapidly.\n\nIn Oakley, the advantages of settlement are good, owing to the Peterson Road being opened through the Township. Where it crosses the Black River there is an eligible site for a town plot, having advantages of never-failing water privileges, and good land in the vicinity. The lands are about 30 to 35 miles from the railway station, and are accessible by the Victoria Colonization Road. Improved farms may be purchased at from 16 dollars to 40 dollars per acre, according to the extent of cleared land and value of improvements. Made farms can be rented at 2 dollars to 3 dollars, for the cleared land, per acre.\n\nThere is a fair demand in the County for labor, good hands getting 12 dollars to 16 dollars per month, with board. Day laborers get 80 cents per day, and Carpenters, Bricklayers, and Plasterers, (the principal trades required) 1 dollar 25 cents to 1 dollar 50 cents.\n\nRoute:\u2014By Grand Trunk Railway to Port Hope, 347 miles, thence by Rail to Lindsay, 40 miles.\n\nDISTRICT OF ALGOMA.\n\nAgent: JOSEPH WILSON, Sault Ste. Marie.\n\nThis agency embraces a portion of the Huron and Superior territory. Sault Ste. Marie being a free port, all goods duly imported and entered there go into consumption free of duty within the District attached to it.\n\nIn the vicinity of the town, lands are for sale in the Townships of Aw\u00e9nage, Aw\u00e9res, Tarentorus, Korah, Prince, Parke, and Macdonald. In the rear are the Indian Townships of Fenwick, Kars, and Pennefather, containing much good land.\n\nThe Townships of Rose, Lefroy, Patton, Thompson, Esten, Spragge, and Salter, on the north shore of Lake Huron, are in this agency. The lands in them are sold for one shilling an acre. Besides its land and timber, the characteristics of this territory are its mineral treasures (*) and its fisheries.\n\n(*) Copper Mining Districts on the Shores of Lake Huron and Lake Superior.\u2014Not far from Sault Ste. Marie, the following Copper Mines are now being worked, viz.\u2014The \"Huron Copper Bay\" and \"Wellington,\" by the West Canada (London Joint Stock) Company, and the \"Bruce Mines\" by the Montreal Mining Company. The aggregate quantity of ore produced annually at these mines is not far from 3,000 tons of 20 per cent., and surface hands and miners are always in demand at good wages; good farming lands, situated a few miles back in the interior from the Bruce mines, can be purchased at very moderate prices from the Montreal Mining Company, and the same Company possess on the north shore of Lake Superior 18 locations, containing over 100,000 acres of carefully selected mineral lands, which can be purchased or leased on favorable terms, in quantities to suit purchasers or lessees.\nSpragge is situated at the mouth of Serpent River. Salter is situated near the mouth of Spanish River. It is well timbered, many sections abounding with maple of large size, and pine of superior quality. It is easy of access, a great part of the front being on Spanish River, which is navigable 15 miles past the Township. Thompson is situated near the mouth of Mississagua River.\n\nThere are 103,000 acres open for sale, price 70 cents, or 2s. 10d. sterling per acre, cash. There are no improved farms for sale.\n\nROUTE\u2014By rail to Sarnia or Collingwood, thence by steamer, whole distance 900 miles; fare, 8 dollars.\n\nFORT WILLIAM.\u2014LAKE SUPERIOR.\n\nAgent: ROBERT McVICAR, Fort William, Lake Superior.\n\nTwo Townships called Neebing and Pai-Poonge, have been surveyed and are offered for sale, also the town plot of Fort William, situate on the Kaministiqua River, which empties itself into Thunder Bay, near the Western extremity of Lake Superior. These Townships are bounded on the South by high ranges of trap rocks. At the base of these we get into a level plain forming the valley of the Kaministiqua River. The soil consists in general of a reddish clayey loam, well adapted for cultivation. Between the long windings of the river, are flats of rich alluvial deposit, giving growth to large elm, ash, &c. The country on both sides of the river is well watered by numerous creeks, affording excellent mill sites.\n\nThe climate at Fort William in winter, is not more severe than that in the neighborhood of Montreal, the snow leaving the ground about the middle of April.\n\nFarm lots in this agency are sold for one shilling an acre.\n\nROUTE\u2014By Rail to Collingwood, thence by steamer.\n\nNORTH OF THE RIVER OTTAWA.\n\nAgent: THOMAS BARRON, Lachute.\n\n39,500 acres is the quantity of land for sale in the townships forming this District, viz.: Chatham, Wentworth, Morin, Gore, and Howard; price 30 cents an acre, payable in five yearly instalments. The soil is of good quality and fertile. In some places it is stony, but the lands in the main are excellent, being well supplied with water, and commanding good sites for grist and saw mills, as well as other machinery. Sixty applications for land were made last season, but only five sales were effected; eight or ten of the applicants were immigrants with small means, the rest Canadians. Partly improved farms can be purchased as low as from \u00a350 to 100, and from that to \u00a3400. A good demand exists for farm laborers; wages from \u00a320 to \u00a330 per year, according to capability. Female ser-\nvants are greatly needed; also a few cartwrights, weavers, masons, bricklayers, plasterers, carpenters, and joiners.\n\nRoute\u2014By steamer from Montreal to Carillon on the River Ottawa, from thence a distance of eight miles by stage; fare, about 7s. 6d.\u20146s. sterling.\n\nPORT OF ARGENTEUIL\n\nAgent: WILLIAM THOMPSON, Fitzallan, Arundel.\n\nThis agency in the rear of Argenteuil. Th lands have been recently opened for sale, and consist of 70,000 acres, at 30 cents (1s. 4d.) an acre, in the Townships of Montcalm, Arundel, and DeSalaberry. A road has been opened by Government through the District. The soil in the limestone valleys, and on the gently sloping hills, is very fertile, but there is much steep, rocky land, abounding in valuable timber, although not arable. The operations of the lumberers greatly facilitate the settlement of the fertile tracts, by opening roads and affording a ready market, at high prices, for the products of the farmer, and labor for himself, his horses and oxen at the season when they are not required on the farm.\n\nThere is scarcely any demand whatever for immigrant labor.\n\nCOUNTY OF OTTAWA.\n\nAgent: E. W. MURRAY, Buckingham.\n\nAbout one-third of the land in this district is mountainous, but well timbered with pine, maple, birch, &c. The soil is very fertile; in some parts a rich sandy loam prevails and in others, heavy clay. Two-thirds of the settlers are foreigners, Germans, Swedes and Norwegians, the remainder Irish and Scotch. Partially improved farms can always be purchased in the neighbourhood at reasonable prices, say from 4 to 20 dollars an acre. Quantity of land for sale\u2014100,000 acres; price 60 cents per acre.\n\nRoute.\u2014To Ottawa, by rail or steamer, thence by steamer, 22 miles, to Buckingham; fare 4 dollars.\n\nCOUNTY OF OTTAWA.\n\nAgent: ROBERT FARLEY, Chelsea.\n\n290,000 acres is the quantity of Crown Land for sale in the above-named district; three-fourths of which are fit for agricultural purposes, the remainder being partly of a swampy and partly of a mountainous character. The soil is light and sandy, blue clay and loam. Ordinary wages for males, \u00a32 to \u00a32 16s. sterling a month; for female servants, from 8s. to 16s. a month, with board and lodging.\nThere are improved farms for sale. All the lands are easily accessible by the Gatineau Road, on the west side of the River Gatineau, going north.\n\nRoute.\u2014By rail to Ottawa City, 335 miles; fare 3 dollars 50 cents; thence by stage, 8 miles, to Chelsea.\n\nCOUNTY OF OTTAWA.\n\nAgent: GEO. W. CAMERON, Thurso.\n\nHas about 54,000 acres of land for sale in the district under his charge at 60 cents per acre.\n\nThe land in the near townships is of a mountainous character, but well adapted for settlement, numerous tracts of fertile soil, are to be found in the valleys; 67 lots were disposed of by Mr. Cameron last year, but none to British immigrants. The settlers are principally French Canadians, the demand for labour is but poor, wages from 6 to 12 dollars per month. There are a few improved farms for sale at from 4 to 20 dollars per acre. Colonization Roads are opening up the valley of the ninth nation, first 15 miles in good condition.\n\nRoute.\u2014Steamer from Montreal via Carrillon to Petite Nation 96 miles; fare 3 dollars. There are three landing places to get to the lands, viz: Granville, Montobello, and Thurso.\n\nCOUNTY OF OTTAWA.\n\nAgent: M. McBEAN, Northfield.\n\nIn this agency there are 283,000 acres disposable at 60 cents an acre, in the Townships of Cameron, Bouchette, Northfield, Kensington, Aumand, Wright, Egan, Sicotte, Baskatonge, and Lyton. This district is well adapted for settlement, the only drawbacks being the want of good roads.\n\nFrom Mr. McBean's last report it appears that there are 245,144 acres of land at present for sale in the townships under his charge. Price 60 cents, or 2s. 5d. sterling, per acre. The soil is grey loam with clay bottom, well adapted for settlement, the only drawback being the want of good roads. During the two past seasons he sold 30,323 acres; and with respect to the value of farms, and the demand for emigrant labor in the districts, he says: I have no doubt but that a number of improved farms might be purchased from many of the old settlers, for cash, at 1 or 2 dollars an acre. They would then retire to the rear and make new farms, being acquainted with the woods. Emigrants coming here to settle could always get work from old settlers at a fair recompense. The disposition here is to help any new settlers coming in.\n\nRoute.\u2014By rail to Ottawa City, thence up the River Gatineau to Northfield.\nPART OF PONTIAC.\n\nAgent: Terence Smith, Allumette Island.\n\nThe lands still unsold in this district, amount in the aggregate to 92,000 acres. Price, 60 cents, equal to 2s. 5d. sterling an acre. The quality of the soil is of a very light description, except in a few small tracts between the mountains. The emigrant would find little or no chance of employment in this vicinity, as in general, the settlers depend upon the lumber trade, and prefer resident labor. There are six improved farms for sale, at low prices, and a few for rent or on shares of half-annual crops.\n\nRoute.\u2014By rail to Ottawa City, thence by steamer to Pembroke, 84 miles, by stage, 6 miles.\n\nPART OF PONTIAC.\n\nAgent: F. X. Bastien, Culmet.\n\nThis agency contains nearly 12,000 acres within its limits, the average price is 60 cents, or 2s. 5d. sterling an acre. The land, it must be observed, is not of superior quality, but there is good access to it at all seasons of the year. The settlers are chiefly French Canadians, and a few immigrants, at wages varying from \u00a314 8s. to \u00a324 sterling per annum, with board, may find employment. Last year the wages were very low.\n\nRoute.\u2014By rail to Ottawa City, thence by steamer to Portage du Fort 63 miles, thence by stage 12 miles.\n\nCOUNTY OF PONTIAC.\n\nAgent: G. M. Judson, Clarendon.\n\nThis agency is an extensive one, and the lands now open for sale within its limits (200,000 acres) are chiefly of good quality and at a reasonable distance from the older settlements; price 60 cents per acre.\n\nThe townships of Alleyn and Cawood offer considerable inducements to intending settlers, and are being opened up by Colonization Roads. The soil, varying from clay to loam, is in general good, light loamy soil prevailing. Last year Mr. Judson received 50 applications for land, and 54 lots were allocated, 9 of which were to immigrants of the season having small means. Some purchases of improved farms were also made by Germans, and lots with small clearings (say 6 or 8 acres cleared and fenced) and a shanty, &c., may be bought at from \u00a340 to \u00a350.\n\nFarm laborers can always find employment; good hands accustomed to farm work can get 100 to 120 dollars per annum, besides their board in the old settlements. Immigrants as yet unacquainted with the work can realise very little the\nfirst year or so, perhaps not more than 6 dollars a month and board, wages being of course governed by the laborers qualifications. Young single females can always do well and obtain ready service.\n\nRoute.\u2014By rail to Ottawa City, thence by steamer to Portage du Fort (44 miles), thence by land to Clarendon (10 miles). The maximum distance of the lands from established roads is 8 miles, the average distance 4.\n\nPART OF RENFREW AND DISTRICT OF NIPISSING.\n\nCrown Land Agent: Jas. P. Moffat, Pembroke.\n\nThe total number of acres of land open for sale in Mr. Moffat's agency is 210,000, distributed over the Townships of Rolph, Petewana, Alice, Head, Maria, Fraser and McKay. The greater portion of this land, especially that in the Townships of Alice, Petewana and Rolph, is well adapted for settlement; but owing to the want of roads, it is difficult of access.\n\nThe soil in Alice is of a sandy loam and generally level. There are about 300,000 acres of good land fit for settlement. This Township is liberally supplied with springs; these are generally of pure water, but some of them are strongly impregnated with mineral substances, the principal of which are sulphur and iron.\n\nIn various parts of this agency there are extensive tracts of hardwood land, the soil of which, though stony, may be cultivated successfully. Pine is abundant, and is the prevailing timber throughout.\n\nThe settlers are principally Prussians and Germans. There are but few farmers in the District desirous of selling their farms. A few improved farms may, however, be purchased for cash, at 4 to 16 dollars an acre. The Government wild lands are sold at 70 cents, cash, or 1 dollar, payable in five instalments.\n\nMen's wages average from 6 to 8 dollars a month, with board and lodging; women's wages from 2 to 3 dollars.\n\nRoute\u2014By Grand Trunk Railway to Ottawa City, thence by stage and steam to Pembroke\u201495 miles.\n\nCOUNTY OF RENFREW.\n\nAgent: Wm. Harris, Admaston.\n\nEvery thing has been and is still being done in this District to promote and facilitate settlement. The Government are busy opening, maintaining, and superintending roads in surrounding Townships. There are 240,000 acres of land for sale, the greater part of which is of a rough and rocky description, but with here and there small patches of excellent land well adapted for the small cotters and agricultural laborers.\nThe Townships recently surveyed are Griffith and Canonto. The agricultural prospects of Griffith are rather indifferent, though a considerable part may serve for grazing. It is a remarkably well watered tract of land, as the part of the country generally is, having rivers, brooks, lakes, and ponds, interspersed and scattered over the whole face of it. There are several water privileges in the Township.\n\nIn Canonto the land surveyed is in general well adapted for agricultural purposes, producing when cultivated the best quality of wheat, potatoes, oats, and Indian corn, and as a grazing country can scarcely be surpassed, as almost every lot is supplied with spring water and excellent meadow land.\n\nThe lands in the agency are the nearest body of Crown lands for sale to the seat of Government, and are in the heart of the lumber District.\n\nThe settlers are principally of Irish extraction. Improved farms can be purchased in the neighbourhood at from 2 dollars to 20 dollars an acre, according to situation and improvements. No steady demand exists for labor.\n\nRoute\u2014By rail to Ottawa City, 385 miles, fare 3 dollars 50 cents; thence by steamer to Farrel's landing, fare 57 cents; then on by land to Admaston, 13 miles.\n\nNORTH OF THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE.\n\nTHREE RIVERS.\n\nAgent: Alphonse Dubord, Three Rivers.\n\nThis agency comprehends the Crown Lands in the Counties of Maskinong\u00e9 and St. Maurice. For the present there are properly speaking, only two Townships open for settlement\u2014the Township of Shawinigan, in which there remains about 9,226 acres unsold, and the Township of Caxton, which is throughout a thick forest, containing 28,483 acres. In general, the soil is healthy, but the country is very hilly, and from want of roads, difficult of settlement. But few farms could be purchased, and those would fetch prices of from \u00a3160 to \u00a3400. There is little or no demand for immigrant labor.\n\nRoute\u2014Daily by steamer from Quebec, 90 miles; fare 50 cents.\n\nCOUNTY OF JOLIETTE.\n\nAgent: J. Bourgeois, St. Ambroise de Kildare.\n\nThe public lots for sale in the Kildare District are easy of access, the land is pretty mountainous in places, but the quality of the soil is good and productive.\nThe settlers are principally of Irish extraction; there is very little demand for labor. No improved farms to be sold. Quantity of land 42,000 acres. Price 1s. 3d. sterling per acre.\n\nROUTE\u2014From Montreal by steamer to Industry Village, 42 miles; thence by land, 9 miles to Kildare.\n\nCOUNTY OF BERTHIER.\n\nAgent: J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Laporte, St. Gabriel de Brandon.\n\nThree-fourths of the land in this District is adapted for settlement. It is rocky and mountainous in places, but there are still 29,000 acres of excellent land for sale. A good road runs from Berthier to Brandon and to the centre of the Township, and several improved farms can be got at an average price of \u00a32 to \u00a32 4s. an acre. The settlers are French Canadians, and there is no demand at present for immigrant labor.\n\nROUTE\u2014By steamer from Montreal to Industry Village, 42 miles, thence 24 miles by land.\n\nCHICOUTIMI.\n\nAgent: Vincent Martin, Chicoutimi.\n\nThe Townships in this agency are Bagot, Chicoutimi, Laterri\u00e8re, Jonqui\u00e8re, Mesy, Tremblay, Caron, Charlevoix, Metabetchouan, Kenogami, Lebarre, Signay, Simard, Harvey, St. John's, Ashnapmonchouan, Roberval and Demeules, of which there are 300,000 acres disposable, at 20 cents an acre. The valley extending from Grand Bay to Lake St. John has much deep, rich, alluvial soil, alternating with sand, but the hills, or rather mountains, are not arable.\n\nROUTE\u2014By steamer to Grand Bay.\n\nCROWN LAND AGENCIES,\n\nLOWER CANADA,\n\nSOUTH OF THE RIVER ST. LAWRENCE.\n\nEASTERN TOWNSHIPS.\n\nThe Eastern Townships form a large tract of country lying to the southward of Quebec and eastward of Montreal, and comprise within their limits six million acres of land.

Agents will be pleased to send pamphlets containing full information on all classes of land, including improved farms. Address Agents' Office, Montreal.\nacres of land, with a population of 200,000 souls. No part of Canada offers greater advantages or facilities to the agriculturist than these Districts. They are in every respect a most desirable field for settlement; salubrity of climate\u2014fertility of soil\u2014good roads, and proximity to the Montreal, Quebec, Portland, and Boston markets being amongst their chief attractions; and all persons having the command of capital who come out to this country with the intention of purchasing farms cannot do better than visit the townships before they make their final choice. They are within easy access by rail of Quebec, and can be reached at a very trifling sacrifice of time and money. The British American Land Company possess large tracts of cleared and uncleared lands for sale in this District; their Office is at Sherbrooke, the District town. Messrs. Rawson and Du Chair, Real Estate Agents at Elmwood, near Lennoxville, have recently published a very useful pamphlet upon the inducements the Eastern Townships hold out to Emigrants of all classes, containing, amongst other valuable matter, a catalogue of farms and improved lands for sale there, with prices and terms of purchase. Copies of these pamphlets can be obtained upon direct application to themselves, or at the Government Emigration Office, Quebec.\n\nSHERBROOKE.\n\nAgent: JOHN FELTON, Sherbrooke.\n\nIn this agency there are about 70,000 acres for sale, at 60 cents per acre, in the Townships of Auckland, Hereford, and Weedon.

There are about 240,000 acres for sale, generally hilly and stony, but with good soil.\n\nThe settlers located are mostly of Scotch descent. In Whitton, Marston, and Winslow, about one-fourth are French Canadians. There is no great demand for farm laborers in the new settlements, but in the older settlements the emigrant can get from 2s. to 4s. a day, or from about \u00a315 to \u00a325 a year, if he understands farming. Blacksmiths, house joiners, carpenters, masons, tailors, and shoemakers, also, good school teachers, would find employment in the neighbourhood. Price\nof land per acre, 60 cents, or 2s. 5d. sterling. 25 lots were sold, and 22 free grants allotted by the agent last season.\n\nRoute\u2014Grand Trunk Railroad to Lennoxville, E.T., 128 miles; fare 2 dollars 25 cents; thence by stage 25 miles, fare 1 dollar.\n\nPARTS OF WOLF AND COMPTON.\n\nAgent: J.

Several farms can be bought at from \u00a38 to \u00a320 sterling an acre, depending on the value of the buildings erected on them. The settlers are chiefly French Canadians, and there is no demand for foreign labor, except the temporary demand created occasion-\nsionally by the Three Rivers and Arthabaska Railroad.

Those possessing small capitals may rent or purchase farms with some little improvements on reasonable terms.\n\nClerks, shopmen, or persons having no particular trade or calling and unaccustomed to manual labor should on no account be persuaded to emigrate, for to this class the country offers no encouragement at present.\n\nTIME TO EMIGRATE AND BEST MODE OF REACHING CANADA.\n\nIt is of the greatest importance to the Emigrant that he should arrive in the country at as early a period of the year as possible. Those who sail in the months of April and May may expect to arrive in time for the spring and summer work; and to obtain the higher rate of wages, which are usually given by the farmer during harvest time. They will thus be enabled to secure a home against the coming winter. If, on the other hand, they land at a season when nearly all outdoor work has ceased, they may be exposed to much hardship.\n\nIf the means of the Emigrant will permit it, steamers should be preferred to sailing vessels. First class steamers leave Liverpool, Londonderry, and Glasgow weekly, from April to November, direct for Quebec.\n\nEmigrants having no fixed destination should on no account take their tickets beyond Quebec.\n\nIf any serious cause of complaint arise during the passage the Emigrant should go at once to the Captain of the vessel and make known his grievance. This will ensure him immediate redress; or, if not, it will strengthen his cause very much should he find it necessary to take legal proceedings on his arrival. The law holds the master of the vessel responsible for any neglect on the part of the stewards, or any of the officers or crew.\n\nLUGGAGE.\u2014Should be in compact, handy packages, distinctly marked with the owner's name and destination. The enormous quantities of useless luggage brought out by emigrants entail heavy expenses and trouble, and in many cases the cost of cartage, porterage, and extra freight exceeds its value.\n\nCLOTHING.\u2014Woollen clothing and all descriptions of wearing apparel flannels, blankets, &c., are much cheaper in England than in Canada, and wherever\nit is practicable, the emigrant should lay in a good stock of clothing before leaving home.\n\nTOOLS.\u2014Agricultural laborers need not bring out implements of husbandry, as these can be easily procured in the country. Artisans are recommended to take such tools as they may possess. But both classes must bear in mind, that there is no difficulty in procuring any ordinary tools in the principal towns on advantageous terms, and that it is more desirable to have the means of purchasing what they want after reaching their destination, than to be encumbered with a large quantity of luggage during the journey into the interior.\n\nCLIMATE.\n\nThe most erroneous opinions have prevailed abroad respecting the climate of Canada. The so called rigour of Canadian winters is often advanced as a serious objection to the country by many who have not the courage to encounter them, who prefer sleet and fog to brilliant skies and bracing cold, and who have yet to learn the value and extent of the blessings conferred upon Canada by her world-renowned \"snows.\"\n\nFrom observations taken for one year, it appeared that the mean range of the thermometer was as follows:\n\n| In Eastern (Lower) Canada | In Western (Upper) Canada |\n|---------------------------|--------------------------|\n| For June, July, and August | 77.57                    |\n| For the winter months     | 11.25                    |\n|                           | 22.49                    |\n\nIn regard to weather, a year's observations showed 309 fine days, and 56 of rain or snow in Eastern Canada, and 276 fine days, with 89 of rain or snow in Western Canada.\n\nCANADA EAST.\n\n\"The climate of Canada East, like that of the Lower Provinces, is unquestionably the most healthy in North America.\n\n\"Disease is unknown among the usual population, except that caused by inequality of diet or imprudent exposure to atmospheric changes. The extreme dryness of the air is shown by the roofs of the houses (which are covered with tin) remaining so long bright, and by a charge of powder remaining for weeks unsoaked in a gun.\"\n\"It is supposed that the long winter is unfavourable to agricultural operations; and though the period during which ploughing may be carried on is shorter than in more favorable climates, yet there are many compensating advantages in the excellence of the snow roads, and the great facilities afforded thereby in conveying produce to market, in drawing manure, and hauling out wood from the forest.\n\n\"If the real excellence of a climate depends upon the earth yielding in perfection and abundance the necessaries of life, or those which constitute the principal articles of food for man and the domestic animals, then Canada East may compare favorably with any part of the world. The steadiness and uniformity of the summer heat causes all grains and fruits to mature well and with certainty.\"\n\nIn Lower Canada melons ripen freely in the open air, and apples attain a peculiar degree of excellence, those of the Island of Montreal being especially famed. The Island of Orleans below Quebec, is equally celebrated for its plums.\n\nCANADA WEST.\n\n\"In a country of such vast extent as Upper Canada, the climate varies materially. Throughout the agricultural, or settled part of it along the St. Lawrence and the Lakes, and which extends from 50 to 100 miles in depth, the winter may be said to commence early in December. Snow usually falls in sufficient quantities in the eastern section of this range to afford good sleighing about the middle of that month, and to continue with trifling exceptions until the middle of March. In the western section, although we have occasionally heavy falls of snow, we are subject to frequent thaws, and sleighing cannot be depended upon except in the interior at a distance from the lakes. On the cleared lands the snow generally disappears about the middle of March, and the sowing of seed for the spring crops begins early in April, and ends about the 10th of May. Ripe wild Strawberries in abundance may be had by the last of June.\"\n\nFrom the head of Lake Ontario, round by the Niagara frontier, and all along the Canadian shores of Lake Erie, the grape and peach, grow with luxuriance, and ripen to perfection in the open air, without artificial aid.\n\nTABLE of Mean Monthly and Annual Temperature at Toronto, Canada West, from 1840 to 1859, taken from the Records of the Provincial Magnetic Observatory, by Professor Kingston:\n\n| MONTHS | Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | April | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Mean Annual |\n|--------|------|------|------|-------|-----|------|------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------------|\n| 1840   |      |      |      |       |     |      |      |      |       |      |      |      |             |\n|        | 23.72| 22.83| 30.07| 41.00 | 51.38| 61.27| 67.03| 60.12| 57.98 | 45.27| 36.65| 25.97| 44.11       |\n| 1859   |      |      |      |       |     |      |      |      |       |      |      |      |             |\nDr. Lillie, in his Essay on Canada, remarks, that \"Professor Hind holds the climate of Canada West to be superior to those portions of the United States lying north of the 41st parallel of latitude, in mildness\u2014in adaptation to the growth of cereals\u2014in the uniformity of the distribution of rain over the agricultural months\u2014in the humidity of the atmosphere\u2014in comparative indemnity from spring frosts and summer draughts\u2014in a very favorable distribution of clear and cloudy days for the purpose of agriculture\u2014and in the distribution of rain over many days\u2014as, also, in its salubrity. In the following points he regards it as differing favorably from that of Great Britain and Ireland, viz., in high summer means of temperature\u2014in its comparative dryness\u2014and in the serenity of the sky.\"\n\nOver the whole of Canada the melon and tomato acquire large dimensions, and ripen fully in the open air, the seeds being planted in the soil towards the latter end of April, and the fruit gathered in September. Pumpkins and squashes attain gigantic dimensions; they have exceeded 300 pounds in weight in the neighbourhood of Toronto. Indian corn, hops, and tobacco, are common crops and yield fair returns. Hemp and flax are indigenous plants, and can be cultivated to any extent in many parts of the Province. With a proper expenditure of capital England could be made quite independent of Russia, or any other country, for her supply of these valuable products.\n## ABSTRACT FROM THE CENSUS OF 1861.\n\n| ORIGIN                        | Upper Canada | Lower Canada | TOTAL     |\n|------------------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------|\n| Natives not of French Origin | 869,592      | 167,578      | 1,037,170 |\n| Of French Origin             | 33,287       | 847,320      | 880,607   |\n| **EMIGRANTS**                |              |              |           |\n| England and Wales            | 114,290      | 13,139       | 127,429   |\n| Scotch                       | 98,792       | 13,160       | 111,952   |\n| Irish                        | 191,231      | 50,192       | 241,423   |\n| United States                | 50,758       | 13,611       | 64,369    |\n| B.
