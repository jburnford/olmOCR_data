It may certainly seem to us in the Territories that it is a matter of some importance at this juncture, and in the interests of its inhabitants Manitoba cannot secure what is so much to be desired with regard to this, it is useless for us to interfere, and that we had better devote ourselves to getting such returns as may accrue to us more immediately within our reach. It should none the less be remembered that the mightiest rivers are formed and fed by little rills, and however remote the advantages possessed by each may seem to him or herself should be used. A large proportion of the inhabitants of these Territories consists of people who have been and still are engaged in eastern provinces, with whom they correspond, and who must take a lively interest in their welfare, and there can be no doubt but that the opportunity offered by the advantages of the Hudson's Bay route among the people of the eastern provinces generally might be materially enhanced by a judicious use of private correspondence. That there exists a strong necessity for the establishment of public opinion in this end in this regard is unfortunately only too evident, although it is not so easy to see how this end may be accomplished.\n\nIn the present state of matters, it behooves the whole Dominion to secure the prosperity of the Territories, for undoubtedly the people in the eastern provinces have got the idea very firmly fixed in their minds that so long as the Hudson's Bay route remains open, the advantage of the route will be enjoyed by the eastern provinces, and that the people of the Territories will be left behind.\n\nToronto merchants say the published crop reports of the North-West are either misleading or their customers in that section are not truthful, if the harvest was so good then there would be reason why money should not be more plentiful and old accounts wiped out. It might surely occur to them that an abundant harvest does not necessarily mean an over-supply of cash. It is said that the farmers are in want of proper facilities for sending it to market\u2014the profits go in cost of transportation\u2014therefore it is not fair to blame the farmers for not making the most of their crops. The Hudson Bay route opened and they will soon handle a good deal more of our cash.\n\nMr. Clark's Vegetable Sugar\u2014Casted and Billets Livery.

The authorities are vigilantly guarding against the possibility of further attacks, as well as striving to find out the author of Saturday's work. The letters recently received, disclosing the dynamiters' plans, tended to incite them to greater efforts.\n\nWestminster Hall and the Tower were closed today to everyone except those officially interested in inspecting the buildings. The approaches to all public buildings are rigidly guarded, and nobody is allowed to enter without submitting to the closest scrutiny. The Tower and Parliament houses were surrounded by sentries. Immense crowds of people visit the vicinity of the ruins daily. Visitors are forbidden admission to Windsor Castle.\n\nTHE DYNAMITER SUSPECT.\n\nInterest was greatly centred today in the prisoner Cunningham, who was arrested at the Tower on the day of the explosion. The prisoner was conveyed to Bow Street Station by a strong guard of police, suspected of complicity in the explosion at the Tower of London. He is 16 years of age, of medium height, dark hair and eyes, short stature, and sinister expression. He willingly answered the questions put to him, which he answered within sight to a glimpse of the alleged dynamiter. The prisoner gave his full name as James Gilbert Cunningham, and asserted that he was an Englishman.\n\nInspector Hubberley deposed that he examined the prisoner at the tower; that he (the prisoner) was confined and gave contradictory answers to his questions. The prisoner, the inspector said, had given a wrong address as the place of his abode, and then stated he lived in Scarborough street, Whitechapel, worked on the docks at Liverpool until the beginning of last year, when he came to London to try to better himself. He formerly resided in America. The inspector further stated that the prisoner was known at his lodgings as Dalton. His luggage had been searched, but the contents had not been made known to the public.\n\nThe examination of Cunningham tended to convince the police that they had secured a person who had a guilty knowledge of Saturday's crime. It was stated that Cunningham was a native of Cork, that he lived for five years in the United States, arriving in England during last autumn. He was described as an Irishman who was well carried out, until the close examination in court, when he forgot himself and threw off his slow, stammering manner. Cunningham is the only suspect now in jail.\n\nTHE INFERNAL MACHINES.\n\nIt is known that the infernal machines used to cause the disaster were fired by sulphuric acid, which worked through the fuse and exploded the cap beneath. The police occupy twenty minutes time to allow the conspirators to escape before the explosion took place.\n\nCUNNINGHAM'S REVELATIONS.\n\nIt is reported that Cunningham has made important revelations, in consequence of which all trains leaving London for the western towns are accompanied by detectives.\n\nDAVITT'S OPINIONS.\n\nMichael Davitt interviewed today about the London outrage, said the dynamite operations had spread throughout Ireland, and fewer in America than was generally supposed. He said he believed the recent outrages in Ross were not actuated by nationalistic or blood-thirsty motives. He said he thought the dynamiters would be more dangerous in the near future. In conclusion, he said the best way to combat the dynamiters was by showing them that the manipulating of Irish grievances in Britain would be futile. He said that the Irish should continue to use King's only expression of goodwill to wards Ireland.\n\nEMMANUEL COLLEGE\n\nPRINCIPAL:\n\nThe Rev. W. R.
