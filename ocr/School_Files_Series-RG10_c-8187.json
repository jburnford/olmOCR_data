The Department is desirous of assisting the Council in their deliberations as far as possible; but, as there would be considerable inconvenience to the school activity if permission were granted for the use of the school building, I hesitate to accede to the request. Even if the council meetings were held on Saturday afternoon, I am satisfied there would be considerable difficulty in arranging for a thorough cleaning. Further, the school desks, on account of their size, are not entirely suitable for seating the Council. You might let me know why the arrangement in the past is not satisfactory, i.e., the holding of the meetings at the residence of either Jake Day or Angus P. White.\n\nYou may explain to the Council that the Department wishes to assist them as far as possible and that we would like to see a suitable council hall erected. In the case of other Indian bands where councils assist in the conduct of reserve affairs, the Indians have willingly recommended the use of their capital funds for the erection of a council hall, to be used for regular meetings and other community purposes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

St. Regis Island School should be painted, exterior, also the shed at this school, which was newly built in 1929, should be painted.\n\nThese outside jobs could be done by Indians of the reserve. Work is very scarce for Indians of St. Regis reserve, and by giving some painting jobs, would help out some families who are in rather close circumstances.\nOttawa, May 13, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to redecorating and repairing the Chetlain, St. Regis Village and St. Regis Island Indian Day Schools.\n\nIn reply I have to say that our appropriation for the current fiscal year has been considerably reduced, and it is necessary to limit our expenditures to the work absolutely essential.

His idea is to put a little block about two inches by one inch and an inch thick under each desk foot to facilitate sweeping and moving the seats when needed for gymnastics.

Please let me have an estimate of the cost.\n\nThe Inspector also states that the outside toilets are not kept sufficiently clean. You should arrange to have the toilets cleaned before the school reopens on the first of September, and you should arrange to have them kept clean during the academic year.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nD.

The paint has peeled off in patches and gives a very bad appearance.\n\nThere will be required two gallons of mixed paint to complete this job. John Day, who I understand is a fairly good painter states he will clean the ceiling and apply the two coats for ten dollars. Dpt to supply brushes.\n\nI would also require permission to have the porches at both entrances of the school repaired. There is new planking required for the steps also for the floors; there are several posts in the railings missing which will require replacing. I think $15.00 would be the maximum cost, but would have this work done as reasonable as possible.\n\nThere are also glass to be replaced in the storm windows, so as to be ready for the fall, and entrance doors.\n\nI would recommend the above work be carried out, the work to be done during the summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 26th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 20th instant, you may arrange for the painting of the ceiling of the senior classroom at the St. Regis Village Indian Day School and the repairing of the porches at both entrances of the school. You may, also, purchase the new planking required for the steps. The cost should be kept within the estimate mentioned in your letter.\n\nAny window panes that are broken may also be replaced.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nD. P.

I am now able to advise that $30.00 will cover the cost of material required for the sills, flooring, steps and railings of the porches, including also repairs to the boys and girls toilets from which boards of the seats and walls have disappeared.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nD.P.

He is making a good job of it and it has made a great improvement, but it shows up the walls, which are very dirty due to the smoke, etc., from the stove. The walls should be washed and painted.\n\nI have considered the possibility of having these walls washed and painted; also the ceiling and walls of the junior class room and entrances washed and painted. It would require approximately 5\u00bd gals. of paint at the cost of $25.00. The cost of washing and applying one coat of paint $35.00. The work now being done in the senior room is $19.50. This includes paint at $9.50 and labour $10.00. This work does not include the cloak rooms as they are in fair shape.\n\nI have considered it advisable to allow Day to go ahead and wash the walls of the senior room.

They will supply a cupboard as per-\n\n4 feet 8 inches high, 3 feet wide, 12 inches deep, with a fir V joint back, 7/8 inch panel doors, 2 pair ornamental hinges, and two turns, constructed of pine or fir, each $13.50; three for $39.00 or 6 for $75.00.\n\nSchools requiring cupboards are, Senior and Junior room St.Regis Village, Chenail and St.Regis Island.\n\nI might mention that the above price is $2.00 under the cost of a book cupboard placed in the Cornwall Island east Day school.\n\nPlease advise as to whether or not I have permission to purchase the above and oblige,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, September 19, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 14th instant, the Department regrets that, owing to lack of funds, we are not prepared to authorize the purchase of the cupboards which you state are required at the St. Regis Village, Chenail and St. Regis Island Indian Day Schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

McNaughton, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Regis, Que.\nSt. Regis, Quebec,\nSeptember 28th, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nI have been requested by the village teachers regarding prospects for a garage for their automobiles. I have secured an estimate of the material required for a two car garage as follows: size 18 x 18, walls, one ply clapboards, T & G roof covered with felt roofing material, two pairs of doors, with windows, sills to be set on stones, interior levelled up with gravel, at a cost of $140.00 (approximately) including tax.\n\nI can secure ground for this garage from Peter P. White (and his mother) twenty five feet by fifty ft. same depth as the lot on which Teachers residence stands, which adjoins to the south.\n\nThis garage could be placed within the school grounds but as the land is low lying, and would be boggy during fall and spring, it would cost more to place the land in shape than to buy the land from White, whose land is high, and drains off quickly.\n\nIncluding labour and some additional fencing expenses in connection with the proposed garage would amount to around $250.00.\n\nMay I have the Department's opinion regarding the above.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, October 1, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo, with reference to the request of the teachers at the St. Regis Village School for the erection of a garage at an approximate cost of $250.00.\n\nIt has not been the practice of the Department to erect garages for the use of teachers of Indian day schools and, in addition, owing to lack of funds, the Department is not in a position to favourably consider the expenditure mentioned.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

I am advised that most of the lunches consist of plain, home made bread, in the form of sandwiches, using sometimes fruit and fat, but short on either meat or fats.\n\nIt has been found that a supply of fresh milk cannot be depended upon, as it will be some time in the New Year before the cattle begin to freshen. I have secured prices of soups, by the case, from Chevrier Bros., wholesale grocers, of Cornwall Ont., and as most of the Teachers consider soup the most satisfactory and convenient meal to serve, also most filling for the children, I am estimating the costs on the basis of serving soups, but which could, if desirable changed to serving milk & cocoa, when a supply is available.\n\nThe following are the prices quoted by above Firm:\n\n| Item          | Case Price |\n|---------------|------------|\n| Habitant Pea Soup, 24 tins 2\u00bd\" per case | $2.00      |\n| \" Veg \"       | 2\u00bd\"        | 2.50      |\n| \" Tom. \"      | 2\u00bc\"        | 2.50      |\n| Aylmer Tomato & Veg, 48. 1\" | 3.40 |\n\nThis would be an average cost, for an assorted supply of $2.60 per case.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 5, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department has carefully considered the contents of your letter of the 26th ultimo, with reference to serving meals to the children attending the schools in the St. Regis Agency.\n\nYou are aware of the relief at present being given and other assistance is also contemplated. In addition, our funds are quite limited. Under these circumstances, the Department is not prepared at the present time to authorize the expenditure that would be necessary to serve midday meals at the St. Regis Village, St. Regis Island and Cornwall Island West Indian Day Schools.\n\nYou may, however, arrange for supplying soup for the month of January only at the Chenail, Chetlain and Cornwall Island East Indian Day Schools. At the end of this month, you should obtain a report from each of the teachers of these three schools stating whether or not they found the serving of soup beneficial to the children, and if, as a result, the attendance during the month was more regular than usual.\n\nWhen this report is received, it will be decided whether or not the serving of soup can be continued for the months of February and March.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

It is a good idea to supply different kinds\u2014vegetable, pea & tomato.\n\nIt is more of a success than milk and cocoa were at the West End School when supplied there.\n\nYours truly,\nColin Chisholm,\nCornwall Island East S.\nSt.Regis, Quebec,\nFebruary 3rd, 1937.\n\nSir:\n\nFurther with reference to the serving of meals to the children attending the schools on the Reserve.\n\nA quantity of soup, three kinds, was placed in the Cornwall Island est., Chenail and Chetlain schools.\n\nAccording to verbal and notations on the attendance reports received from the Teachers, the additional food has proved beneficial to the children and has improved the average attendance during the winter month, although on account of the Influenza epidemic the month has not been a fair test. The Teachers state this extra food has really been required as the lunches carried by the children are not sufficient enough to provide proper nourishment.\n\nThe Chenail and Chetlain schools use 3 tins daily, Cornwall Island east using 5 tins. There will be soup on hand for a few days during February.\n\nMay I suggest that the serving of soups be continued during February and March inclusive of Cornwall Island west, school as I am informed by Miss Peters that the lunches of most of the children are not very abundant, principally bread and fat.\n\nI would judge that conditions on St. Regis Island is somewhat better, considering that there are only a few families from there on relief.\n\nI enclose a letter received from Mr. Colin Chisholm teacher of Cornwall Island, est., school.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa,\nCanada.\nOttawa, February 8th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn view of the contents of your letter of the 3rd instant, the Department approves your supplying soup for the months of February and March to the children attending the Chenail, Chetlain, Cornwall Island East and Cornwall Island West Indian Day Schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

The same applies to the St. Regis Island, Chenail and Cornwall Island, west, Indian Day schools.\n\nI have been quoted prices (Snetzinger's Hardware, Cornwall Ontario) on a Furnacette heater, of cast iron construction, encased in polished steel, the cold air is drawn off the floor to circulate through the room. Fire box 12\u00bd\" diameter, coal or wood, Height to top 41\u00bd\", floor space 18\" x 18\", price $35.00 each. A good appearing stove, which should be a better heater than the ones at present in use and more economical on coal.\n\nAlthough the stove in the Chetlain school is not in as bad a shape as the others, it is a Quebec heater style and could be replaced to advantage.\n\nI would recommend this matter be given favorable consideration. The schools would be all set, in this regard, for a number of years.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letters of the 11th and 25th ultimo in connection with the schools in the St. Regis Agency.\n\nIn view of your recommendation, you may purchase new stoves for the two classrooms in the St. Regis Village School, also for the St. Regis Island, Chenail and Cornwall Island, West, Indian Day Schools. It is noted that the cost of each of these stoves will be $35.00.\n\nOur funds are quite limited and, in view of the expenditure that will be incurred for the stoves, I regret that it will not be possible to authorize purchase of the desks for the Junior room at the St. Regis Village School this year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

However, there should not be any increase as prices quoted are those supplied for No. 2 desks, while the present order calls for No. 4 and No. 5 desks.\n\nAs you are no doubt aware there has been a considerable increase in the number of pupils attending the various schools. Ten additional seats will be required to take care of the Junior room requirements at the Village School. Eight additional desks are required at the Chenail School and about five at the St. Regis Island School.\n\nIt is our intention to place all the new desks in the Village school and transfer any seats that might be of further use to the other schools. In this way we can take care of the present additional pupils as well as the increased attendance which will take place at the opening of the new term and those pupils moving up to higher grades.\n\nThe fact that very few of our Indians have moved off the Reserve during the past few years has been a big factor in the increased attendance at the various schools. It is sincerely hoped that this requisition for desks will receive your kind consideration. I can assure you they are an absolute necessity.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant enclosing requisition for 46 desks for the St. Regis Village Indian Day School.\n\nI realize that the new desks would be preferable but at the same time the funds at our disposal will not permit ordering such a large number at the present time. I am prepared to consider favourably the purchase of the 23 desks which you state are required for the new pupils. It is noted that 10 of these are needed at the Village School, 8 at the Chenaill School, and 5 at the St. Regis Island School. Please let me know the size required at each school and the number of each size.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. D.F.

Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Can.\nOttawa, July 30, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the last instant, an amount of $300.00 was provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at the day schools in your agency.\n\nYou might let me know at which schools and in what manner you consider this amount should be spent to the best advantage. In the event of your requiring any materials, full details should be given, so that purchase may be made through our Purchasing Branch.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. T. L. Bonnah,\nClerk in charge,\nIndian Agency,\nSt. Regis, Que.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to refer to yours of July 30th., concerning appropriation for repairs and improvements at the days schools in this Agency.\n\nWith such a limited amount as stated in your letter I am doubtful as to the advisability of going ahead with any repairs. However I have enclosed a requisition covering materials required in order to shingle the village school. The labour of course is only an estimate, which may or may not be reduced by putting the job up for bid on a contract basis. On this latter point I recollect from conversation with Mr. McNaughton last year, working on a contract basis is not practiced by the Branch with Indian labour. It is offered only as a possible solution to decreasing labour costs. Consideration must be given however to obtaining labour that will do the work properly. We are not blessed with an abundance of such labour at this time.\n\nYou will note that the latter part of the requisition deals with scaffolding materials which are required if the job is to be done with consideration to the workmen. These materials should be kept here after the job for like purposes.\n\nI would ask that you give this matter serious consideration as there is no question about the necessity of having this work done. There is an equally important job to be done at the Cornwall Ild. West school where the plaster has been falling off the walls in both cloak rooms for some time but as this is interior work it could be held over until next spring when new monies are voted.\n\nPhilip Phelan, Esq.,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch, OTTAWA.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nClark in charge\nOttawa,\nAugust 16, 1941.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: St. Regis Village Indian Day School,\nSt. Regis Indian Agency, Quebec,\nElectoral District of Chateauguay-\nHuntingdon.\n\nIt is necessary to shingle the roof of\nthe St. Regis Village Indian Day School.

The desks in question can be supplied by the Rev. rather Jacobs, local missionary at a price of $1.25 f.o.b. St. Regis, Que. per desk. In this connection it would be well to contact Inspector Thibault who is in a position to give you more detailed information.\n\nI might say that the desks have been examined and although they are not new they are in good condition and are all single desks. The price asked is most reasonable.\n\nAt the present time we are in a position where we have not seating accommodation for our children and many have had to be sent home for this reason. This being due to more children coming of school age as well as other families returning to the reserve.\n\nIf we could be permitted to take advantage of this offer and buy 63 desks we would be in a position to fill our needs at the Village School as well as Cornwall Island and it would give us a chance to clean the Chetlain School out of double desks and put in all singles. In turn, we could use the desks from the Chetlain to fill our needs at the Chenail and St. Regis Island Schools where additions as well as replacements are needed. Apart from the initial cost of the desks a sum of approximately $35.00 would be required to cover transportation of the desks to the various schools as well as labour in setting them up.\n\nI would recommend the above for your kind and early consideration as it may be sometime again before we could get a buy of this nature. You will recall that although new, the last seats purchased cost us $8.40 each.\n\nPhilip Phelan, Esq.,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Affairs.

The employment of Mr. Robert Riddell is out of the question due to difficulties this firm has recently experienced in help being called for military duties and the like.\n\nAs the price quoted by Mr. Julien seems reasonable enough at this time, and no other help is available, would you kindly forward authorization to have the work undertaken without delay by this firm.\n\nEncl.\n\nD.P.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nPhilip Phelan, Esq., B.A., Chief, Training Division.\n\nI have to refer to your letter of July 31, regarding the Sisters of Ste. Anne taking charge of the St. Regis Village Day School. In this connection may I advise you that the Reverend Father Jacobs informs me that he has received notice of acceptance from the Mother General of the above order. It also appears that the Sisters who will take charge of the Village School will arrive in advance of the opening date of the school.\n\nIt would seem advisable, without delay, to consider cleaning of the interior of the residence to the extent at least of having the building in a state of cleanliness when the Sisters arrive. As the walls, with the exceptions of the kitchen and bathroom which are painted, are all kalsomined it would not be advisable at this time to consider decorating as the colour scheme we might choose would perhaps not be acceptable. I would, however, recommend that authorization be granted to hire some women to wash the kitchen and bath walls, woodwork and floors and give the place a general dusting down to remove cobwebs and the like. Consideration will also have to be given to repairs to the roof and around the windows where rain is continually seeping in and destroying the interior of the building. Some broken windows will need repairing as well.\n\nI would suggest that, if you wish the above work be carried out, you wire me C.N.R. Cornwall as Mr. McNaughton is at present on vacation, our time is limited, the mail service poor and I have much pressing work in the field and may not be in the office should you decide to telephone.\n\nfor D.F.

A satisfactory job.\n\nThe buildings look a very much improved appearance and should preserve the buildings for several years.\n\nIn this connection I have to advise that additional paint, in excess of the estimated amount, was required to properly complete the painting. As Mr. Julie was travelling to and fro from Cornwall I had him supply the extra paint required for which you will find enclosed voucher no. 194, in the amount of $21.20 in payment thereof.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON ST.

Bonnah, Indian Agent, St. Regis, Que.\n\nWith reference to previous correspondence regarding the plan to be followed to secure water for the teachers' residence at St. Regis, I understand that Mr. Doucet discussed this with you on the occasion of his recent visit. Under these circumstances I trust that the attached sketch will make the plan clear. Mr. Doucet has drawn the diagram and also given a list of the materials required. You will note that 181' of piping will be needed. It will be necessary to have at least 2 pieces 10' long, 1 piece 5' long, 2 pieces 1' long and 1 piece 6' long. The remaining quantity of piping, to bring the total to 181', may be in any length that it is possible to secure.\n\nThe major portion of the work will be digging the trench from the well to the side of the residence. This pipe line should be connected to the existing pump, as it is not possible at the present time to obtain a gasoline engine of any kind.\n\nIt is felt that the total expenditure for material and labour should not exceed $150.\n\nIf there is any other information you require please let me know.\n\nR.A.

REGIS VILLAGE SCHOOL\n\nThis school is situated in the lowest part of the village and below river level. The junior classroom has sufficient space, but the senior class is altogether too small. No basement is possible on this location. Inside decorating is badly needed and plaster work requires repairs.\nOttawa, June 28, 1945.\n\nMr. T. L. Bonnah, Indian Agent,\nSt. Regis, Que.\n\nInspector Thibault has submitted a report regarding the St. Regis Village School.\n\nAs stated in my other letter of today's date, it is not possible to erect a new building this year. However, the inside of the school might be redecorated to make it more cheerful for the children. Please obtain a quotation on this work. I may say that we have available, in our current year's appropriation, $600.00 for repairs and improvements to the day schools in the St. Regis Agency, and I will be glad to have you give consideration to the best manner in which this amount can be expended.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to your letter of May 11th, I might say that we have a variety of repairs that could be undertaken at our schools and teachers' residences. I feel, however, that in spending such a small amount of money that is allotted for such a purpose this year many things will have to be considered. If a post war construction program is contemplated in this regard then the only thing we can do is try and hold the older buildings together by undertaking only extremely urgent repairs and spend the larger amount on the buildings you definitely know will be of use in future years.\n\nDue to the nature of repairs in some instances it is virtually impossible to requisition the needed materials and in some cases it is not possible at this writing to even obtain certain materials.\n\nWe are up against a big job at the teachers' residence in the village as here we have plastered walls and the series of smaller tremors following last September's jolt has left the walls in a bad state. After interviewing a reputable contractor in Cornwall I am of the opinion there is little to be gained by going to the heavy expense of a replaster job in this building, as in most cases all plaster has to be removed. He suggested that I use V-lap (which is a sort of beaver board) and put this over the present plaster. At some future date should the V-lap become soiled it could be sized and painted. In this way we would eliminate the mess of a plaster job. I have seen some of this work done and it makes a good finish for a wall. The cost of this material is $77.00 per M.\n\nAs the sun room in the residence is in bad shape I thought, if agreeable to you, I would finish this room with V-lap and if it is satisfactory to all concerned we could consider at some future date finishing other rooms in a similar way.\n\np.t.o.\nAs it is impossible, with the limited funds available, to undertake extensive repairs at any one place I would offer the suggestion that an amount of $200.00 be advanced for labour costs and that permission be granted to obtain materials for extremely urgent repairs at the various schools and residences. It is understood, of course, that every possible precaution will be taken to keep the entire expenditure within the $500.00 mark.\n\nYour early reply would be appreciated.\n\nT. L. Connah\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, June 27, 1945.\n\nMr. T. L. Bonnah, Indian Agent,\nSt. Regis, Que.\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, with reference to repairs to the schools in the St. Regis Agency. I wrote you in connection with this matter on June 23, and, on reviewing our file, I find that a typographical mistake was made in my letter of May 11. This should have read $600.00 instead of $500.00.\n\nUnder separate cover you are being forwarded an accountable advance of $200.00 for labour for repairs. I note your statement regarding the purchase of materials, and, as you know, purchases from any one firm must not exceed $50.00.\n\nThe Department agrees with your suggestion, to finish the sun-room of the teacher's residence with V-lap, with a view to ascertaining if this makes a satisfactory job. When this is completed you will know its cost and you will then be able to more accurately estimate what expenditure will be required to complete other rooms in the building where the condition of the plaster is unsatisfactory.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n| Qty. | DESCRIPTION       | Amount |\n|------|------------------|--------|\n|      | \"Leap second\"    | $1.50  |\n\nIndian Affairs.

Repairs have been made to the porches of the Cornwall Island West School, the interior of the classroom redecorated, a new toilet was also constructed. Both cloakrooms as well as an entire wall of the school had to be replastered before any decorating could be done. In the Village, the Senior room of the Village school has been redecorated, giving it a much brighter appearance. Plaster work and some decorating have already been done at the Teachers' Residence in the Village.\n\nT.L.

Moreover, the water service is very rudimentary.\n\nWhat the Reverend Sisters desire, is an enlargement of the school with provisions for a social work classroom and the installation of an adequate water service.\n\nThis improvement could very well be done during the summer months and made ready for the September opening.\n\nHoping that you will attend to this matter as soon as possible I remain, dear Mr. Phelan,\n\nyours very truly,\n\nJ.

In view of more urgent requirements on reserves where we have no educational facilities or on which our buildings are extremely dilapidated, it will be some two or three years before we can consider the erection of a new school at St. Regis.\n\nWe have just finished a new two-room school on this reserve to replace two very old buildings.

Of course, this school will be closed down next year and the children will be attending the new two room school at Chenail. It is not our intention to employ Miss Terrance at this new school at Chenail and we have appointed a Miss Comeau from New Brunswick as the Senior teacher. Miss Francis will handle the Junior Room.\n\nI was very frank in discussing conditions in her classroom with Miss Terrance and told her that we would not consider her for the new school at Chenail. I have made the suggestion that she transfer to the Caughnawaga School where she can be kept under constant supervision. I have not as yet heard as to whether this transfer will be acceptable to all concerned.\nI also note your recommendation with regard to our requirements at St. Regis. I doubt if we can include this in our 1949-50 building program but hope to include in our 1950-51 project this item.\n\nIn conclusion may I again express the appreciation of our Department to you for the sincere interest which you take in our schools and for the valuable assistance which you render annually to our teachers.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

Wescott's report on his visit to the schools of the St. Regis Agency. Report dated July 19th; original on file 1-1-6, Quebec.\n\n\"It may be presumed that you are already considering the building of a new school house to replace the present village school. The present building is not adequate for the excellent school program, including the manual arts, which you are trying to implement in your schools.\n\n\"I respectfully suggest that, when you plan a new building for St. Regis Village, you study the possibility of transporting the children of St. Regis Island to and from the future village school. The children of the Island could be transported by boat in the autumn and in the spring, by sleigh in winter. There would be only a few days at the beginning and at the end of winter when one or the other of these means of transportation could not be used.\n\n\"This suggestion, of course, is based on my own opinion. The feasibility of such a project would have to be studied by the local superintendent and others who know the situation at first hand.\n\n\"The cost of transporting the pupils would be offset by many advantages, both educational and financial. The pupils would have all the benefits of the educational activities that you are endeavouring to provide for the Indian children. It would no longer be necessary to provide a teacher and a teacher's living quarters and a school house for an average enrolment of twelve pupils. It may be noted that the present school house on the Island is in need of repair or replacement.\"\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nJuly 15 1948\n\nTo the Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa, (File: 33-6-5)\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF\n\nVOTE 516 ALLOTMENT 12-415 ALLOCATION SYMBOLS\nSHIP TO Mr. T.L.

While we are using the same pump, it being now equipped to operate electrically, the Sisters can look after this themselves in accordance with their requirements.\n\nJ. L. Bernah,\nSuperintendent,\nSt. Regis Agency.\n\nEncl.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nOn the 1st instant I phoned Mr. Phelan regarding the purchase of a stove to heat the Junior Room of the St. Regis Village School. Heating this particular room has presented quite a problem as there is a 14-ft. ceiling and it is a very large room. It had originally been planned, I understand, to heat the two rooms by means of a furnace but on account of the low location it was found that, after digging the cellar for the school, it was full of water with the result that the plan of installing a furnace was abandoned. I checked the temperature in the Junior Room and for several consecutive days it was impossible to get anything above 60 degrees.\n\nI had planned to get one of those Warm Morning heaters to install in this room at a cost of $69.50. There is a draft regulator on them similar to some of the more modern brooder stoves. However, at the same time, the heater at the St. Regis Island School gave out and I put the Warm Morning heater over at St. Regis Island. We put in a large No. 2205 Perfection oil heater in the R.C.M.P. Office a year ago at a cost of $93.33. It has a heating capacity for 9,000 cubic feet. The officer in charge of the detachment here found it too large a capacity heater so I installed this particular unit in the Junior Room of the Village School and placed a smaller oil stove in the R.C.M.P. Office. We are now getting good satisfaction in the Junior Room at the school.\nAs the writer would like to see this particular unit left at the school, I am wondering if it would be possible for an arrangement to be worked out so that, if necessary, the purchase price in the amount of $93.33 could be transferred from Schools to Agency vote. Insofar as fuel oil is concerned, I have arranged with Mr. White, who supplies our Chenail School residence with fuel, to supply us.\n\nI would like to suggest that we install another oil burning unit in the Senior Room at the Village School some time during the coming summer so that we can put it into operation for next fall and, upon hearing from you concerning this matter, information will be supplied in order that a heater of proper capacity can be obtained. Insofar as any coal that we might have left over at the St. Regis Village School, this will not represent any loss as it will simply be transferred next winter to the St. Regis Island School.\n\nT. L. Donahue,\nSuperintendent,\nSt. Regis Agency.\n24th February, 1949.\n\nMr. T.L. Bonnah,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nP.O. Box 987,\nCornwall, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 10th instant, you may forward a Voucher in the amount of $93.33 for the cost of the stove, if this account has not already been paid.\n\nWith regards to the last paragraph of your letter you can forward a requisition after 1st April, 1949, for the type of heater which you consider will give satisfaction in the Senior Room of the St. Regis Village Day School.\n\nBernard F.

Office here. Naturally, the stove was paid for. What the writer desired was that, if such is necessary, Administration be reimbursed from the Educational Vote for the cost of this stove in the amount of $93.33. The reason I requested this is that it might just be possible we will need an additional stove of perhaps smaller capacity to install in the R.C.M.P. Officer's single quarters (should they again send us a single man this year as a second Constable). The unit which we had for heating this quarters was transferred to the R.C.M.P. Office when the large unit from the R.C.M.P. office was transferred to the school.

She has notified them that she will not take boarders any longer.\n\nThere is no other place in the village where they can board, but they told me that there is a house owned by Mrs. Gorrell which could be had. They all get along well together, and if they had a house they could board themselves. The house is partly furnished and they would be quite willing to try living there.\n\nI would suggest that we write to Mr. Agent Taillon and make inquiries about this house of Mrs. Gorrell's.\nOttawa, June 30, 1919.\n\nDear Taillon,\n\nThe St. Regis teachers who have been living with Mrs. Smith inform me that she will not be able to keep them after the summer holidays.\n\nI am told that there is a house belonging to a Mrs. Gorrell, which would suit, if it could be had on reasonable terms. I would like you to find out what the Gorrells would rent the house for. I believe it is partially furnished and I should like to know exactly what furniture they would leave in it and what would be required. I understand they would need four single beds and these can be got at a reasonable rate from the Militia Department.

I understand they would need four single beds and these can be got at a reasonable rate from the Militia Department. You might send me a list of the furniture that you think would be required, with the probable cost of each article.

Some of the teachers have requested that they be allowed to board in Hogansburg, having made arrangements to be taken to and from their schools by car. The Department underwent considerable expense in furnishing the house last year and I have to request that you will be good enough to state what disposition was made of the articles supplied in fitting up the house and you should give an inventory of the same. As we have these on hand it might be well, if possible to do so, to rent another house and the equipment on hand should be sufficient to furnish it.\n\nKindly give this matter your prompt attention and inform the Department as to what you consider the best to be done regarding the matter; also, if a house cannot be secured, would it be possible for the teachers to obtain boarding accommodation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nF. E. Taillon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Regis, Que.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nIn reference to your request of July 28th ultimo, No. 33-6-8, I beg to inform you what the only chattels and movable things that can be secured for the Tucker is that Mr. Peter L. Morrow, the house is in good condition and is furnished, the rental asked is fifteen dollars per month.\n\nThe articles purchased last year are now stored in the village school and consist of the following:\n\n- Wash-stand\n- Dresser\n- Table\n- Rockers\n- Table cloth\n- Linen\n- Travelling\n- Oil clock\n- Pair blankets\n- Sheet\n\nPersonally, and in confidence, I think if a house can be obtained on board, what it is for.\nSir,\n\nI have been unable to locate the teachers inside upon the reserve. I have interviewed Mrs. T. Lam who has the only suitable house, in which teachers could possibly board and where teachers for many years boarded; she has been unable to give me an answer this evening but will do so in a few days, at which time I shall make known to you her decision.\n\nJ.

Gorow and that you are making inquiries in regard to securing a boarding house for the teachers.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will await a report from you in regard to Mrs. T. Sam's decision as to whether she would board the teachers or not before taking any action in this matter. Kindly advise the Department as soon as you receive her decision.\n\nIn regard to the list of articles purchased last year for the teachers' residence and which you state are now stored in the Village School, I beg to say that it is noted that you have not included in the list the four white enamel hospital beds and the four mattresses which the Department purchased. I have to ask you to be good enough to state what has become of these.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF. E. Talbot, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Regis, Que.\nSir,\n\nReferring to file 33-6-8 and to my letter of Aug 4th instant, particularly to that portion of my letter regarding boarding house for the doctor's child, I have to inform you that Mrs. Smith has just informed me it is impossible for her to take the teachers' child in view of there being no other suitable boarding place to be had.\n\nWill you take the Peter Yarrow house referred to in my letter of the 4th?\n\nJ. D. M. Leonard, Superintendent\nAltamont, Ont.\n\nF. E. Tailor\nAgent.\nOttawa, August 13, 1920.\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant stating that Mrs. Sam has just informed you that it is impossible for her to take the teachers of the St. Regis Schools to board and asking whether the Department will take the Peter Garrow house, which you stated in your letter of the 4th instant is in good condition and furnished and can be obtained for $15.00 per month.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department approves of renting the house you refer to from Peter Garrow at $15.00 a month as a residence for the teachers and you will be good enough to make the necessary arrangements with him. You should draw up an agreement for the rental of the house and have it signed by Peter Garrow. This agreement should be similar to the one you drew up last year when renting the house from James Hemlock and should be in duplicate and you should forward one copy to the Department and retain the other copy in your office. The rent will be paid monthly, upon receipt of properly certified vouchers, in duplicate. If possible, a clause should be inserted in the agreement giving the Department the right to renew.\n\nAny necessary repairs required from time to time should be made by the owner of the house and it should be in good condition before the teachers move in. You should have the furniture which you stated in your letter of the 4th instant is stored in the Village School moved to this house.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. D. McLean\nAsst.

Mr. Agent Taillon states that this house is in good condition and furnished. He is also being instructed to place in this building the furniture owned by the Department and which was used in the other teachers' dwelling.\n\nThe Department feels that it is not advisable for the teachers to reside in Hogansburg and the agent feels certain that the residence that the Department has secured will furnish very satisfactory accommodation for the teachers.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nfor Assistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nMiss Lorette McGrath,\nDouglas,\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department is informed by Mr. Agent Taillon that he has been able to secure a suitable house for a teachers' residence.\n\nYou may have leave of absence from duty to attend the marriage of your cousin, but it is expected that, if it is your intention to return, you will do so and be in St. Regis in time to re-open the school after Labour Day.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFor Asst.

The house was in such a poor state of repair that it was necessary for the teachers to keep on a heavy fire, which, no doubt, contributed to the wearing out of the stove.

(RG 10, Volume 6109, file 331-8, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOTTAWA, July 13th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer you to official letter of September 14th, 1920, regarding lease of house from Peter Garrow to be used as a teacher's residence on the St. Regis Reserve. As it will, no doubt, be necessary to continue this arrangement for the next school year, I have to request that you will obtain a lease of this house at the same rental. You should draw up a lease and have it signed by Peter Garrow and forward a copy to the Department.\n\nThe lease should contain a clause giving the Department the right to renew for a further period.\n\nYou will be good enough to give this matter your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF. E. Taillon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Regis, P.Q.\nDear Mr. Taillon,\n\nYour letter was received this morning asking about the house. We will be down at St. Regis again before very long and I will have a talk over my self about the place of course. Cannot say just when but before Sept. anyway I was in to see you before last but you were not there so they were lot of dishes broken and Mrs. Condon't find all the linen again which she left there for the tea. We got the sheep last Monday from the department and we thank you very much for it.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPete L. Garrod\n\nJuly 32, 1921\nSir,\n\nIn reference to yours of July 7th instant #33-4-5, and in particular to that portion of your letter relative to the renewal of lease of teachers' residence for another year, I beg herewith to enclose a letter which I have just received from Mr Garrow concerning the house.\n\nFrom the tone of the letter, and a previous conversation, I am under the impression that unless the Department is prepared to pay for whatever material has been destroyed, I fear we will not be able to secure a house for the teachers; for the only available and suitable one is this particular house.\n\nPersonally I am aware that both Miss McGrath and Miss McParland were very hard on the household material as they seemingly did not take very good care of things and it may have been while they were here that the things named in the attached letter disappeared.\n\nI think that unless you are prepared to allow them for the loss sustained, they will not rent the house for another year.\n\nKindly let me have your decision, so that I may be in a position to tell them what you will do in the matter.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Sec.,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6109, file 331-8, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nOTTAWA, August 10th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo relative to the renewal of lease of the teacher's residence in the village of St. Regis, for another year, and stating that the present owner refuses to renew this lease unless he is compensated for damages to the furnishings which he claims were destroyed by former teachers.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that in December, last, you forwarded an account to the amount of $21.00 in favour of James Henlock for damages sustained to a rocker and a Quebec heater, which was not allowed. It is considered that Peter Garrow in refusing to renew the lease unless he is also paid damages is a \"hold-up\" on his part. However, in order that a residence can be obtained for the teachers, and as his seems to be the only one available, the Department will be prepared to allow him a reasonable amount for any damage that was done, and I will be pleased if you will forward immediately a properly certified account covering the amount due. You can inform Mr. Garrow that the Department will pay a reasonable amount, and you should endeavour to obtain a renewal of the lease for the same rent as last year and forward a copy to the Department. If he refuses to sign the lease until he receives a cheque for compensation, you will be good enough to forward the account as asked for at once.\n\nKindly give this matter your prompt attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Aest. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nF. E. Taillon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Regis, P.Q.\nThis Agreement made this 15th day of August A.D. One Thousand and Nineteen Hundred and Twentyone. Between Peter L. Garrow party of the first part, and the Department of Indian Affairs of the second part,\n\nWITNESSETH: That the said party of the first part does hereby lease to the said party of the second part the following described property, situate in the Village of St. Regis, County of Huntingdon and Province of Quebec, namely: a 1\u00bd story (wood) residence, situate at the corner of School and Center Streets, for the term of ten months, beginning on the first of September 1921, and ending on the 30th day of June, 1922.\n\nAnd the party of the second part agrees to pay as rent for said premises the sum of One Hundred and fifty dollars; same to be paid on the first day of each month during the term of this lease in installments of Fifteen Dollars each.\n\nAnd the party of the second part covenants with the party of the first part, that at the expiration of the term of this lease he will yield up the premises to the party of the first part without further notice, in as good condition as when the same were entered upon by the party of the second part, loss by fire or inevitable accident, and ordinary wear excepted.\n\nIt is further agreed that the party of the first part will have the house banked for the winter and also supply double windows as well as all the necessary cooking utensils, dishes, and bed clothing.\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF the parties have hereunto set their hands and seals the day and year first above written.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6109, file 331-8, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nSir,\n\nReferring to yours of the 10th instant #33-6-8 regarding the renewal of lease for the teachers residence, I beg to herewith inclose lease from Peter Garrow for the school year 1921-1922. I endeavored to secure the lease for a longer term but he stated that there was a possibility of his requiring the house at that time and therefore, he would not consent to a longer period.\n\nAs to the claim for damages, he has agreed to accept $10.00 for articles broken and missing, which I consider reasonable and would recommend for payment.\n\nYour refer to my letter of December last to a claim for $21.00 in favour of James Hemlock and which you did not entertain, allow me to say with all respect that I believe Hemlock is legally, morally and equitably entitled to the amount claimed, although you have ruled otherwise.\n\nOwing to the fact that it is difficult to secure suitable boarding places or houses for the accommodation of the teachers, may I offer the following suggestions, that during the summer of 1922 a modern residence should be erected upon the school lot for the teachers, thereby doing away with the necessity of renting houses which at best are not altogether suitable for the purpose.\n\nWhile writing of teachers recall to mind that I made application for the placing of Sisters in charge of the village school and your reply was that no suitable residence was available; if you will follow my suggestion and erect a house, we could secure the nuns for the reopening of the school for the September 1922 term.\n\nAs you are well aware wherever the Sisters are in charge of the Indian schools much more satisfactory work is done. Mr Inspector Gilman, Inspector for the Protestant Provincial Board of Education and who inspects these schools for the Department has only words of praise for the wonderful work being done at the Caughnawaga school where they are serving; he always urges me to do my utmost to secure for the village at least the Sisters.\n\nI hope you may give the matter your valuable consideration and that when the school year 1922-1923 arrives we will have installed 'Les bonnes soeurs.'\n\nJ.D. McLean, Sec.,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\nOttawa, August 23, 1921\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th instant, enclosing a lease from Peter Garrow of his house to be used as a teachers' residence on the St. Regis Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this is satisfactory. It is noted that the rent, namely, $15.00 per month, is payable on the first day of each month during the term of this lease, and you will be good enough to forward each month a certified voucher, in duplicate, for the amount of rent due.\n\nWith reference to Peter Garrow's claim for damages, you may forward a certified voucher, in duplicate, for $10.00. You may also forward another certified voucher, in duplicate, for $21.00, covering the claim of James Hemlock.\n\nWith reference to these claims for damages done to the contents of the teachers' residence, I would point out that no such claims will be considered in future, unless received before payment of teachers' salaries has been made as it is felt that the teachers are liable for any damage done to the furniture.\n\nThe Department notes your suggestion that a modern residence be erected during the summer of 1922 and that sisters be engaged to take charge of the schools in St. Regis Village.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nF.

In case you shall overlook any, I shall enumerate them below:\n\n1. 3 single mattresses (Miss Robillard also urged)\n2. \u00bd doz. knives and forks (stainless)\n3. \u00bd doz. small spoons (tea)\n4. \u00bd doz. large spoons\n5. Kitchen supply - cooking utensils - also 6 brooms and 1 dust mop\n6. Dishes (not too many)\n7. Table linen - 6 linen cloth with serviettes, also two cotton damasks for everyday use.\n8. 1 doz. dish towels\n\nRegarding dish-towelling, I have procured at a sale enough material to make a dozen at $1.45. I shall make them up and take...\nthem along, then send you the bill.\n\nWe are supplying our own bed-linen,\ntowels and bedroom window hangings.\n\nMrs. M. Grier you may possibly think me\nextreme when I ask the Department to furnish\neverything but bed-linen; but if you consider\nhow awkward it is for us to move these things\naround, you will, I think, consider the\nmatter favourably. I usually have excess baggage\nwithout any of these extras.\n\nNow, regarding the dishes, I would advise\neither an inexpensive small dinner and tea\nset combined or the equivalent in two\nseparate sets of different design. Choose cutlery\nand kitchen utensils as you wish, but since\nwe will sleep on mattresses only try to\nchoose comfortable ones. The table linens\nmay be chosen to advantage, as in the\nforegoing.\n\nMiss Robillard mentioned the necessity\nof some repainting at the Residence. Possibly\nshe could tell you definitely by letter what\nis needed. She also mentioned a new\nlavatory at the residence with a lock.\nYou omitted telling me if you had any more vacancies anywhere. My cousin would like a position, but since she only has a third-class certificate, those holding second-class should receive first consideration. However, she is clever and a good teacher, so if you have a vacancy you might advise me of it.\n\nI think possibly this is all I have to request this time, I expect to be in the city soon so shall call you.\n\nThanking you,\n\nI am,\nSincerely,\n\nMargaret MacNally.\n\nP.S.

I may say it is expected that a cheque covering the rental due for the months of April, May and June, last, to the amount of $45, will be sent you in the course of a day or so. It was necessary to obtain a Governor General's Warrant before the funds were available.\n\nIt is further regretted that any damage was occasioned to the furnishings in this house. If you will make out a statement giving a list of the articles and a fair estimate of the damage, the Department will take this matter up with the teachers, with a view to adjusting any claim you may make.\n\nThe Department is very anxious to obtain a renewal of the lease of this house for another year, and we hope that, in view of the above explanation, you will reconsider your decision and agree to allow the teachers to occupy this building until June 30, 1927.

She complained that a number of the chairs had been broken by the teachers. My opinion is that some of the chairs got out of repair through use. It was impossible, however, to convince Mrs. Garrow of this and it was decided to have it understood that three kitchen chairs purchased recently by the Department would be considered Mrs. Garrow's property to replace the chairs she claims were broken.\n\n2. It was also decided that two of the toilet sets in the bedrooms should be considered Mrs. Garrow's property.\n\n3. It was agreed that the following articles of furniture belong to the Department:\n\n   (a) 1 Dresser.\n   1 Stand - These are in the small bedroom upstairs.\n\n   (b) 3 Beds.\n\nIt should be noted that these articles should be added to the list of supplies purchased this year for the residence by the Department.\n\n4. It was agreed that all the bed clothes at present in the residence are the property of the Department.\n\n5. Blinds were purchased this year for the windows as the other blinds had worn out. As the windows are an odd size and the blinds had to be cut specially for them, it might be as well to leave them in the residence when the Department vacates same.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I am particularly interested in any irregularities that there may have been in connection with the personal services. I should like to know if you consider the transfer of Miss Prudhomme to the St. Regis Island Indian Day School to be in the best interests of our work. You might let me know if visits by the teachers from the Chenaill and Chetlain Schools are causing any difficulty at the teachers' residence in the village.\n\nAs you were informed at the time of your appointment, the Department was considerably worried over school conditions on the reserve and it was and is my desire that you act as adviser to the other teachers, in personal matters as well as in connection with teaching methods. I should be grateful for an immediate and full reply on the matters touched upon by myself and on any others that you see fit to report.

I believe that a new residence is urgent, so that we will be able to keep the rather good personal services which we now have at this point. The Village residence should provide accommodation for three teachers and additional accommodation for the Chetlain and Chansil teachers, who make it their home over the weekends. A suitable location would have to be secured. I have made a note for 1927-28 Estimates.\n\nAt the time of my visit, I laid down rules in connection with the residence and definitely placed Miss MacNulty, the Village senior teacher, in charge.\n\nI propose to write to the Indian Agent, authorizing the purchase of one mattress, which is required.\nOttawa, February 1, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Ferrier, who recently visited St. Regis, states that one more mattress is required at the teachers' residence in the village.

You should inform Peter L. Garrow, the owner of the house we rent, that the Department will not require his building after September 30th, next. Secure the cooperation of the two village teachers in the preparation of a list of the department owned equipment that is in this house, so that there will be no misunderstanding when our effects are moved some time in the month of September.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

ORR,\n\nThere is an item in the Supplementary Estimates, of $5,000, for the purpose of erecting a teachers' residence at St. Regis Village. It is very important that this building be completed this year, as we are apt to lose the splendid teaching services we have engaged, unless a suitable home is provided. I am asking Mr. Indian Agent MacGibbon to look into the question of a suitable lot (see file 33-6-9). I would like to suggest that this building be advertised along with the Cornwall Island classroom (33-4-5) as it is possible a better price could be secured if the contract was awarded as a whole. Both sites can be easily reached by water from Cornwall.\n\nAccommodation in the St. Regis Village teachers' residence is required for 4 teachers. I would suggest that two bedrooms be larger than the others - one for the principal and the other for the week-end accommodation of a second teacher - the girl from Chetlain, who lives in the village from Friday until Sunday. A fair sized living room and dining room should be provided.\n\nThe basement should be large enough for not only the furnace but for storing food, etc.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nSir,\n\nI beg to say regarding teacher's residence, St. Regis Village. I informed Mr. Peter L. Garrow, Deferiet, N.Y., that the Department would not require his house after Sept. 30th/27. I may say that Mr. Garrow wants pay for his house, $15.00 per month, during July, August and September, if the goods belonging to the Department are left in the house. It might be possible to have these goods stored in one room, for very little, that is, if the new residence would be erected and ready for use by the first of September when school opens. Mr. Garrow wishes to know as soon as possible concerning this.\n\nI Am,\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nW. C. MacKillop\nAgent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 8th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd ultimo, regarding the teachers' residence at St. Regis Village.\n\nIn this connection I beg to say that you may inform Mr. Garrow, the owner, that the Department will require this building until the end of September, next, and will allow him rental therefor at the usual rate, viz. $15 per month. All furnishings should remain in this house during the summer holidays and until the new residence is ready for occupation, which will not likely be before the end of September, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The cistern is constructed, conductors connected, and ready for water. As the water-works will not be in operation this Winter, what about a cistern pump being installed in the kitchen of this house? This is the only way the water could be used from the cistern, is by having a cistern pump in the kitchen.\n\nW.G. MacGibbon\nAgent\nOttawa, November 17, 1927.\n\nSir;\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, informing the Department that the new teachers' residence in St. Regis Village is nearly completed. It is noted that the cistern is constructed and ready for water.\n\nYou may arrange to have a cistern pump installed in the kitchen of this house in order to supply the water required. You should purchase a suitable pump for the purpose, and have same installed. Please keep all expense down to the lowest possible point. An account, in duplicate, properly certified, should be forwarded covering the cost of the pump, and the labour in installing same. Please give this matter your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. A.

I am leaving the fourth bedroom out except for a blind and curtains therefor.\n\nMac\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose list of supplies for the Teacher's New Residence, St. Regis Village. This list was handed to me by Miss Macaulay, Teacher. There are a lot of supplies on the list which are not really necessary at present; of course there are some that are, such as stove, table, chairs, etc., that are absolutely necessary to have before the teachers move in. These should be purchased as soon as possible, in order to be moved in the new house by December the first. Mr. Lalonde, head carpenter, left this afternoon, November 15th. He handed me the keys of the house, also instructed me the running of the furnace; which he said should be kept going, as the plaster is not thoroughly dry yet. The house is completed with the exception of the flush electric switches, and they are being put on the last of this week, as the floors are newly varnished, and will not be thoroughly dry until then.\n\nThere is a little matter on which I want information on, is, that Miss Stacey, teacher of St. Regis Island School, asked me if she could be entitled to have a room in the New Residence, St. Regis Village, on week ends, if she desired. Miss Stacey visits friends at Hemmingburg occasionally, and it happens sometimes she would stay over in St. Regis; therefore this room would be a good clean place to stay. Miss Stacey does not care to stay over night in most of the places in St. Regis Village. There are four bed-rooms in the new house, so there is plenty of room. Of course Miss Stacey could have to be warned to take none of her friends in the new house. I think there is just a little bit of off feeling between the other teachers and Miss Stacey.\n\nI am,\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nW.A. MacGillivray\nAgent.\nOttawa, November 21st, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, enclosing a list of supplies, prepared by Miss MacNulty, for the new teacher's residence at St. Regis Island. In reply I beg to say that Mr. Phelan of this Department is going to Cornwall on Thursday, November 24th, in order to arrange for the purchase of the supplies considered necessary. Please arrange to have Miss MacNulty meet him at the post office in Cornwall at 11 o'clock that morning. You should, also, arrange with one of the Indians who has a motor boat to bring Miss MacNulty to Cornwall and he should be given definite instructions to wait in Cornwall until she is ready to return in the afternoon. As many of the supplies as possible will be sent back with him. In order to facilitate delivery of the supplies, this Indian should be requested to land, if possible, at the wharf most closely situated to the centre of the town but, if this is not possible, Miss MacNulty will know at what wharf the boat is. Payment for the services of this Indian will be made on receipt from you of a properly certified voucher in duplicate. This Indian should be at his boat from 2 p.m. on so that articles purchased can be delivered to him.\n\nThe pupils of the senior room of the St. Regis Village School may be granted a holiday on Thursday.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I promised her that the Agent would be instructed to arrange for the cleaning.\nSir,\n\nI beg to say that the teachers moved in the new teachers residence, St. Regis Village, today, November 29/27. The Village School and Chenail School were closed for the day, the teachers assisting in moving. I hired Mr. Lawrence Hoppa with his team and wagon for transferring house-hold goods to new house, and was assisted by Mr. Mitchell Thomas. Tomorrow I will have the window shades on and dry closet placed.\n\nI may say regarding the cistern in basement of new house. When the contractors constructed and completed the cement cistern they notified me that it was O.K. for water. I had the cistern good three-quarters full of water when I noticed it leaking, leaking fast and getting worse. I went over to Cornwall the following morning, notified the contractors they came over, dried the cistern and gave it a coat of good strong cement both inside and out, which I am satisfied is a good lasting job. At present there is barely one foot of water in cistern. If this cistern was full I don't think the teachers would go short of soft water during the winter months.\n\nI Am,\nYour Obedient Servant.\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I was instructed to hire an Indian with a motor boat to proceed to Cornwall on the same day, to bring back the supplies purchased. I hired Mr. George Jacobs, of St. Regis, who runs a motor boat, the day was very windy and rough on the water, and I had some difficulty in securing someone to venture the trip, but Mr. Jacobs consented to go, and got within a mile from Cornwall and had to turn back, on account of rough water. It happened that Tom Thomas was over to Cornwall that day, with motor boat and snow, and he brought over the supplies next morning. I consider that Mr. Jacobs is entitled to pay for his trip, which is $2.00. He done the best he could considering the weather. I might say that I would have sent this in sooner, but on account of Mr. Jacobs being away for a short time prevented me doing so.\n\nI Am,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.C.

Miss Morris and Miss Willard say they left the butter in the store-room in the basement, close to a window, and had been in the habit of leaving the window a little open at times, and it appears that this window had not been locked securely on leaving for the holidays, so someone short of butter unhooked the outside window, pushed open the inside window, and reached for the butter.

It appears that some of the registers have no heat in them whatever and that as a result some of the rooms are too cold to sit in. The furnace is a large one and properly installed should give ample heat for the entire building.\n\nThey also stated that the sun room windows were so drafty that they could not use that room on a windy day and that the back door was so badly sprung that they have had to close it permanently during the winter.\n\nWould it not be possible to bring these matters to the attention of the contractor?\n\nInspector.\nMarch 6, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nIt has been reported to the Department that the heating system at the new teachers' residence recently constructed at St. Regis village is not working satisfactorily.

You should arrange for the purchase of the quantity of Page wire, posts, braces, steeples and for the 10' gate required, and also for the labour in having the fence erected. We note that you estimate the total cost of the material and labour to be approximately $41.\n\nWhen this work has been completed, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the fencing material and also for the labour in erecting the fence. You should see that the work in erecting this fence is satisfactorily carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nM. A. MacGibbon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Regis, P.Q.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have been able after much enquiry to purchase the amount of curtain material required for Twelve Dollars - Fifty-nine cents. You allowed Thirteen dollars for same. There was an extra door panel and two side panels which we had not taken into consideration. All windows and doors are now accounted for.\n\nThere still remains the question of poles. No ordinary pole fits these windows, as you will see from dimensions on separate sheet. I find special poles will have to be cut and will cost ten (10) cents per ft. Brackets and ends fifty cents (50) extra for each pole. Making this up at the above prices poles for the windows, and extensions for the doors and smaller ceiling windows will amount to $6.26. All windows are thus accounted for.\nWould you have some one look around in the city to see if something better can be obtained? In the event you're not getting better prices, would you let me have an order to secure what I have quoted? I shall send the bills later.\n\nThanking you,\n\n[Signature]\nSincerely,\nMargaret MacPhee\n\nMr. R. Ferrier,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nTwin windows require three poles 74\" long\u2014there are three sets of twin windows.\n\n1 Sun-room window requires a pole one hundred ten (110\") long.\n\n1 Sun-room window requires a pole 59\" long.\n\nThese to be complete with brackets and ends.\nOttawa, May 31st, 1925.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th instant, informing the Department that you have purchased the quantity of curtain material required for the windows of the teachers' residence at St. Regis Village, and requesting authority to have the number of curtain poles, brackets and ends required supplied.\n\nIn this connection I beg to say that you may arrange for the purchase of the special curtain poles, brackets and ends required. We note that you estimate the cost to be approximately $6.26. Please obtain an account, in duplicate, which you should hand to Mr. Agent MacGibbon, together with the account covering the amount paid for the curtain material, and request him to attach same to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and send to the Department, when payment will be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

(RG 10, Volume 6109, file 331-8, part 2)\nSir:-\n\nI beg to say regarding the cistern connected with the teachers residence, St. Regis Village. The teachers residing in the residence informed me that the water in the cistern was bad. After examining the water, I found that it was unfit for use, being polluted by the stain from the shingles, also probably, due to the fact that no water was used from the cistern during the summer months.\n\nI had the cistern drained and cleaned. Enclosed are vouchers #384, in favour of Thomas Benedict, for draining and cleaning cistern.\n\nI am,\nYour Obedient Servant.\n\nW.A. MacGibbon\nAgent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSt. Regis Island, Que.\nOct. 27, 1925\n\nMr. P. J. Ferrier,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nSir:\n\nI would appreciate the right to use the spare room in the teacher's residence. Having no fixed place in the village to stop overnight or on Sundays makes it very inconvenient for me. The room, I understand, is only partly furnished, will await instructions regarding furnishings.\n\nHoping for a favorable and early reply.\n\nYour humble servant,\nTeacher on the St. Regis Island School.\n\nM. Stacey\nOttawa, October 31, 1928.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have to inform you that Miss M. Stacey, teacher of the St. Regis Island Indian Day School, has requested permission to use the spare room in the teacher's residence in the village whenever she has to stop over night and on Sundays. Please let the Department have a recommendation without delay. I understand that Miss Legarde of the Chetlain School does not use this room at all.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMiss M. MacNulty,\nSt. Regis,\nP. Q.\nSt. Regis, Que.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to letter No. 33-6-8 of Oct. 31st, I might say that Miss Stacey came to me a month or more ago, asking permission to week-end here, and I replied as follows:\n\n\"The spare room is not furnished.\"\n\nIt might be advisable then for you to write her personally and corroborate my statement; which is just how matters are.\n\nAfter consulting the girls, I feel that the granting of this privilege to an Indian would be a step in the wrong direction, and one you would regret taking, as the preservation of the prevailing harmony among the girls should be given first consideration.\n\nThe Hotel is open for guests, and I feel sure that there are other Indian people who will keep her if she\nwill only pay for her trouble. Miss Legarde has never asked to stay, simply because she week-\nends in Hogansburg with her friend's family.\n\nTrusting this will prove satisfactory,\n\nSincerely,\n\nMargaret MacNully.\n\nMrs. R.V. Ferrier,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nOttawa, November 8, 1928.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, with reference to the partly furnished room in the St. Regis Village teachers' residence. This room is for the use of the teacher of the Chatlain Indian Day School and is also a spare room for the relatives of the three teachers who live there regularly.

The coal was not dampened before putting in the coal bin, which resulted in a great deal of coal dust covering the entire surface in the basement, which made it a very dirty job in cleaning. I engaged Joe White to clean the basement. In future I will try and have the coal dampened before putting in bin.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nAgent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, April 3, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that Mr. and Mrs. Garrow, from whom the Department at one time rented a teachers' residence at St. Regis, called at the office today. They have explained that they are under the impression the Department owes something towards the cost of erecting an outdoor toilet at their home. You will remember that you wrote in this connection on April 16th, a year ago.\n\nIn view of the fact that there is now no toilet at their home, the Department has decided to supply the following lumber, which you may order and give to the Garrows when they request it:-\n\n200 ft. H. T. Lumber at approximately $40. per 1000 ft.\n5 pieces 2\" x 4\" x 12', and 6 pieces 3/8\" x 12\" x 12' (pine).\n\nThe approximate cost of this lumber is $11.50. When the material has been supplied, you should forward a properly certified account, in duplicate, in favour of the lumber concern. Mr. and Mrs. Garrow understand that they are to be responsible for the nails, hardware and the labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. A.

All the fixtures are there for a bathroom and for hot water. At a later date, the downstairs, especially, should be decorated.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier\nOttawa, February 27, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to authorize you to provide a check valve at the bottom of the kitchen pump at the St. Regis Village teachers' residence. You should also have two steps built at the base of the soft water cistern. Further, you should place above that portion of the smoke pipe which is near the furnace some insulating or protecting material. Asbestos might be advisable for this purpose. You may purchase a fire basket for the fireplace in the living room. You may authorize Miss MacNulty to secure some edging for the upstairs linoleum runner and to lightly tack it to the floor. You should also examine the legs of the four beds and determine what type of steel or glass glides would be suitable.

They again burst a few days later, in the flooring beneath the bath room, same place as they froze before. I therefore consulted Mr. Parker as to the best method of protecting the pipes. The pipes were repaired and packed around to protect them from the frost and we also placed valves in the pipes leading to the second floor, with draining taps so they could be closed and drained during severe cold weather, and also the water could be shut off if they froze again.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir,-\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 18th instant, with reference to certain repairs that had to be made to the plumbing at the St. Regis Village teachers' residence.

They are leaking and in some places have become broken. They are not in a condition to carry sufficient water to fill the cistern during a rainy spell, with the result that the Teachers' have had to have their soft water carted from the river.\n\nAt the present time only 2/3 of the roof sheds water into troughing delivered to the cistern. The balance was caught in a barrel or wasted. It is proposed to have all spouting deliver water to the cistern.\n\nMr. Parker of Cornwall informs me the most practical method would be to charge for the manufactured troughing, 25\u00a2 per foot, plus labor, etc., cost of installing.\n\nIt will all depend upon the condition of the pipes as to what the total cost would be. Some of the old troughing may be used. The total cost would be around $30.00. If I may have permission I can have this work done in time to catch the fall rains.

Six Gav. smoke pipes, two elbows with check draft inset. The plaster ceiling of the kitchen has become cracked, threatens to fall, requires repairing. The most practical method is to use Plaster board or gyproc. A portion of the plastered wall under the window sill of the sun room requires repairing, and cause of seepage of rain water remedied. Through settling of the building the cellar door and the bath room door (directly overhead) will have to be rehung, so as to close properly.\n\nThe walls and ceilings throughout should be morescoed or painted. The kitchen, sitting room hallways, three bedrooms, particularly require renovating. There are several large cracks in the wall of one of the bedrooms, near chimney which require to be filled. We have trouble with the drain leading from the cellar. It may be that the septic tank has become decayed and will not function properly. The drain may have to be reopened the box examined and possibly replaced. Costs in connection with this will be problematical in accord with repairs required.\n\nWalls and ceilings of rooms to be painted will have to be washed as they are quite sticky and greasy.

They are mitigating reasons.\n\nWhen Miss Terrance taught at the village school during the temporary absence of Miss McDonald she chose to reside at her home just south of Hogensburgh, a 2\u00bd mile drive and had her meals at the residence. Then she changed to having her meals at an Indian home, with Mrs Joe Sawatis.\n\nWhen Miss Terrance was appointed Teacher at the Chenail school, she chose to reside at home and drive to her work. By doing so she reached by car over roads kept open the year round, and passable, excepting for a period following severe snow storms; the school more conveniently than she could if living at the Village teachers' residence, from where it means a walk of a mile and one half, being ferried across St. Regis River during the summer months. This worked good until last winters severe weather and heavy storms with consequent blocking of all roads. She could not conveniently reach her school at such times and decided that she had best stay at the residence. She was advised there was room for her there and the teachers resident at the residence were also advised, but, Miss McDonald, especially, strenuously objected to have an Indian girl reside with them, and gave Miss Terrance the cold shoulder. In consequence Miss Terrance did not move to the residence but at such times as there was heavy travelling stayed with Miss Sawatis in the village, and at other times made her way home.\n\nIn addition Miss Terrance has said that she wished to reside at home with her mother who has not fully recovered from a car accident, which occurred last fall. If she stayed on the staff she has intimated that she would drive to her work, and has voiced a preference to an appointment at the village school, where she could reach in a few minutes by car.\n\nMiss Terrance was\nMiss Terrance was quite aware that as far as the Department was concerned she was quite welcome to avail herself of the accommodation provided at the residence. But there was that uncongenial atmosphere.\n\nI must advise that Miss Caza did not voice, to me, any objection to having Miss Terrance live at the residence.\n\nIn passing I may advise that Miss McDonald has been her and taken away her effects while she advised me that she did not resign from the service of the Branch, we are losing her services here. That means there will be an opening for Miss Terrance if it is found advisable to give her one of the appointments at the village school. I have suggested that she accept the position at the St. Regis Island school. She would not take it under consideration, saying that she wished to be placed so she could go to her duties from her home. Miss Terrance is inclined to be quite fleshy, a heavy weight, and does not like foot travel, especially over heavy roads.\n\nIt is now quite possible, that due to the departure of Miss McDonald, that an Indian lady teacher will be find a changed attitude by other teachers residing at the residence. At least I hope so.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nSt. Regis, Que.\nJuly 2nd., 1943.\n\nR.A.Hoey, Esq. Supt.

We have specified Beauty Rest but of course another make of coil mattress will do as well. The four washstands which are in the residence at the present time, will also serve our purpose.\n\nYou will probably be surprised to notice that we have requested bedroom equipment for six. This is explained by the fact that four sisters will reside in St. Regis: the two teachers, the housekeeper and a fourth one who will stay with the housekeeper during the day. Of course, we expect to have visitors occasionally so we have asked for two additional beds.\n\nThe kitchen equipment is also scanty; this explains the rather large list we are sending to you.\n\nAll papers duly filled will be forwarded to you within a day or two.\n\nThanking you for your kind attention to all these matters, I beg to remain\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nSister Mary Zita, S.S.A.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nOttawa.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nAugust 15, 1943\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF St. Regis Village Indian Day School\n\nVOTE: 76 Allotment: 18-415\n\nSHIP TO: Sister Mary Zita, Principal, St. Regis Village Indian Day School, Cornwall, Ont.\n\nPurpose for which required Furnishings for teachers' residence\n\nNOTE:\u2014Requisition for non-consumable equipment, state if New Issue or Replacement.\n\n| Quantity | Description |\n|----------|-------------|\n| 4        | Single beds |\n| 4        | Mattresses for above (with coil springs) |\n| 12       | Pillows     |\n| 6        | Chairs      |\n| 4        | Rocking chairs |\n| 1        | Singer sewing machine No. 127-3-2 |\n| 1        | Table for community room approx. 5' long |\n| 1        | Dining room table with 6 chairs |\n| 1        | Ice-box (4\u00bd cu. ft.) |\n| 1        | Teacher's desk (similar to Globe No. 121) |\n| 1        | Teacher's chair (similar to Globe No. 1562) |\n| 1        | Small table suitable for holding typewriter |\n\nNote: We have arranged to have the Sisters of Saint Ann take charge of the St. Regis Village School and the above furnishings are required for the teachers' residence.

For your information I enclose copy of a requisition which is being forwarded to our Purchasing Branch and also a copy of a letter which is being forwarded to Indian Agent McNaughton.\n\nI suggest that you purchase the kitchen equipment. It is presumed that you will secure all the articles at as reasonable a cost as possible.\n\nSome time ago the Department discontinued supplying sheets, pillow cases, blankets, bed spreads, comforters, tablecloths and napkins for teachers' residences. All our teachers occupying residences now purchase this equipment themselves and it remains their personal property. In view of this regulation I regret that the quantities of these items mentioned in your letter cannot be supplied.\n\nYou will note that we are only purchasing 4 beds and mattresses at the present time. Our records indicate that we have already supplied beds and mattresses at this school and I suppose that they are still there. I am, therefore, ordering only 4 new ones for those actively engaged in the work and from our point of view it seems it should be possible to make use of the beds already in the building in the event of your having any visiting Sisters.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nSister Mary Zita,\nPrincipal,\nSt. Regis Village Indian Day School,\nSt. Regis, Que.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nAugust 13, 1943.\n\nMr. D.F.

But I am sorry to say that it has no commodities for sisters.\n\nWould you kindly allow us to hire a carpenter who could put shelves in a wall cupboard, upstairs, for blankets etc. Also to board off a small space between the stairs and kitchen to form a cupboard for our school apparel and to store away brooms.\n\nFor the sake of privacy, we need doors.\non the parlor and the Community room. Besides these are a few other little repairs to be made throughout the house.\n\nWe registered about forty-five pupils on Sept. 1 but started school only on Sept. 7 with sixty pupils on the Roll Call. Bad weather prevented the painters from finishing for Sept. 1.\n\nMr. McNaughton told me about two weeks ago that the beds had been ordered but they have not yet come. We did not get the typewriters either.\n\nI am happy to say that he and Mr. Bonnah are doing their best to make life pleasant for us at St. Regis.\n\nWe were sorry to find the school books in such a condition\u2014torn and scribbled upon. Therefore we take the liberty of sending in a requisition for the books needed. You can rely upon us to see that the children take good care of them.\n\nTrusting that you will not find us too exacting.\n\nI remain,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSister Mary Rita, S.S.T. Principal\nOttawa, September 24, 1943.\n\nReverend Sister Mary Zita, S.S.A. Principal, St. Regis Village Indian Day School, St. Regis, Quebec.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 18th instant, I am instructing Indian Agent McNaughton to secure a carpenter to make the shelves which you require. I trust that you will keep the expenditure as low as possible.\n\nPresent regulations do not permit us supplying a typewriter but we have arranged with Sister Mary George to have one of the typewriters at Caughnawaga repaired and sent to you.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, September 24, 1943.\n\nMr. D. P. McNaughton, Indian Agent, St. Regis, Quebec,\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Sister Mary Zita, in which she states that they require the following:\n\n1. Shelves in a wall cupboard upstairs.\n\n2. A small place boarded off between the stairs and the kitchen to form a cupboard and store brooms, etc.\n\n3. Doors between the parlor and the community room.\n\nPlease employ a carpenter to do the necessary work. It is expected of course, that the cost will be kept as low as possible.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n| Date   | Description          | Quantity | Unit Price | Total Price |\n|--------|----------------------|----------|------------|-------------|\n| AOUT 1943 | 2 GARDE-ROBES       | 2        | 25.95      | 51.90       |\n|        | 10% ESC.            |          |            | 5.19        |\n| 25     | 9553                 | 1        | POT        | 3.19        |\n|        | 1 BOL A MAIN        |          | .69        |             |\n|        | 10% ESC.            |          |            | .38         |\n|        | TAXE                |          | .07        |             |\n|        | 9553                 | 4        | LAVETTES   | .60         |\n|        | 10% ESC.            |          |            | .06         |\n|        | TAXE                |          | .02        |             |\n|        | 9553                 | 4        | SAVONNIERS | .80         |\n|        | 10% ESC.            |          |            | .08         |\n|        | TAXE                |          | .02        |             |\n|        | 9553                 | 1        | CHERUDRON  | 1.75        |\n|        | 2 ROULEAUX          |          | .30        |             |\n|        | 10% ESC.            |          |            | .20         |\n|        | TAXE                |          | .04        |             |\n\nTotal: 53.47\n| DATE | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Aug. | TO- Merchandise supplied for Teachers' residence, St.Regis Village and purchased by Principal Sr.Mary Zita.

Welfare & Training.\n\nThe Superior of the Village School has been discussing with me the prospect of having something done with the floor in one of the bed rooms at the residence.\n\nIt is a very difficult matter to get anyone here that can make a decent job of putting on varnish and as our sidewalks are very scarce in the village it is almost impossible to keep a varnished floor in good condition, with the result that it means continuous expenditure for this item.\n\nAs an alternative, I would recommend that authority be granted to purchase a linoleum 8' x 10' for the room in question and also that a piece two yards square be purchased to cover the bathroom floor. It is not expected the cost will be over $12.00, very likely less. It would be difficult to have the floor prepared and varnished for anything less and the results over a period of time would not be satisfactory.\n\nYour early consideration to the above would be appreciated.\n\nActing Indian Agent.\nOttawa,\nNovember 6, 1943.\n\nEX'D.\n\nMr. T.L.

Reserves and Trusts.\n\nRe: Purchase Order No. 20830\n\nThe above P.O. represents chairs ordered during October last for the Village teachers' residence from one Andrew Jardine, Funeral Director of Cornwall Ontario.\n\nWhen speaking to Mr. Jardine last week he advised me there was no sign of the chairs as yet but that he couldn't do any better than wait until they arrived. When that might be I would not venture to say.\n\nYou are aware that chesterfield and mchair chairs that supplied seating accommodation at the residence has been removed from the premises a long time ago.\n\nI would appreciate being advised of the length of time this Order might remain in force under the conditions outlined to Mr. McNaughton.\n\nIf Mr. Jardine cannot furnish our needs within a reasonable time it would seem in the best interests to place the order with some dealer handling furniture alone as it appears probable that such a dealer would get more concessions from the manufacturer than one having an entirely different line as the main source of income.\n\nT.M. Donovan\nClerk in charge\nOttawa,\nDecember 29, 1943.\n\nMr. T.L. Bonnah, In Charge Indian Agency, St. Regis, Que.\n\nI have your letter of the 26th instant, in which you state that you have not yet secured the chairs from Andrew Jardine, Cornwall.\n\nIf you can secure suitable chairs either in Cornwall or any place else at a price approximately the same as quoted by Jardine, you may make immediate arrangements for their purchase and you can advise Jardine that it will be unnecessary for him to supply them.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMr. R.A.Hoey, Esq. Supt. Welfare & Training.\n\nWhen Inspector Thibault was here some time ago we discussed the question of getting water for the teachers' residence in the village. Since his visit I have been making inquiries to ascertain if a solution could be found for our problem but so far have met with little success.\n\nThere is a cistern in the cellar at the residence with a hook-up to a hand operated pressure tank which supplies water for the taps and bathroom. However unless we have plenty of rain there is no way of filling the cistern except by hauling water. When the cistern goes dry, which is quite often, this means no water is available for the hot water tank as well which is hooked up to the furnace with the result that the furnace coil, from not having water in it, has been useless and often requires replacement. Since it has been necessary to keep the furnace on steadily for the past couple of months the water system could not be used and consequently water has to be carried upstairs, where it is held in the bath tub, for operation of the toilet unit.\n\nThere is little use in putting in a new furnace coil unless water can be kept in the cistern and this means continuous expense for this purpose as it takes about 20 barrels to make an impression in the cistern and this costs twenty-five cents per bbl. and 20 bbls. lasts about ten days or thereabouts. Since the furnace has been on steadily no water has been put in the cistern and there is little use unless the coil in the furnace is replaced but when that is done, water...\nwill have to be kept up in the cistern. There is no drinking water on the premises and this has to be carried from a neighbouring Indian home or from the school yard pump.\n\nThe only permanent solution I can see would be to install a small Briggs-Stratton gas engine which would operate a pump of sufficient capacity to draw the water from the school well and store it in a pressure tank in the basement of the residence. This would then give the teachers water for all purposes. The other alternative is to drill an artesian well on the grounds and pipe it into the house to the pressure tank. However files available on drilling artesian wells at this agency would indicate this to be a very expensive proposition.\n\nDuring the remainder of this winter it would seem advisable to have the hot water coil repaired in the furnace and the cistern kept full of water in the cellar and I would recommend that authority be granted to undergo the necessary expenditure until a permanent solution is found.\n\n[Signature]\n\nClerk in charge.\nOttawa, January 10, 1944.\n\nMr. C. D. Roberts, In charge Indian Agency\nSt. Regis, Que.\n\nOn December 28 Mr. Bonnah wrote us regarding the question of getting water for the St. Regis Village teachers' residence. No doubt, a copy of this letter is on file in your office.\n\nI have discussed its contents with Mr. Bonnah today and you are authorized to arrange to have the cistern kept full of water. Mr. Bonnah estimates that this will require about 20 barrels at a cost of 25\u00a2 per barrel and that 20 barrels will last approximately 10 days.\n\nWhen winter is over you can give the matter further consideration and after reviewing Mr. Bonnah's letter of December 28 you can then let us know what you consider might be a more permanent solution of the matter.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 11, 1944.\n\nMr. C.D.

You will recall I discussed this with you while in Ottawa.\n\nUnfortunately there is only a 6\" casing in the artesian well at school and with the piping and foot valve down in the casing it is not possible to place more plumbing in such a small space. A foot valve would also have to be put into the intended system as well. After considering this, digging costs and levels to be contended with, it would not appear advisable to consider my first suggestion. The only alternative is to have a well drilled or dug right on the house lot and a small gas engine to pump the water into a larger pressure tank in the residence basement. Digging may not be practicable as there appears to be a slate strata underneath the subsoil. The extent of this of course, I cannot say.\n\nThe above for your information and necessary action.\n\nT.L. Bonnah\nClerk in charge.\nOttawa,\nMarch 29, 1944.\n\nMr. T.L.

In fact, they have labored strenuously in a supreme endeavor to raise the educational level of their charges.\n\nI wish to thank you and the Department of Indian Affairs for the assistance you gave the teachers in their work as well as for every step taken by you to give them some measure of comfort in the residence.\n\nAt this time when the General Administration is checking up on the most pressing needs of our various establishments, I would like to draw your attention to the unsatisfactory heating system in the teachers' residence. Reports show that the furnace is much too small to assure necessary warmth, and as none of the windows or doors are weather-proof, the sisters suffered very much from the intensive cold during the winter months.\n\nAnother cause of considerable inconvenience is the insufficiency of domestic water. Proper sanitation and hygiene are impossible under existing conditions. Mr. Doucet, who inspected the house, will know that our complaint is justified.\n\nThough it may seem early to be planning for the next year, I feel that I should not delay to expose a situation to which I would ask you to give your personal and immediate attention in order to relieve the sisters of these water and heat worries. I hardly believe it would be possible for the sisters to resume another winter under similar difficulties.\n\nThanking you most sincerely, I remain\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\nSuperior General.\nOttawa,\nApril 27, 1944.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Sister Leopoldine:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, with reference to the teachers' residence at the St. Regis School. We have already given considerable consideration to the supplying of water to this building. To do so at a reasonable figure presents considerable difficulty. However, it is our intention to have Mr. Doucet visit St. Regis between now and the 15th of May, at which time he will again discuss both the water situation and the furnace with the Reverend Sisters and the Indian Agent. I can assure you that we will do everything possible to make them comfortable.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

Linings have been burned through for many months and have been patched and repatched. I am trying to obtain a complete relining for this stove but so far have been unsuccessful. The stove definitely should not be used but there is no alternative.\n\nI should think, in view of the wood and coal shortage, that the purchase of a three burner perfection oil stove with oven would be very practicable in the residence. I have tried to locate such a thing in Cornwall but without any success and less promises. However one might be had across the line but I can't say definitely at this writing. One thing certain, our wood supply won't hold out much longer at the residence and neither will the coal.\n\nI had hoped to have an opportunity of discussing this and other matters with Mr. Doucet last week or early this week but I imagine other matters has kept him from the intended visit here.\n\nIf you have any solution regarding the oil stove, I should appreciate your advice.

Bonnah, Indian Agent, St. Regis, Que.\n\nIn reporting on his recent visit to the St. Regis Reserve, Mr. Doucet states that the exterior of the teachers' residence is in need of paint. I understand that there is an Indian on the reserve who would be able to do the work. Please consult him and let me have an estimate of the cost of the material and labour.\n\nIn order to adjust the windows and doors, Mr. Doucet suggests that the window casings be removed to determine the cause of the trouble. The spaces should be packed with oakum and caulked before putting on the casing and caulked again after the casing has been put in position. Grey caulking should be used, as this kind may be painted. No doubt you can arrange to have this work done at a reasonable cost.\n\nMr. Doucet also states that he interviewed Mr. Edward Parker in Cornwall and that the latter is willing to examine the furnace in the teachers' residence. It is hoped that Mr. Parker will be able to fix the furnace so that it will give satisfactory heat. If he considers it possible to do this you should let me know, as it may be necessary to purchase a new furnace, but we hope that this can be avoided. When Mr. Parker comes to the residence you should also decide about the size of the pipes leading from the furnace.\n\nFurther instructions will be forwarded to you regarding the water situation.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nReceived from T.C.

It is noted that the total cost of this material will be $75.45. I phoned the Purchasing Branch this morning and they could obtain paint at a cheaper price, but, as we presume from the information given on the purchase order that this is special quality paint you are securing, the retail price of it may be considered reasonable.

Welfare & Training.\n\nWith reference to yours of June 5th, please be advised that the water system has now been installed in the village teachers' residence from the school artesian well. Vouchers are going forward under separate cover for this item.\n\nYou will notethat it was not possible to keep within the limited amount specified in your letter. However, I have done as well as can be in regards to keeping down labour costs for ditching and excavation at the well. Had I not spent all my time on this work costs would have doubled what they are as the men had to dig through hard pan and plenty of rock to put through the ditch. Total labour costs for this work being $74.25. Plumbing costs are $124.14, which includes bridge toll and the services of Garnet Clark, welder.\n\nI might mention that the casing of this artesian well was only 5\" and not 6\" as expected. It being impossible to place two 1\u00bd\" check valves in such a small space regardless of the type of valve. Sensing that we would encounter great difficulty there, I made a test of the water rise and got well below the level. Mr. Clark burned through the casing and we set in our pipe and then welded around the casing. During this process the water had to be kept pumped out of the casing. A check (horizontal) valve was placed outside the casing and if anything should ever go wrong with this valve it will not be necessary to touch the regular pump. Incidentally the check valve had to be removed from the regular pump at the well as it was not possible to even get it down past the other piping despite the fact that the casing was hugged.\n\nBoth the pump at the school and in the residence are now in good working order and with plenty of water.\n\n...p...t...c\nI feel, however, that consideration should be given to the purchase of a gas operated pump for the teachers' residence. The hand pump that is in operation at the present time is somewhat of a man-killer. You must realize that with four people in a house continually there is a lot of water used and with the small pressure tank it has to be pumped at least five times daily. Pumping is comparatively easy until the pressure reaches 30 lbs., beyond that it is no easy job and we cannot expect to have a janitor that receives only $5.00 per month spend all his time pumping water. I would judge that at least two and one-half hours must be spent daily in pumping water by hand and after that is done a janitor has to go about his other work. If we had a gas operated pump there would still be the same pumping to be done but would give a janitor a chance to do his other work while the pump was operating. I discussed the prospect of getting a gas operated pump with Mr. Parker and he advises that there is a possibility but not until August.\n\nT.L. Bonnah\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 28, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nI attach an account amounting to $124.14 covering material and labour required in installing the water system in the teacher's residence at the St. Regis Village Day School.\n\nOf the amount stated $52.00 is labour and $72.14 covers the cost of the materials. It is not possible to accurately estimate the quantity of material required for this job and as the labour to start the work was available at the present time, the Indian Agent was authorized to proceed with it.\n\nIt would be appreciated, if you would issue a purchase order so that the account may be paid. The quotation is as follows: 76-331-10-691.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nReference to yours of June 1st, re heating of teachers' residence in this village.\n\nMr. Parker has examined the furnace and taken necessary measurements of the various rooms to ascertain the heating capacity. Considerable repair will be necessary to put the old furnace in good order but Mr. Parker does not recommend that this be undertaken insomuch as even when the furnace was new it did not heat the place. He recommends the purchase of a new furnace and suggests the Beach Air Warmer #24, weight 1600 lbs. with a capacity of 30,000 cu ft. Further, some changes will have to be made in the heating and cold air ducts as is presently located. An additional hot air duct 4 x 6 will have to be installed for upstairs heating and two hot air registers put in the floor downstairs. It appears that apart from the present furnace, which never did work satisfactorily, cold air ducts were not installed in the proper locations downstairs. Doors are being installed in the archways in the dining room and the living room and this won't help matters either unless consideration is given to a larger furnace as specified above. In fact, with the present furnace, even if repaired, will not make the residence bearable should we have a cold winter as it was very difficult to get any heat last winter and the weather was comparatively mild throughout.\n\nI understand from Mr. Parker that the type of furnace above noted could be installed for about $404.00 with the necessary alterations and additional ducts included in this cost.\n\nWould you kindly advise your wishes in this respect.\n\nT.

It was necessary to put galvanized tin flashing around the entire building in order to shed the water.\n\nWith regards to the windows, I might advise that I have a carpenter working on this at present and considerable progress is being made with a view to eliminating the water nuisance which is destroying the interior of the residence.

REGIS INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF JUNE, 1944.\n\nConsiderable work is being carried on at the teachers' residence in the village. The exterior of the building is receiving a complete paint job. The building in general, over a number of years, has taken terrific punishment due to the fact that rain has been seeping in around the windows and doors and underneath the shingles on the wall of the building resulting in considerable damage being done to the interior. Much of this nuisance has been eliminated now. The roof of the building appears to be in fair condition but it was noted that a 2\" gap existed across the entire peak of the roof due to deterioration of the original peak boards. The chimneys at both ends of the building had to be caulked from bottom to top as there was about \u00bd\" space open to the elements on each side of the chimney.\n\nA water system was connected up during the month now giving a steady water supply to the residence from the artesian well in the school yard. Unfortunately, however, the old hand pump in the basement which was previously used and hooked up on the present system is definitely not giving service, and an adjustment will have to be made.\n\nT.L.

We have had the furnace examined and Mr. Parker, of Cornwall, states that the only way to properly heat the building is to install a new furnace. A furnace with 30,000 cubic feet heating capacity is required, and a Beach Furnace has been recommended by Mr. Parker. One of our officials visited Mr. Parker recently and ascertained that furnaces are very hard to obtain, but they have a Beach Air Warmer No. 26 in stock and this could be secured if the order is placed in the near future.\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and for Departmental purposes only.

It will probably be necessary to install a new septic tank. This matter requires immediate attention and Indian Agent Bonnah was authorized to proceed with the necessary work. The probable expenditure will be $200.00.\n\nOttawa, March 20, 1945.\nSt. Regis, Que.\nMarch 20, 1945\n\nPhilip Phelan, Esq., Chief, Training Division\n\nWith reference to our telephone conversation of this date regarding the sewage disposal system at the teachers' residence in the village, I would advise as follows:\n\nThe situation at the teachers' residence is similar to what we have experienced here at the office for the past number of years. The cellar drain and the toilets at the residence are on the same hook-up and, with the disposal system seven feet underground, there is very little chance for any seepage. In order to lower the water level in the basement of the residence, and get rid of raw sewage, digging is under way so that we can open up the line to the cesspool. As advised, arrangements have been made to put in a separate system to take care of the first and second floor. A septic tank will be installed near the residence with sufficient seepage lines therefrom to take care of seven people. A cut-off will be made in the cellar approximately eighteen inches below ground level, and hooked up to the new septic tank. In this way, the seepage lines coming from the septic tank will not be buried underground too deeply, where they are of no use. In the meantime, all we can do is keep the old line open to the cesspool, and after the new system is installed, use the old line for a cellar drain only. With more occupants in the residence, and the latter in use the year 'round, it is well to have a system that will give satisfaction. Unfortunately, there is so little land there that the seepage lines will have to be run on a neighbor's property.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs.

I wrote you in connection with this matter on June 23, and, on reviewing our file, I find that a typographical mistake was made in my letter of May 11. This should have read $600.00 instead of $500.00.\n\nUnder separate cover you are being forwarded an accountable advance of $200.00 for labour for repairs. I note your statement regarding the purchase of materials, and, as you know, purchases from any one firm must not exceed $50.00.\n\nThe Department agrees with your suggestion, to finish the sun-room of the teacher's residence with V-lap, with a view to ascertaining if this makes a satisfactory job. When this is completed you will know its cost and you will then be able to more accurately estimate what expenditure will be required to complete other rooms in the building where the condition of the plaster is unsatisfactory.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n**REQUISITION FOR CHEQUE**\n\nTO BE USED FOR ADVANCES OR AUTHORIZED PAYMENTS FOR WHICH THERE ARE NO ACCOUNTS\n\nDEPARTMENT: MINES and RESOURCES\n\nBRANCH: INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nDATE: June 27, 1945\n\nAPPLICATION IS HEREBY MADE FOR THE ISSUE OF THE FOLLOWING CHEQUE OR CHEQUES:\n\n| CHEQUE NO. | IN FAVOUR OF | AMOUNT |\n|------------|--------------|--------|\n|            | St. Regis Indian Agency Trust Account | $200.00 |\n\nSend cheque to:\nMr. T.

To go ahead and V-lap this building would mean we would have no funds left for other repairs.\n\nI was fortunate in getting an expert plasterer and had the Teacher's residence and village school and Cornwall Island West School replastered where needed at a cost of $74.15 for labour for this work. I am redecorating the interior of the C. Ild. W. school by Indian labour and also the teachers' residence in the Village. As soon as we can get around to it, the Jr. room of the Village school will be redecorated. The redecorating of course applies only to plastered walls. These walls are being done over with Durolane which is an oil bound paint which I am obtaining from approved sources at a cost of $1.00 per 5-lb. tin.\n\nAs requested, both porches have been repaired at the C. Ild. W. school and new woodwork repainted. Work done here will give the interior of this building a cleaner appearance, and will undoubtedly have a good effect on the teacher and pupils.\n\nT. L.

Further, no louvers were put in the attic. As you know, in past years considerable difficulty was experienced in trying to heat this building. The Adirondack Home Insulation Company of Malone was doing some work here on Indian homes and I asked the representative to give me an estimate on the cost of insulating the teachers' residence.\n\nYou will note from the attached that the entire building can be insulated at a cost of $682.00. You will also observe that the attic and dormer can be insulated at a cost of $284.54 along with the installation of vents or louvers. If only the walls of the building are insulated, the cost would be $403.92.\n\nIn the event that your office would consider insulating this building, I am forwarding this information on to you as we have found that since we had the Agency Office insulated it has made not only the office but the R.C.M.P. living quarters upstairs livable in winter and summer.\n\nT.

The unit has been working very satisfactory. When we discussed on the telephone, prior to my letter of November 30th last, what disposal would be made of the electric oil burning unit previously purchased for the Chenail School Residence, the suggestion was put forward about transferring that unit to the Sisters' residence in the Village where the power is hooked up and can be operated. The storage tank that came at the time the new electric oil burning unit was received has been set up and will be left at the Chenail School to take care of our oil storage for the nonelectric oil burning unit mentioned above. This brings us to the point that if we transfer to the Sisters' residence the original electric oil burning unit previously purchased for the Chenail School, then we will also have to purchase a storage tank and place it at the Sisters' residence in the village.\n\nAs you had not continued further in this matter, I thought possibly you might be pondering over the idea of purchasing an electric stove for the Sisters' residence at St. Regis Village and using the electric oil burning unit at another location where power is available and heating is essential from a kitchen stove. In the Sisters' residence, of course, there is a large furnace which gives adequate heat and an electric stove definitely would be more practical there. If you decide on the electric stove for the Sisters' residence we will not require the oil storage tank. Please advise.\n\n(Sgd) T. L.

If you wish to add anything further to your application, please use this space:\n    I was discharged from the U.S. Army with the grade of Technician Fourth Grade (sergeant), Nov. 10, 1945. My occupation while in the army was radio repairman. During my more than three years of overseas duty, most of the time was with a signal property repair crew of the 41st Inf. Div. Because our supplies were always so short or outmoded, we often made much of our own equipment, tools, and installations. I think such experience is more valuable than any formal course in a trade school.\n\n    My experience as camp counselor is in line with that of a manual training teacher. On the attached sheet is a record of jobs I have held in this connection.\n\nDate ...................................\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6100, file 331-11, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nSome months ago I discussed with Mr. A. J. Doucet the possibility of obtaining the services of a young man from the Cornwall Island Reserve who had recently been discharged from the United States Army. It was suggested at that time that he be placed in charge of Manual Training classes in our various schools and at the same time take over the boys' work which I had started. The name of this young man I had in mind was Ernest Benedict and after explaining everything to Mr. Doucet it was agreed that we can obtain his services and could put him on at a rate of around $1,500.00 per annum. Due to various reasons of which perhaps army life may have been responsible, it was not possible to get Ernie to settle down and after considering every angle I thought it better to let the matter rest in abeyance until he was prepared to readjust himself to civilian life.\n\nSome days ago he contacted me and advised that, if given the opportunity, he was prepared to go to work in the capacity previously outlined to him and I am pleased, therefore, to forward his application with the hope that your office may see fit to consider his appointment. It is true he would have very little to work with insofar as manual training is concerned. It may also be true that travelling will present some obstacle during the winter months. I do not feel, however, that such obstacles should prevent the employment of this man as I know him to be quite capable and could be depended upon in lieu of regular manual training (equipment which we have not on hand) to keep the boys occupied in such work as leathercraft, beadwork, wood carving, and basketry. There is plenty of work for him to do in this regard and I feel confident that if he is employed we can get together and work out a very good program for the benefit of all concerned.\n\nMay I hear from you in the above respect at an early date or if it is possible for Mr. Doucet to pay us a visit, so much the better.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This Report is to be sent to the Department of Mines and Resources, Training Division, at the end of each teaching month.\n\n2. Operations Learned and Grade obtained is secured from the Student Record Sheet. Use the number of the operation\u2014not the name. Example: John Jones\u20144A-6B-8C-etc., etc. The 4 stands for the operation, the A for the standing obtained, B would stand for the operation; B for the grade or standing obtained, and so on (see Foreword For Job Sheets).\n\n3. The Report is signed by the Instructor and the Principal.\n\nNote: If no instruction has been given during the month, state so on the report and give the reason for not being able to give any instruction.\n\nThis Report is to be used for all manual training activities: Sewing, Cooking, Metal Work, Gardening, Woodwork, etc.\n\n(a) Label the Report according to the activity on which you are reporting. Insert the activity just before the \"Month\".\n\n(b) In the space provided for the year insert 1st, 2nd, or 3rd, representing the year on the Basic Chart on which the pupil is working.\n\n(c) Write the number only of the basic operation satisfactorily mastered and the grade obtained. Example: IB, 8A, 12C, etc., as the case may be. A stands for excellent, very good; B for good, fair; and C for poor.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nAttention: Mr. A.J. Doucet.\n\nI am enclosing herewith Monthly Report in connection with manual training carried on in St. Regis Village. This takes in boys from both rooms at the village school.\n\nWe have been able to make a survey of the Chenail and Chetlain Schools and will have a similar number as soon as road conditions and travel permit. Incidentally, I have discussed this with some of the parents in the Chenail and the programme certainly meets with approval. It is a pity we have not a central school, well equipped, in that district.\n\nI do not think we have much to be afraid of with regards this work. The children are doing well and getting the information in the correct manner. The big trouble is to get them to stay at home long enough during noon hour so Ernie can eat. You can be assured of every cooperation from this office.\n\nEncl.\n\nT.L.

Lavallee, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nSeven Island, P.Q.\nSeven-Islands 31 Dec. 1931\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn answer to your letter of Dec. 15, 1931 NO.68-1-1 about the day school, I beg to inform you that I recommend this school be closed for the following reasons: it is impossible to keep a day school on the Reserve with an Indian girl as teacher because the parents of the children are jealous, they all want that the teacher should be their daughter. They all want to let their house for the school.\n\nIt is too bad that I could not make any arrangement with the Municipality Of Seven-Islands to take back these children to their school as before.\n\nI have not the same trouble at Moisie as The Municipality want still take our Indians at their school.\n\nI thought that by refusing to give any relief to those who would not go to the school I would have success but I was deceived.\n\nThe only thing I have to do now, is to make arrangement for the Indians who really desire their children be educated to send them to Moisie school.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. H. Parrott, Agent.\nOttawa, January 12, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo, recommending that the school at Seven Islands be closed on account of poor attendance and local jealousies among the Indian parents.\n\nIn reply I have to say it is considered that this school has not been a success from the point of attendance and that it would be a waste of money to continue it in operation. You will, therefore, be good enough to inform the teacher that this school is to be closed at the end of the present month and that her services will not be required after that date. She should prepare a return showing the attendance and days taught during the current month and forward same to the Department through your office, when payment of any salary due her to the date the school closed will be made. It is noted that you will endeavour to make arrangements with the Moisie White School for the attendance of the Indian children whose parents desire them to attend. It is hoped that the majority of the parents will agree to allow their children to attend school at Moisie.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nJ. H. Lavallee, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nSeven Islands, P.Q.\nOttawa, February 15, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to that portion of your letter of the last instant, informing the Department that the school which was conducted at Seven Islands was closed at the end of January, last, I have to say that as soon as the return, prepared by the teacher, showing the attendance and days taught during the month mentioned is received, payment of the salary due her will be made.\n\nRegarding your request that this school be reopened after the Indians return from their hunt in the Spring, when there will be a number of children who would attend, I have to say that, as our funds will be extremely limited, the Department will be unable to authorize the reopening of this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. H. Lavall\u00e9e, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nSeven Islands, P.Q.\nTO THE DEPUTY MINISTER\n\nSIR:\n\nI beg to report that on the 30th of June I left Ottawa according to your instructions, to inspect the following Reserves: Becancour, Pierreville, Lorette, Seven-Islands, Bersimis Restigouche, Maria, Cacouna, Les Escoumins, and Pointe-Bleue which were visited in the order above mentioned.\n\nX X Z\n\nSEVEN ISLANDS\n\nAt Seven Islands, I was asked if the Department would consider re-opening the school. There are 15 to 20 pupils who could attend this school. There are two Indian girls seeking the position of teacher - Marie Anne Picard, now Mrs. Jourdain, and Miss Jourdain, daughter of Mrs. Jourdain. The last applicant has not the required qualifications, while M.A. Picard has a teachers certificate.\n\n(sgd) Henri Fabien\nSeven Islands, Sept. 5th, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nConcerning the operation of an Indian school for this winter, we have about 17 school age children. These are all children of destitute families. Last year those children attended classes and I am under the opinion that it would be better to continue this school.\n\nG. Beaulieu, M.D.\nAgent.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 19, 1935.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. THIBAULT\n\nPlease note the request from Dr. G. Beaulieu for a school during the winter months at Seven Islands.\n\nSeveral years ago we operated a school at this point but the attendance was so unsatisfactory that it was closed.\n\nHave you any information about this matter? Would the operation of a school have a tendency to prevent the Indians from going into the bush for the winter?\n\nI would appreciate having an opportunity of discussing this matter with you.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 19, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. THIBAULT\n\nPlease note the request from Dr. G.

Labrador, Que.\n\nChief Andre and some other Indians from Seven Islands visited the Department recently and requested the establishment of schools. He claimed that there were approximately 150 children between 7 and 16 years of age, for whom no educational facilities are available.\n\nAs you are probably aware, we operated a school for several years at Seven Islands, but, owing to irregular attendance, it was closed in January, 1932, and we have never re-opened it.\n\nIs there any building available for school purposes? How many children do you think would attend if a school was opened?\n\nThey also made a request to have Jovite Andre sent to Rivere du Loup Convent. It was stated that it would involve an expenditure of $180.00 for one year. Please let me have your views regarding this request.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nSeven Islands July 23, 1945,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa,\n\nIn answer to Mr. Phelan's letter of July 18, 1945, regarding education of Indian children, we would be able to have a class room for school purposes in the new building bought recently from the Hudson's Bay Co. Further details may be obtained from Mr. Thibault who inspected this building on his recent inspection tour.\n\nAs most families go hunting during the winter months, it would be advisable to have school during the summer, that is from March to October. During this time about 100 children would be able to attend, but in Moisie the Indian children could attend the white school, as was done in previous years at a rate of $15.00 a year per pupil.\n\nRegarding Jovite Andre, the Chief's daughter, who wishes to go to the convent at Riviere du Loup, I would suggest she attend school here for at least a year because she is 13 years old and has never been to school.\n\nThe Chief came here, and informed me that he already had authorization from you to send his daughter to the convent, if this is so, you will have several more similar requests as all the Indians would like to send their children out, providing the Department is willing to pay.\n\nThe Chief Andre would like an immediate answer as he leaves for his hunting grounds in August.\n\nDr. G. Beaulieu, Indian Agent,\nOttawa, July 31st, 1945.\n\nDr. G. Beaulieu, Indian Agent, Seven Islands, Que.,\n\nIt is noted from your letter of the 23rd instant, that Inspector Thibault has full information regarding the arrangements that can be made for opening a school at Seven Islands. I will discuss this matter with Inspector Thibault when he returns to the Department and I will write you again.\n\nRegarding the Chief's daughter, no definite promise was made to him that we would send this girl to the convent at Riviere du Loup this year. He was simply told to speak to you and have you write this office. As it is noted from your letter that she has not yet attended school, the Department feels that there would be no advantage in sending her to another school when the school on the Reserve is opened that she can attend. If she makes reasonable progress we can consider later the advisability of sending her to the Convent.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nM.

There is no semblance of school yet. I should like to know whether it is impossible for the Department to find female teacher as Mgr. Labrie has already offered me one at least.\"\n\nThe Department does not understand the above statement in view of the communications that have already been sent to you.\n\nI again direct your attention to the following:\n\n(1) Official letter of August 11th, 1947, authorizing the appointment of Miss Geraldine Methot as teacher of the Seven Islands School. We enclosed the necessary forms for her to complete and return. We have not yet received these forms.\n\n(2) Official letter of August 30th, 1947, authorizing the opening of Mosie School and the employment of the teacher recommended by His Excellency, Bishop Labrie.\n\nEnclosed are copies of both letters mentioned above and I would appreciate it if you would arrange to have these schools opened immediately, if you have not already done so.

This could be explained by the increase of number of families which were unable to go hunting this year on account of the scarcity of furbearing animals and the low price of fur.\n\n(3) All the pupils seem to enjoy going to school and we notice already a great improvement in their good manners and their language.\n\n(4) Most of the pupils could not speak French at the beginning and the teachers were having a hard time. But now there is a big difference. Many of them can read French, count # and draw.\n\n(5) Our class rooms are too small for having the pupils all at the same time. Consequently the teachers take the boys in the morning and the girls during the afternoon. I hope that the Department will decide to build a school soon and big enough for 4 class rooms.\nD\u00e9partement indien\nChambre d'Attaque\n\nNous sommes les m\u00eames\nindiens qui nous parlent pour notre\nr\u00e9serve Sept-\u00celes.

Neary\n\nLast year our Department was kind enough to open two classes for Indian children; one at Moisie and the other one at Seven Islands. The Indians have approved such initiative and are thankful to you.\n\nNow, for the coming academic year 1948-49 a major problem is presented to us. Due to high attendance of children (56 at Moisie and 48 at Seven Islands) the school teachers were compelled to divide such a group in two, one again in the morning and the other in the afternoon. There's no difficulty or objection then as these pupils were in the same division, except one. Due to the progress of above pupils we are contrived this year to have another division.\n\nI would like to have your approval to add two (2) more classes this coming year as we must not delay the progress of students of last year and to prepare the young ones who are coming in the first grade this year.\n\nAs most of these youngsters, if not all of them, who will be coming in school for the first time, speak only the Indian language, we could pass these two new classes, one at Moisie and the other one at Seven Islands by two Indian girls who have had some kind of experience in teaching some previous years, one of them is Miss Helene Jourdain and the other Miss Annie Pinette but none of them have teacher's certificate. I would suggest a salary of $50.00 a month or $500.00 per annum for each one of them.\n\nIf such plan is accepted, it will give us space in our schools to allow Indian children from 6 to 15 years of age with these two extra classes.\n\nPlease kindly advise soon as possible.\n\nJ. M. Faure,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nSeven Islands, Que.\nMr. J.M. Pauze,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nSeven Islands, P.Q.\n\nWe have your letter of the 27th ultimo recommending that provision be made for two additional class rooms - one at the Seven Islands Day School and the other at the Moisie Day School.\n\nI enclose two of our regular application forms which you should have completed by Miss Helen Jourdain and Miss Annie Pinette. As soon as these forms are received, further consideration will be given to your recommendation.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nSeptember 8, 1948.\n\nMr. J.M. Pauze, Supt. of Indian Agency,\nSeven Islands, P.Q.,\n\nSeven Islands Indian Day School\nMoisie Indian Day School.\n\nI have had an opportunity of discussing thoroughly with Mr. Gendron the situation at both these schools. He has concurred in your recommendation that each school be converted to a two room institution. This will mean a teaching staff as follows:\n\n(a) Moisie Indian Day School - Miss A. Giasson and either Miss Jourdain or Miss Pinette\n\n(b) Seven Islands Indian Day School - Miss C. Cormier and either Miss Jourdain or Miss Pinette\n\nThe Department is prepared to accept your recommendation to hire Miss Jourdain and Miss Pinette at a salary of $50. per month. It would be appreciated if you would have both these teachers complete the attached Employee Questionnaire and Income Tax forms so that they can be taken on our pay roll. You should also indicate the school to which they will be assigned and the date upon which they assumed their duties.\nThere are a few other matters which you will have to consider:\n\n**Blackboards:** Please find attached a self-explanatory letter indicating the shortage of blackboard and the action which you can take to remedy this situation. In view of the isolated situation, we are ordering this blackboard paint for you and it should reach you in the near future.\n\n**Fuel Supply:**\n\nAn accountable advance of $200. is being sent to you in order that you may immediately procure a supply of fuel for both these schools.\n\n**Repairs:**\n\nIt is understood that minor repairs are required at both schools and an accountable advance of $200. is being sent to you in order that this work may be carried out as soon as possible.\n\n**School Supplies:**\n\nMiss Cormier and Miss Giasson are to be the Senior teachers at these schools and it will be their responsibility to requisition for school supplies as required. They will find in the June 1947 issue of the Teachers' Magazine, the School Bulletin, a list of the supplies provided by the Department. We also provide textbooks as authorized for use in the Province of Quebec. We are also sending school registers and monthly report forms for use in these schools.\n\n---\n\nBernard F.

We have one who is Canadian but it is their wish to appoint an Indian who is not a graduate. We spoke about this matter to the agent. All the mothers are against the appointment of a new teacher. They did not speak about this before now. The chief has gone away. The mothers want their children to get a good education.

Her duty would be to teach French to Indian children who have no knowledge at all of the French language, and I presently consider this young girl to be unable to speak French fluently and correctly.\n\nAlso we will have to reconsider the opening of a new classroom at Moisie for the time being as there are only 30 children in the school presently. Nevertheless I would like to keep the possibility to open a second classroom with an Indian school-teacher at Moisie around the first two weeks of January, about the time when most of these Indians will be back from the bush as it did happen last winter when we had approximately 60 children. Presently I am trying to find the second teacher for the Moisie Day School for this coming term. You will forward the regular application forms so as not to cause too much delay in starting this second classroom when the Indians will be back from the bush. It is understood that this application will be withheld until such time the Indian children will make themselves available.\n\nJ. M. Pauze,\nSupt.

I hope that you will be able to obtain the services of a second qualified teacher at Moisie.\n\nAs you are probably aware, our day school teachers' salaries are considerably higher than those paid to teachers in the provincial schools. Therefore, we feel that we should be able to obtain the services of a well-qualified and experienced teacher at this school.\n\nWith this in mind, you should advise Miss Jourdain that her services are only on a temporary basis and that we intend to replace her with a qualified and experienced teacher when the services of such a teacher are available.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education:\n\nPlease be advised that Miss Helene Jourdain has categorically refused to carry on as a school teacher. Her last day of work March 3rd, 1949.\n\nLast Thursday afternoon I sent in to our Seven Islands Indian Day School three young Indian children whose family from what I gathered was not liked or in good terms with the said Miss Helene Jourdain and her family - so she thought best to refuse them. Furthermore I would point out that the principal Miss C. Cornier accepted the said children and sent them over to her or in the division where they belong in Miss Helene Jourdain's classroom. Even though she was ordered to take them in her division she categorically refused to have anything to do with them. As there was no other alternative and on account of her stubbornness I had to dismiss and replace her and this with the approval of our Indian Chief Mr. Mathieu Andre and a Councillor Mr. Wallace Regis, who helped me to find another school-teacher.\n\nPlease find attached Mrs Marie-Anne Noel's application for employment as a school teacher to replace the said Helene Jourdain. Kindly note that Mrs Noel is holding an Elementary School Teacher's Diploma, dated August 1st, 1927. Mrs Noel being available, she started her school teaching in the morning on March 8th, 1949. It is understood that Mrs Noel is not interested and will not accept the same salary of $51.00 a month as previously given to Miss Helene Jourdain. It is understood that she will be employed on a temporary basis.\nWhen we had Miss Helene Jourdain as a school teacher I received quite a few complaints from Indians for having given to them an \"Indian teacher without a diploma\". Now that we are giving to them a graduate school teacher there are approximately eleven children whose parents refuse to send them to school. Nevertheless it is remarkable that the 4 or 5 families opposed to our new school teacher are political friends (Jules Sioui) of the Jourdain, Vachon and Thrinish Families. The children mentioned above are going to attend a private school directed by the said Helene Jourdain. I cannot tolerate such schism or misunderstanding in our school at Seven Islands, I am going with your approval to cut off their family allowances cheques.\n\nJ. M.

We are agreed that we should accept the resignation of Miss Helene Jourdain. This means that another teacher will have to be employed and I note that you have interested Mrs. Marie Noel. As she holds the equivalent of a second class teaching certificate and has had four years of experience, she would be entitled to a starting salary of $168.00 a teaching month. If she is only teaching part time, her salary would be lower in proportion to the amount of time spent in teaching duties.\n\nYou will recall the telegram which I sent you on March 10. This was as a result of a telegram received here on March 9 from Mrs. Pierre Vachon, reading as follows:\n\n\"We have lost our good teacher who had taught our children for eleven years. Our new Agent, Mr. Pauze is having her replaced by Mrs. Johnny Noel. The latter already made one bad break by hurting a child. The Priest considered that she should never teach thereafter.

She left because she would not accept pupils from outside the Reserve, which would have spoiled the classes of our children; the children of Mr. Francisse Pinette, a settler of Baie des Sept-\u00celes, who now resides at Sept \u00celes outside the Reserve. The Indians asked politely to Mr. Pauz\u00e9, the Agent, to refuse to accept these children who are not on the Reserve, so the classes would not be disturbed before the end of the year. Mr. Pauz\u00e9 did not agree. We also asked him to wait for the visit of the Inspector of Indians, this summer, so he could discuss with him the question of that family who never resided on the Reserve, but he positively refused.\n\nMiss H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Jourdain who was unwilling to accept the children of Mr. Pinette left her class, to avoid having trouble with these children, and Mr. Pauz\u00e9 asked Mrs. Johnny Noel to replace Miss H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Jourdain. The Indians do not like to send their children to Mrs. Johnny Noel, they prefer to send them to Miss H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Jourdain. The latter has a private school at her home and has 12 pupils.\n\nIs it fair to disturb our class in that way for the sake of disturbing intruders, and we ask you to treat us with justice.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I am,\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.)

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education:\n\nSeven Islands Indian-Day School,\nFile: 332-1 (E) March 21, 1949.\n\nAs requested in your last letter, I wish to inform you that Mrs Marie Anne Noel is a full time teacher. She is teaching from 09:00 A.M. till 11:30 A.M. and from 01:00 P.M. till 04:00 P.M.\n\nBefore discussing the content of Mrs Pierre Vachon's telegram I wish to inform you that she is a well known troublemaker, she has been that way for years and will always be looking for trouble.\n\nAs for the content of the telegram I wish to advise that Mrs Pierre Vachon is trying to avenge herself of an old feud against Mrs Noel and Mrs Noel's mother (all Indian women). Referring to some old records I found out that Mrs Pierre Vachon was arraigned in court on October 26, 1931 for having stolen from Mrs Noel's mother a kettle and a half moose skin, and was found guilty by the Justice of the Peace Dr. J.H. Lavallee, ex-Indian Agent. This same year Mrs Noel was teaching school and a daughter of Mrs Pierre Vachon happened to be one of her pupils. Apparently the said pupil attacked Mrs Noel in school with a heavy wooden pencil box. No need to tell you that the school teacher Mrs Noel tried to take that pencil box off the assailant's hands. While they were both pulling on the wooden pencil box it slipped off the school teacher's hands and the pupil struck herself on the arm and made a king of a bruise, it was also reported to me that in striking some muscles her arm was swollen the next day. This was the only time Mrs Noel had anything that went wrong with her pupils and most likely what Mrs Vachon is referring in her telegram when he states: THE\nLATTER (Mrs Noel) ALREADY MADE ONE BAD BREAK BY HURTING A (should have been \"her\") CHILD.\n\n2.- \"WE HAVE LOST OUR GOOD TEACHER WHO HAD TAUGHT OUR CHILDREN FOR ELEVEN YEARS.\" From what I gathered if we take off from that eleven years the days she was sick and the days when she did not feel like teaching her full time teaching would be worth about 4 or 5 years.\n\n3.- As for the part: \"THE PRIEST CONSIDERED THAT SHE SHOULD NEVER TEACH THEREAFTER...\", I doubt very much such statement as Mrs Noel went on teaching till the end of the school year. Furthermore I cannot find in our records a report or a judicial record against Mrs Noel. Unhappily the Priest in question left Seven Islands 15 or 16 years ago.\n\n4.- MORE THAN HALF THE CHILDREN HAVE QUIT ATTENDING...\"\n\nA wrong statement again approximately 1/3 of Miss Helen Jourdain's pupils and approximately 1/6 of the of the Seven Islands Indian Day School attendance have left the school.\n\nReferring to Family Allowance problem I regret to inform you that I reported to the Regional Director of Family Allowances the children mentioned in my letter of March 9, 1949. I waited till March 19, 1949, to hear from you but unhappily your letter reached me on March 25, 1949. The reason is that I had to set them an example (cancellation of their Family Allowances cheques for April) so as to counteract a certain propaganda started by them, the last two weeks, to get some of our pupils out of Mrs Noel's division, so as to enlist more pupils in Miss Jourdain's private course, who by the way is teaching only two (2) hours per day which is far from being efficient. We cannot let them win their points it would be too bad for the future of our school teachers and of our schools of Moisie and Seven Islands.\n\nJ. M.

In view of the animosity which exists at Seven Islands against this teacher, do you feel that we should advertise for another teacher in Quebec City? Our salaries are higher than those offered in provincial schools and I feel that by bringing in an outside teacher we may overcome the problems now existing concerning Mrs. Vachon, Miss Jourdain, etc. In any event, we are only adding Mrs. Noel to our salary roll until the end of June and you should advise her that the Department does not consider hers a permanent appointment, but that further consideration is being given to the appointment of another teacher.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nEnforcement of the Indian Act (Sec. 10)\nSeven Islands Reserve.\n\n1. Following a series of events which brought about the dismissal of Miss Helene JOURDAIN (Indian) as school teacher at the local Indian school on March 3rd, 1945 several Indian parents whose children were in Miss JOURDAIN's class, withdrew their children from the Indian school and sent them to a private school opened by Miss JOURDAIN. The reason for this was that these Indians objected to Miss JOURDAIN's substitute, Mrs. Johnny NOEL (Indian).\n\n2. Mr. M. PAUSE, superintendent of the Seven Islands Indian Agency made every effort to deal with the matter as tactfully as possible and have the parents send their children to the Indian Day-Time School; and in the light of the continuous refusal he reported these children as being absent from school to the Family Allowances Board in Quebec City who in turn deprived the parents of the Family Allowances for these children, 12 altogether. Furthermore, Mr. Pause has requested the assistance of the undersigned to enforce Sec. 10 of the Indian Act.\n\n3. Miss JOURDAIN though she has been teaching on and off for the past 12 years for the Dept. of Indian Affairs, is not a qualified teacher, whilst Mrs. Noel on the other hand possesses the proper qualifications. Furthermore Miss JOURDAIN only teaches from 1.00 p.m. to 2.30 p.m. and from 3.45 p.m. to 5.45 p.m., whilst the Indians attending the Indian Day-Time School have to go to school from 8.00 a.m. to 12.00 noon and from 1.30 p.m. to 4.00 p.m. As a result of the difference in school hours, the children from the Indian school are frequently tempted not to go to school in the forenoon.\n\n4. The writer concurs with the Indian Agent and Indian Chief's opinion that the idea of the private school has an ill-effect on Indians of the Seven Islands Reserve. Furthermore, since Miss JOURDAIN was considered an incompetent teacher and showed a definite lack of knowledge of the French language (which is taught at the Indian School) it is felt that some action should be taken to prevent her from teaching at a private school. It may also be pointed out that Miss JOURDAIN and the parents do favour her teaching, are all followers of SIOUX and do not hesitate to cause dissension amongst Indians whenever possible.\n\n5. The writer is of the opinion that a strict application of Sec. 10, as 3 & 4, upon children and parents who support Miss JOURDAIN would prove satisfactory. Your further instructions in this connection will be awaited.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS AWAITED.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Miss Helen JOURDAIN of Seven Islands was dismissed as a School Teacher from the local Indian School on March 3rd 1949. In sympathy with her dismissal, several Indian families are sending their children to her private school where she teaches daily between the hours of 1.00 p.m. to 2.30 p.m. and 2.45 p.m. to 3.45 p.m. The Indian agent has requested the assistance of a member of this Force to enforce section 10 of the Indian Act.

Miss Helene Jourdain of Seven Islands, who was dismissed as teacher from the Indian School there on March 3, 1949, is now teaching privately on the Reserve, which is obviously having an ill-effect on the local Indians.\n\n3. It would seem that this situation could be fully met by enforcing the provisions of Section 10(4) of the Indian Act against the parents of those Indian children who have discontinued attendance at the Seven Islands Reserve Indian School.\n\n4.

She reports however on a matter which calls for some action on the part of the office. He states that there are a good many children attending the school who do not belong to it, that they come from the townships of Craig & that some are white cross from part Indians. He says they have their own school where they can attend also that they do not attend the Indians' School. I am unable to tell the number of Indian children attending at the school as the new teacher has not returned to office. Mr. Miller does not give the number of outside children attending but if he does it will be necessary to take steps to prevent them from attending.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nTo Department of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa, 189\u2014\n\nTeachers can teach the Indians in addition to the Indian children without any detriment to the latter. I think they ought be allowed to attend by paying say 50 cents per month. Before anything further is done in the matter however I would recommend that Mr. Miller be requested to give the names of the outside children attending, and also their reason for attending the Indian School in preference to their own school. And in the event of their being attended by the DIAH to attend the school whether the teacher cared to teach them without any loss to the Indian children.\n\nJohn M[il]ler\n\nIndian Affairs.

The teacher, Miss Legge, appears to have the confidence of pupils and parents, and from what I saw she deserves it.\n\nThe school was to close during the week, as teacher's term had expired.

H. Morcom brought a sentimental letter to me which assured him that he might send his children to the Indian School here provided he paid a fee of $50 each. I was not aware of any child being there without the consent of their parents.\n\nBelieving them children to be all that could be desired, I received and did my duty by them. One day, however, I found these children to be exceptionally mischievous. In spite of the rules of discipline caused no little annoyance in the dormitory. I learned that they had repeatedly wounded the feelings of the Indian pupils by shaming them of their language. Notwithstanding all this, I would have done all in my power to oblige all such indigent families if not for the objections made by some of the people of the league to the effect that if these white children continued to attend the school they would take away their children.\n\nWhen being addressed to this immediately informed Mr. Morcom that I could not allow his children at school. For reasons stated begged of me to take them back but declined, stating that as I was employed by...\nthe Indians. Whatever I may have found to weigh cautiously the claims of the common cause. I trust you may have given you a clear explanation. If not, I am at your service to answer any questions you may wish to put to me regarding the matter.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTeacher.\nMEMO.\n\nOttawa, March 30th, 1895\n\nHER ref 196679, 196667\n\nIndian Affairs.

If you think the salary high, I think she will be willing to accept $275 per year instead of $300 but I must say $300 is not too much to give her as the work is hard and she does it well.

His veracity is not to be depended upon at all times, in proof of this assertion I may state, that he made a statement on March 27th in Quebec from the altar, with the intention of damaging my character as an honest man, which he had to retract on April 22nd in the same place.\n\nI can say positively that the pupils are not progressing favorably under Miss Lege's tuition, in fact only one of the most advanced, after much hesitation, could name the Capital of Canada, on March 5th when the pupils\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The priest must be aware that Miss Legge's eyesight is poor, for she has to wear spectacles quite frequently.\n\nAs for the great sacrifice that Miss Legge has made for the pupils, the only sacrifice that she has made, that I know anything about, is her reputation for truthfulness. She has made false returns of the attendance of pupils, also of the number of days that she has taught; if you will look over the returns I have sent down, you will see that the attendance on the day of my visit is very much below the average that she gives.\n\nMiss Legge has known since Jan. that several of the kids were not satisfied with her as a teacher, they made complaints to me and I told her so. The parents of several families do not send their children and will not done, they say it is worse as they do not learn.\n\nI did not inform Miss Legge that her dismissal was an account of her defective eyesight.\n\nMiss Legge would not be engaged a second term in any country school that I have ever attended.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nAdam Burwash\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOTTAWA, 21st June, 1900\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo with reference to the decision of the Department to dispense with your services as teacher of the Temiscamingue school from the 30th instant; and in reply I beg to say that upon further consideration of this matter, the Department regrets that it cannot alter its decision.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

Also the Sisters are usually skilled in medicine. Their advice would be of value to us, whether cases in sickness were serious or not.\n\nSecondly: We have strong reasons for wishing a change in our school, as there has been a very small attendance of our children for some time and I believe there is good reasons for it,-in fact too many reasons to mention in writing.\n\nx x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\n\nJohn King,\nChief.\n\nI may add that Mr A.Burwash, our Agent can testify to any statements made by me in this letter.\nOTTAWA, 26th February, 1904\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nThe teacher of the North Temiscamingue school having resigned on account of ill-health, the school is now closed pending the appointment of a successor. Mr Agent Burwash was asked to report as to the prospect of obtaining a teacher in the neighborhood, but it will take some time before his reply can be received. In the meantime, the Chief of the Band writes stating that it is their wish to have the school placed in charge of the Grey Nuns. These Indians are all Roman Catholics and I have no doubt the Church authorities would much rather have the Nuns placed in charge of the school. It is a difficult matter to secure the services of a suitable teacher for this locality but before deciding I think it would be well to ask the Agent for a report in this matter.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Macrae, from North Temiscamingue, dated 16th March, 1904.\n\nThe very day I posted my last letter to you I was surprised afterwards to hear that the school teacher had left here without giving any notice neither to the Chief nor to the Indian Agent. Different cases of liquor had taken place on the reserve a few days before, and I do not know but he might have been afraid to have been suspected of something I told you last summer. Anyway he is gone and the children have no school. He went out for illness.\nSir,\n\nYour favor of the 1st March has been received.\n\nRespecting the proposal to place the Seminawamique Indian School under the care of the Grey Nuns I beg to say that the school at Villa St. Anne has been under the care of the Grey Nuns now for some years and they are, I believe, giving very good satisfaction to the people there. It is very probable that the Nuns would do equally well here. The teachers that have been teaching here did better for the first year or so than they did the last while that they taught. Probably the cause of that may have been the Indian children are not very bright and I am inclined to think the teachers became discouraged.\n\nI think it would be well to give the Nuns a trial for a time. I think their influence would be good, and they might succeed better than their predecessors. The Band at the present time is very eager to have the Grey Nuns here as teachers and nurses for their sick.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nAdam Burwash\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs.

He says there is a family of a half-breed whose brothers are all members of the band, whilst he himself is not admitted, and that he has a good many children and cannot get them schooling without paying for them.\n\nThe Department would like to know whether there is a white school where these children could attend, and, if not, whether their being admitted to the Indian school would interfere with the education of the children of the band, and, if possible, you should ascertain the circumstances of the half-breed referred to, whose name is not given, and report thereon and advise us to this application.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

Half breed children although not members of the band have never been excluded from the Indian school, some have been attending all along. The band did ask twenty-five cents per month for each child that attended school, if the parents that could afford it, to help pay for firewood and keep the school clean and in repair, but none ever responded, but the children were not stopped from attending school. The party referred to in Rev. Luther King's letter is Robert King, he is a brother of the present chief.

Not being able to walk such a distance on work days, as well as during the winter months, I have to pay $50.00 a year to get someone to drive me. This reduces the salary to $250.00 which is barely enough to live at the high prices everything is selling up here. For nearly two years I have tried it but lately I have been informed by my Superior that if the Department could not raise the salary of at least $50.00 it would be very hard on our Order to continue teaching the Indians.\n\nBut I do hope the Department will understand the justice of my appeal, and grant my humble request.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nSr. Mary Anne, of the Sisters of the Sacred Heart.\nOttawa, October 12th, 1909.\n\nMadam,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 6th instant asking for an increase of $50.00 in your salary to cover the cost of your transport to and from the North Temiskaming School I beg to say that the department will grant you this increase on the understanding that it will not be called upon for any further contribution in this connection. This arrangement will begin from the first of October instant. Your salary from that date will be at the rate of $350.00 per annum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Renaud, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorth Temiskaming, Que.\nOttawa, November 18, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that I have recently visited the Indian day school on North Temiscaming Reserve.\n\nThis school is at present in charge of the Rev. Sister Monica. In many ways, worthy of mention, the school impressed me very favourably. The pupils were all clean and the order kept was good. The attendance was fair. School supplies etc., are kept in very good condition and the building itself was clean.\n\nI heard two of the classes, one in arithmetic and another in reading and dictation. I also examined the work done at the desks. Some of the work was very creditable but of course I am not in a position to give any opinion as to progress. What I saw might have been taught and learned by the pupils, this year or last year. The class in arithmetic was of the younger pupils and while I may not be competent to express an opinion as to teaching methods, not being a school inspector, Sister Monica's method with the class in arithmetic certainly struck me as being far from practical.\n\nI noticed that she spoke with a distinct French accent, if the term may be used, and did not appear to readily understand.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent,\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nunderstand some questions I asked her. A lack of pronunciation of the Rs was particularly noticeable. For her own purposes, however, she has quite good command of English; that is for conversational purposes. If asked to express an opinion as to her suitability for teaching English I would from my own viewpoint put it this way:- Reversing conditions; if I were studying French I would certainly want one whose pronunciation of French was better than her pronunciation of English. This may be a somewhat indirect method of arriving at a conclusion and yet it is to me the only standpoint from which I could express an opinion having in mind my lack of qualification as a school inspector.\n\nI noticed that the stove in the school building is old and badly cracked and standing on the bare, dry, soft wood floor. I advised the agent to ask permission to purchase a new stove and a zinc floor tray on which to stand it. The present outfit is a fire menace.\n\nI would also suggest that the building will require painting inside, next spring and that a lighter color be used on the walls and ceiling.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nSchools Branch -\n\nThe Deputy Minister has decided that Sister Monica, teacher of the Timiskaming school, may be retained in her position until such time at least as the Separate School Inspector has had an opportunity of making another inspection and report.\n\nMr. Finn should be communicated with and informed that it is the wish of the Department to have a competent teacher at this school, and he should be asked to make a thorough inspection on his next visit. Mr. Agent Renaud should also be written to and instructed to inform Sister Monica that if she wishes to retain her position as teacher of this school, she must try to perfect her English in order that there may be no complaints as to the instruction received.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.
