GOODFELLOW.\n\nPrince Albert, N. Y.\nThe annual meeting of the above Society was held at Oram's Restaurant on Wednesday last. Owing to the cold and stormy weather, the attendance was not so good as it would have been otherwise. Mr. W. Miller, sen., President, was in the chair.\n\nThe President delivered a very interesting address, reviewing the progress of the Society during the past year. He then called upon the Sec.-Treasurer to read his report, the same showing the finances of the Society in a very healthy state, carrying over a nice balance.\n\nThe adoption of the report was moved by Capt. Hoey, seconded by W. Miller, jr., and unanimously carried.\n\nThe next order of business was the election of officers.\n\nW. Miller, sen., was unanimously re-elected President.\n\nAnd Spence, 1st Vice-President.\n\nCapt. Hoey, and Vice-President.\n\nA. H.

Stewart.\n\nAfter the election of officers, the following matters of importance passed:\n\nMoved by Capt. Hoey, seconded by Mr. Van Luven, that a special vote of thanks be tendered to Mr. Hughes, M.M.W.C., for his attention to the Society's interests both in the Council and otherwise, and that the same be engrossed on the minutes. Carried unanimously.\n\nMr. Hughes, in a suitable and happy reply, stated that he had met with some trouble in obtaining any back grant from the Board, as the last attempt, made during the Rebellion, had not drawn the amount appropriated to the District of Lorne, and which had in consequence reverted to the general fund. He urged the members to be on the watch for new members, as the grant next year would probably be pro rata. After explaining the action of the Council with regard to several matters interesting to the Society, he closed (applause) by wishing the Society every success and thanking the members for their cordial vote of thanks.\n\nA vote of thanks was unanimously tendered Mr. Macdonald, Mr. Pearson and Macdonald, the retiring Presidents, and was suitably replied to by those present. The Directors and members of friends who had donated so liberally to the funds of the Society for the consideration of which they had expended them during the past year.\n\nMoved by J. Stewart, seconded by J. Macdonald, that special thanks of the Society be accorded to A. H. Clark, secretary treasurer, for his valuable services during the past year, and that the same be engrossed with minutes.\n\nMr. Clark replied suitably, replying to the members and contributors for the pleasant manner in which he had been used in them during the past year.\n\nMoved by J. Stewart, seconded by W. Miller, jr., that the next grand council be held early in March.\n\nA meeting of the directors will be held early in March, to enable them to have the grand lists made out and distributed by May.\n\nFor meetings adjourned.\nTHE PRINCE ALBERT TIMES\nAND SASKATCHEWAN REVIEW\n\nJ.

In view of this, many school districts held their elections under the Ordinance of 1883, and can now get no magistrate to legalize their action according to that Ordinance. Some have only formally signed up their commissions, but in the absence of any authority to swear them in under the new regulations, could not act, and Mr. Hughes\u2014who was sworn in at Regina\u2014could not do so as his commission had not come to hand.\n\nIt is announced that a baronetcy has been conferred on Mr. George Stephen, president of the Canadian Pacific Railroad. The honor is well deserved. Mr. Stephen has from the first had firm and unflinching confidence in the future, and he has done so much to hasten its realization, and consequently in the future of the country through which it runs. Rewards of this kind are usually given for distinguished services to one's country, and certainly from this standpoint, Mr. Stephen is deserving of the honor conferred upon him.\n\nC. A. Paterson has been gazetted Brigade Major of the 5th District. He was in the North West during the rebellion.\n\nCONGREGATIONAL MEETING\n\nThe annual meeting of St. Paul's Presbyterian Church was held last Wednesday evening. Rev. Mr. Macmillan, LL.B., presided. Owing to the severity of the weather, the attendance was only fair. One notable feature, however, was the presence of the ladies. The minutes of the previous annual meeting were read and adopted. Mr. McTaggart was appointed Congregational Secretary in place of Mr. Napier. The treasurer's annual report was read and adopted, showing a good surplus carried forward. Messrs. A. H. Clark, F. C. Baker, J. Campbell, J. F. Knowles, R. Dick, and Mr. McTaggart were elected managers. It was decided to increase the number of elders. The question of allowing the Ladies' Aid Society to hold a Burnt Quarter service in the church was earnestly discussed, but owing to the hostile feeling of a few towards it, the committee declined to make the application. A vote of thanks was tendered by Mr. A. H. Clark and unanimously carried, to the organist and choir for the very kind and efficient manner in which they have attended to their duties during the past year. The meeting then adjourned.\n\nMaj. Bell's claim for transport has been valued at $1,000 without $100. This does not include his private claims, which are large.\n\nCURLIANA\n\nSeveral very interesting games of curling have been played recently, some of which follow are the scores:\n\nPRESIDENT V.
