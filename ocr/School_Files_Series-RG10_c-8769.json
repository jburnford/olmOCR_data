C.\nTowards the latter end of the month the case of Peter Johnson, age 6 - under Doctor's supervision over six months for sending to the Le Jack Industrial school to join his brother and sister there - was again taken up. Dr. Roth was now able to pass the child and therefore the necessary steps were taken to complete this desired end. Le Jack school was wired for acceptance, which was granted, and the necessary warrants and papers made out. A report on this school admittance case has also been submitted under separate cover. This action frees his father Davey Johnson, who since his wife died seems to have lost all energy to exist and was not capable of looking after his small and very decent son. Davey has now been told to get out of town and earn some revenue by trapping on this registered trap grounds and is granted no assistance.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nNORTHERN AIRWAYS LTD.\n\nRoyal Mail Service\n\nCARCROSS TO ATLIN AND TELEGRAPH CREEK\n\nCarcross, Y.T.

This condition will probably continue until the end of the current school year. But, since we have been so far unsuccessful in obtaining an increase in pupilage, and have been deprived of three supernumerary pupils in reprisal for having tried to obtain an increase, we shall have to reduce the number of children next year.\n\nIt seems to us that the easiest way is to raise the entrance age from 7 years to 8. Thus, we will not accept any new pupils next fall, and thereby bring the number of children down to about 165.\n\nMORALE.\n\nThe children seem to be quite happy and contented. So, far we have not had a single runaway this year. The only real trouble we have is with three children who were committed to my care by the Juvenile Court. I accepted them in order to save them the alternative of being sent to the Reformatory.\n\nHEALTH.\n\nWe have been singularly fortunate in this regard, and have had very little sickness of any kind. One girl had to be sent to Kamloops for eye treatment, one boy broke his leg, and another had an infected hand.\n\nThere is now a doctor at Fraser Lake who acts as Medical Officer for the School. We have not had an emergency for him as yet; but I must confess that I am not particularly impressed by him, and have not a great deal of confidence in him.\n\nLIVESTOCK.\n\nThe farm animals are all doing well, and we look forward to a substantial increase in the number of cattle and sheep this spring. We have now about 60 pigs in the new piggery. Due to a small fire we lost about 250 hens by suffocation. This loss was mitigated by the fact that they were the oldest birds and the decrease in egg prices.\n\nCROPS.\n\nPreparations are already being made for the coming season. Most of the seed is already in hand; and there are about 10 acres more of newly broken land to be brought into cultivation this spring.\n\nRev. Alex. R.

Please let me know if it is the intention of the Principal to discharge this girl at the end of June, 1940.\n\nTwenty-one days' grant was deducted from Stephen Jaal, No. 383, as the Department paid for his maintenance in hospital for the period January 13 to February 3. Please point out to the Principal that when a pupil is placed in a hospital per capita grant should not be requested as the Department is obliged to pay for the pupil's maintenance in hospital.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. Robt.

Her sister is an undesirable character, and her Brother does not want her. So, in my estimation, it is for the best interest of this girl that she remain in school, until I can find a suitable place for her.\n\nAs regards the twenty-one days' grant deducted from Stephen Jael. I did not deduct this period, as I usually do, because of the fact that I have 164 pupils, and am only receiving the grant for 160, I thought that it did not make any appreciable difference. Therefore, I was not asking for the per capita grant for this boy for the time that he was in the hospital, since it does not affect the average attendance in point of view of the grant.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

You should so inform the Principal and co-operate with him in arranging to have the parents transport the children without cost.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. Robt.

A.R. Simpson, O.M.I., Principal of the School.\n\nThe return shows $7919-45 on Capitation. I trust that a cheque will be forwarded in care of the Canadian Bank of Commerce at Vanderhoof B.C. as requested by the Rev. Principal.\n\nA general report from the Principal is also attached. I trust that these will be found satisfactory and in order.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nRobert Howe\nIndian Agent.\n\nL-\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nEnclosures.\nDear Sir:\n\nI would like to have Mary Magdalene Pierre, age 11 years and Bertha, age 9 years, orphans of the Fort Grahame Band admitted to the Lejac Indian Residential School. These orphans now reside with Isadore Joe North at Tekla Landing Indian Reserve. I visited this family recently and would report the home is indescribably filthy and positively unfit for youngsters to live in. Miss Finan the teacher at Tekla Landing Seasonal School states the girls are quite bright and anxious to go to the Residential School and get away from their present surroundings.\n\nThe Rev. Principal has a full quota of pupils for the coming school year, but he is willing to accept the two girls providing they can be admitted as supernumerary covered by grant and their transportation paid from Takla Landing to Vanderhoof. Transportation costs would amount to approximately $12.00 each. Both girls have been medically examined; Bertha has a huge goitre which should be attended to otherwise their health is satisfactory.\n\nI am convinced the best place for these orphans is in the Residential School and would recommend, if possible, that the school grant be increased to cover maintenance and the expenditure authorised for their transportation to school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRobert Howe,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 30th, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant, with reference to two orphan children of the Fort Graham Band whom you consider require institutional care.\n\nOwing to the reduction in our Appropriation for tuition grants, it is not possible to allow payment for supernumeraries during the current fiscal year. The two children whom you mention appear to be very deserving cases and it is felt that the Principal of the Lejac School should make some arrangements to accept them even though supernumerary grant is not allowed. It is quite possible that there are a number of children in the school who could be discharged and in this manner vacancies would be created for those actually in need.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. Robt. Howe,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\nVanderhoof, B.C., October 2nd, 1940.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT ON STUART LAKE AGENCY FOR SEPTEMBER\n\nLEJAC INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nSchool commenced on the 3rd instant. The Rev. Principal reported 54 absentees on the 16th; an unusually large number. I regret that it was necessary to call Corpl. Fielder of the local Detachment of R.C.M.P. Police to round up the truants. To date 25 truants have been returned to school and it is expected the remainder will be in school shortly. The Indians offer a number of excuses for failing to return their children to school, but I think the chief reason is that the Principal inadvertently and unbeknown to this office advertised through the missionaries that the pupilage would be reduced from 200 last year to 150 for this year.\n\nThe Department under letter No. Cir-502-1000 May 22nd, 1940 advised that a reduction in the School Grant was necessary and that there would be no objections to reducing the pupilage to conform with the grant.\n\nI feel sure the Indians took advantage of this statement as an excuse to keep their children at home. It would have been better policy to keep silent about the reduction until after the opening of school and then weeded out a number to conform with the pupilage desired.\n\nRobt. Howe,\nIndian Agent.\nAt the request of the local Ind.Agent R. Howe, Esq., I patrolled to the a/m points for the purpose of checking Indian Absentee School Children, arranging for their transportation to Lejac School and other matters pertaining to his branch of service.\n\nOn Sunday, Sept. 22nd, 1940, driving Pol.Car. Code #2543, I left Vanderhoof and patrolled to Stoney Creek & Laketown Ind.Reserves, collected three children and drove them to Lejac Ind.School returning to Vanderhoof at 9 P.m., on the same day.\n\nOn Sept. 23rd, I travelled to Ft. St.James per Pol.Car and continued through to Tachie and Portage Reserves located at the north end of Stewart Lake, B.C. The patrol up the Lake was made by Ind.Dept.launch with Mr.G. Hamilton hired as Pilot and Guide. Sept. 23rd to Sept. 25th, was spent at Tachie and Portage Ind.Reserves interviewing parents of absentee children and making arrangements for the transportation.\n\nGasoline and Motor Oil issues were made to parents bringing their children to Ft. St.James and on the morning of Sept. 26th, I left Tachie together with (5) Indian motor boats bringing (10) school children from Tachie (5) from Portage and (4) from Trembleur Lake. Without untoward incident we all arrived at the Ft. at 11 A.m., the same day. I remained with the Children until 5.30 P.m. and turned them over to Father Simpson, O.M.I., on his arrival there with the necessary transport for the children to be taken to Lejac. Following this procedure I returned to Vanderhoof arriving at 8 P.m.\n\nIncluding three children collected at Ft. St.James Reserve a total of (25) have been returned to School today.\n\nIt is evident among these northern Indians that they care little or nothing about sending their children to school for several reasons verbally outlined by me to the local Ind.Agent who in turn has transmitted them to the Priest Father Simpson who holds the position of Principal at Lejac Indian School.\n\nFree transportation by boat was obtained. No crime was encountered during this patrol or Complaints of serious nature received. Copy of this report handed to the local Ind.Agent together with a list of Gasoline & Motor Oil issues to Indians, and a list of Twine and clothing issues to Indians.\n\nExpenses shown on Fm 93, Period Sept.15/30th, 1940.\n\nCpl.\nL.F.Fielder, Reg.#9521.\nI/c. Vanderhoof Det.\nOttawa,\nOctober 15, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department finds it necessary to return your voucher No. 15. In official letter of May 13 last you were advised that an amount of $70.00 would be allowed toward the transportation of children to and from the Lejac School. However, before payment of this amount can be made it will be necessary to forward receipts amounting to at least $70.00. The receipt attached to the enclosed voucher only amounts to $32.15.

We expect to receive a few more destitute children at the beginning of the new year.\n\nMorale.\nAll of the children are in very good spirits, and very little trouble has been experienced with them. So far, there has not been a single attempt to run away from school; every one of the children seems to be quite satisfied.\n\nMANUAL TRAINING.\nThis is proceeding along the customary lines; carpentry and farm instruction for the boys; and the usual household work for the girls, combined with instruction in spinning, carding, rug-making, dressmaking, and the making up of articles for the Red Cross.\n\nHEALTH.\nThe general health of the children is very good, and very few have had to stay in bed at all this quarter. The exceptions are four or five who have been suffering with acute tonsillitis; we are waiting for the doctor to make arrangements to have tonsillectomies performed on several of the children.\n\nLivestock.\nAll of the animals are in good shape, and the numbers remain about the same. Our herd of Holstein cattle is consistently maintaining the best record in the district for the production of butter fat and poundage of milk.\n\nRev. Alex. R.

Mallinson,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant with regard to Indian Agent Mallinson's interpretation of the Department's wishes regarding the admission of pupils to residential schools.\n\nThe statement made in the second paragraph of your letter is correct.\n\nAs regards Mr. Mallinson's reference to the Edmonton School the circumstances surrounding the admission of children to that school are entirely different from those affecting the Lejac Residential School.\n\nAs you have already advised Mr. Mallinson, it is not always possible to have a child medically examined before admission to a residential school. You may, therefore, inform him that the information contained in your letter to him of February 11 is correct.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to advise that there appears to be some confusion on the part of Mr. Indian Agent Mallinson in respect to his interpretation of the Department's wishes regarding the admission of pupils to residential schools insofar as the medical examination is concerned, and I enclose herewith a letter, dated the 29th ultimo, received from the Reverend Principal of Lejac Indian Residential School in this connection.\n\nI advised Mr. Mallinson on the 11th instant that it would not appear to make very much difference where the children were examined so long as the required medical certificate was completed by a doctor. Apparently he is of the opinion that no children should be moved from their reserves to the school until medically examined, a procedure that would be practically impossible in respect to children on reserves remote from a medical officer.\n\nIn the case in question, it was merely a case of the local missionary conveying the children to the school where facilities exist for their immediate examination and if it transpired that they were unfit, it would devolve upon the missionary to return them home. I enclose copy of Mr. Mallinson's letter of the 14th instant quoting your instructions in respect to admissions to the Edmonton school which is entirely another matter, owing to the expense that would be involved in conveying children from this province to Alberta with consequent risk of refusal for admission on medical grounds.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nI have no knowledge of the admission of a pupil of the Moricetown Indian Day School to Lejac Residential School as set out in the penultimate paragraph of Mr. Mallinson's letter, but presume it was approved by the Department.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nGR\nJanuary 29th, 1941.\n\nC.H. Barry, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Barry:\n\nWill you kindly give us a ruling on the following question, and thereby clear up another of our difficulties with Indian Agent Mallinson?\n\nWhen new children wish to enter the school, they are brought here by the principal or his agents. Upon arrival here they are examined by the school doctor, the \"Application for Admission\" forms are filled out, sent back to the camp for the parents' signature, and then these forms are sent to the Indian agent concerned for his signature and forwarding to Ottawa.\n\nSuch is the modus operandi used here for the admission of new pupils; and, I believe, in other schools as well. If the medical examination had to be carried out in the camps, sometimes months would elapse before the child could see the doctor, or vice versa. Of course, if the doctor finds a child unfit for entry to the school, that child is immediately sent home. Is this practice in any way contrary to the rules or wishes of the Indian Department?\n\nMy reason for asking is that there are two children living in undesirable conditions near Telkwa, whom Father Godfrey has been trying to send to this school for nearly three months. He has been unable to do so because Mr. Mallinson insists that they cannot be sent here until the necessary forms are filled out and authorization is received from Ottawa. These children are still waiting for their medical examination. The agent will not allow them to come here to be examined by the school doctor, as explained above.\n\nPlease let me have your opinion on this question as soon as is convenient; and I would appreciate it if you will advise Mr. Mallinson accordingly.\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"Rev.

(RG 10, Volume 6445, file 881-10, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nFebruary 14th, 1941.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nre- Your File 15/13/305\nAdmissions to Lejac Residential School.\n\nIn reply to your letter of February 11th, I wish\nto quote excerpts from correspondence received from the\nDepartment covering the above-mentioned subject. Although\nthese refer to one residential school in particular, this\noffice has acted on these instructions in regard to each and\nevery residential school.\n\nDepartmental letter No. 110-0-10 of September 5th,\n1935, signed by A.F. MacKenzie, reads as follows:\n\"As you are aware from previous correspondence, the Department\nonly wishes orphan or neglected children sent to the Edmonton\nSchool from the Babine Agency. Such cases must be known to\nyou for some time previous to their being sent to the school\nmentioned and, consequently, the Department cannot see why\nthe medical officer and yourself cannot submit all applications\nfor admission to the Edmonton School in order that they may be\nconsidered two or three weeks before the time of their proposed\ndeparture.\"\n\nDepartmental letter No. 110-0-10 of October 2nd,\n1935, signed by Phillip Phelan states:\n\"It should be distinctly understood that, in future, no\nchildren should be taken to Edmonton until you have submitted\nthe applications to this Department and received our approval.\"\n\nIn other correspondence the Department has emphasized\nthe necessity of submitting a full report giving reasons why\nan applicant should be admitted to a residential school.\n\nOn receipt of a request from the Principal for\ncertain children in the Smithers and Telkwa areas to be admitted\nto the Lejac Residential School, I asked the Provincial Police\nat Smithers if they would kindly have these children taken for\n\nD.M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nmedical examination, advising Dr. Brummitt accordingly on the same date. When the Smithers children visited the office of Dr. Brummitt, the doctor was unable to attend to them, and I presume they have not made a further call. Those in the Telkwa district are living some thirty miles from Smithers and have probably not visited Dr. Brummitt.\n\nI may say that the Smithers children live with their grandmother in Indian Town, Smithers, and will be transferred to the Tsitsik reserve when the department can make a grant for their removal and for repairs to a house this coming spring. These children would then attend the Rocher Deboule Indian Day School.\n\nThe Rev. Father Simpson has recently admitted to his school, before I was notified, a thirteen year old Indian girl who was regularly attending the Moricetown Indian Day School. In making enquiries to report to the Department the reason why this girl should be admitted, I found that the stepmother and the girl did not get along well together, and submitted my findings to the Department when the application was sent.\n\nI have asked the Department for a definite ruling relative to whether approval must be received prior to the admittance of a child to a residential school or not.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n\"S.

School.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your telegram, dated March 3rd, authorizing the above two Indian children for schooling at the Lejack R.C. Industrial School; at Lejack, B.C.\n\nHis Lordship Bishop Coudert requested that their fares be paid, but this was refused at once. The Telegraph JACK Family are well fixed in Atlin. They have a good Town House, also a Motor Car, with a very good trap-ground with which they keep same going. This family are given to purchasing \"intoxicants\" when-ever possible and have done damage with their car, when under the influence of same. In all they can well afford to pay their children's fares, both coming and going -and for the future they should do so.\n\nNeedless to state, having money they are rather looked after by the R.C. Mission, and this family lives partly at the south end of Teslin Lake, and partly in Atlin, they are very handy as a nucleolus wherewith to forward the progressive movements of the R.C. Mission in these parts.\n\nIt is however quite correct that these children should have training away from their home. The Bishop intends to personally take them south about the 15th of this month.\n\nI am. Sir,\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept Mines & Resources.\nOTTAWA.\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nHarper Reed\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nApril 1, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 27th ultimo you may inform the Principal of the Lejac Residential School that the admission of Evelyn Charlie is approved.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. R. Howe,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to enclose herewith application for admission to the Lejac Indian Residential School for Evelyn Charlie, age six years, adopted daughter of Alec Long Charlie, Stellaquo Reserve, Fraser Lake, B.C.\n\nEvelyn is the illegitimate child of Minnie Isaac of the Stella Band, Fraser Lake, B.C. and was adopted at birth by Mrs. Alec Long Charlie. Mrs. Charlie applied to me for relief recently claiming she is in destitute circumstances and unable to provide for the child.\n\nAt my urgent request the Rev. Principal agreed to take the child into school and would recommend the application be approved and the child admitted as a grant earning pupil.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nRH/L.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nEnclosure.\nSTIKINE\n\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nMarch 25th, 1941.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit, hereunder, a Report, covering the activities of this Agency over the month of February 1941.\n\nA winter visit to the Atlin end of the Agency had been in mind for some time, therefore clearing up the Office detail work as much as possible, the Office was turned over to Dr Meyer to carry on with, and the Mail Plane of the 15th inst was taken on its return to Atlin.\n\nHere it was discovered that nearly all the local Indians were in Town, with also their dogs. It seemed that no trapping of any amount had been undertaken during the winter, up to the present time; and little fur, if any had been obtained and sold. Going into the reason why this had come about, the information was allowed that The Bishop was coming and a lot of Fathers also, and big meetings were to be held. This state of affairs is not quite as bad as it sounds, for the fur obtainable around the mining camp of Atlin, is really of no great account, and if the Indians consistently trap their grounds, they would become depleted in a couple of years. However, as Bishop Condelet, O.M.I., was in Residence at the R.C. Mission Church, he was at once called upon. It was found that a meeting of all the R.C. Fathers was taking place, and the gathering numbered 6 in all. Here was a very good chance to talk over all Mission Affairs, with His Lordship; with the various Fathers concerned present. Therefore on the 16th inst a meeting was held, and all matters of all sorts were gone into, especially those concerning the various Mission Schools. A request was received from His Lordship to have two Atlin children sent to the Lejack Mission Industrial School, and therefore that routine was taken up, Ottawa's permission obtained and the arrangements carried out to enable the Bishop to take these children with him, upon his return to Atch. Much of the detail regarding this meeting will be contained in the school reports made about to be rendered, but His Lordship was good enough to admit that he had learned much in the 5\u00bd hours we expanded in talking about Mission and Indian affairs; than he had learnt during the time he had been mixed up with the Stikine agency, up to then. It was possible, however to have Father Dream, O.M.I., who went into Teslin Lake and opened up a R.C. Mission Church at that point, in direct opposition to the already established English Church Mission, there; to mark on the Office Census Sheet the Indians who as at to-day he claims belong to the R.C. Mission Church. It now appears that he owns over half the Indian Band, but of course this matter will be taken up with the Indians themselves, when Inspector Coleman is present.\n\nHarper Reed\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI beg to attach hereto the March Quarter report of the Lejac Indian Residential School as submitted by the Rev. Principal, A.R. Simpson, O.M.I. The report shows $6908-57 on capitation.\n\nA report is attached from the Principal showing conditions at the school.\n\nForm No. 33 is attached showing 7 admissions and 6 discharges.\n\nI trust that these will be found in order.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRobert Howe,\nIndian Agent.\n\nRH/L.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nEnclosures.\nGENERAL REPORT\nfor quarter ending March 31st., 1941.\n\nATTENDANCE.\nSeveral children have been admitted during the quarter, and at present we have 159 children actually in the school.\n\nMORALE.\nNo complaint can be made about the behaviour of the children. They all seem quite happy and contented to be at school. There have been no runaways this quarter again.\n\nMANUAL TRAINING.\nThis is proceeding along the customary lines. The girls are doing more work for the Red Cross, in knitting and sewing.\n\nHEALTH.\nOn the whole the general health has been good. Cases of influenza were rather numerous for a while, but none of them were serious. Two children were sent to the hospital, one with acute mastoiditis, the other with T.B.\n\nDr. Holmes was here March 24th. and 25th., during which time he performed tonsillectomies on 32 children. Every operation was completely successful, and there was not a single case of bleeding. Dr. Holmes is worthy of commendation for his excellent work.\n\nLIVESTOCK.\nAll of the animals are in good shape, and we have about the same number of all stock, except pigs and chickens, whose numbers are somewhat less.\n\nIMPROVEMENTS.\nThe ammonia refrigerating plant has been discarded, and an ice system has been installed in its place. This ice system is now in operation, and seems to be quite satisfactory.\n\nRev. Alex. R. Simpson, O.M.I.\nPrincipal\nOttawa,\nApril 4, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of the 18th ultimo it is considered that the Telegraph Jack family should pay the transportation of their children to and from the Lejac Indian Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. Harper Reed,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nSir,\n\nRe:- Indian Lad \"George\" U.S.A. Born. Discharge from LEJACK School.\n\nI beg to once again submit for your consideration the above case of an illegitimate lad born in Juneau S.E. Alaska, smuggled into B.C. by way of the Taku River; and later, with the aid of Rev Father Allard, O.M.I., then in Atlin B.C., was sent to the R.C. School at Lejack B.C. Altho much correspondance has passed regarding this case, the lad has remained there ever since and is now ready for discharge.\n\nNo doubt but what Mrs Telegraph-Jack, full indian of Atlin, allowed her daughter Bessie, now deceased some years, to obtain an illegitimate child whilst staying for a visit in Juneau. Bessie stayed on there, and the child was taken care of by some relatives. Some years later Mrs Telegraph-Jack again visited Juneau, and as she and her husband were getting along in life, with their only son married, they returned to Canada with their illegitimate grandson. Smuggling this boy in, they obtained assistance from Rev Father Allard, and he without taking the correct routine, sent this lad to Lejack School.\n\nThe Telegraph-Jack family are rather well off, and rather ignore the aid of the Indian Department. They consider that whatever the R.C. Mission states is correct, and it is only necessary to fix matters with them. They are given to obtaining intoxicants whenever possible, which is nothing more than other indians do, but on account of their well-fixed condition, can do so more often.\n\nTheir son Willie Jack has just been granted the privilege of sending two of his children to the Lejack School, and this family were rather annoyed that the fares involved, were not paid by the Department. This they can well afford to do as was proven to Bishop Courdet, O.M.I., recently.\n\nHis Lordship, a week or so ago, requested that the Department consider this case again, and as the lad has received training at the Canadian School, and is reported as \"good\" that he be accepted into the Atlin Band of Indians, and returned to the care of Mrs Telegraph-Jack.\n\nTaken from a broad point of view, it would seem the only action to take, but in all these half-breed cases, further troubles will come about as the lad grows up. In any case the Telegraph-Jack Family should pay all costs concerned. May further instructions in this matter be received, please.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept.

Both the father and the mother are trouble-makers and an older sister, Josephine, is sub-normal with a very particular inclination towards vagrancy and everything that goes with it. I understand that she is at present under the Doctor's care for a venereal complaint and that there is difficulty in keeping her to the treatments.\n\nIf it can be arranged to have this boy remain in the residential school at Lejac for a further period I recommend unhesitatingly that this be done for I am convinced that the more schooling that he can get under the supervision of the school authorities the better will be his chances of becoming self-supporting and self-respecting after he finishes school.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nH.B.

None of these children have been in residence for several quarters. It is considered that the Principal should apply immediately for the discharge of all these pupils and thus avoid the necessity of entering them every quarter. In the event of any of them returning to the school application can be made for their re-admission.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. Robt.

Fifty absentees were reported. Constables Rae and Sharpe rounded up most of these and at the time of writing 157 pupils are in attendance; several more than covered by the grant.\n\nDoctor McQuarrie arrived at Vanderhoof on the 30th, and arrangements were made for T.B. tests and X-ray for a number of Indians as well as pupils at Lejac Residential School.\n\nRobert Howe,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa.\nLEJAC INDIAN\nRESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nGENERAL REPORT\nfor quarter ending September 30th., 1941.\n\nATTENDANCE.\nVery little difficulty was experienced this year in bringing the children back to school, and it did not take long before we had more children than the \"per capita grant\" allows for. In this respect, the cordial assistance of Mr. Howe, and the other officials of the Stuart Lake Agency, was of great value, and is greatly appreciated.\n\nMORALE.\nThe children are in good spirits, and seem to be very glad to be back in school, with very few exceptions.\n\nMANUAL TRAINING.\nThis is already in full swing for both boys and girls. A good number of the boys are gaining valuable knowledge and experience in the reconstruction of the chicken house, to which is being added a second floor.\n\nHEALTH.\nQuite a number of the children have had very bad colds, and several developed pneumonia, two had to be taken to the hospital for treatment. This epidemic now seems to have petered out. We have been greatly handicapped by the fact that the medical supplies which were requisitioned for last April, have not yet arrived; and our stocks of several essential articles are completely exhausted. At present we are awaiting the arrival of Dr. MacQuarrie, who is bringing an X-ray apparatus, and will hold a T.B. clinic here at the school.\n\nCROPS.\nWhile the yield was excellent this year, it is to be feared that there will be a considerable loss in the harvesting. Since the 24th. of August, we have had rain every day, which has prevented the threshing of the grain, and the bringing in of the hay crop. It is too soon yet to say how much of the crop will have to be considered as lost.\n\nLIVESTOCK.\nWe are still keeping about the same number of animals of all kinds, and disposing of the increase. The stock are in very good condition, and the lamb and pig crops have been disposed of at satisfactory prices.\n\nCOST OF LIVING.\nThe cost of living index has sharply risen for us, as well as for all others. Many of the staple lines of food and clothing are greatly increased in price; and it is becoming more and more difficult for us to meet expenses with our present income. The government has acknowledged that its civil servants are entitled to a \"cost of living bonus,\" and it would seem only just the Indians, the wards of the Government, are entitled to equal consideration. I hope that this will be considered by the Department of Indian Affairs; and that ways and means can be found to increase the \"per capita\" allowance in proportion to the cost of living.\n\nWe have applied to the Provincial Government for permission to purchase moose meat from the Indians, in view of the high cost of beef; but we are not very hopeful of receiving a favourable reply.\n\nRev.

As you are aware, their mother died last year, and the father, Mean Baptiste Tom, is so badly crippled with arthritis as to be incapable of working and providing for their support.\n\nThe eldest one, Jessie, is old enough to take her place with the rest of the school children; but the two younger ones give us quite a lot of extra work and care. Accordingly, I would appreciate it greatly if the Department of Indian Affairs would provide for Doris and Margaret as supernumerary pupils. This would be of considerable assistance for us, especially in view of the fact that we have already several children in excess of the number provided for in our \"per capita grant.\"\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

I know how my brother feels because I was there for seven terms and I was not able to speak English very well until I attended the white school at Woodstock for one and a half term, while there I progressed a lot. I will now present the story in full.\nIn the year 1934, my mother and Dad separated because he was beating my mother several times which I believe got her ill and finally died as a result from the severe beating she received. In the first place they were not legally married while we were with Auntie Mrs J Shettle at Woodcock. My mother wrote to Alex Williams my Dad asking for support but he refused flatly to contribute to my brother's support. Auntie Shettle bought all the clothes for my brother for some time and I was attending school at Lepic at the time. This was the year I believe that my brothers started school along with the Shettle. We were all in grade 1 in 1935. My mother had to send them to Lepic because she was unable to support my brothers two years rolled by and in the spring of 1937 June 8th I receive a telegram from mother and we returned to her call at once. She was on her dying bed then she spoke to my auntie Mrs Henry Russell and said \"Sister you look after my children from now on because my eldest sister Mrs J Shettle...\"\nhas too many of her own; now I must\nleave you all. \"Farewell,\" these were\nher last words. My brothers returned\nto Lepic after their summer vacation,\nand I was discharged at sixteen years\nof age. Four years went by and I knew\nthat my brothers, to my surprise, they\nwere not able to read or do their school\nwork as any average pupil should do.\nThis is five terms for them at Lepic\nand they are only in Grade IV. And as\nI mentioned in the letter they started\nthe same time as the Thistle's and\nhad the same opportunity today.\nLawrence and Charlotte Thistle are ready\nfor promotion into Grade VIII there\nmust be something wrong somewhere.\nThis is why we kept him back because\nhe is certainly not learning anything\nelse. He was comparing with any\naverage pupil like at Glen Howell.\nI was at Lepic when the four children\nran away from Lepic sometime at New\nYear's and were found froze to death.\nJust a quarter of a mile from Fort\nFraser after a thirteen mile journey\nthrough a blizzard, so you naturally\nwill know that the children are not.\nvery happy to a certain extent.\n\nToday Alex Williams is making a lot of fuss because we are living here with auntie Russell at Glen Howell and by the way, auntie Russell gave him a chance to have his own son Edgar to spend his vacation with him at Moncton for about two or three weeks. I was also helping him put up his hay crop at his ranch and during my absence my stepmother was treating my little brother very mean indeed and on my return to their house my brother Edgar told me about it.\n\nHe says he can't get his breakfast until noon sometimes because he has to do his chores first and often he had to beg for some bread from the neighbors around who also told me about it.\n\nThis is what greeted me very much some for Glen Howell with auntie Russell.\n\nThe Indian Agent is demanding my brother's return to Lejac which we object very much but he says, that in his personal feeling that this home of the Russells is certainly very clean and that my brother Edgar is very healthy and happy and everything the child's\nwishes to have he is really at home and we are very fond of him. But the state's it is according to the Indian act that no Catholic should reside or attend school on Salvation Army Reserve. So I pointed out to him that this has not being observed because I know a number of Catholics attending Anglican school at Sagerton that is Mrs Edith Birde children and also Johnson Alexander children are attending the Keapio school and going to church on a United Church Reserve so I feel that my brother has equal rights to those of other Catholics on different Reserve I also don't see why one child should observe the Indian act while others are free. And the only objections is that my brother is a Catholic. My auntie Mrs Henry Russell wants to adopt Edgar because auntie Thistle is adopting his brother Robert but Mr Mallinson says Alex Williams will not give his consent. I would not trouble you about this but Mr Mallinson our Indian Agent told me he was writing Ottawa so I feel we must let you know why we have refused our Indian Agent.\n\n(To be continued)\nI certainly would appreciate any assistance or advice you forward us and hoping you will reply promptly on this matter.\n\nI remain,\nHarold P. Williams.\nOttawa,\nDecember 4, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of October 15 you may inform the Principal of the Lejac Residential School that the admission of the following children is approved:\n\nRobert Quock\nEvelyn Reid\nGloria Reid\nHoward Tashoots\nIrene Tashoots\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. R.H.S.

Howard and Irene are illegitimate children of Mary Tashoots; Howard's father is an unknown white man and Irene's father never has taken any responsibility for bringing her up, therefore the mother signed both forms.\n\nI trust these applications will be found in order.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nR.H.S.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to advise that it is necessary to transfer two boys, Donald Baker and Philip Roy to the Lejac Indian Residential School. Donald Baker is at present an inmate of St. John's School which is conducted under the auspices of the Catholic Children's Aid Society in Vancouver, but is being transferred within the next day or two. The other boy, Philip Roy, has been a patient in the Sardis Indian Hospital and has recovered sufficiently to return to the school.\n\nThe usual procedure in the case of the transfer of such young people is to send them by rail under the care of an escort, in which case their transportation would cost $17.62 each plus meals and the return fare of an escort from Vancouver would cost $62.75 plus berth for four nights, meals and a stopover at Lejac awaiting return train; however, these boys can be sent by Air Plane from Vancouver to Prince George at a cost of $16.50 each, and as the trip lasts only about two hours, escort, berth and meals are not required. On arrival at Prince George they could be met by Mr. Indian Agent Howe or his Constable and transferred to Lejac by Agency car.\n\nIn view of the very considerable saving by use of the Air Plane transportation I would recommend same and request your authority by Air Mail for provision of the Air Plane passage.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

You may inform the Principal that their admission is approved.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. Robt. Howe,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\nATTENDANCE:\nThe attendance has remained constant throughout the quarter, although several children lost a few days as patients in the hospital. Three new children were admitted at the beginning of the quarter.\n\nMORALE:\nThis continues excellent; there was no serious trouble with any of the children, nor were there any runaways.\n\nMANUAL TRAINING:\nThe boys have done good work in the carpenter shop, the blacksmith shop, in painting and repairing several of the farm and school buildings, and in the construction of a small greenhouse.\nThe girls have been very industrious in knitting and sewing for the Red Cross, as well as for the needs of the house.\n\nHEALTH:\nQuite a number of the children had mild attacks of the \"flu,\" and a few had to be sent to the hospital for various reasons. However, there were no deaths among the children although one girl was very seriously ill with a blood condition.\n\nCROPS:\nDespite the prevailing shortage of farm labour, we have been fortunate in maintaining a sufficient force of staff for the needs of the farm. All of the seeding was done in good time, and thanks to the generous rains, the prospects for a good crop are very bright.\n\nLivestock:\nThe crop of lambs and calves has been fairly good. All of the livestock are in good condition, and are doing very well now that there is green pastures available for them.\n\nNew Building:\nA small greenhouse has been built on the foundations of a building that had been destroyed some years ago. This addition to our buildings has already proved its worth in forcing the plants for transplanting to the vegetable garden.\n\nRev. Alex. R. Simpson, O.M.I.\nPrincipal\nOttawa, July 10, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, enclosing the June quarter return of the Lejac Indian Residential School.\n\nLast year, we granted permission for Francis Isodore, No. 395, to remain in the school until June 30, 1942. The Principal has not yet applied for the discharge of this boy. You should bring the matter to his attention.\n\nMabel Storrit, No. 0219; Nancy Monk, No. 0320; and Melanie Zea, No. 0374 are all shown to be over 16 years of age, but the Principal has not yet either applied for their discharge or for permission for them to remain for a further period. I would appreciate hearing from you regarding these pupils at an early date.\n\nPlease direct the Principal's attention to the fact that in the March quarter there are 90 days; in the June quarter, 91 days and in the September and December quarters, 92 days, each.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. Robert Howe,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B. C.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to attach hereto the June Quarterly Report of the Lejac Indian Residential School as submitted to this office by the Rev. Principal, A.R.

So far, the Department has never made any criticism of this practice.\n\nAs for Francis Isadore, #395, Mr. Mallinson merely informed me that permission had been granted for him to remain in school for another year; he did not say that his time expired on June 30th, as is stated in the letter from Mr. Phelan.\n\nAs you will remember, you applied for permission for Mabel Storrit, #0319, to remain in school for another year; she is now due for discharge. Nancy Monk, #320, and Melanie Zaa, #0374, are both due for discharge also.\n\nI regret my error in computing the number of days in the past quarter as 92 instead of 91.\n\nTrusting that this explanation will be satisfactory,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. Alex. R. Simpson, O.M.I.\nPrincipal\n\nIndian Affairs.

For some reason I took offence from your letter and, without sufficient reflection, sent back a reply which, I fear, you must have found insulting, to say the least.\n\nAfterwards, I realised that your letter was merely a routine one in the interest of keeping down unnecessary expenses and entirely impersonal. Consequently I deeply regretted my hasty action in replying to you as I did, and have many times intended to apologise to you for any offence that I may have caused you.\n\nTherefore, Mr. Phelan, I beg that you will accept my most sincere apologies, belated though they are, and join with me in the hope that our future relations will be more cordial and unmarred by any further indiscretions on my part.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. Alex. R. Simpson, O.M.I.  \nPrincipal\nOttawa,\nJuly 29, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 22nd instant, enclosing letter from the Principal of the Lejac Residential School, I may say that we always consider the school year at a residential school being from July 1 to the following June 30. Consequently when approving the retention of a pupil for another year it is always to the following June 30, the end of the academic year. This applies to pupil 395.\n\nIt is noted from the letter that pupils 0219, 0320 and 0374 are being discharged.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. R.

It is due to the urgent request of their parents, and your own advice, that they have now been returned to their homes. Due to the remoteness and difficulties of communication with Bear Lake, the only safe means of travel for these children was to send them by air.\n\nThanking you for your co-operation in this matter,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

This woman is not in very good health and is not able to keep the children clean or look after them properly, and I consider that for the children's own good they should be sent to a residential school.\n\nI have not been able to discuss this matter with their guardian, Selina Francis, she being away at present, but I am of the opinion that she will not give her consent to their being sent away to school. However, if their admission has your approval, will you kindly authorize me to send these children to Lejac, either with or without Selina Francis' consent, as I firmly believe that it is in the children's best interests that they go.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nS.

What has been said regarding Theresa Abraham also applies to Annie W. Austin, although no previous request has been received for her admission.

It is noted that these boys were brought back from Prince Rupert although they were employed at that point and are stated to be at least 14 years of age. From the information at our disposal it is difficult for us to understand why such heavy expense should have been incurred. You are aware, of course, that the expenses of the R.C.M.P. in returning truant pupils to a residential school are all paid by this Branch. From our point of view the boys had been located, were working and are probably older than 14. Besides, we understand that the Lejac School has its full quota of pupils. With these things in mind you can easily understand why we were surprised that instructions were apparently issued from your office to have the boys returned immediately to the Lejac School without consulting the Department.

With reference to the first paragraph thereof, I have taken this matter up with the Rev. Principal and he has replied as follows:-\n\n\"Re. Alfred Antoine; I beg to advise that this boy returned to school in September with the others, but that his name was omitted from the quarterly return through error.\"\n\nR. Howe,\nIndian Agent.\n\n/L.\nREPORT ON STUART LAKE AGENCY FOR MONTH OF DECEMBER, 1942.\n\nI visited Lejac School on the 23rd. inst. and attended the annual school concert. The children appeared to be in good spirits and contented. Five boys ran away during November and December but were located and brought back. The health of the pupils is improving having had setbacks due to an epidemic of whooping cough and influenza. All the children were inoculated by Doctor Findlay for whooping cough.\n\nR. Howe,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 14, 1943.\n\nMr. R. Howe, Indian Agent, Vanderhoof, B.C.\n\nThe name of Alfred Antoine, No. 401, was shown on the December quarter return of the Lejac Residential School, although his name did not appear on the September quarter return. Please advise regarding this boy.\n\nYou may inform the Principal that the Department approves the discharge of the pupils numbered as follows:\n\n| No. 327 | No. 394 | No. 6315 |\n|---------|---------|----------|\n| \" 368   | \" 396   | \" 0368   |\n| \" 370   | \" 405   | \" 0377   |\n| \" 386   | \" 417   | \" 0385   |\n| \" 387   | \" 0356  | \" 0386   |\n| \" 388   | \" 0275  | \" 0391   |\n| \" 391   | \" 0312  | \" 0405   |\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo with reference to the above mentioned truants of the Lejac Indian Residential School. These boys ran away from Lejac Nov. 10th 1942 and were located at Prince Rupert by the Prince Rupert Detachment of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Constable Rae of the Agency Staff escorted them to Lejac.\n\nThe truants were returned to school at the urgent request of the Principal. I was reluctant to bring them back especially when they were employed at the Shipyards, an important war industry. However, it was necessary to take into consideration the effect on the other pupils at the School. If these truants had been allowed to remain away we would have had an epidemic of runaways. Three others ran away a few days after the truants in question but were located shortly after. The fact that these truants were brought back to School had a deterring effect on others contemplating truancy.\n\nHaving in mind the tragedy which occurred a few years ago when several pupils lost their lives running away from Lejac School during sub-zero weather, I think the action taken was the wisest course to follow in order to prevent a possible repetition.\n\nThe only expense the Mounted Police may have incurred in the case is the cost of one telegram and three or four meals for the truants.\n\nRH/L.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sampson, Indian Agent, Telegraph Creek, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 20th ultimo, with reference to certain children on the Tahltan Reserve who you feel should be placed in the Lejac Residential School.\n\nThe Department has always felt that it is very important to have a very careful medical examination of children before placing them in a residential school. The suggestion contained in the second-last paragraph of your letter might be difficult to carry out, because, if the children were examined and found to have tuberculosis, it might not be possible at that time to place them in the Coqualeetza Indian Hospital and, therefore, they would have to remain in the Lejac School where their condition might be a menace to the health of the other pupils.\n\nTaking everything into consideration the Department feels that no action should be taken in this matter at the present time, but we would appreciate hearing from you again about the first of July at which time the matter will receive further consideration with a view to determining if we can arrange for their examination before going to the school and, if so, those physically fit could be sent for the 1943-44 term.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nThere are about twelve children between the ages of six and eleven who have lost their mothers in recent years and are now a considerable burden upon their fathers, Indians of Tahltan Band. These children are of Roman Catholic faith and the Principal of the Lejac School is urging that they be admitted to the school. Bishop Coudert, who was interviewed recently, also thinks the children should be sent to Lejac.\n\nAs the Department is aware, there is no doctor here now and therefore a thorough physical examination cannot be obtained by the children before going to the school. In view of the fact that there is considerable tuberculosis amongst these Indian families it seems all the more desirable to have a thorough examination of all children who are to be admitted to residential school.\n\nBishop Coudert has suggested that it might be possible to have the children examined when they arrived at Lejac and if active disease was found in any of them, that they be sent on to the Coqualeetza Indian Hospital at Sardis.\n\nI should be pleased to have the Department's views in this matter as it would be of great benefit to the children and fathers of the aforementioned families if the children could be admitted to residential school.\n\nR.H.S. Sampson,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMarch 17, 1943.\n\nMr. R. Howe, Indian Agent, Vanderhoof, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 10th instant, you may inform the Principal of the Lejac Residential School that the admission of Tommy and Annie Poole is approved. In view of the circumstances requiring their admission to a residential school, I agree with you that they should remain at the school until they are capable of looking after themselves. This means that they should not be granted holidays unless with your permission.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith for the Department's approval applications for admission to the Lejac Indian Residential School for Tommy Poole, 9 years and Annie Poole, 6 years, of the Fort Grahame Band, Fort Ware, B.C.\n\nThe mother of these children was murdered January 8th, 1943 and the father is in custody and stands accused of the crime. Please refer to my report to the Department of March 4th., 1943; our File No. N-3-929.\n\nWhen I arrived at Fort Ware these children were being cared for by their Grandmother, but she is positively incapable of giving them the necessary care.

There have been no truants during the past quarter, due, no doubt, to the fact that the boys who ran away in November were speedily brought back to the school.\n\nMANUAL TRAINING\n\nThe boys are doing rather well in the carpentry work, they have rebuilt part of the chicken-house which burned down, they have made a number of useful articles of furniture, and several repairs to the buildings. Due to the scarcity of the inferior quality of rubber boots, they are obliged to fall back on the use of leather boots once more. This necessitates a shoe repair shop, which has been set up, with a competent instructor for the boys.\n\nThe girls continue with their work in making clothes, mending and knitting, embroidery, etc., as well as with the arts of the kitchen.\n\nHEALTH\n\nThe children have had a very hard time this winter. Following the whooping cough of last quarter, we had the chicken-pox, then the flu, and now we have the measles. Two weeks ago there were 69 children in bed at the same time. Fortunately, there have been no deaths to report. One boy broke his leg while skiing, but he is all right now.\n\nLIVESTOCK\n\nThe stock have come through the winter in fairly good condition, and we have not lost any. The only misfortune we had was with the lambs, many of which were born too soon, and twelve of them froze to death in the extreme temperatures, 40 below zero. We have restored about half of the chicken-house which burned down in November last.\n\nIMPROVEMENTS\n\nWe have arranged to have the programmes of the National Film Board shown here at the school. The children study the subject matter of the films beforehand, from the booklets which are provided, and they seem to take an intelligent interest in the films. A Victor Sound Projector, 10mm., has also been added to the school equipment, from which the children derive a great deal of benefit and amusement.\n\nRev. Alex. R. Simpson, O.M.I.\nPrincipal\nOttawa,\nApril 20, 1943.\n\nMr. R. Howe, Indian Agent, Vanderhoof, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 14th instant, the Department approves the admission of Ruth Benoit and Paul W. Leon to the Lejac Residential School.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith application for admission to Lejac Indian Residential School for Ruth Benoit and Paul W. Leon. You will note the application form for the latter is not signed by parent or guardian.\n\nThis boy complains of ill treatment from his father and ran away from home two months ago and refused to return. It was considered advisable to place him in Lejac School rather than having him wandering around the district.\n\nRH/L.\n\nEnclos.\n\nR. Howe,\nIndian Agent.\nLejac Indian Residential School\nUnder Direction of The Oblate Fathers\nLejac, B.C.\n\nApril 28th., 1943.\n\nMedical Report on the Progress of\nTheresa Abraham, age 18, Bear Lake Band.\n\nThis Indian girl was sick for 9 months in the hospital, with Infantile Paralysis, and came to the Lejac Indian Residential School in August of 1942.\n\nOn admission to the school, Theresa was unable to walk as the results of the Paralysis, without the aid of (2) crutches. Also, her eyes were extremely weak and infected.\n\nNow she can walk fairly well without any assistance, however the right lower extremity is still very weak, and she depends on the wall for support.\n\nIt will be some time before Theresa is able to return home. She is a bright girl and seems one who will reap the full benefits of the school, and she is happy and contented here.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nS. P. Hindlay, M.D.\nMedical Officer.\nLejac Indian Residential School\nUnder Direction of The Oblate Fathers\nLejac, B.C.\nMay 4th., 1943.\n\nPhilip Phelan, Esq.,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Theresa Abraham, age 18, 0424.\n\nIn view of what you said in your letter of October 14th., 1942 (file #163-1-10) concerning the special circumstances under which this girl was admitted to this school, I was considerably surprised to receive a peremptory demand for her discharge at the end of the current school year, which was transmitted to me from your office by Mr. Indian Agent Howe.\n\nIn the above mentioned letter of last October, you asked that a report be submitted to you concerning this girl before the end of June 1943, at which time the question of her remaining in the school for another year would be given consideration by you. I am enclosing herewith the report of the School Medical Officer on the case; and I beg to submit also my own opinion, as follows.\n\nTheresa Abraham, although already 18 years old, has had no previous opportunity to attend school, and, at the time of her admission here, was completely illiterate. During the months that she has been able to attend classes, she has worked hard and well, and has made satisfactory progress. She is very anxious to learn, at least, to read and write.\n\nRealising how remote her home at Bear Lake is from all medical attention, she has begged that she be allowed to remain at this school until she has completely recovered from the effects of the attack of infantile paralysis which she suffered more than a year ago.\n\nTherefore, in view of the above circumstances, and of the opinion given in the medical report, I strongly recommend that Theresa Abraham be permitted to remain in the Lejac Indian Residential School for at least another year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. Alex. R. Simpson, O.M.I.\nRev. Alex. R. Simpson, O.M.I.\nPrincipal\n\nIndian Affairs.

C. via Vancouver.\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant. Your recommendation for the admission of the children mentioned in this communication to the Lejac Residential School is acceptable to the Department and approved. These are the two youngest children of Nelson Quock and Moran, age 5 years, and Louise, age 7, children of Joe. Butts Dennis.\n\nIt is expected that the application forms, fully filled in, will reach us in due course.\n\nR. A.

It is desired to send the two youngest, Lewis, age 5 and Ivan, age 6\u00bd, to school. One child, Una, age 10, is being looked after by relations. This leaves only two children, Edith age 15, and Henry, age 12 both of whom are really too old to send to school now and they are considered old enough to look after themselves fairly well. Sending the two youngest to school will relieve the father to a large extent and permit him to get out and find work.\n\nJoe Mutts Dennis family, fatherless, with five children under sixteen. Moran age 5 years and five months, and Louise age 7 could be sent to school leaving Ethel 12, Gregory 3, and a baby 1, to be looked after by the mother.\n\nIt would be appreciated if a reply to this letter could be sent by Air Mail via Vancouver, B.C. because I should like to arrange to send all the children out together to save the expense of separate matrons.\n\nR.H.S. Sampson,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nAugust 11, 1943.\n\nMr. R. Howe, Indian Agent, Vanderhoof, B.C.\n\nI have noted the contents of your letter of the 2nd instant, with reference to the admission of Dominic Pierre and Ted Pierre to the Lejac Residential School. Your action in placing these boys in the school is approved. The Department would like to have the usual application forms on file so that we will have complete information regarding these two children and you should, therefore, forward these. It will be unnecessary to have the mother sign them, as you can refer on the application forms to your letter of August 2.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nJuly 28, 1943.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nMr. R. Howe, Indian Agent, Vanderhoof, B.C.\n\nThe section of your telegram of July 22 which refers to placing children from Fort Grahame in the Lejac Residential School has been referred to me.\n\nAs the Welfare Division has authorized the necessary food for those requiring same and as the summer holiday period is now in effect at the Lejac School, it was felt that you should be written before authorizing any specific action.\n\nAs you know, the authorized pupilage at the Lejac School is 160, but grant is allowed for only 92.24% of this number, or 147.58. Under these circumstances you should confer with the Principal of the Lejac School and ascertain how many children from Fort Grahame he can take, as present regulations do not permit our paying supernumerary grant over the number of 147.58. It should also be understood that the Department only favours placing in the Lejac School children who have reached the age of 7 years. Children younger than this age should be placed with friends or relatives at Fort Grahame, even though you have to apply later for authority for food for them. Similar action should be taken with reference to children of 14 or 15 years of age. This is the only provision that can be made, unless the Lejac School is able to accommodate them within the number of grant-earning pupils and, in view of the large enrolment at this school in the past, it is considered advisable to obtain full particulars before making a decision.\nREPORT ON STUART LAKE INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF JUNE, 1943.\n\nSchools:\n\nI visited Lejac Indian Residential School twice during June. Mr. Engineer W. Warren, inspected the sewage system, water tower and school foundation on the 21st.\n\nThe School term closed on the 25th and the children left for their homes the same date. The health of the children was reported to be good.\n\nR. Howe,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJune 10, 1943.\n\nMr. R. Howe, Indian Agent, Vanderhoof, B.C,\n\nFor your information I enclose a copy of a letter which is being sent to Mr. R.H.S. Sampson, Indian Agent, Telegraph Creek, with reference to four children of Guy Reid. The mother died last November and I understand that the two oldest members of this family, Gloria and Evelyn Reid, are already in Lejac. You will note the instructions that have been given to Indian Agent Sampson and you should arrange with the Smithers Hospital to have the children examined as soon as they arrive. The authorities at Smithers can notify you when the children reach there and, if they are pronounced physically fit, you should have them brought to Lejac immediately. The Assistant Superintendent of Medical Services wishes to avoid their remaining in the hospital for a lengthy period, if they are physically fit. However, if any of them need hospital treatment, they can remain there, but the usual report should be forwarded by you to Dr. Moore regarding their condition.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nCopy sent to Mr. Howe\n\nOttawa,\nJune 10, 1943.\n\nMr. R.H.S. Sampson, Indian Agent, Telegraph Creek, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 20th ultimo, with reference to Johnston, Lucy, Bob and Nelson Reid who you recommend should be placed in the Lejac Indian Residential School. The Department has no objection to having the children sent to this school and you can make the necessary arrangements accordingly. The usual application forms should be completed and forwarded to Indian Agent R. Howe, who will arrange to have the medical forms completed.\n\nThe Assistant Superintendent of Medical Services suggests that these pupils be sent to Smithers, B.C., where they can be placed in the hospital and fully examined and X-rayed before going to the Lejac School. I am writing to Indian Agent Howe instructing him to make the necessary arrangements for their examination at Smithers. If they are pronounced physically fit, Indian Agent Howe will arrange to have them transported from that point to Lejac. If any of them are suffering from tuberculosis or other disease, they can be treated at the Smithers Hospital.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nMay 29, 1943.\n\nMr. R.H.S. Sampson, Indian Agent, Telegraph Creek, B.C.\n\nIn a report from the R.C.M.P. dated May 10 we have been advised that the father and mother of May Loots, Lower Post, B.C., recently died and the girl is now orphaned and destitute. She is 5 years of age and we understand from the correspondence that she is a Catholic. Please make arrangements to have her placed in the Lejac Indian Residential School.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nREPORT ON STUART LAKE INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF APRIL, 1943.\n\nSchools:\n\nLejac Indian Residential School was visited once during April. Two runaways were reported; Paul Wassa Leon and Albert Prince. These boys were located later, and Albert Prince was returned to school; the other, Paul Wassa Leon was discharged.

We had anticipated some difficulty in reaching our quota this year due to prevailing economic conditions, but it did not materialize. However, though the boys are numerous, there are no really big boys, which is quite a handicap tous in our farming operations.\n\nAll during the summer vacation we had about 25 children in school; which is an expense, as far as I am aware, that other Residential Schools do not have.\n\nMORALE\nDespite the fact that there was considerable reluctance on the part of the parents to send their children back to school, the children themselves are in high spirits and seem to be quite content to be back in school, with perhaps two exceptions.\n\nHealth\nMany of the children on their return were lousy, there was a great deal of impetigo, itch, etc. We now have this well in hand. At the moment a slight epidemic of the \"flu\" is going through the school.\n\nMANUAL TRAINING\nA number of the boys are already at work helping to rebuild the chicken house which burned down last winter; the shoe shop is in operation, and the various chores of the farm.\n\nThe girls are also back in their usual routine of domestic economy, knitting, dressmaking, repairing and renewing clothing, etc.\n\nLIVESTOCK\nThe stock have done well this summer. We are now preparing to send over 50 head of cattle and about 50 head of sheep to the market.\n\nCROPS\nOn the whole, the crops are far below the yield of last year, and the harvesting operations are considerably later. But, if the weather permits, we ought to get enough feed grains to see us through the winter. We probably have enough hay put up, although there is a local shortage of feed.\n\nSUPPLIES\nThe problem of obtaining clothing and food supplies is becoming more acute. This will be somewhat alleviated for us by the fact that during the summer we put up nearly 2000 quarts of fruit and vegetable tables; a great proportion of which was wild fruit.\n\nPROPERTY\nDuring the summer the necessary repairs were made to the water tank, and the exterior surface was painted. Quite a lot of painting and repair work was done in the school during the vacation.\n\nRev. Alex. R. Simpson, O.M.I.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Nancy Anatole is now in good physical condition; the only defect being in her vision, which can be corrected by using spectacles.\n\nIf the Department declines to approve the admission of the four children, Peter Abraham, Margaret Andrews, Raymond Seymour and Nancy Anatole, I shall have to send them home; since they all come from remote areas they will be far removed from all medical supervision and care, which they are now receiving at this school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

During the Christmas holidays we had about 175 parents and relatives of the children here for the Christmas concert, and all of them seemed to be quite satisfied with the condition of their children; which would indicate that the children themselves are contented.\n\nHEALTH\nDuring the survey made by the T.B. Travelling Clinic at this school about 130 children were X-rayed. Consequently, six children had to be sent for hospital treatment. Two children have returned here after lengthy sojourns at the Coqualeetza Indian Hospital.\n\nFor about six weeks, beginning the first of November, the school was quarantined for Mumps; 120 children in all being affected. One little girl, seven years old, died in Vanderhoof Hospital.\n\nMANUAL TRAINING\nThis is proceeding along the customary lines. Due to the fact that there are no big boys this year, the boys are not giving as much assistance with the farm work as in other years. The work of rebuilding the chicken house which burned down in November 1942 is now completed. Operations have been suspended in the shoe repair shop due to the difficulty in obtaining materials.\n\nLIVESTOCK\nThe results of the sale of cattle this year were rather disappointing due to a sudden slump in prices just before the sale. The results from the sheep were quite satisfactory. Due to the shortage of feed we disposed of 30 suckling calves, which would normally have been held over until next year.\n\nSUPPLIES\nIt is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain sufficient clothing for the children, especially shirts and overalls. Leather for shoe-repair is also very scarce. The rubbers and running shoes made from reclaimed rubber are very unsatisfactory.\n\nRev. Alex R. Simpson, O.M.I.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This girl, with Elsie Gonzales, ran away from Squamish Indian Residential School last month and we had considerable trouble locating her.

The average for the quarter is over 160. The Department has recently notified us that three indigent children are being sent here from Lower Post. This will make about thirty such children, with the additional burden of keeping them in school all during the summer vacation. It is only just that some recognition of this be made by the Department, such as raising our number of grant earning pupils to 160.\n\nMORALE\nThe children continue to be in good spirits, and another quarter has passed without any cases of truancy. In fact, we have not had a single runaway during the current school year.\n\nHEALTH\nThis has been somewhat better during the past quarter. Many of the children have had colds and the 'flu, but nothing very serious. One girl was sent to hospital for six weeks as a precaution against T.B. One other girl went to hospital with sores on her legs. The children were all immunized against diphtheria. Two of the children who were sent to hospital last fall, as a result of the T.B. chest clinic, have died.\n\nMANUAL TRAINING\nThis is going on as usual. We have received a welcome addition to our tool supplies from the Department. Activity is being resumed in the shoe repair shop since we have been able to obtain a supply of leather.\n\nThe girls have been doing good work in making useful garments out of the supplies of discarded army and air force clothing that we have been receiving lately.\n\nLIVESTOCK\nAll of the livestock have weathered the winter in a satisfactory manner. The new crop of XXXXX calves and lambs is now arriving daily. We got 500 Barred Rock Pullet chicks late in February. This is the first time we have had anything but Leghorns.\n\nGENERAL\nIt is earnestly hoped that we will be able to have the exterior woodwork of the building repaired and painted this year. During the very cold weather it was impossible to heat parts of the building due to the looseness of the windows and doors.\n\nRev. Alex. R. Simpson, O.M.I.\nPrincipal\n### ADMISSION OF PUPILS AT LEJAC RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL DURING Jan-Mar. 31st., 1944.

In her present condition she would be almost helpless on the Reserve; and, if she leaves this school, she should be admitted to a hospital rather than be sent home.\n\nSince Theresa is also anxious to continue her studies, I am willing to have her remain in school for the next school year.\n\nWill you please take this matter up with the Department, and see what can be done?\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev.

Findlay on the above noted pupil of Lejac Indian Residential School.\n\nThis girl's home is at Bear Lake in a desolate and remote area. In view of poor conditions and lack of medical supervision it is impossible to treat her at home.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nRH/H\nEnc.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nMrs. Antonia Jack, a widow of Atlin-Teslin Lake Band and the mother of six children, has asked that her boy Sylvester, aged 11 years 5 months, now attending Lejac Indian Residential School, be returned home in order to help her and to learn to trap.\n\nSylvester was admitted to Lejac School in March, 1941, and is apparently making normal progress. While I am disinclined to recommend the discharge of pupils before they reach the age of sixteen years, this case is exceptional in that the widowed mother needs the help of a son and also it is important that Sylvester learns to trap during the next three or four years or it will take him much longer to learn later. From past experience it seems these Indian boys do not take well to trapping after they are sixteen or older.\n\nMrs. Jack has a girl, age 10 also in Lejac School and has asked that two younger children, aged 8 and 6 years, be sent to school. They would have to be escorted and as the mother is destitute this expense would be a charge on the Department, as would the expense of a matron on the journey from Atlin to Lejac. The cost of this trip would be about $200.00, mainly for fares. If the boy Sylvester returned with the escort the cost would rise to $275.00.\n\nAnother factor in the case is that there is no means of having the prospective school children medically examined before leaving Atlin as there is no doctor there. They would probably have to go to Smithers first before proceeding to Lejac. The children appear healthy but their father died of pulmonary tuberculosis last June at Coqualeetza Hospital.\n\np.t.o.\nMrs. Jack is at present drawing rations but has a good trap-line and should become self-supporting as soon as the boy Sylvester is able to trap efficiently.\n\nI would be pleased to receive the Department's direction in this matter as soon as possible, both in connexion with the requested discharge of Sylvester from Lejac School and the admission of the two younger ones.\n\nR.H.S. Sampson,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMay 29, 1944.\n\nMr. R.H.S. Sampson, Indian Agent, Telegraph Creek, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 25th instant, with reference to the children of Mrs. Antonia Jack. Careful consideration has been given to the second paragraph of your letter. The Department feels that it would not be advisable to grant the discharge of Sylvester Jack this year. After all he has only been in the school since 1941 and if he is to receive any advantage from his school training he should remain for another year.\n\nRegarding the two younger children, the Department is prepared to approve their admission to the Lejac School, provided the Principal is willing to accept them. I note that it will probably involve an expenditure of $200 for their transportation and, as you suggest, they should be sent to Smithers for medical examination before they proceed to Lejac.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nREPORT ON STUART LAKE AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF APRIL, 1944.\n\nGeneral:\n\nThree Murat children from Lower Post arrived by plane at Prince George April 19th. Jimmy and Jennie Murat were conveyed to Lejac School after being given a clean bill of health by Dr. E.J. Lyon. John Murat has been taken by air to Coqualeetza Hospital for treatment.\n\nR.

These children, with possibly the two Jack children from Atlin whose removal to Lejac was the subject of my letter of April 26, 1944, would make a total of fourteen. The Reverend Principal of Lejac has advised that he is willing to accept all these children.\n\nAs the Department is aware, the children cannot be medically examined here and therefore would first have to go to Smithers. Of the ten children from Telegraph Creek listed above, perhaps only two are likely to need medical attention; Gerty Dennis for an eye condition and James Dennis for possible P.M. knee joint. In any case it is important that these children receive medical attention for their ailments and they cannot do so at Telegraph Creek.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Missionary, Rev. J. Carpentier, has signified his willingness to escort the children if his travelling expenses are paid. The mother of Charles Tashoots, a capable woman, is willing to act as matron for the girls without charge, provided her expenses are paid. As Father Carpentier opens Dease Lake Seasonal School September 1st the children will have to go out early in August.\n\nThe parents of the children are destitute and in the case of the Dennis and Etzerza families, the widowed mothers are in receipt of rations for their families. There are five children under 16 years in the Dennis family and eight children under 16 years in the Etzerza family; these two widows are heavily burdened trying to care for their large families. The Reid children being motherless, do not receive proper care and would benefit greatly from attending residential school. The Tashoots boy is living in immoral surroundings and would also be better off in school; he also has very greatly enlarged tonsils which interfere with his breathing.\n\nI would be pleased if the Department would authorize the removal of these children.

The average for the quarter was 167.89.\n\nMORALE\nNearly all of the children seem to be very happy. There has not been a single case of truancy during the past year, that is, no child has run away from school.\n\nHEALTH\nThis has been fairly good. We had a dental clinic, and the dentist was amazed at the good condition of the teeth of the older children who had been in school for several years. The general state of the teeth of the new children was quite bad.\n\nThe T.B. Clinic took X-rays of about 24 children; but, for the first time since this survey was begun, we did not have to send a single child to the Sanatorium.\n\nOne girl, Bertha Pierre, was sent to St. Paul's Hospital in Vancouver for further treatment for goitre. Today, a telegram came announcing that she had died June 29th, without any explanation.\n\nMANUAL TRAINING\nThis is following the usual lines. Both boys and girls have had considerable work in the garden and greenhouse, transplanting and thinning out, etc.\n\nOne of our girls, in the Provincial T.B. Poster contest, won a first prize; another girl and boy each got honourable mention in the same contest.\n\nWe have made quite a large number of serviceable garments for the girls from the discarded army clothing we have received.\n\nLIVESTOCK\nThe lamb crop was disappointing, but the calf crop has been fairly good. When our pullet chicks were about ten weeks old, one of the boys filled the feed trough with sawdust, and we lost over 200 of the chicks.\n\nGENERAL\nDue to the lack of available labour, it will not be possible to have the exterior woodwork of the school building repaired and repainted, as we had hoped.\n\nThe lack of help is also hampering our work on the farm.\n\nRev.

Joe Poole, being a widower, is unable to give his children proper care and the conditions under which they live are deplorable.\n\nDr. Stringer, on our recent visit to this point last June, examined these children and found them physically fit to enter school, and the Reverend Principal consents to their admission regardless of age, particularly as they are underprivileged.\n\nPermission is requested to bring the children out by the mail plane, October 14th next at the Department's expense, the cost being \u00a332.78 each.

From the information placed before us at that time we thought that in view of the boy's age and the short length of time that he had attended the Lejac School it would be in his best interests to remain in the school for another year. However, we have had strong representations to the effect that the mother requires his assistance and consequently we feel that the boy should be discharged immediately. Please make arrangements for his return home at the earliest possible date. The cost of his transportation will be paid on receipt from you of a certified account.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of October 10th. concerning Sylvester Jack, No. 407, is to hand.\n\nIt is rather surprising to me that the matter of discharging this boy should be renewed at this time; because, only last August his mother brought his little brother and sister to school, and she was quite cheerfully resigned to the fact that Sylvester could not go home this year.\n\nHowever, if it is wish of the Department that he should go home, I have no objection. But, I wish to point out that this boy comes from Atlin, which is in a most remote section of Northern B.C., and that the boy is only 12 years of age. Therefore, he will have to have an escort to take him home, the more especially since the season is now far advanced and the means of transportation are very uncertain at this time of the year.\n\nI did not consider that your letter authorised the sending of an escort with this boy; therefore, I will take no steps toward sending him home until I receive confirmation from you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. Alex. R. Simpson, O.M.I.\nPrincipal\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nOctober 1st, 1944\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Lejac Indian Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Department of Indian Affairs may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child: ____________________________\n\nEnglish name: Agnes A.

Hoey, Superintendent\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nIndian Affairs Branch\nSouth Building\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nUpon returning to my headquarters here in Whitehorse, I found your two communications of October 10 and 24 with enclosed correspondence of Agent Benson and Father Simpson re Sylvester Jack's return to Atlin.\n\nI wish to thank you for your earnestness in taking this matter up.\n\nAs stated in my letter of October 7, I was surprised to hear of Mrs. Jack's request being turned down by Ottawa, after it had been endorsed by the local Indian Agent, especially in view of the fact that Mrs. Jack had been sent purposely to Lejeu last Summer as an escort both to bring some of her younger children in and to take Sylvester back home with her. Frankly, I could not understand the attitude of the Ottawa Officials, and was anxious to have some explanation on the matter. I added that Mrs. Jack, though greatly disappointed, \"accepted this painful situation without recrimination and consented to leave her boy in the school for another year.\"\n\nYour explanation is somewhat satisfactory, though it shows once more the difficulty which the Ottawa Officials have to understand at such a distance our local problems and the lack of confidence they have in the report of their local Agents. I must now admit that you have gone beyond my expectations by instructing the Principal of Lejeu, at this late date, to have the boy sent home at the earliest possible date.\n\nI wired immediately to Father Hemel, the missionary in charge at Atlin, in order to ascertain whether Mrs. Jack was still in Atlin and whether it this late date she still cared to have the boy come back to her for the present coming season. I received this morning the following wire from Father Hemel: \"Sylvester Jack born November 1st 1932\u2014stops Antonio and George with him come back as soon as possible because they go tramping after New Year.\" George is a first cousin to Sylvester and looks after his training.\n\nIn my estimation there is not the slightest difficulty for a boy of Sylvester's age to come back home alone. There is a steamer plying every ten days, all the winter long, between Prince Rupert and Skagway, and a connecting train between Skagway and Carcross, with a connecting plane between Carcross and Atlin. I would suggest to have Father Simpson or Agent Howe make the necessary arrangements for the boy's trip through the Indian Agent at Prince Rupert; the latter knows exactly from experience what papers are required by the Immigration for the boy's passage.\nfrom Prince Rupert to Atlin, via Skeena and Carcross; he then would have only to put the boy on the steamer at Prince Rupert, and wire George Simons of the Northern Airways at Carcross to let the boy on his arrival at Carcross by train.\n\nPending favorable weather conditions for the plane to take off for Atlin, I\n\nIf any escort is deemed absolutely needed, which point I will consider\n\nwould advise keeping the boy in Lejeune until next summer when some opportunity may arise to have other children of the North brought in or out of the School;\n\nin which case I would ask you to notify me at your earliest convenience so\n\nthat I may wire the parents not to expect Sylvester back before next summer.\n\nThanking you for your kind cooperation in this matter,\n\nI remain, Dear Mr. Hoey,\n\nyours sincerely in Christ\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.J. Condon O.M.I.\nVic.Ap.of Whitehorse\nOttawa,\nNovember 9, 1944.\n\nDear Bishop Coudert:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd instant, I enclose, for your information, a copy of a letter which is being forwarded to the Principal of the Lejac Residential School, also a copy of a letter to Indian Agent Gillett, Prince Rupert.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRt.

Any expense which you incur in this regard will be paid upon receipt of the usual account in duplicate.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nReverend Sir:\n\nOn receipt of your letter of October 18, regarding Sylvester Jack, No. 407, I wrote to Right Reverend J.L. Coudert, O.M.I., and part of his reply reads as follows:\n\n\"I wired immediately to Father Hamel, the missionary in charge at Atlin, in order to ascertain whether Mrs. Jack was still in Atlin and whether at this late date she still cared to have the boy come back to her for the present trapping season. I received this morning the following wire from Father Hamel: 'Sylvester Jack born November 1st, 1932 - stop - Antonia and George wish him come back as soon as possible because they go trapping after New Year.'

Owing to unsatisfactory home conditions, such action is often advisable, especially in the case of the girls.\n\nWe considered the information contained in your letter, regarding the past conduct of Irene Isadore. While there is no doubt that she should be detained in some institution for a time, we do not want our Indian residential schools turned into penal institutions. It is felt that the placing of a girl with her background in a residential school would be a retrograde step and almost inevitably the other children would suffer.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nSend the following message, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\nVeuillez exp\u00e9dier la d\u00e9p\u00eache suivante aux conditions mentionn\u00e9es au verso auxquelles je consens par les pr\u00e9sentes\n\nOttawa March 7 1945\n\nMr S MALLINSON\nIndian Agent\nHAZELTON British Columbia\n\nDISCUSSED YOUR LETTER MARCH THIRD WITH\nMR HOEY AND IT IS CONSIDERED INADVISABLE TO PLACE IRENE\nISADORE IN THE LEJAC RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL -stop- THE JUDGE\nSHOULD BE ALLOWED TO COMMIT HER TO SOME INSTITUTION\n\nPhilip Phelan\nCharge Indian Affairs Br.\nMines and Resources\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI wish to advise you that Irene Hellena Isadore, Moricetown Indian, age 16, was before the Judge of the Juvenile Court this date in Smithers, to face a charge of theft from the Chinese proprietor of a restaurant situated in Smithers.\n\nAs a previous charge of intoxication was laid against this girl, and knowing that she would appear before the Court on a charge of theft, I wrote the Principal of the Lejac Indian Residential School, asking if he would accept this girl, should the Judge see fit to commit her. The Principal agreed to accept custody of the girl on condition that she passed a clean bill of health.

Mallinson,\nIndian Agent.\nGENERAL REPORT\n\nFor quarter ending March 31st., 1945.\n\nATTENDANCE\n\nThis went up to a high of 178 during the quarter, and has varied very little during that time. According to the quarterly returns, our average has been a little over 174 for the past quarter, almost 10% over our per capita allotment.\n\nMORALE\n\nOn the whole, the children all appear to be contented and settled down. There have not been any runaways during the quarter, and the behaviour of the children has been consistently good.\n\nHEALTH\n\nAs regards the health of the student body, this has been one of the best periods in my experience. Very few children have had to be put to bed, and most of these were merely cases of severe colds or of influenza. Only four children had to be taken to the hospital. One of these, Matilda David, No. 0436, developed a heart condition which seemed to be due to a previous attack of St. Vitus Dance two years ago. Her condition deteriorated very rapidly, and she died two days after being taken to the hospital.\n\nWe had a six day dental clinic for the children. The dentist was very well impressed with the condition of the children's teeth, as compared with those of white children in the locality, or elsewhere. Exactly 50% of the student body did not require any attention. The great majority of the work done was for children who were spending their first year in school. Evidently, having a clinic for the children once a year pays dividends.\n\nLIVESTOCK\n\nThe stock are not doing so well this winter, the milk production is below previous levels, and so is the egg production. One of the main causes is the shortage of feed and grain. Last year we had an 80% crop failure due to the severe drought. Already, I have spent over $3000.00 this winter in the purchase of hay and grain.\n\nAnother contributing factor is the shortage of farm labour. Our present farm manager is not up to the standard of previous ones, and we are also short-handed. Due to the fact that there are no really big boys, we do not get very much help from them.\n\nThere was a very heavy snow fall this winter, and the continued cold weather seems to indicate that we will be quite late in getting to work on the land this year; which is another cause of anxiety.\n\nRev. Alex. R. Simpson, O.M.I.\nPrincipal\nOttawa, April 11, 1945.\n\nMr. R. Howe, Indian Agent, Vanderhoof, B.C.\n\nI have the March quarter return of the Lejac Residential School. According to our records, Theresa Abraham, No. 0424, is 19 years of age. We have allowed an extension to June 30, 1945, or, in other words, we will pay grant to that date if the girl continues in the school until June 30, 1945. However, it will not be possible to pay grant for her after that date. Consequently, her name should be removed from the return before you forward the return for the quarter ending September 30, 1945.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nOctober 2nd., 1944\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Lejac Indian Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child ...............................................................\nEnglish name Morrison Paul ......................................................\nAge 9 years ............................................................................\nName of Band Fraser Lake .......................................................\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid .......................\nFather's full name and No Harry Paul ...........................................\nMother's full name and No Lucy C.

Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Theresa Abraham, No.0424\n\nMr. Indian Agent Howe has conveyed to me your remarks re the above pupil, following your examination of the March quarter returns for this school.\n\nSince there has been considerable correspondence concerning this girl each year about this time, I must presume that you are familiar with the facts of this case; and in view of these facts I find it hard to understand your arbitrary demand for her discharge.\n\nLast year, and the year before, I had to beg the Department to allow this girl to remain in school, but I do not intend to do so again. It is not reasonable that I should have to beg for the privilege of saving money for the Department. If this girl has to leave the school, the only place where she can receive adequate care, and entertain any hope of further improvement in her condition, is in the hospital. Here she is under constant medical supervision, she receives daily massage and other attention. If she returns to her home at Bear Lake, a most isolated and primitive reserve, she will certainly not enjoy these advantages.\n\nYou say, \"it will not be possible to pay grant for her after that date (June 30, 1945).\" May I point out that our average attendance for the past fiscal year was 171.87; and that we were allowed grant for only 160 children? It is obvious, therefore, that we enjoy no financial advantage by keeping this girl in school; our only motive in doing so is a wish to give her a chance for recovery from her ailment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. Alex. R. Simpson, O.M.I.\nPrincipal\n\nC.C. Mr. Howe.\nOttawa, May 15, 1945.\n\nMr. R. Howe, Indian Agent, Vanderhoof, B.C.\n\nI desire to refer to my letter of April 11, with regard to Theresa Abraham, No. 0424, Lejac Indian Residential School. It is regretted that before writing this letter I overlooked reviewing your letter of April 26, 1944, with which you enclosed a communication from the Principal of the Lejac School, regarding Theresa Abraham.\n\nIf I had reviewed this letter I would have realized that this girl is crippled, as a result of Infantile Paralysis, and the Rev. Principal feels she should not be returned to her home at Bear Lake.\n\nWhile I appreciate his interest in this girl's welfare, at the same time it must be realized that our residential schools are not intended for the maintenance of such persons. I have discussed the case with the officials interested, and we are anxious to know if the girl could be placed with some responsible Indian family, and for her maintenance the Department will be prepared to pay a reasonable amount from the Welfare Appropriation. Please give this matter your consideration and let me have your recommendation.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Phelan\n\nre: Theresa Abraham\n\nI believe the department should express its appreciation to Father Simpson for taking care of this girl who is crippled as a result of infantile paralysis and I feel that some remuneration to him would be a proper charge against the Welfare Vote.\n\nP.

Payment at this rate will be effective from April 1, 1945, and you should forward a voucher for the amount, either monthly or at the end of every three months. Payment at the rate stated will be made from the Welfare Appropriation.\n\nIt is noted that you consider this girl may have to remain at the school for two years more. The provision mentioned is being made on the distinct understanding that her presence in the school does not adversely affect the other pupils.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nStuart Lake Agency,\nVanderhoof, B.C.,\nMay 29th, 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nYour file 163-1-10\n\nI have your letter of May 15th with regard to No. 0424 Theresa Abraham, Lejac Indian Residential School.\n\nThis crippled girl was absolutely illiterate when she entered Lejac School two years ago. She is most anxious to continue her studies and improve her education.\n\nI do not know any Indian home where Theresa would receive proper care and medical supervision necessary in her present physical condition.\n\nShe is improving slowly but surely. I would strongly recommend that she be allowed to remain in school and continue her studies at least for another two years. By that time her condition may be sufficiently improved so that she may be able to work in Coqualeetza Hospital as a maid.\n\nThe home conditions of this family at Bear Lake in a remote area are deplorable, and Theresa definitely does not wish to return home. Her mother died a few weeks ago.\n\nR. Howe\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 29, 1945.\n\nMr. R. Howe, Indian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 21st instant, the Department approves the admission of Julie Moise to the Lejac Indian Residential School. This admission is being approved owing to the unusual circumstances mentioned in your letter and is not to form a precedent for the admission of other children under school age.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nStuart Lake Agency,\nVanderhoof, B.C.,\nMay 21st, 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith application for admission to Lejac Indian Residential School for Julie Moise, 4 years, of the Necoslie Band. The parents of this child have been at loggerheads for several years and separated permanently, I believe, a short time ago. At the request of both parents, the Rev. Principal kindly consented to look after the child until home conditions improve.\n\nStephen, age 7, the only remaining child of this couple, is a patient at St. John Hospital undergoing treatment for tuberculosis. When authorized by Dr. Barclay it is desired that this boy should also be admitted to Lejac School.\n\nRH/H\nenc.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This boy is the son of Stephen Pool who was sentenced to life imprisonment for killing his wife in 1943.\n\nA brother and sister of this boy were admitted to Lejac in 1943 and William, who was only three years of age at the time was placed in the care of his grandmother, Mrs. Massettoo.\n\nOn my visit to this remote Band last week, I found the boy was not receiving adequate care and his aged grandmother refused to look after him any longer nor could I obtain a foster home with other Indians; consequently, I brought him out on the plane with me and placed him in the Lejac School.\n\nI would strongly recommend that his admission be approved and that he be allowed to remain in school until he is able to fend for himself.\n\nR. Howe,\nIndian Agent.\n\nRH/h\nenc.\nLejac Indian Residential School\nUnder Direction of The Oblate Fathers\n\nLejac, B.C.\n\nJune 22nd., 1945.\n\nRobert Howe, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Howe:\n\nFor the past several years there has been an increase every year in the number of children remaining here at the school for the two months of the summer vacation. This summer there will be about 44 children here all during vacation.\n\nThis condition is due to the fact that we have been accepting indigent and neglected children from the Stikine Agency, as well as orphans and neglected children from your own agency; and in the summer time these children have no place to go, or their homes are too far away or too remote to allow them to go home. We have also two incorrigibles from the Vancouver Agency.\n\nAs you can understand, this means a great deal of extra expense for us, for the feeding and clothing of these children, and for the necessary staff to look after them. No provision for this is made by the Department, because the grant now received covers only the ten months of the school year, as was stated in the House of Commons last August by the Hon. Mr. Crear.\n\nDuring the past winter we had a great deal of extra expense due to the crop failure of last year; and the prospects for a good crop this year are not very bright. Consequently, our resources are severely strained by the ordinary expenditures of the school year, without having the extra expense of taking care of such a large number of children for two whole months without any compensation. As far as I am aware, no other school has such a problem. Next year it will be still worse, for Mr. Sampson, Indian Agent at Telegraph Creek has notified me that he intends to send down seven more indigent children this fall; and I am extremely reluctant to refuse to accept these children.\n\nTherefore, I beg that you bring this matter to the attention of the proper authorities in the Indian Department with a view to obtaining a supplementary grant, possibly from the Welfare Branch, to assist us in taking care of these indigent children during the summer months.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. Alex. R. Simpson, O.M.I.\nPrincipal\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter received from the Rev. A.R. Simpson, Principal, Lejac Indian Residential School, applying for a supplementary grant for underprivileged children retained in the School during the vacation period.\n\nI can vouch for the circumstances as outlined in the Principal's letter and would recommend that a grant be made to care for these children during the summer holidays.\n\nRH/H enc.\n\nR.

This girl will be 16 in September, 1945, and although the mother is anxious for the girl to attend school for at least two terms, I do not recommend the admission unless the Department feels a special concession may be granted in this case to allow her to attend school until she is 18.

The girl has suffered from a discharging sore at the back of her right ear, which, according to a U.S. Army medical officer, is caused by a diseased condition of the bone, since last winter. From appearance the girl is obviously in need of expert medical attention. It is suggested that she proceed to Smithers Hospital for medical attention, and when her condition is improved, be sent to Lejac School. Faith, R.C.\n\nTo Lejac School, Viola Jack, age 13, of Atlin-Teslin Lake Band. This girl's father is apparently a pulmonary T.B. case and may be going to hospital shortly. The girl last winter suffered from a cataract-like condition of both eyes, and for a period had great difficulty in seeing. The trouble has cleared up to some extent but it is apparent that she needs medical attention to ensure that her eye-sight is protected. It is suggested that she also go to Smithers for medical attention, and ultimate admission to Lejac, as her faith is Roman Catholic.\n\nIt is planned to send these girls out under the care of Mrs. Henry, referred to in a previous letter as requiring medical attention in Prince Rupert. The cost of\nthe fares for Mabel Frank and Viola Jack will be about $50.00 each, plus about $10.00 to $15.00 possible expenses enroute, but there would be no matron's fee.

Well, here it is.\n\nEach Indian Residential school has a certain quota of pupils allotted to it by the Department of Indian Affairs. Our official number of pupils is 160. Each quarter we have to send in an attendance report, and, if the average daily attendance for the quarter is under 160 even by half a pupil, a corresponding amount is deducted from the per capita grant for the quarter in question. But, no matter how many children we have over our allotted number, nothing is paid for the extra pupils.\n\nMy request is that the per capita grant to the Residential Schools be based on the actual number of pupils present in the school. At the moment we have 192 children, but our grant is only for 160; so we have to carry the additional 32 children without any assistance from the Indian Department.\n\nThe objection may be raised that such an arrangement will cause the principals to overcrowd their schools in order to get the extra grant. Every single admission to a Residential School has to be authorised by Ottawa before the child can be placed on the rolls as a grant-earning pupil, so this gives the Department a means of controlling the pupilage in all the schools. Besides, it is a well known fact that a large proportion of the Indian children in Canada are without any facilities for education; therefore the schools should be encouraged to accept as many pupils as they can without detriment to the efficient operation of the school. Even crowded quarters in a Residential School are, in most cases, incomparably superior to the home accommodations.\n\nTrusting that I have made myself clear, and thanking you in advance for your valued interest, I remain,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.)

I hope you will strain your bowels of mercy and give at least a little measure of relief, even if you do not see your way clear to go all the way.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nW. Irvine,\nMember for Cariboo\nOttawa, November 27, 1945.\n\nDear Mr. Irvine:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of November 21st and also copy of a letter received by you from the Reverend A. R. Simpson, O.M.I., Principal of the Lejac Indian Residential School, sent forward therewith.\n\nThe position of Inspector of Indian Day and Residential Schools for the province of British Columbia has been vacant now for a couple of years. It is my understanding, however, that steps have been taken by the Civil Service Commission to have an Inspector appointed at an early date. Just as soon as this appointment is made, it is my intention to ask the Inspector to make a thorough investigation of a number of our residential schools, with the object of determining the actual enrolment that should be authorized in each case. In the meantime and until such an investigation has taken place, we shall be glad to allow supernumerary grants for an additional ten pupils at Lejac. This arrangement will, I feel sure, be measurably satisfactory to the Principal.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nWilliam Irvine, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nLejac Indian Residential School\nUnder Direction of The Oblate Fathers\nLejac, B.C.

The parents of this child have been separated for some time, Gloria staying with her mother, who is living with an Indian of the Stuart Lake Agency. The child's admittance to Lejac is the only way of her obtaining any education.\n\nYour early advise in the matter will be appreciated.\n\nS. Mallinson,\nIndian Agent.\nStikine Agency\n\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nApril 1, 1945.\n\nQUARTERLY REPORT\n\nSchools. Advice of the Departments approval of the admission of the two Etzerza girls to Cardross Residential School, and Sally Quash to St. George's School at Lytton, have recently been received. During recent months more parents have asked for admission of children to Lejac school but this is becoming unfair to the agencies near the school, which still have many children who could be admitted. There is need of a Roman Catholic school to service this agency and the Yukon.\n\nR.H. S. Sampson\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 20, 1946.\n\nMr. R.H.S. Sampson, Indian Agent, Telegraph Creek, B.C.\n\nI desire to refer to that section of your letter in which you recommend that Bertha Reid be placed in the Lejac Indian Residential School next May. Provided the girl is physically fit you may make the necessary arrangements to send her to the school mentioned and at the time stated.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nStikine Agency\n\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\nFebruary 19, 1946.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nNurse Dunn has reported the following case and asks for immediate action to prevent further contacts:\n\nIsobel Reid, age 30, unmarried Indian woman of Tahltan Band, and the mother of two children namely, Bertha, age 5, and a baby, age 16 months. Suspected of having pulmonary tuberculosis so sputum samples sent out for bacteriological examination. Report received from Provincial Laboratories February 16 states last two tests show positive sputum for pulmonary tuberculosis. This woman is coughing extensively, has weakness and night temperature, and has not menstruated since the birth of her last child, October 10, 1944.\n\nMiss Dunn has strongly recommended the isolation of the mother from the two children and steps have been taken to have the children cared for temporarily, but it is probable that 100 percent isolation will not be achieved owing to the fact that the mother's tent is close to the tent where the children will be staying, and there will doubtless be some visiting as neither the nurse nor myself can exercise any control or supervision. The camp in which Isobel Reid lives is some four miles from town and is difficult to reach, being across the Stikine River. There is no suitable house, or home, where the woman could be kept in Telegraph Creek. Neither is there anyone at the Camp who could be hired to take charge of Isobel Reid and look after her. This means that she must keep her own fire going, and do her cooking, so it is not possible to have her take the proper treatment of complete rest.\n\nAs the woman is an open case she is a menace to any camp or community in which she lives, as well as to her two small children. Her removal to Whitehorse Hospital at the earliest possible date is recommended.\nThe problem of finding a suitable home for the children also arises. The woman has only one sister, Mrs. Maggie Jackson, who already has eight children of her own and could not be burdened with two extra. It is therefore suggested that Bertha, age 5, be admitted to Lejac Residential School when navigation opens on the Stikine River. Mrs. Jackson can probably be persuaded to look after Bertha until that time. It may be possible to send one or two other children to Lejac at the same time.\n\nAt the present time the only suggestion I have concerning the baby, age 16 months, is the Catholic Home in Edmonton and it may be possible to arrange removal of this child with the Ward children whose removal was authorized by the Department's telegram of February 11.\n\nThe three separate recommendations contained in this letter are:\n\n(1) To hospitalize Isobel Reid in Whitehorse immediately pending removal to Miller Bay Hospital this coming summer. Cost of removal to Whitehorse will be about $100.00 including meals & hotel room enroute.\n\n(2) To admit Bertha Reid, age 5, to Lejac Indian Residential School next May. Cost, if combined with removal of other school children, about $125.00\n\n(3) To remove the baby to Catholic Institution in Edmonton, probably to travel as far as Whitehorse with mother, then join Ward children for trip to Edmonton. Cost approximately $50.00\n\nIf the Department approves these recommendations it would be appreciated if they could advise by night letter so that Isobel Reid can be removed from the proximity of her children as soon as possible. I am also anxious to know about the removal of the baby before final arrangements are made about removal of the Ward children previously referred to.\n\nR.H.S. Sampson,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 4th February, 1946.\n\nMr. S. Mallinson, Indian Agent, Hazelton, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 10th ultimo, the Department approves the admission of Gloria Derrick to the Lejac Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Department also approves the discharge of pupil No. 0360.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nGENERAL REPORT\nFor quarter ending March 31st., 1946.\n\nATTENDANCE\n\nDue to the number of children that had to go to the hospital the attendance average for the past quarter is slightly lower. This would have been much lower had it not been for the cooperation of Mr. Indian agent Howe in refusing many requests on the part of the parents to take their children out of school for one reason or another.\n\nMORALE\n\nThe children maintain a good spirit, and there has not been a single case of truancy since the beginning of the current school year. Some of the parents send letters to the children containing abuse of the school and its authorities; but the children do not seem to pay very much attention to such epistles.\n\nHEALTH\n\nThis has been the worst period with regard to the health of children in all my experience here. Early in February we had a flu epidemic with about 65 children being in bed at the same time. This was almost cleared up when another outbreak occurred at the beginning of March, during which we had 145 children in bed simultaneously with four Sisters and several other members of the staff. This was rather a terrible period. Now we have about 15 children still in bed running some fever. The children have been slow in shaking off the after effects of this flu, and are not entirely recovered even yet. I had the school doctor apply to the Department for a supply of vitamins for the children, but as yet we have had no response. Another request for a supply of tin tablets to counteract none in several of the children has also been ignored.\n\nDue to a series of accidents we have been unable to have an X-ray survey here this year, and this is particularly unfortunate because I feel sure that there are some very active T.B. cases among the children that should be detected and isolated.\n\nLIVESTOCK\n\nThe constant need for the purchasing of feed at high prices for the cattle is a serious drain on our resources. The winter has been a very long one and we still have over two feet of snow on the fields which means that it will be a long time before the cattle can be turned out to pasture.\n\nGENERAL REMARKS\n\nThe following items have been brought to the attention of the Department before in these quarterly reports without producing any reaction whatsoever; but I will repeat them again now.\n\n1. The hot water supply is absolutely inadequate for the needs of the children.\n\n2. Additional space is required at this school in the form of more dormitory and dining-room facilities; and a hall for indoor recreation. All this could be taken care of by the addition of a single wing to the present building.\n\n3. Due to the increasing difficulty in obtaining cordwood, and the oft repeated objections of the parents to their children having to work with firewood, it is suggested that the Department consider the possibility of converting the present heating system to an oil-burning installation.\n\nRev.

Howe,\nIndian Agent.\n\nRH/jf\nOttawa, May 8th, 1946.\n\nMr. R. Howe, Indian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 25th ultimo, you may inform the Principal of the Lejac, Indian Residential School, the Department approves the admission of James Prince.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nMrs. Hazel Brown, Indian woman of Tahltan Band, whose husband has been sent to hospital for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis, has requested that her daughter Rose, age 9 years, be admitted to an Indian residential school. Mrs. Brown is destitute and the removal of this child to school would be an assistance to her, as well as affording an opportunity for the child to be properly educated. This action is recommended by the undersigned.\n\nAs the child is of Roman Catholic faith, the nearest school to which she could be sent is Lejac. The cost of removal will be about $40.00, as she would be included in the party in which the Reid children, as referred to in my letter of April 4, 1946, are a part, and the same matron will be in charge of all the children.\n\nWill the Department please authorize this expense?\n\nR.H.S. Sempson,\nIndian Agent\n\nMAY 15 1946\nOttawa, May 17, 1946.\n\nMr. R.H.S. Sampson, Indian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of the 26th ultimo, the Department approves the admission of Rose Brown to the Lejac Residential School, provided she is physically fit. It is noted that it will cost approximately $40.00 for transportation.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI beg to refer the Department to their letter of May 17, file 163-1-10, in which they approved the admission of Rose Brown to Lejac Residential School.\n\nIn my letter of April 26 requesting this admission it was stated the child was of Roman Catholic faith. However, the mother now informs me that although the child has attended the Roman Catholic church for a few months she has not been baptised into the Roman Catholic faith, she further states that although she originally asked to have the girl sent to a Roman Catholic school she now wishes her to go to a Church of England school with her brother David, age 7. Both these children were baptised in the Anglican faith.\n\nIt is believed that the nearest Anglican residential school is probably at Alert Bay, or an alternative might be St. Georges at Lytton. It is suggested that if the Department approves the admission of these children to either of these schools, their removal be carried out at a time when some agency official or other reliable person is travelling to Vancouver. It would therefore be appreciated if the Department could grant authority for the admission now so that it may be on hand should an early opportunity present itself to send the children down. This plan is recommended in order to save the expense of a special escort for the children, for whom the cost of a return fare to Vancouver would be paid.\n\nThe cost of sending the children to Vancouver or nearby would be approximately $150.00\n\nR.H.S.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nLast week Mrs. Etzerza came here from Telegraph Creek as escort to two small children coming to this school. She herself has four children here now. There is another daughter, Irma, at home who is now 16 years old and who had had a certain amount of instruction in Day School.\n\nAccording to what Mrs. Etzerza told me, she applied to the local Indian Agent two years ago to have Irma sent to this school in order to get further education in the grades and some vocational training. The Indian Agent refused to make application on the grounds that the girl was already 14 years old, so it was not worth sending her down here for only two years. Irma still wants to come here, and I promised her mother that I would take the case up with you. I am sure that Ottawa would approve her admission for vocational training in Home Economics, Dressmaking and Hygiene, if it were proposed by you.\n\nAt the present time I am negotiating with a Registered Nurse in the hope that she will accept the position of School Nurse here. The Hon. Brooks Claxton informed the Joint Committee on the Indian Act that it was the intention of his department to employ qualified nurses to be stationed in the larger residential schools. I trust that this provision can be applied to this school. Your opinion on this matter will be much appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. Alex. R. Simpson, O.M.I.\nPrincipal\nAugust 27th, 1946.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nI would like to acknowledge receipt of the letter from Rev. Simpson, Principal of the Lejac School, dated August 19th, regarding Irma Etzerza, age 16. Admission to the school was refused on the grounds that the girl was really too old to benefit from two year's school, and it would also have meant a special trip with a matron to Lejac, the cost of which would have been about $150.00.\n\nI have just recently received an application from Mrs. Etzerza, mother of Irma, to send this girl to the Grouard Residential School Co-operative, where the girl would be given some work and would be allowed to stay for several years. This application has been forwarded to Bishop Coudert at Whitehorse who will advise me if they will accept her.\n\nI believe that if the Department is willing to authorize this expense of sending her out for further schooling that she might do better at the Grouard School as she is now 16 years old.\n\nRHS/EW\n\nR. H. S. Sampson,\nIndian Agent\nDear Reverend Father Simpson;\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of August 13th, regarding admission of Irma Etzerza to the Lejac Indian Residential School.\n\nThe matter has been taken up with Mr. Indian Agent Sampson and upon receipt of his reply, I shall advise you in this connection.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nFor D.

Sampson, Esq., Indian Agent, Telegraph Creek, B.C.\n\nWith reference to Reverend Principal Simpson's letter of August 13th, regarding admission of Irma Etzerza, it would appear that this girl may have been of the Anglican faith and, if such is the case, it is not understood why she and the other children would have been admitted to a Catholic institution.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would please advise me on the subject.\n\nfor D. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nDear Father Simpson O.U.I.\n\nYour letter reached the Indians before mine - concerning Tima Etzonga. I heard Mr. Simpson telling Mary Etzonga that Tima was arranged for school - she seems to agree or be forced that you are willing to help her at hopes even if one to two or more.\n\nI hate sending Tima now would simply extra expenses - she need not be accompanied since there is a boat girl cooking in the steamer boat, who could look after her properly and put her aboard the coast boat. She could be looked after in August by Brother Carroll\n\nSo don't give up. The last boat on the steamer will be around the 10th of October. I am sure would like Tima to stay a year or two in Hope. That would be a great help to her and to the family. She is actually a good little girl.\n\nBest regards to all the Telegraph Creek children and to the good Sisters.

Several times witnesses before the Joint Commission in Ottawa have recommended the extension of the school age. At any rate, under present regulations a child may remain in school with the consent of the Department until the age of 18 years.\n\nTherefore, I beg that you immediately instruct Mr. Sampson to have this girl sent out to school. As navigation in that area will soon close immediate action is necessary; and I would suggest that you send a night letter.\n\nBoth the local Missionary and the mother of this girl are anxious that she have the chance to come here.\n\nThanking you in advance for your assistance in this matter, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev.

If we cannot receive satisfaction through your office I am sure you will understand if I take the matter up with Mr. Neary in Ottawa.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. Alex. R.

Unfortunately the Indian Agent, when writing about this case did not advise of the family's baptism into the Catholic faith and we followed the same procedure as we have previously where the situation was reversed and it was proposed to admit Catholic children to a Protestant Institution.\n\nThere was also the question of permitting an Indian girl of this age to travel alone for a journey of this nature.\n\nAgent Sampson thought that as the girl's mother applied to have her sent to Grouard Residential School this would meet her situation and he referred it to you but I have not been advised of the outcome.\n\nNo doubt the Department will instruct the Indian Agent in the matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nBishop J.L.Coudert,O.M.I.,\nLejac Indian Residential School,\nLEJAC, B.C.\n\nFor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI enclose herewith a file of correspondence regarding the admission of a girl of the Tahltan Band in the Sukine Indian Agency to Lejac Indian Residential School.\n\nAt the time the writer inspected this Agency in 1941 this girl was attending the Tahltan seasonal day school operated under the auspices of the local Anglican missionary and the family were considered of that faith. She is now sixteen years of age.\n\nAn application for her admission was received from the Reverend Principal of Lejac in August and was referred to the Indian Agent, Mr. Sampson, who advised, and I believe with a great deal of reason, that she was really too old to benefit a great deal from the two year period of training proposed, and that the cost of sending her with necessary escort would have amounted to $150; also, that the girl's mother has applied for her admission to Croscad Residential School Co-operative, the location of which is unknown at this office. It will be noted that Agent Sampson forwarded it to Bishop Coudert, but I have not heard of the result. In the meantime the Reverend Principal has been very insistent in the matter and apparently has accepted the impression created by his missionary, Father Forget, at Telegraph Creek, that the Indian Agent is obstructing them unreasonably, and both he and Bishop Coudert have adopted a somewhat threatening attitude in the matter.\n\nAgent Sampson knows the girl, and would have been unwise in agreeing, in any event, to her proceeding on this lengthy journey alone. It is a days journey down the Sukine to Wrangell, Alaska, where she would certainly need more protection, in this town, than would likely be afforded by the cook on the boat. There is no assurance that the arrival of the river boat will coincide with the steamer to Prince Rupert, and several days may elapse. She would be alone on the Prince Rupert boat which...\nwould be undesirable. On arrival there she would separately be met and cared for by Father Carroll until the train left at 1:30 p.m., but would be unescorted until it arrived at Lejac late the following afternoon. Under these circumstances I hesitate to recommend approval of her admission without an escort and it is unlikely that the escort could be able to return owing to navigation closing on the Stikine. It might be possible for the Agent to arrange for her care by some reliable person going out for the winter.\n\nIf you wish to approve of her admission it would be appreciated if you would telegraph Mr. Sampson direct.\n\nFor D.

Sampson, Indian Agent,\nTELEGRAPH CREEK, B.C.\n\nSusie Johnson born 16 November 1931\n\nIn view of the facts presented in your letter of 6 November 1946 under file 0-11/1, the Department feels that the cost of sending Susie Johnson to Lejac Residential School for one year does not warrant her admission there.\n\nFrom your letter we would conclude that she is the only member of the family now recognized as an Indian under the Indian Act. Is there any possibility of her father assuming his responsibility for this child as mentioned in paragraph five of your letter?\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nNovember 22, 1946.\n\nW.T.\n\nRe question \"Are we responsible for some going?\"\n\nYes, as she was not removed from the membership role of the Atlin-Teslin Band with her parents and other members of her family and is still a Band member. See letter dated May 23, 1944, on file 62-158 herewith.\n\nT.R.L. MacInnes.\nStikine Agency  \nAirmail  \n\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.  \n6 November, 1946.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nAn application has been received from the guardians of Susie Johnson, born 16th November 1931, of Atlin Band, for her admission to Lejac Residential School.\n\nSusie is the daughter of Albert Johnson, late of Atlin Band, who was removed from membership in the Band by authority of Departmental letter 62-158 of May 23, 1944, for residence in Alaska for a period exceeding five years without formal permission.\n\nThis girl has for several years lived with Mr. and Mrs. John Anderson of Atlin Band who now wish her to be admitted to school.\n\nThe cost of sending Susie to Lejac School from Atlin would be about $250.00 including return fare for escorting matron, plus matron's wages for two weeks (if any). The guardians, who are not very well off, apparently expect the expense will be borne by the department. There would also be an expense of $65.00 for returning this girl in about a year's time.\n\nIn view of the age of this girl,(15) it is not felt that removal for a year or two schooling warrants the high cost involved. Besides this the girl's father has not supported her for at least five years, and has abandoned her to the care of relatives entirely. Johnson maintains a home in Juneau, Alaska, and could very well keep the girl there and send her to school. He earns good wages most of the year from fishing and mining.\n\nIt would be appreciated if the Department will cont'd.\nadvise this office of their views in this case as soon as possible.\n\nR.H.S. Sampson,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 20 November 1946.\n\nMr. J.V.

I was informed by Mr. Indian Agent Boys of the Babine Agency that the Department had declined to approve the admission of these children on the grounds that they were not Catholics; although they were sent here at the request of their mother. They have relatives here who are Catholics. These children have since been sent home.\n\nRe Nos. 0510 and 0511. These two children are from the Stikine Agency, and the \"Application for Admission\" forms were sent to Mr. Sampson quite a long time ago.\n\nRe Nos. 503-504 and 505. These are all from the Babine Agency. At the time Mr. Boys informed me that Nos. 506 and 0521 had been refused admission, he told me that the Dept. had approved the admission of No. 506. The completed forms for Nos. 504 and 503 were delivered to Mr. Boys on September 24th.\n\nI might remark here that it is difficult to work with Mr. Boys. I have written him three times about two girls who have not returned to school and who are actually in Hazelton, and have not yet received any reply from him, nor has he taken any action in the matter.\n\nRe No. 496. The admission of this boy was approved by the Department under date of August 6th. The forms were sent in direct by the Indian Agent, consequently his serial number was not given at the time. This may have caused some confusion.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. Alex. R. Simpson, O.M.I.\nPrincipal\n\nIndian Affairs.

With reference to the above, at the a.m., of the 12th instant, the following letter was received at this office:\n\nBEGINS:\nDear Sir Re Martha Irene JOSEPH December 11th, 1946.\nIt appears that the above child, born August 17th, 1935, daughter of Dan Joseph of Tsitlak Reserve, a Roman Catholic, was taken care of by Mrs Kate of Kispiox and later by Mrs Alfred William (Matilda) Brown of Hazelton. She was enrolled as a pupil of Lejac Indian Residential School but failed to return and is reportedly attending Hazelton Indian Day School.\n\nThe Rev Principal of Lejac Residential School requires her return and under Section 10(2) of the Indian Act he is on solid ground in protesting her attendance at school under Protestant auspices, and I have no option but to require her return to his school in the absence of any valid reason why she should not do so.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would kindly take whatever action is necessary to ensure her return to Lejac School.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) James Coleman\nR.C.M.P.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nSub-Division\n\n2. In the p.m., of the 12th instant, Mr & Mrs Alfred W. BROWN, the foster parents of this child, were interviewed at their home on the Hazelton Indian Reserve and were informed of the contents of the above letter and were instructed to have the child returned to the Lejac Residential School. They at first were reluctant to comply with the instructions but after some discussion, they stated that she would be returned to the school in question. However, they requested that she be permitted to remain at home for the Christmas Holidays in order to give them time to get her clothing in proper condition and also give the girl the opportunity of spending the Christmas Season amongst her relatives and friends.\n\nThis request was reported to Inspector Coleman on the 12th instant, and he advised that under the circumstances he thought it would be in order for the girl to stay at home for the period requested but that she must report to the Lejac School not later than January 4th, 1947. The foster parents were informed accordingly.\n\n3. Please set D.D.D. for report covering the departure of this girl for the Lejac School to read 15-1-47.

MacKay\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nStikine Agency\n\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\n\n13 December 46.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver.\n\nI am in receipt of copies of correspondence under your file 215.12.5341 in connexion with sending Irma Etzerza to Lejac School.\n\nIt is rather surprising to learn that so much concern was shown by the members of the R.C. Church in this area over getting this girl out to school, and I find it very difficult to understand why not one of these gentlemen approached the R.C.T.S. with a request or recommendation for her removal. In view of her age (16) it is all the more surprising as only this year the Reverend Principal of Lejac discharged two of our children at 16, one of them a girl Evelyn Reid, whose both parents are dead, and the other a motherless boy with a very poor home. (Robert Quock). If I had known of his desire to keep the children until 18 years of age I certainly would have urged he keep both these children. Irma Etzerza has a good home compared with what Evelyn Reid had to look forward to.\n\nMrs Mary Etzerza asked this office once, in the summer of 1945, if Irma might be sent to Lejac school. She was advised that owing to Irma's age (then nearly 15) I was not anxious to send her for only a year or two's schooling. Irma had at that time only been baptised into the Roman Catholic Church for a matter of a very few weeks. Early this spring Mrs Etzerza asked about sending her daughters Peggy (18) and Irma to the Grouard Residential School in Alberta where girls are kept after they are 16 to learn special trades. Enquiries were made about this proposal and from the report received from the Reverend Principal of that institution I feel that Irma would have had a much better chance of learning something constructive. The girl Peggy could also have gone there.\n\nI think it would perhaps be advisable to clear up any doubt about this office obstructing the members of the R.C. Church, and exhibiting personal animosity in dealing with this case. This is absolutely false and the Reverend Principal of Lejac certainly has no grounds upon which to make such an assertion. This is especially true when one considers that he did not even communicate with this office concerning the case. Neither did Rev. Forget discuss the case at all. My treatment of this particular case was quite impartial, and if anything, this family has received considerable sympathetic attention owing to Mrs. Etzerza being a widow with a large family.\n\nIt might also be of interest to mention that Mrs. Etzerza states that the Rev. Principal of Lejac told her Irma would be allowed to stay at Lejac until perhaps she was 25 years old, and this, she claims induced her to request Father Simpson to admit her.\n\ncont'd.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In the complete absence of any communication about this case, except your request of September 25th regarding Irma's religion, I was very uncertain about the matter but presumed your office had arranged about sending Irma out, owing to poor communication with this point. The girl was sent to Lejac October 17th under care of Miss Florence Inkster, an Indian girl travelling to Prince Rupert.\n\nR.H.S.

Father Godfrey of Smithers to Lejac Residential School probably last month \"because she was getting in trouble there\" (Reserve or Smithers) at that time being in the care of her sister, Mrs Clara George, who was drawing her family allowance although it is stated that she did very little for the girl. Father Donz says that she attended school at Hagwilget very irregularly. Both parents being dead the signing of the admission will devolve upon the Indian Agent.\n\nLong standing department instructions are to the effect that no child is to be removed from a Reserve on which a day school is operating to a residential school without first taking the matter up with them, explaining why such action would be desirable for the child. Not having personal knowledge of this girl's circumstances I am not in position to make a report, particularly as I am lacking transportation.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you could make inquiries on the reserve with a view to supporting the desirability of this girl being transferred from the care of her sister to the school in question and let me have same in duplicate.\n\nYours truly,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\n2. A number of complaints have been received in the past regarding the conduct of this girl particularly in connection with her irregular attendance at the Taltak Indian day school. The mother, when alive, and the sister since the death of the mother, have been warned regarding the girl's non-attendance at the school. Both of these relations claimed the girl was difficult to handle and would not heed them when instructed to go to school. Since the closing of the Taltak School in June, 1946, this girl, of course, has received no educational instructions.\n\n3. On November 18th, 1946, Father Bonze, O.M.I., of the Taltak Indian Reserve, called at this office and advised that this girl had left her sister's home on the reserve and had gone to Smithers, B.C., and would not return. He stated that she was employed in a Chinese restaurant, and, as this did not appear to be a proper environment for a girl of this age, he and the sister asked that she be return to the Reserve or moved to better employment.\nImmediate enquiries were made regarding this complaint and it was ascertained that the B.C.P. Police, Smithers, B.C., were endeavoring to locate the girl and no assistance was required by this detachment. However, whilst on patrol in Smithers, B.C., on the 21-11-46, the N.C.O./Cpl. B.C.P. Police was interviewed and he stated that the girl had not been found but she was not working in any of the restaurants at that point. He advised that a sharp lookout was being maintained and when the girl was found, appropriate action would be taken. Shortly following this interview, the B.C.P. Police informed me that the girl had been taken by Father Godfrey and sent to the Lejac Residential School.\n\nThe home life and general environment of this girl have been very poor and very little control of her activities could be maintained by her relations. Past complaints of her conduct have been minor but she is now reaching the age where she could get into a great deal of trouble unless positive measures are taken to correct the situation. There is no doubt that the enrolment of this juvenile in an appropriate institution will be of great benefit to her.\n\nDuplicate copies of this report handed to the Inspector of Indian Agencies at Hazelton, B.C.\n\nInspector J.

I received enclosed Admission Form for Violet Mary Wilson, aged fifteen, apparently the illegitimate daughter of Christine Alex of Tsitsik Reserve who died last February.\n\nAs there is a day school on the Reserve, temporarily closed but expected to open shortly, and I had no knowledge of the girl nor transportation to make enquiries, I referred the matter to the local R.C.M.P. officer, asking him to make enquiries and his report is so complete that there is little that I can add to it. It clearly indicates that the girl will be better in the school for another year although I am of the opinion that the missionaries should consult this office before removing a girl to a residential school without permission as in this case. Such a procedure is likely to give rise to complications.\n\nHaving no relatives I have signed the admission in the usual way and would recommend approval of same.\n\n(James Coleman)\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, 21 January 1947.\n\nMr. J.C.

Mrs. George states that she has been acting as foster mother to Margaret Joseph, born September 1, 1942.\n\nMargaret Joseph is the daughter of the late Mary Pierre who died in 1943, since when, the child has been cared for by a succession of relatives. Sam Pierre married Mary Tom in 1936, shortly afterwards they separated and Sam Pierre went to live with another Indian woman while Mary, nee Tom, had one or two more children by another man thought to be Frank Joseph. Since the mother's death the child has been unwanted wherever she went. The present foster mother, Mrs. Thomas George, requests a place for the child in Lejac School. Father Simpson states his willingness to accept her in view of the circumstances and despite her tender years, and I recommend her placement at the school.

It is stated that his mother requires his assistance as she is a widow with several other children. The information on our file indicates that this boy is only fourteen years of age.\n\nPlease let me know what progress he is making in his school work and if you consider his services would be of any value to his mother at the present time.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. Alex. R. Simpson,\nPrincipal,\nLeJac Indian Residential School,\nLEJAC, B.C.\nOttawa, March 24th, 1947.\n\nMr. R.H.S. Sampson, Indian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B.C.\n\nWe have your letter of the 27th ultimo with reference to the discharge of Ira Etzerza from the Lejac School.\n\nWe are writing the Principal of the Lejac School to ascertain what progress the boy is making. Our information is that he is only fourteen years of age and if he is making good progress at school it seems unreasonable to make him sacrifice his opportunity for the rest of the family.\n\nI would be interested in knowing the age of the other children who are residing with the mother. What does the mother do to provide a living for the other members of the family?\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nIra Etzerza, age 14, of Tahltan Band, was admitted to Lejac Residential School in July, 1944, and now his mother is asking that he be discharged and returned home to assist her.\n\nAt the time this boy was sent to school his mother was a widow, destitute, and with eleven children, eight of whom were under sixteen years of age. The oldest son, age 19, was helping his mother at that time, but has since moved away from the family, leaving the mother with no one to help her in providing wood, in gardening, or in hunting.\n\nThe mother, Mrs. James Low, was married last fall to a white who subsequently failed to provide support for the family, resulting in his wife leaving him and returning to her former home at Telegraph Creek. She is without support and certainly needs the assistance of this boy Ira.\n\nAs Ira has only one more term to attend until he will be sixteen years of age, and owing to the need of him at home, it is recommended he be discharged at the end of the current term, and returned to Telegraph Creek. The cost of returning him will be about $60.00 including transportation and meals. Will the Department please authorize this expense if the boy's return is approved?\n\nR.H.S. Sampson,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 20, 1947.\n\nMr. R.

He is quite willing and apt in manual work.\n\nHowever, I understand that there is an older brother, Ralph, age 19 years, who is still living at home; and who should be of some assistance to his mother.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

Since this boy became 16 years of age he has not lived with his family for more than a few weeks, and although he has earned good revenue from his trap-line he has not assisted either his widowed mother, or his infant brothers.\n\nThe advisability of bringing the boy Ira back from school was thoroughly considered before application was made on February 27, and it was felt that in view of all attending circumstances his return home was best. The fact that he can probably be promoted to Grade VI next year is of no particular advantage to him when he returns to his home. His livelihood will be made from trapping, hunting, and labouring. As a matter of fact he will likely learn more of value to him in future life if he returns home and goes out trapping next winter. It has been found in the past that if these young boys do not learn the art of trepping in their early teens they have some difficulty mastering it later. Apart from these facts there is also the urgent need of the widowed mother for the assistance of the boy. She lives at the old Tahltan village, a mile from the nearest camp and thirteen miles from town, and has only her oldest daughter, 22, who is not well, and four small boys, the oldest of whom is 6 yrs. She has absolutely no revenue and depends upon her garden and relief rations to feed the children. All the wood-cutting and other heavy work has to be done by herself.\n\nI trust . . . .\nI trust the Department will see fit to authorize Ira's discharge from Lejac School in the light of the foregoing facts.\n\nR.H.S. Sampson,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 30th, 1947.\n\nMr. H. E. Anfield, Indian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nWe have received the following letter from Indian Agent Sampson:\n\n\"Replying to the Department's letter of April 25th, file 163-1-10 (WT 1) as this warrant was issued by the Skeena Agency in June 1946 will the Department please advise the cost of the fare from Prince Rupert, B.C. to Wrangell, Alaska.\"\n\nOur records show that the fare of Susie Carlick from Lejac to Prince Rupert was $7.30. We have no warrant on file to show what the fare was from Prince Rupert to Wrangell. The principal tells us that all the arrangements of transportation were made by you directly. Kindly then notify Indian Agent Sampson of the cost of the transportation.\n\nWe are sending a copy of this letter to Mr. Sampson.\n\nBernard F.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nKB/HM.\nLEJAC INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nGENERAL REPORT\nFor quarter ending June 30th., 1947.\n\nATTENDANCE\n\nThe level of attendance was very constant all through the quarter. Five new pupils were admitted and two others returned from the hospital early in April.\n\nMORALE\n\nThe children have shown good spirit all through the past school year. If only the parents were as satisfied as their children our task here would be much easier. During the whole of the year just ended we did not have a single case of truancy.\n\nHEALTH\n\nThere was very little sickness during this period. Only two children had to be hospitalised, and that for comparatively minor ailments. Since last February we have had a qualified nurse (she is not a Sister) on the staff; which has been a considerable drain on our resources since she has to have quite a high salary; but she has done well and seems quite capable.\n\nAt the end of May we had an X-ray clinic at which about 60 of the children had plates made.\n\nGENERAL REMARKS\n\n1. This summer we are having the whole exterior woodwork and the roof of the main building repaired and painted - thanks to the generosity of the Department. The roof will also be rebuilt - the Dept. paying for the materials and the School paying for the labour.\n\n2. We expect to complete the four-roomed house for the farm manager and his family which was started last year, and for which it has been extremely difficult to obtain materials. All of the work was done by the Manual Training Instructor and the boys.\n\n3. All of the cement floors in the basement are to be painted this summer - at our own expense.\n\nRev. Alex. R. Simpson, O.M.I.\nPrincipal\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nWith reference to your letter of June 30th, 1947, file 163-1-10 (WT 4), this is to advise that the fare from Prince Rupert to Wrangell for Susie Carlick was $14.56.

Welfare Training\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\nDear Mr. Neary,\n\nIn reply to your letter of Dec 5th, I have accepted a boy and girl sent here by the Magnetola at Smithers. When Major MacKay visited the school last month, I advised him of this fact. He was not in favour of accepting this type of pupil, and pointed out the complications that could take place. Mr. Horn, the Indian agent, was present at this talk. I called him on the phone this morning to verify my memory. From this I concluded that it was not the policy of the Department to accept this type. So when the Boys asked me to take two more they were refused. If the Department is in favour of accepting these boys I am certainly willing to co-operate. However, I am not willing to take the full responsibility.\nLejac Indian Residential School\nUnder Direction of The Oblate Fathers\nLejac, B.C.\n\nwithout a ruling from the Department:\nFrom the last paragraph of your letter\nI conclude that it may be taken as\na ruling to accept the two children\nMr. Boys wishes to send. I will write\nto him by this mail.\n\nMajor MacKay stated that the\nschool could not be made the custodian\nof their children. Is there any legal\ndifficulty in such cases. Would you\nadvise me on this point.\n\nThanking you for past favours,\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.P. Mulvihill, O.S.B.\nOttawa, December 18, 1947.\n\nMr. J.V. Boys, Indian Agent,\nHazelton, B.C.\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 17th of November and our reply of December 5th with reference to placing certain Indian boys in the Lejac School. Father Mulvihill advises us that he has asked you to send the boys to whom you refer in your previous communication.\n\nHowever, the point has been raised that sending this type of boy to an Indian residential school might seriously affect the discipline of the school. We are inclined to feel that in handling cases of this kind only those boys should be sent to a residential school who have committed offences of a minor nature and have not previously appeared in court.\n\nWe do not want the feeling to grow among the Indians that our residential schools are in the same class with the Provincial Industrial School to which offenders against the law are committed. We will, therefore, depend on you to exercise great discretion regarding the type of boy in the class under discussion, that should be sent to an Indian residential school rather than allow the law to take its usual course in committing them to provincial institutions.\n\nCopy of this letter is being sent to Father Mulvihill and we also enclose a copy of our letter to him.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, December 18, 1947.\n\nDear Father Mulvihill:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 11th instant, we appreciate the action you have taken in notifying Indian Agent Boys to send the two Indian boys to whom he referred in his letter. As stated in my letter of December 5th we feel that when the offences charged are of a minor nature and the offenders have not previously appeared in court, there should be no harm in placing them in a residential school.\n\nI enclose for your information a copy of another letter being forwarded to the Indian Agent.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J.F.

The Department feel that it would be in the best interests of this girl to remain in the Lejac School for at least another year.\n\nUnder these circumstances we are not prepared to grant her discharge at the present time.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\n\nc/o to Father Mulvihill.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nMrs. Antonia Jack of Atlin Band has applied for the discharge of her daughter, Susie, who will be 14 on the 19th July, from Lejac Indian Residential School. Susie was admitted in 1941 and has been at school continually since. She has attained Grade 6.\n\nMrs. Jack's reason for requesting the girl's discharge is that she requires her to help at home. Mrs. Jack is currently pregnant and feels that she should have her daughter's help in looking after the younger children.\n\nWhile in Atlin recently, this case was discussed at some length with the Mother and Step-father of this girl, when every effort was made to make them see the wisdom of leaving the girl in school until she had graduated, to give her an opportunity to carry on to higher education or a vocation if she so desires, and for that reason her discharge is not recommended.\n\nThe Principal of Lejac School reports that this student is well mannered and applies herself to her studies and other work. In view of this it seems that this student will have a good chance of benefiting by further education.\n\nThe parents expect the cost of returning this girl will be borne by the Department. It is estimated this expense will amount to just under $100., providing she returns home without an escort, but owing to her age it might be wiser to have her escorted by a responsible adult as the journey consumes several days by boat and train. If the Department feels this pupil's discharge is warranted will they please advise by Air Mail, at the same time authorizing the expense.\n\nR.H.S.

They have since been under the care of a sister, Emma Dennis, age 21, but a certain amount of neglect is evident, particularly in feeding them. Emma Dennis is an unmarried mother, and the general living conditions of the group are not satisfactory. There are no other close relations in a position to undertake the guardianship of these two children, so it is felt they will be growing up under more beneficial surroundings if they are sent to a residential school.\n\nThree older children of this family were admitted to Lejac Indian Residential School in 1944, and this seems the best institution to which to send Veronica and Adolph who are also of Roman Catholic faith.\n\nRemoving these children will involve hiring a matron, and the complete cost including fares, expenses enroute, and return of matron is expected to total $170.00. As far as can be determined there will not be any other admissions to Lejac School this season, but if there are the children will also be sent down with the same group. It is planned to send as matron an Indian woman who has four children in Lejac School now; this will give her a visit with her children, and also enable her to have medical attention while in Prince Rupert.\n\nIf the Department approves this action...\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\nJuly 13/48.\n\naction will they please authorize the expense by Airmail via Vancouver, B.C.?\n\nAs it is not possible to have the children medically examined at Telegraph Creek it is planned to have them thoroughly examined, and X-rayed on arrival in Prince Rupert.\n\nR.H.S.

The distance is about 900 miles, and takes from four to five days' travel by aircraft, boat, and train. The cost of sending the children to Lejac will run into nearly $300.00 by the time the return fare of a matron is paid.\n\nThere is a provincial public school in Atlin which I am sure would admit these children until they can be sent to Teslin. They have accepted native children in the past.\n\nIf the children are sent to Lejac at this time it is likely they would have to be transferred to Teslin later, at considerable expense.\n\nNo action is being taken until the Department's instructions are received.\n\nR.H.S.

The parents lived together commonlaw for many years, but when Rosso's health began to fail rather more than a year ago Margaret Joseph left him. He kept the two boys and has looked after them very well. Recently, however, he wrote me that his health is now such that he is no longer employable and cannot care for the boys. I had the case investigated by the Provincial Welfare Branch who reported that the man's statements were in all respects true.\n\nI would suggest that the best solution from the boys' point of view would be to place them in Lejac Residential School and I have written to Fr. Mulvihill, Principal, in this matter. I feel sure that he will accept Henry and I hope that he may also take Lawrence despite his tender age.\n\nI recommend acceptance of these two boys and trust that the applications may have your endorsement.\n\nW.V.

(RG 10, Volume 6446, file 881-10, part 9)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nMrs. Elizabeth Williams, of the Atlin Band, has made application for the admission of her children Anna age 14, Michael Lawrence age 8, and Andrew age 6, to Lejac Indian Residential School.\n\nThe circumstances in this case are as follows. During the latter part of December the father, Stephen Williams, was found to have tuberculosis. Williams was in turn removed to Miller Bay Hospital for treatment. Prior to his removal, the three school age children were attending the local Public School. However, when the local School Board learned of the father's condition they decided it advisable to discharge the children in the event they may have contacted the disease.\n\nApart from the three applicants for admission, there are four other children in this family. Jackie age 19, Patricia age 4, Mary age 16 and an infant Jimmy. Now that the family head is unable to provide or care for this large family, the admission of the three school age children would relieve the mother of a considerable burden. In addition the small dwelling in which they live is inadequate for their number. Although the eldest son will be able to provide a little assistance, for the most part this family will be entirely dependent on this office.\n\nWhile the admission of these children Anna, Michael and Andrew would be most beneficial in many ways the cost of their fares from Atlin to Lejac would be considerable, approximately $350.00. There is also the possibility that the proposed school at Lower Post may be completed this fall and that their admission theremight be more practical. In the event the Department may authorize this expenditure, Father Arsenault, O.M.I., Atlin, has written to the Principal of Lejac enquiring about possible accommodation for these children.\n\nMay this office be advised if the Department will approve this application?\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept.

As soon as they are approved by the Medical Officer you may arrange to send the children to Lejac. It is noted that the cost of their transportation will be approximately $350.\n\nWhen the Lower Post Residential School is completed these children can be returned to that school if the mother so desires. It is hoped that you can arrange for the children to be sent to Lejac before the end of March and the account for their transportation forwarded to us in order that payment can be made from the appropriation for the current fiscal year which ends March 31, 1950.\n\nBernard F.

Lee Cochran, Fort St. James, B.C.\n\nI wish to refer to your letter of May 19th, 1952, advising that the Department has deleted $21.96 from the above Voucher, charged for conveying school children from Fort St. James, B.C., to the Lejac Residential School, a distance of \"156\" miles.\n\nMr. Cochran was authorised by myself to make this trip to convey the Moise children to Lejac. The mother of these children suffered a hemorrhage and was admitted as an emergency case to the Miller Bay Hospital.\n\nFoster care could not be found for these children. Therefore, it was necessary to take them to Lejac School immediately by car. No other means of transportation was available at the time and under my instructions, Mr. Cochran transported the children to Lejac.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, I trust the Department will remit the amount of $21.96 in payment for this trip.\n\nR.

Therefore there was no alternative, but to admit them to the Lejac Residential School.\n\nR. Howe,\nIndian Superintendent.\nMay 19, 1952.\n\nMr. R. Howe,\nSupt.

Indian Agency,\nVanderhoof, B.C.,\n\nThe Department approves\nthe discharge of the following children from\nthe Lejac Indian Residential School:\n\n# 467 Paul Damien\n475 Russel Alex\n0548 Madeline Antoine\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nLejac Indian Residential School\nUnder Direction of The Oblate Fathers\nLejac, B.C.\n\nSept. II/52\n\nP. Phalen, Supt.,\nEducation Division,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Phalen: RE: Circular dated July 23/52.\n\nI have given careful consideration to the above circular regarding the admission of pupils into the Residential School.\n\nI am particularly concerned over this paragraph: \"Before accepting any child in a residential school for the first time, the Principal must have the regular application and certificate of health completed, signed by the Indian Superintendent and approved by the Dept.\"\n\nIn this country of vast distances and difficult communications this paragraph is hard to follow to the letter. To give a specific instance,\n\nA group of children were brought by their parents to Fort McLeod. They had travelled four days and five nights by way of the Findlay and Parsnip Rivers. They were met by car at Fort McLeod and transported 195 miles to this school. Among them were some new pupils and the application forms were signed by the parents when they parted from them at Fort McLeod.\n\nIn bringing such to the school it would seem that the above paragraph is not being carried out. As I would interpret it a doctor would have to go to Fort McLeod, examine the children, fill the report and send same to the Superintendent who would then forward it to Ottawa. Only on its return could the children be brought to the school. What is to be done with them in the meantime? If they return with their parents over the four day and five night trip they will not be seen again until next Spring. Thus a year of school is wasted and probably by next Spring they would need another physical examination before being admitted. In practise they were brought here to the school to await the doctors examination and the admission papers are now being completed for forwarding to Ottawa.\n\nToday two children arrived unannounced via C.N.R. from Grassy Plains. No doctor's examination,\nLejac Indian Residential School\nUnder Direction of The Oblate Fathers\nLejac, B.C.\n\nno admission papers, just boy and girl. Their parents travelled a considerable distance to reach the railway station and no doubt by now are on their way back. Should we put the children on the next train and return them taking the chance that they may miss their parents and so be stranded? What better can we do than accept them await the doctors examination and prepare the admission papers to be signed when the parents are contacted. That may take from one week to a month.\n\nThe circular states that no grant can be claimed for such children until admission papers have been approved by Ottawa. This seems to be a severe penalty on the school for trying to act in the best interests of the children.\n\nIf the parents could be educated to register their children six months or a year before the actual date of entrance the prescriptions of the circular could be observed. However that is going to entail quite an effort and I doubt if it is feasible with the Indians of this country.\n\nWe are preparing the admission forms to the best of our ability and forwarding them to Ottawa as soon as it is feasible. I trust that you will appreciate our difficulty and allow grant for the month of September for those accepted.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\nG.F.

In view of this fact we are disallowing the per capita grant claimed for them on the September Return.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would arrange to secure these applications and forward them to this office for consideration. When the admissions are approved, you will be advised accordingly and the Principal may then claim retroactive grant for these children on the December Quarterly Return.\n\nAs pupils # 522 and 0656 were in residence during June, the school is entitled to 62 days grant for the months of July and August for them. We are consequently allowing this amount on the Return.\n\nAs pupil # C584 was not in residence during June, we are therefore, disallowing the 62 days claimed for her on the September Return. We are allowing the 30 days for September.\n\nThe Department approves the discharge of the following pupils:\n\n# 596 # 0461 # 0486\n612 0477 0495\n0433 0482 0499\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nMPT/RM\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nSir,\u2014\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child:\nEnglish name:\nAge:\nName of Band:\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid:\nFather's full name and No.:\nMother's full name and No.:\nParents living or dead:\nState of child's health:\nReligion:\nDoes applicant speak English?\nPreviously attended:\nschool for years\n\nI hereby certify that the above application for admission has been read over and interpreted to the parent or guardian and that the contents were understood by him or her and that I witnessed his or her signature to this document.\n\nSignature of Missionary or other Witness\n\n*Principal or other official of the school must not sign as witness.\n\nNote\u2014All the above particulars must be fully given, especially the \"Name of Band,\" \"No. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid\" and \"Religion.\" The minimum age for admission is seven (7) years, except in the case of an orphan, destitute or neglected child.

Over the years and after a few unfortunate accidents at the school these Indian parents reached a state of mind where they would not let their children attend Lejac as they thought the child would either die there or return home sick. This I know was not correct and after much propaganda and persuasion four families volunteered to send their children. I hope they will be favourably impressed so that next year I might admit other needy cases without too much trouble.\n\nApplications for admission are, in this case, being forwarded after the children are in school as it was not known until the last minute whether any of these children would attend. Once they made up their minds and reached the school Rev. Fr. Kelly took them in immediately less there should be a change of mind while waiting for Departmental approval.\n\nThe admissions are as follows:\n\n1. Magdalene WEST - The father operates a logging camp where the children would receive no schooling.\n2. Doris WEST\n3. Catherine ABRAHAM\n4. Frances Susan ABRAHAM\n5. Cecile ABRAHAM\n6. Mildred WILLIAMS - Member of Old Fort but lives on Chelslata Reserve. No school on either reserve.\nMother deceased and father believed to be in vicinity of Burns Lake, B.C.

I am not at all sure, however, that I shall be in a position to make the trip next year.\n\nI heartily agree with you when you express the view that handicraft projects should be promoted at our Indian residential schools. I have been emphasizing the necessity for vocational instruction and handicraft work during the last year, and it is encouraging to learn from reports that have reached us that the majority of our Indian day and residential schools have now made provision for vocational instruction.\n\nI feel confident Inspector Barry and Commissioner MacKay can, with the experience they have had, provide you with a number of helpful suggestions. Both these men are in close contact with conditions on the reserves and are really in a better position to give you worth-while advice than I am. The reports that have reached me since you became Principal at Lejac have been very encouraging. I feel confident you are doing a good work at the institution.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hosy,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. W. Byrne Grant, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nLejac, B.C.\nLejac Indian Residential School\nUnder Direction of The Oblate Fathers\nLEJAC, B.C.\n\nDecember 4th, 1937\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWould you please be kind enough to send us twenty more copies of Follow-up Report on Residential School Graduate.\n\nThe Commissioner, Major McKay, was here recently and tells me that there is a very good prospect of your making a visit of the schools of the West early next year. I hope that you will not allow the apparent inaccessibility of Lejac and the rather hard reputation that our Northern winter seems to have in the East, to prevent you from paying us a visit and in preparing your schedule I hope you will keep in mind that there are only three trains a week so we will count on your staying a full two days.\n\nWhen you do come I shall be specially anxious to discuss with you the question of handicrafts for the Indians leaving the school.\n\nAfter a years residence here I have come to the conclusion that handicrafts which could be carried on and developed in the camps offer the best solution for the present poverty and thriftlessness of the Indians. Trapping seems to be disappearing fast, game is getting less abundant, the market for farm produce in the vicinity of the camps is limited and the indolence of the Indians makes it difficult for them to produce either a sufficient quantity or a regular supply for outside markets.\n\nNo doubt you have a bird's-eye view of this question as it affects all the Indians of Canada and will therefore be in a position to give us some practical advice.\n\nWe shall all be greatly disappointed if your expected visit does not materialize.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

There was very little difficulty experienced in bringing the children back to the school this term. In fact, we have been compelled to refuse admittance to some, because we could not afford to take them since our grant only allows for 160. There are still a few of the older pupils who have not yet been able to return, and for whom we will have to make room.\n\nMorale.\nThe children are all in excellent spirits, and are quite happy to be back at school. There does not seem to be any inclination towards running away, as is usual at this time of the year.\n\nManual Training.\nThe piggery which the boys have built is nearing completion; and is a concrete example of what our Indian boys can do under proper example and instruction. The routine work of the carpenter shop and the farm work is going on in a satisfactory manner.\n\nThe girls are again working at their usual household tasks, as well as in spinning, carding, dressmaking, etc.\n\nHealth.\nMost of the children are in good health, though many are in need of dental attention. Two children were sent to the hospital; one girl, who died of endocarditis, and a boy with pneumonia.\n\nWe were disappointed in not being able to get the services of the provincial T.B. clinic for the children when it passed through this district. The medical authorities of the Department seem to be very apathetic about the whole thing, despite the fact that such a step was originally suggested by Dr. McQuarrie when he was here last year.\n\nCrops.\nThe yield was fairly good this year, though we do not know yet just what the potato crop will be. The garden was very successful and a large quantity of vegetables was put away for use later in the year.\n\nLivestock.\nAll of our stock are in good condition, and their numbers are substantially the same as they were when the previous report was sent in; so there is no point in repeating them here.\n\nIn view of the rising prices of meat, our herd of pure bred Herefords promises to be a valuable investment.\n\nRev.

Goods have gone forward to destination today and invoice to Mr. A.H. Simpson, Lejac, B.C.\n\nIn our quotation we quoted you on cedar finish as this together with Hemlock & Spruce is the species of lumber that we cut. Your order came back calling for Fir so we wrote Mr. Simpson explaining the situation here and asked if cedar would be suitable and he replied that this would have to be filled in Fir. This being the case we had to send to Vancouver for the Fir at a greater cost to us so we have priced this on the invoice at $55.00, this figure just covering the cost to us.\n\nHoping that you will find this satisfactory, we are,\n\nYours truly,\nLITTLE, HAUGLAND & KERR\n\nDKK\nPer: Duncan H.

The Department is anxious to encourage vocational education as much as circumstances will permit. The Department is also anxious to obtain as much education from the materials furnished as is possible.\n\nOn examining the above mentioned requisition, a few items have struck my attention. I would like to refer you to the Yankee drill point sets. The requisition calls for six additional sets. Our records indicate that three sets were sent out last February. This seems excessive to me.
