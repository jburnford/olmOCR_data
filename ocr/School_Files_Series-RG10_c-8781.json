I wish to report that there are still two or three children whose names appear on the report and whose application forms have not been sent in.\n\nIt is most difficult in some cases to get the application form signed by the father. When the Missionary visits the Reserves the parents are often away fishing or working in some inaccessible logging camp. I have tried mailing the forms to the parents in the past, but this has not worked out well in most cases.\n\nI expected all the parents would visit their children at the school this Christmas. They did not, and the result is there are still three application forms to be sent in.\n\nIn such cases would it suffice to have the mother sign? The way things look now it will be Easter before all the application forms are duly signed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH. F. Dunlop, Q.M.I.\nOttawa, January 14, 1947.\n\nRev. H.F.

He is of the opinion, however, that a properly equipped plant for the repair and making of shoes for the pupils would serve a useful purpose. Father McCaffrey, however, is a new man in the Indian work and what I have seen of him leads me to conclude that he is more studious than practical. In view of the attitude of this School, I am of the opinion that no manual training equipment should be purchased as the phase of technical education at present being dealt with has reference to manual training only. Possibly next year the Principal may become possessed with a broader vision.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6461, file 887-11, part 1)\nEXTRACT from Report of G. H. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools, regarding his inspection of the SECHELT Indian Residential School on May 19 & 20, 1931.\n\nOriginal on File 167-18-6.\n\nVocational Training:\n\nThe Principal informs me that he could not afford to pay the salary of a Manual Training Instructor. There is a Shoe Shop, containing one Singer machine. In this shop, the repairs to all the shoes are made. Half soles and heels are put on by the boys under instruction. This work seems to me to be satisfactory. The boys do some garden work.\n\nIn the Sewing Room, there are six machines in good condition. The girls make their own dresses, knit, sew, mend, darn, and do fancy work. They also, of course, learn to clean, cook, bake, and wash. This work shows when the girls leave school in cleaner homes, better food, and homemade clothes. The crochet, fancy work, tatting and knitting that I saw were excellent.\nOttawa, July 16, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Sechelt Indian Residential School is one of the few of our institutions in British Columbia where manual training is not given proper prominence. In 1928, when the Department equipped most of the residential schools and arranged a grant towards the cost of a manual training instructor, the Rev. Principal was so doubtful about the advisability of special training, that the Department did not take any action in the case of this school. Mr. Inspector Barry's most recent report states the Rev. Principal at Sechelt informed him that he could not afford to pay the salary of a manual training instructor. It appears that only garden work and shoe repairing are undertaken by the boys.\n\nThe Department wishes you to discuss this question with the Rev. Principal at the first opportunity. Inform him that we will pay $50 a month towards the cost of a qualified manual training instructor and will supply, not only the equipment required for the purpose, but lumber for woodworking and other materials from time to time. You will please report the result of your efforts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nP. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n819 Metropolitan Bldg.,\nVancouver, B. C.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 16th with reference to manual training at Sechelt Residential School. I consulted with the present principal, Father Maillard, who is agreeable to this special training being given, and we were both in complete accord in suggesting that Mr. A.R. Tebbs, of Selma Park, Sechelt, be engaged as instructor. He is fully qualified to teach the usual manual training work and what is more important in a fishing community, can also teach boat-building and Father Maillard and I respectfully recommend that this man be given favourable consideration when an instructor is appointed. I am glad this work is being undertaken, and suggested it to the former Principal who was not in favour for some reason or other. The ex-pupils are far more likely to make use of such instruction than any academic learning they may acquire.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 10, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, with reference to manual training instruction at the Sechelt Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to say it is noted that the Principal and yourself recommend that Mr. A. R. Tebbs be engaged as instructor, as he is fully qualified. The Department will approve of the appointment of Mr. Tebbs and, as stated in official letter of the 16th ultimo, will pay the sum of $50 a month towards the cost of his salary. The Reverend Principal could arrange to pay Mr. Tebbs each month, and at the end of each quarter you could forward a voucher, in duplicate, properly certified, in favour of the Principal, for the amount of salary allowed by this Department.\n\nIf any equipment or tools are required, I have to request that you will, after consulting Mr. Tebbs, prepare a list of the supplies absolutely necessary, together with an estimate of the cost, and forward same for the consideration of the Department. Should any lumber for woodworking, etc., be required, you should also prepare a list of same and forward it to the Department, stating the cost, when consideration will be given to authorizing the purchase.\n\nYou might also advise the Department as to the date upon which Mr. Tebbs begins duties. It is hoped that he will meet with success in his instruction of the pupils in manual training work.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n619 Metropolitan Bldg.,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 10th ultimo regarding manual training for Sechelt School, the Principal advises me that it will be necessary to make alterations in the school to accommodate the workshop and if the material is supplied, the School workman will do the work free. I have obtained figures for this, which with windows and doors will amount to $102.35. It is proposed to have the benches and cupboards made by the boys under the manual training instructor's supervision, the cost of this lumber, etc., being $26.50. There will be a small additional cost for the bench screws so that the total for the room, benches and cupboards will be approximately $150.00. Stock benches complete with screws cost $40.00 each so a considerable saving will be effected in having them made.\n\nI asked Mr. Tebb to give me a list of articles considered necessary for the pupils, and the enclosed was submitted by him. Part of the list shows what each pupil will need, part shows what each pair of pupils can use together and the balance shows the tools for general use. I have had no previous experience with manual training in Indian schools, but Mr. Tebb appeared to understand what is required so I submit the list as sent in by him. I obtained prices from three local firms on the patronage list and the total for these articles, figuring on a class of twelve, will amount to approximately $250.00 according to the lowest tender. In compliance with your instructions, I also obtained prices on wood to be used in the manual training class and this amounted to $40.00.\n\nIn summary of the total expenditure, I beg to submit the following and respectfully request your advice as to purchasing same:\n\n- Lumber for school---------------------$102.35,\n- Lumber and other material for benches, etc.------------------50.00,\n- Tools and other supplies for pupils---250.00,\n- Wood for working---------------------40.00,\n\nTotal----------$442.35,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nFreight will be in addition to these figures and with various unforeseen items may raise this figure to nearly $500.00, but the school will then be well equipped.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.

The Department will also approve of you purchasing the various woodworking tools as mentioned in the list, to an expenditure of approximately $250, as well as the wood required for working purposes by the class. You should arrange for the purchase of the above materials, tools, etc., from indicated sources, after obtaining their best prices, and the purchase should be made from the firm quoting the lowest price. The total expenditure for all purposes, including freight, should not exceed your estimate of $500.\n\nAfter the purchase of the lumber, tools and other equipment has been made, you should forward itemized accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred. You should state on the face of the vouchers that payment is to be made from B.C. Special Appropriation.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will give the matter of the purchase of the materials and tools required early attention, in order that manual training instructions for the pupils can begin as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

MacKenzie\nSecretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter No. 167-18-11, I beg to answer\u2014\n\nThe work accomplished by the manual training classes from Nov. 1st 1931 to March 1st 1934.\n\nThe work accomplished was as follows, in the building allotted for a workshop, four new windows and frames have been made and installed, thereby giving the classroom sufficient light. The walls and part of the ceiling has been lined with shiplap, thereby adding warmth to the shop. Six work benches (double) have been built with bench screws and tool racks; these supply accommodation for a class of twelve students.\n\nLockers with twelve compartments, for accommodation of the students' tools and drawings, have been built.\n\nOn the first of January we commenced work on the different methods of joining wood together in model form, to give the students both practice and insight into the modes of joining before taking up construction.\nSechelt Residential School\n\nSECHELT, B.C.\n\nThe mode of procedure adopted is for the instructor to draw the model either full size or to scale from this student makes a working drawing, afterwards constructing the model from the drawing prepared by himself.\n\nEach student is being instructed in the care of and art of sharpening his tools.\n\nI am pleased to say that a great improvement in the quality of the work done has been effected this year; carelessness is being reduced and more personal pride taken in the work. My belief is that interest and attention of the entire class are very good.\n\nNow all these Boys after school will have to earn their living mostly by fishing. My wish is that these Boys should be trained in boat building and for this kind of work we have in the actual Instructor the boatman to be had, as by trade he is Boat builder. To attain this Object, the school should be equipped with proper tools, material for boat building.\n\nSo I am convinced that money spent by the Dept is well spent.\nSechelt Residential School\n\nWhile the heavy pieces are passed through the washing machine\u2014pieces such as sheets, blankets, overalls, towels, etc.\u2014there is a great deal of handwashing done by the girls. On this I insisted and still insist on this particular point.\n\nHandwashing\u2014ironing of the clothes, pressing, cleaning is all done entirely by hand.\n\nSewing room\u2014The work accomplished there is quite satisfactory. The girls have made their dresses and are making sweaters, night shirts for boys and girls, overshirts for boys.\n\nBlouses\u2014Mending\u2014patching work\u2014more actual knitting such things as sweaters, stockings, socks. Has been neglected and brought this point to the attention of the Sister in charge.\n\nKitchen\u2014The work here has not been as I had wished it\u2014not enough training in the actual demonstration of the art of cooking\u2014no bread made. So, girls on their leaving the school could scrub floors and pots, prepare vegetables but not cook.\n\nRev. Ed. Maillard\nPrincipal\nSechelt Residential School\nSechelt, B.C.\n\nM. R. A. Tebb, Manual instructor\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to say that I am greatly pleased with the progress which has been made. Such practical evidence of the services being given in pursuit of our educational program should surely convince the Dept. that these efforts along manual training lines are worth while, especially when the work is conducted under the direction of men who are not only qualified to instruct but also able to give such evidence of their sympathetic consideration for the advancement of the Indian children as you are doing. Please accept my congratulations and hearty wishes for future success.\n\nC. C. Terry,\nass't Indian Commissioner\nfor B.C.\nOttawa, April 30, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department recently wrote the Principal of the Sechelt Indian Residential School for a report regarding vocational training at that school. His reply has been received, and this reads in part as follows:\n\n\"All these boys, after school, will have to earn their living, mostly by fishing. My wish is that these boys should be trained in boat-building, and, for this kind of work, we have in the present instructor the best man to be had, as he is a boat-builder by trade. To attain this object, the school should be equipped with proper tools and material for boat-building.\"\n\nThe Department presumes that this material is in addition to that recommended by Inspector Barry. You might consult the Principal and advise the Department what expenditure you would recommend in the purchase of material and equipment for boat-building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. J. C. Hall, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n203-6 Rogers Bldg.,\nVancouver, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 20th ultimo saying that School Inspector Barry reports that some lumber is certainly required for construction of various articles and that \"owing to lack of suitable material, old boxes have to be used\" and also recommending pine.\n\nI wish Mr. Barry would report facts instead of such nonsense as this.\n\nI have just visited both the Reverend Principal and the manual training instructor, Mr. Tebb, who were surprised at such statements.\n\nThe pupils were allowed to make various articles outside of the regular instruction, but under supervision, on condition that they found their own lumber and they used box lumber or anything else. They have the privilege of selling these articles. They make sleds and other toys out of boxes it is true, but not through shortage of lumber.\n\nMr. Tebb says he hoped to finish the term with what he received in the last shipment but will probably run short and was preparing a list although he says very little pine, if any, should be included on account of expense and also because after the Indians leave school they will seldom use pine and it is better to train them to meet conditions as they exist on the Reserves, that is why he uses no machinery in instructing.\n\nAs I was instrumental in getting manual training started in the two residential schools and one of the day schools in this Agency, it is scarcely likely that I should allow the good work to be injured by lack of material.\n\nMr. Barry's reports both in this matter and regarding the condition of two rooms in the Sechelt School as separately reported upon, give the Department an entirely erroneous impression of actual conditions.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(F.J.C.

This matter was the subject of a discussion recently between the manual training instructor, Mr. Tebb, the Reverend Principal and myself and after looking into it thoroughly I was preparing to report to you.\n\nI believe I have already mentioned that before Mr. Tebb's retirement from active business he was in the boat building line, his yard employing as many as three hundred men, and is well qualified to instruct in that work. When he was first engaged as manual training instructor I asked him if he would be able to teach the boys boat-building and he said that as they had had no previous training, it would be a year or two before he considered them proficient enough in the use of tools. However, they have shown remarkable ability generally and Mr. Tebb considers they could now be given boat-building instruction in the advanced classes. This would mean possibly eight or ten boys at Sechelt School.\n\nI had in mind that possibly we could take advantage of Mr. Tebb's services by sending pupils from other schools to take this instruction, or better still have a special boat-building school at some central point where the senior boys of other schools could all receive instruction. There is no question that this is work for which the Indians are peculiarly suitable, and the trade now going to Japanese boat-builders might well become the main Indian employment at the Coast as quite a number of Indians have taken up marine engineering.\n\nManual training instruction is the most valuable teaching they receive but so far it has apparently been confined mostly to making furniture or small articles which are also factory made, and therefore the Indians can not compete in the market for that class of goods.\n\nIn this report I am only suggesting for the Department's consideration the establishment of a separate boat-building school as I realize the many angles which would need careful thought, but as regards Sechelt School we should first need a boat-house near the beach, proper tools and suitable material. Mr. Tebb suggested that the boys make a 45-foot hull, fishboat type, of fir and cedar.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nto commence with. This would take possibly four school terms at the present hours and small number of boys available. A few tools will be needed in addition to those on hand at present. The lumber in a boat of this size would cost about $400.00 but of course would not all be needed at once. You are correct in your premise that this lumber is in addition to that needed in the usual way as recommended by School Inspector Barry and I am enclosing herewith Mr.Tebb's list of present lumber requirements.\n\nWith regard to the boat building, we are now midway in the last term before the school holidays and I respectfully suggest that this work be commenced when school re-opens in August. That will give me time to submit to you a detailed plan rather than send immature suggestions now.\n\nIn 1925 the Department paid $680.00 for a launch supplied to this School and a boat-house was built which is still in a fair state of repair and could be easily fixed up for the purpose. I understand the boat was never taken care of and they allowed it to be pounded to pieces on the beach shortly after it was supplied and they therefore have no further use for the boat-house. Your file 157-18-5, August 18, 1925, refers to this building.\n\nI hope the Department will not think I am delaying this work, but by looking ahead now, we may save trouble and disappointment later.\n\nA point I wish to bring to your notice and which is often overlooked when comparing the manual training work of different schools is that we have no machinery in the schools of this Agency, all work being done by hand which I believe is more valuable training because while the Indian is going to work in a town he will not have machinery available. That is the reason I mentioned that it would take probably four terms to build a small boat. It is the instruction that is valuable rather than the article produced.\n\nWith your approval therefore, I will again confer with Mr.Tebb and then forward you a complete list of boat-building requirements which he has already assured me will not be large.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSIR,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnclosure:-\n\nB/HM.\nOttawa, May 17, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to instructing the boys in the Sechelt Residential School in boat building.\n\nThe Department agrees with your suggestion that plans be made to build a boat during the next four terms and that this work be commenced after the school reopens next August.\n\nIt is noted from the last paragraph of your letter that you will again confer with the Instructor, Mr. Tebb, and will then forward a complete list of boat building requirements. Provided these requirements are reasonable, favourable consideration will be given to supplying them on receipt of your further report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF.

Since that time, Mr. A. R. Tebb has been appointed as instructor at Squamish Residential School also.\n\nAlthough there may appear to the Department to have been considerable delay in reporting to you, it is something which I quite respectfully consider should not be so, and I wished to have some of my work before reporting to you. It was originally intended that a fairly large boat should be built, but Mr. Tebb points out that all the bigger boys of Sechelt School left last term and we now think the first work should be done on a smaller craft where the principle will be the same, then another year larger work may be undertaken.\n\nMr. Tebb has handed me a list of tools, lumber and hardware, the total amount will be less than $90.00. I have suggested that we do the same work at Squamish Residential School and believe it will be a splendid idea and will give both schools an incentive to try and turn out the best work. As Squamish School has some of the tools already, the total amount for the two schools would be approximately $90.00 including freight and cartage.\n\nAs this instruction will be of much value to the pupils in later years, I respectfully recommend that the Department authorize the purchase of this material for the Sechelt and Squamish Residential Schools at a cost not exceeding $90.00 for the two schools.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSIR,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.

You may arrange for the purchase from a firm on the approved list and obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, which you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.

Tebb, Manual Training Instructor at the Sechelt Indian Residential School.\n\nMr. Tebb was appointed by the Department and is paid by the Department. Consequently, he is in a different position from the other members of the staff. It was for this reason, no doubt, that Mr. Ball advised you that Mr. Tebb's services should be retained.\n\nIf the Manual Training Instructor's services are unsatisfactory, you should have so reported to the Department, giving your reasons for desiring a change, and, at the same time, giving the name and qualifications of the person whom you wish employed.\n\nIf you communicate with the Department along the lines suggested in the preceding paragraph, the matter will receive careful consideration. A copy of this letter is being forwarded to Mr. Agent Ball.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T. J.

Would you kindly take note of this; and should you wish to resume your work of the past year please submit your application and it will be considered with others which I may receive during the course of the Childrens' vacations.\n\nThanking you for your co-operation,\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.) F.J.Fahlman.\nPrincipal.\nWhen Mr. Phelan was in British Columbia recently, I mentioned to him that the Rev. Father Fahlman, the new Principal at Sechelt Residential School, had written the manual training instructor asking for his resignation. This was in line with Father Fahlman's action with all the staff. I understood Mr. Phelan to say he would advise Father Fahlman that Mr. Tebb's appointment was made by Order-in-council, but apparently Mr. Phelan did not do so.\n\nI asked Father Fahlman whether he had any complaint against Mr. Tebb and apparently there is none. Mr. Tebb's work at both Sechelt and Squamish Schools has been most satisfactory, and I do not think he should be dismissed merely because Father Fahlman is discharging all his own staff, including the Sister who has been there since the School opened many years ago.\n\nSechelt School in my opinion was very efficiently run, and the standard of work done by the pupils was high so this wholesale dismissal of the staff is not understandable.\n\nI regret to say that I have been entirely ignored by the Reverend Principal in his management of the School and believe he has the opinion that the Department has no connection with it except to pay the grant.\n\nI enclose herewith copy of the notice received from the Reverend Principal. Mr. Tebb complained that manual training tools were taken by members of the new staff and used by them and I instructed Mr. Tebb that all tools should be kept under lock and key, when not in use. Father Fahlman has taken the keys and Mr. Tebb has no access to the tools.\n\nI have instructed Mr. Tebb not to send in his resignation and respectfully request your approval of this action and Father Fahlman advised accordingly.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.

It is just possible that a change in the manual training instructor at this school would be advisable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. Mackenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n203-6 Rogers Bldg.,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nPB/O'M.\nSir:\n\nIt was necessary today to send you a night letter as follows:\n\n\"Reference last paragraph my letter twenty-second instant re manual training Sechelt School. Principal refuses allow Tebb to instruct or \"access to manual training room although advised of Tebb's status Stop No classes held this term Stop Principal operates school from Mission seventy-five miles away visiting Sechelt occasionally.\"\n\nAfter school re-opened Mr. Tebb telephoned me that the manual training building was locked and Father Fahlman refused to allow him access to it. I telephoned Father Fahlman explaining that Mr. Tebb was appointed by the Department and paid by you and not from his grant and gathered from him that the matter was settled but Father Fahlman still denies Mr. Tebb entry and has not sent any classes for training.\n\nI regret to have this difficulty but Sechelt School is not maintaining its former high standing. Father Fahlman is seldom at Sechelt. He apparently makes his headquarters at Mission\u2014which is over seventy-five miles away by sea and land, leaving the School to be operated by the staff. A few years ago this lack of superintendence by the Principal resulted in serious trouble. A brother who was left in charge was handcuffed by the village Indians and more serious trouble was averted with difficulty. I do not wish to see this School revert to those conditions.\n\nThe School has hitherto exhibited at the annual Vancouver Exhibition and the work of its pupils has always been most favourably commented upon by the public. Mr. Tebb also had considerable manual training to exhibit this year including a boat, but through Father Fahlman's action in locking him out, and his apparent indifference to school affairs in general, no exhibit was received this year from Sechelt.\n\nI had hoped that when Father Fahlman was appointed principal he would co-operate with me in school matters, but he seems to look upon the School as a private institution.\n\nI visited the school two or three times, but even\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6461, file 887-11, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nthis appeared to be resented although personally Father Pahlman is very agreeable and friendly.\n\nI can not understand his attitude and trust you have already advised him that the manual training is to be continued and that Mr. Webb shall instruct unless there is a real reason why he should not do so.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 5th, 1935.\n\nVery Reverend Sir,\n\nLast week, Reverend Father Doran kindly called at the Department and was supplied with a copy of a telegram which had been received from our Indian Agent at Vancouver in connection with the manual training instructor at the Sechelt Indian Residential School. You will remember that you telegraphed the Department regarding this matter on the 14th ultimo and we replied in a telegram dated the 15th ultimo.\n\nThe Department is now in receipt of another letter from our Agent, a copy of which is enclosed for your information.\n\nYou will note especially the Agent's remarks regarding the Principal not residing at the school. If Mr. Hall's statement is correct, the Department considers that it would be advisable to have Father Fahlmann reside at Sechelt. I feel you will agree that he cannot give proper supervision to the school unless he is at Sechelt the greater part of his time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nVery Rev. Jds. Scannell, O.M.I.,\nProvincial,\nSt. Joseph's Rectory,\nLaurier Ave. E.,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nPP/O'M.\nSechelt Residential School\nSECHELT, B.C.\nAugust 29th, 1935.\n\nRe: No. 168-18-11, Aug. 15th.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe thought and consideration due the matter of your letter of the 15th inst., required much time and resulted in this regretted delay. In reply may I state that a copy of the telegram sent the Department by very Rev. Father Scannell has come to me, and I heartily endorse the opening sentence. I feel that the principle of the Principal's authority is at stake.\n\nWhen, for reasons which I shall hereinafter mention, I discharged Mr. Tebb, not knowing that he had been appointed in any other manner than any other member of the School Staff, I was acting just as I had acted formerly in discharging members of the Staff of this School and of St. Mary's Mission School when I was Principal there, and among those thus discharged there were some whose salary was paid by the Department in just the same way as Mr. Tebb's has been paid. That the position of Mr. Tebb should be different from the other members of the Staff is what I most heartily disagree with. It necessitates my giving way to what I cannot regard as being in the best interests of the School of which I am Principal. Now to be obliged to retain the services of one who is known by the other members of the Staff to have been discharged by me is bound to affect my authority very adversely. Furthermore, for me to reinstate Mr. Tebb now in view of his letter to me which was anything but respectful, nay, redolent of open defiance, would render my position quite untenable.\n\nMy reasons for discharging Mr. Tebb are briefly these:\n1; He lacks authority over the children who make up his class; he has admitted that they do not work well for him.\n2; He has overstepped his authority in some instances.\n3; He has failed without apparent good reason or any explanation to comply with requests I have made in connection with the Manual Training Department of the School.\n\nA.

He instructs one day a week at Squamish School which involves three days' travel at his expense. No other person could handle the two schools in this way as Mr. Tebb has a residence in Vancouver and Sechelt and is willing to divide his time in this way without cost to the Department. His work at both places is most satisfactory. He is an expert boat-builder which is the principal work to be done in my estimation. There has never been any question as to his competence to instruct and undoubtedly the Reverend Principal merely desires to bring in some one from outside the district as has been done in the boiler room where his young nephew replaced the former man. The position is inside the School and no objection was made although I believe the new man has no papers as an engineer, but the manual training is separate from the school and classes are held in another building.\n\nThe whole trouble I have no doubt is because Mr. Tebb refused to allow the young man referred to, and other employees of the School, to use manual training tools whenever they wished, and it was upon my instructions they were forbidden to remove these tools. If we are to have no control in such matters, I can not be held responsible if in a short time we have to replace the manual training tools at large expense.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nB/HM.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSeptember 11, 1935.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Buskard,\n\nOn the recommendation of the Indian Agent, Mr. A.

McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nHaving received from the Reverend Father Falhmann, O.M.I., principal of the Indian School, Sechelt, B.C., a very unsatisfactory report of the Manual Training Instructor - Mr. Tebb - and knowing at the same time, that his notice of dismissal could only come from the Department, may I respectfully suggest that you inquire into the state of affairs. To me it seems that the only solution would be to have Mr. Tebb transferred to some other school as evidently the disagreement between himself and the principal will eventually tend to militate against the best interests of Sechelt School. I am\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. Scannell\n\nPROVINCIAL.\n\nP.S. In spite of the fact that the Principal of the Kamloops School had been taken to hospital with a bad break down the matter seems to have been left upon examining the school books. To me such action, to say the least, was in very bad taste.\nOttawa, October 31, 1935.\n\nSir,-\n\nThe Department has carefully considered your letter of the 9th ultimo and previous correspondence in connection with the employment of Mr. A. R. Tebb as manual training instructor at the Sechelt Indian Residential School. We are, also, in receipt of a letter from the Principal of the school with regard to Mr. Tebb.\n\nThe information contained in this correspondence has been given very careful consideration and it is quite apparent that the present relations between the Principal and Mr. Tebb are so strained that it is extremely doubtful if efficient work is being done. Our experience shows that, when this condition arises, it is necessary, in the interests of the work, to make a change. The Department, therefore, feels that the time has arrived to secure a new manual training instructor at the Sechelt Residential School. Please let me know if you have any further comments to make in connection with this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n203-6 Rogers Bldg.,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nPP/O'M.\nSir,\n\nre: Your File No.167-18-11\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 21st ultimo, and note that you have decided to get rid of Mr. Tebb as Manual Training Instructor at Sechelt Residential School.\n\nI think the Department is making a mistake in this matter, and it is very disheartening that an Agent is not supported. Father Fahlman is new to the work and has yet to show that he is going to make a success of the School - so far the reverse is indicated. Already I am receiving complaints that the children are not being fed nearly so well as formerly; the Agent soon notice it and report it to their parents. Apart from that, Mr. Tebb was recommended because of his peculiar fitness for instruction, especially in boat-building, which is the main thing in training up. He formerly had as many as 50 men working under him in ship and boat building so he knows considerably more than the Principal about his work. Sechelt is a small community, and it will be interesting to see who Father Fahlman has in mind as instructor. He dismissed the Sisters and the boiler-room fireman (an old and faithful Frenchman, with a family, who had been there a long time) and put his young nephew in his place.\n\nThese changes are not being made for efficiency reasons, but to satisfy personal inclinations. If Mr. Tebb's services were not satisfactory, I should quickly report it to you, but no man's work should be dependent upon personalities of this kind. I do not think there are any strained relations at all; Father Fahlman simply ceased sending any pupils to the Manual Training Building, without giving any reasons except that he was \"making changes in the staff\". Tebb is scarcely a member of the staff, he goes to the school one day a week, and never enters the main school building.\n\nIf the Department wishes any more information, I may add that this trouble started because Tebb refused to allow the young nephew referred to, to use the Manual Training tools for odd jobs.\n\nIf this young fellow is appointed instructor, so that the amount paid quarterly to Tebb is paid to him, I hope the Department will ask for his qualifications, if the Department still has any control in these matters of personnel.\n\nIt is becoming rather obscure as to what an Indian Agent's duties are regarding Residential Schools. Sechelt School was worked up to a high state of efficiency, cleanli-\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6461, file 837-11, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nness and good treatment of the pupils, and I always received fullest co-operation from the former Principal, so it is rather disheartening to see these changes being made by a Principal who, after all, spends little time at the School.\n\nI presume you will wish to retain Mr. Tebb's services at Squamish Residential School, if he will carry on. These schools together mean only two days employment a week.\n\nYou say you have received a letter from the Principal with regard to Tebb, but you do not state the nature of his complaints, if any.\n\nMay I say on Mr. Tebb's behalf that his work is most efficient, and as he was in charge of the building of this school some years ago, I presume he is fully qualified.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\n\n/DH.\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, November 15, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, with reference to the action taken by the Principal of the Sechelt Indian Residential School in dispensing with the services of Mr. Tebb as manual training instructor.\n\nThe Department has given careful consideration to this matter, and, as you were informed in official letter of the 31st ultimo, it is considered that the present relations between the Principal and Mr. Tebb are strained. It would be in the best interests of the work to make a change. While Mr. Tebb's services have been entirely satisfactory, our experience shows that, when there is dissatisfaction between the Principal and any member of the staff, it is necessary, in the interests of the work, to make a change. The Department is, therefore, of opinion that, in order to have the work continue without friction between the Principal and Mr. Tebb, the services of a new manual training instructor should be obtained. You will therefore be good enough to inform Mr. Tebb that his services as manual training instructor at the Sechelt School will not be required after December 31st, next. It is presumed he will be willing to continue the work until that date.\n\nYou should request the Principal to forward the name and full particulars regarding the qualifications and experience of the man he nominates for the position, to succeed Mr. Tebb. You should inform him that the Department will be unable to approve of the appointment of any person who has not the necessary qualifications. The Principal should make a nomination, through your office, at an early date.\n\nIt is understood that Mr. Tebb's services are to be continued as manual training instructor at the Squamish Indian Residential School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n203-6 Rogers Building,\nVancouver, B. C.\nOttawa, November 15, 1935.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, with reference to the manual training instructor at the Sechelt Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I have to inform you that Mr. Agent Ball is being advised, by official letter of today's date, that Mr. Tebb's services will not be required as manual training instructor at the Sechelt School after December 31st, next.\n\nThe Agent is being requested to have the Principal nominate the services of a fully qualified instructor, to replace Mr. Tebb after that date. The Department will expect that the person nominated by the Principal will have the necessary qualifications and experience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nVery Rev. J. Scannell, O.M.I.,\nSt. Joseph's Rectory,\n151 Laurier Ave. East,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\n\nre: Your file No.167-18-11\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 15th ultimo and to advise that I have notified Mr.Tebb that his services at Sechelt School will not be required after the 31st instant.\n\nNaturally, Mr.Tebb is dissatisfied; and I regret that we shall not be able to carry on with the boat-building part of the work. They started with a row boat, and next term figured on commencing work on a gas-boat. There is one else in the district who can do this work.\n\nHowever, another matter has come up in connection with this; Mr.Tebb has sent a bill to the Reverend Principal for $75.00 for the time during which he called regularly at the School, and no classes were sent to the Manual Training Building. Mr.Tebb considers that he was doing his duty, and as he had not been officially informed that he was discharged, considers that he is entitled to payment. The Reverend Principal has written me as follows:\n\n\"I beg to advise that I did not act in the matter, as I considered my thirty days notice to Mr.Tebb that the School did not require his services over that period was sufficiently official.\"\n\nI await your further instructions in this matter.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(F.J.G.Ball)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, December 17, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 9th instant, you may submit a voucher for the amount you consider should be allowed Mr. A. R. Tebb for the period September 1st to December 31st.\n\nPlease let me know at once if you have communicated with the Principal of the Sechelt School with reference to having him nominate a qualified manual training instructor to succeed Mr. Tebb.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

He reported every day on which classes should have been held, this meant a three-mile walk and loss of at least half a day, and this amount represents one-half the amount he should have earned. After losing this time, the Reverend Principal commenced sending classes to him again, and asked him to give extra instruction so as to catch up on lost time.\n\nWith regard to your enquiry as to nomination of a successor, I have repeatedly asked for this, so far without success. I shall make further enquiry and report later. My opinion is, as mentioned in a previous letter, that the Reverend Principal proposed having his nephew, the boiler-room man, do this work, but since a qualified man is required, he, of course, cannot be nominated.\n\nPersonally I think it will be difficult to find another man in such a small community as Sechelt; in fact, I know there is no one who can teach boat-building which I expected to become the chief aim of the instruction so that these pupils could learn to build their own fish boats instead of buying them from the Japanese.\n\nThis whole scheme has been wrecked by petty interference. I asked the Reverend Principal recently what friction there had been between himself and Mr. Tebb, and he said there was no friction, but he thought Mr. Tebb could not control the boys. This has never been mentioned before, and I do not see how such a complaint could be made from my observation of the manual training class-rooms both at Sechelt and Squamish.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.O.

Fahlman\" O.M.I.\n\nFrd'k. J.C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n203-6 Rogers Bldg.,\nVancouver.\nSir:\n\nI beg to forward herewith copy of a letter received from Reverend Father Fahlman, O.M.I., principal of Sechelt Indian Residential School. (It is dated December 10th 1936, which, however, is evidently a mistake, as it was only received this morning. It was probably meant for January 10th 1936).\n\nThe Reverend Principal was requested several times to send in the names of applicants for this position but as usual he chooses to absolutely ignore Departmental instructions, and appoint a man without any reference to the Department at all.\n\nThere is only one conclusion, and that is that we are to have absolutely nothing to do with the School (which is being run as a private institution by the Reverend Father Fahlman), except pay him for operating it.\n\nI beg to refer you to your letters of November 15th (File 167-18-11) paragraph 3, and December 17th, paragraph 2, which are quite clear, but were completely ignored by the Reverend Principal. I strongly object to his attitude and the manner in which he studiously ignores the Department in all things connected with the School.\n\nIf these things were being done for the good of the School, I should heartily support them. Morley told me, as long ago as last June or July, that Mr. Tebb was leaving the School, so it is quite evident that the whole thing has been engineered long ago. Mr. Morley is a commercial artist by trade, not a carpenter or boat-builder and his only experience has been in helping his father build a few summer cottages.\n\nI shall not forward vouchers for this man unless you advise me to do so, as he has not been approved by the Department. Personally I think if the Reverend Principal wishes to employ this class of instructor, he should pay him out of the regular grant, which is already more than sufficient.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nB/DH.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, January 17, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Mr. Agent Ball, in which he states that you have requested him to forward vouchers covering the manual training grant for the December quarter for Mr. Morley, whom you have employed as manual training instructor.\n\nIn official letter of November 15th, Mr. Ball was directed to request you to forward the name and full particulars regarding the qualifications and the experience of the man you nominated for the position of manual training instructor. No doubt, Mr. Ball conveyed the Department's instructions to you; but, as yet, no such information has been received. I also quote, for your information, the last paragraph of official letter of November 15th, addressed to Very Rev. J. Scannell, O.M.I.:\n\n\"The Agent is being requested to have the Principal nominate the services of a fully qualified instructor, to replace Mr. Tebb after December 31st. The Department will expect that the person nominated by the Principal will have the necessary qualifications and experience.\"\n\nIn his recent letter, Mr. Ball writes regarding Mr. Morley:\n\n\"He is a commercial artist by trade, not a carpenter or boat builder, and his only experience has been in helping his father build a few summer cottages.\"\n\nIn view of Mr. Ball's report, the Department does not consider that Mr. Morley has sufficient qualifications to act as manual training instructor of the Sechelt Indian Residential School, and, consequently, we are not prepared to allow a grant to the school for his services.\n\nAs stated in previous correspondence, the Department is quite prepared to allow you to nominate the manual training instructor, but we must insist that the man nominated by you holds the requisite qualifications and has had the necessary experience. Otherwise, the expenditure of public funds for the purpose will be wasted. I regret that Mr. Agent Ball is under the impression that you do not wish to cooperate with him in fulfilling the Department's principle of Indian residential schools to do. The best results can only be obtained by all our officers working in harmony.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T. J.

It is regretted that the more useful and important training, viz, boat-building, has been dropped since the change was made in instructors.\n\nOur Indians up coast are primarily fishermen, and while cabinet-making gives a good impression in the class-room, and, of course, teaches the pupils the use of tools, their instruction should be along the lines of boat-building, and repairing, which will be useful after they leave school. I have been over-ruled in this, but still consider I am right.\n\nThe requisition is submitted for your approval.\n\nI have the honour to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nB/DH.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, April 9th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd instant, you may purchase the articles shown on the enclosed list for the manual training department at the Sechelt Indian Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Limited, referring to the above noted payment. For your information I may say that the voucher when submitted by Indian Agent, Mr. Ball, was for $13.27. It was paid less 3\u00a2, discount on $1.71.\n\nChief Treasury Officer.\n\nHMG/J\nOttawa, Ontario,\nJuly 20, 1938.\n\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of the attached account from Marshall-Wells B. C. Limited.\n\nA similar account was forwarded from your office under cover of your voucher #9597 of May 1938. The item of $12.75 covering the cost of 50 lbs. \u00bc\" galvanized chain had been deleted when it reached here. This reduced the account to an amount of $11.56. You also attached an account of $1.71, dated May 4, 1938, for some supplies for the Sechelt School. This account showed that it was subject to a discount of 2\u00bd% and we deducted 3\u00a2, making the net amount $1.68.\n\nAdding the amount of $11.56 and $1.68, gave an amount of $13.24. Cheque #43034 for this amount was issued and sent to the Company on June 25, 1938.\n\nWe are also in receipt of your voucher #9595 for $102.66. This amount includes an account of $12.75 for galvanized chain fence. Apparently it is the item that you previously deleted from the old account. A cheque for the latter account has not yet been forwarded to the Company, but will go forward in the near future.\n\nUnder the circumstances, I am enclosing the account Marshall-Wells B. C. Limited recently forwarded to us, and you should interview the Company and straighten out the matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division\n\nEnc.\n\nF. J. C.

Limited.\n\nI have made a number of enquiries regarding this matter, but have been unable to ascertain why the account was sent to you, or who was responsible for it being done. Marshall Wells advise that they have a number of temporary employees substituting while their regular staff are on annual leave, and this probably accounts for the mistake.\n\nWhen the account for the School was received at this office, it was noticed that they had included the chain purchased for the new float at Klahoose Reserve, so this amount was deleted, and the account forwarded to you. The chain was then added to the account covering the float, and that account forwarded to you. Marshall Wells Ltd. was advised of this action at the time, and I cannot understand how they came to send another account to you later.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDH.\n\n(F.J.C.Ball)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n167-18-11 CLOSED\n\nFROM 16/7/31\n\nTO 27/7/38\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10 Volume 6461)\n\nFile 887-10, part 3,\nVancouver Agency - Sechelt Residential School -\nAdmissions & Discharges 1934-1939\n\nFile 887-10, part 4,\nVancouver Agency - Sechelt Residential School -\nAdmissions and Discharges 1939 - 1944\n\nFile 887-10, part 5,\nVancouver Agency - Sechelt Residential School -\nAdmissions & Discharges 1943 - 1952\n\nFile 887-11, part 1,\nVancouver Agency - Sechelt Residential School -\nVocational Training-Supplies-Accounts\n1931 - 1938\n\nFile 887-11, part 2,\nVancouver Agency - Sechelt Residential School -\nBuilding Maintenance-Supplies-Accounts-Vocational\nTraining 1938 - 1946\n\nFile 887-11, part 3,\nVancouver Agency - Sechelt Residential School -\nVocational Training-Accounts-Instructors'\nSalaries 1947 - 1950\n\nFile 887-14, part 1,\nVancouver Agency - Sechelt Residential School -\nLivestock-Accounts 1923 - 1946\n\nFile 887-17, part 1,\nVancouver Agency - Sechelt Residential School -\nCadet Corps Band Set-Accounts 1939 - 1945\n\nFile 887-22, part 1,\nVancouver Agency - Sechelt Residential School -\nTuition payments 1949 - 1950\n\nFile 887-23, part 1,\nVancouver Agency - Sechelt Residential School -\nDeath of Pupils. 1936 - 1937\nSir:\n\nI beg to advise that the Reverend Principal of Sechelt Residential School has applied for the manual training instructor, Mr. Morley, to be placed on full time at the school so that he can do carpentry and other work around the school premises. At present he is paid $8.00 per day for classes held, averaging $60.00 per month. There are approximately forty boys at the school, the primary classes not receiving manual training instruction.\n\nWhile Mr. Morley's services as manual training instructor are satisfactory to the school, it will be recalled that I objected to his employment because he was not qualified to instruct in boat-building, which in my opinion is important for coast Indians. Mr. Morley is no doubt useful in repair work around the school, staff houses, barns and other buildings. Whether this can be included in his work as manual training instructor is for the Department to decide.\n\nThe Reverend Principal, Father Cornell, has done excellent work in bringing this school to its present high standard in so short a time.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C. Ball]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa,\nAugust 22, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 10th instant with reference to the manual training instructor at the Sechelt Indian Residential School.\n\nAs you are no doubt aware this man's salary is paid from the B.C. Special Appropriation which is intended for special expenditures. It would not be possible to consider paying Mr. Morley a salary from this Appropriation for doing minor repair work at the school as services of this nature should be supplied by the school staff. Under these circumstances it is not possible for the Department to favourably consider the request of the Reverend Principal of the Sechelt Residential School.\n\nI have carefully noted the contents of the second paragraph of your letter but in view of the fact that Mr. Morley's services have been satisfactory along certain lines at least, and as the new school year is rapidly approaching, I do not consider it advisable to make any change at the present time.\n\nHowever, the Reverend Principal and yourself should, during the coming school year, make inquiries with a view to recommending for the Department's consideration for the school year 1939-40 a manual training instructor who would be competent to do boat building and boat repairing.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.J.C.

We had a letter from the Chief Treasury Officer, dated July 19th, in which he stated that the matter had in turn been referred to your department for a reply.\n\nTo date we have not heard from you and we are still holding this cheque until we have details which will enable us to have it properly credited.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMARSHALL-WELLS B. C. LIMITED\n\nWRBelfry/NW\nCredit Department.\n\nEnc.\nOttawa,\nAugust 27, 1938.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 19th instant enclosing copy of your letter of the 4th ultimo in connection with an account which you submitted for material supplied to the Sechelt Indian Residential School.\n\nFollowing receipt of your letter of the 4th ultimo Indian Agent Ball was written and he replied by stating that a slight change was made in your original account and you were so informed at the time. Today a cheque for $102.66 is going forward to you. As far as our records show this covers all amounts for which we have received vouchers.\n\nIf you still consider that there is any amount due your firm from this Department I would appreciate if you would consult Indian Agent F.J.C. Ball and adjust the matter with him. If it is necessary to forward another voucher he will do so.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nW. R. Belfry, Esq.,\nCredit Department,\nMarshall-Wells B.C. Limited,\n573 Carrall St.,\nVancouver, B. C.\nSir,\n\nFile 167-18-11\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 22nd ultimo advising me that Mr. Morley, manual training instructor at Sechelt Indian Residential School cannot be given full time employment. I have discussed this further with the school, and I am advised that Mr. Morley is working only 5 hours per week or $2\u00bd each term for $150. This is $2.40 per hour. I do not know what hours the Department requires, but $2.40 appears to be too high for the work he is doing.\n\nAs previous correspondence at the time of his appointment contains full particulars, I do not feel that I should again raise the issue. Under Mr. Morley the pupils are doing good work of the type in which they are instructed, such as making desks, tables, cedar-chests etc., but I think he should work three times as many hours for the same money, or at the rate of 80\u00a2 per hour, the rate most carpenters receive. Possibly this extra time would cover the Reverend Principal's request for a full time instructor.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F. J. C.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nYour File 167-18-11.\n\nI have to refer to Mr. Hosey's letter of the 6th ultimo in the matter of the appointment of Mr. E. J. Henderson as Manual Training Instructor at Sechelt Indian Residential School.\n\nThe question of procedure in such appointments was discussed with Inspector Barry, and I quote hereunder excerpts from his report to me regarding same:\n\n\"Manual Training is part of the curriculum in almost all of our Indian Residential Schools in B.C. Manual Training Instructors are appointed, as are all other members of the school staff, by the Principal of the school, without any particular reference of the matter either direct to Ottawa or indirectly through your own office.\n\n\"Ever since my own appointment as Inspector of Schools and probably for years before that it has been understood that while the appointment of the Principal of an Indian Residential School, on the nomination of the Church concerned, is subject to the final approval of the Department in Ottawa, the appointment of members of the school staff in these schools is a matter for the Principal alone. It is true that when a member of the school staff is reported on adversely the Department has as a general rule upheld my own findings and requested the Principal to make a change to remedy the adverse conditions reported on by me. This in no way invalidates the general rule that the Principal is alone responsible for appointments to and dismissals from his staff.\"\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIn .....\n\"In conclusion I may say for the information of the Department that I was not informed of the vacancy for a Manual Training Instructor at Sechelt. I know nothing of the qualifications of Mr. R.J. Henderson of Vancouver though I have on file particulars of a Mr. R. Henderson, Manual Training Instructor, of Vancouver, and for some time at St. George's Indian Residential School, Lytton, who would be quite unsuitable for the Sechelt appointment.\n\n\"Under the circumstances I would recommend that the Reverend Principal of the Sechelt Indian Residential School be permitted to exercise his undoubted privilege in appointing a Manual Training Instructor of his own choice. I do not consider that the Department should go on record at this stage and in any way restrict the actions of the Reverend Principal.\n\n\"When the Sechelt Indian Residential School is next inspected, and this will be before Christmas if I can manage it, a full report will of course be made on the Manual Training.\n\n\"Should my report on the above training be adverse the Department would no doubt take steps to have the school authorities make a change in the staff.\"\n\nThe Reverend Principal of Sechelt School in engaging Mr. Henderson was simply exercising a right which has been recognized and approved by the Department for many years and which applies in all our Indian Residential Schools in British Columbia.\n\nInspector Barry will report on Mr. Henderson's work as Manual Training Instructor, following the forthcoming inspection of Sechelt Residential School.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\"\nOttawa,\nOctober 31, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn view of the contents of your letter of the 24th instant the appointment of Mr. E. J. Henderson as manual training instructor at the Sechelt Indian residential school is approved subject, of course, to his qualifications being found satisfactory when Inspector Barry next inspects this school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI am advised by the Reverend Principal of Sechelt Residential School that the Manual Training teacher Mr. Morley, of Sechelt, has left the school, and that they have hired Mr. E.J. Henderson, of Vancouver, to take his place.\n\nIs this in accordance with the Department's procedure in such matters?\n\nMr. Morley was appointed in 1936 in spite of my objection that he could not instruct in boat-building, the most necessary part of manual training for Coast Indians.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F. J. C. Ball]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nSir:\n\nI wrote you on August 31st last, as per copy attached, and have had no reply.\n\nPresumably, the Department approves of the change, as an account has been received from the School for the September quarter, and has been forwarded to Ottawa for payment.\n\nMr. Henderson is capable of doing this work and says he can teach boat-building if required. He is a Roman Catholic, and acceptable to the Reverend Principal who engaged him in Mr. Morley's place.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nB/DH.\n\n(F.J.C.Ball)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa,\nNovember 2, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 25th ultimo regarding the manual training instructor at the Sechelt Indian residential school I may say that the following letter was forwarded to Indian Commissioner Mackay on the 31st ultimo:\n\n\"In view of the contents of your letter of the 24th instant the appointment of Mr. E. J. Henderson as manual training instructor at the Sechelt Indian residential school is approved subject, of course, to his qualifications being found satisfactory when Inspector Barry next inspects this school.\"\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F.J. C. Ball,\nIndian Agent,\n416 Federal Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to refer to your letter of October 19th authorizing the purchase of lumber and equipment for the Manual Training Division of the Sechelt Indian Residential School. The application for these materials was made by the Reverend Principal of the School and was endorsed and forwarded direct to the Department by Mr. Indian Agent Bell.\n\nThe requisition calls for a large quantity of hardwoods and I doubt if the Department took into consideration the costs involved when the application was approved. Quotations have been received for all the soft woods and about one-quarter of some of the hard woods applied for, and the lowest estimate received was $345.64. The tools and hardware will cost approximately $113.00 so that the total cost with a considerable reduction in the amount of the hard woods would be approximately $460.00.\n\nI think it is a mistake to purchase expensive hard woods for the Manual Training Division of our Schools. The Indians will not have these woods available to them on their Reserves, and I am satisfied that if they are trained to work with the native woods of the Province that the aim of such training will be met equally as well as if expensive hard woods were used. Before placing the order I should appreciate your further instructions in this matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nNovember 28, 1939.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of the 21st instant the Department considers that it is unnecessary to incur a higher expenditure than $460.00 in the purchase of lumber, tools and hardware for the vocational training division of the Sechelt school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

He is a manual-training instructor working part-time at the school, on a salary of $50.00 per month, eligible for compensation under the Dominion Government Workmen's Compensation Act as administered by the Provincial Government Board. Chapter 30 of the 1920 statutes and amendment of 1931 appears to cover it, but I have not heard of any claims having been made.\n\nI think the question was raised because a manual-training instructor, appointed by the school authorities without reference to us, and who was discharged by the Reverend Principal in threatening suit under the Minimum Wage Act because the school offered, and he accepted odd-job work at the same salary for two months when the school was closed. The Reverend Principal is now perplexed because he thought such statutes as the Minimum Wage and Workmen's Compensation Acts did not apply to the school, and in case of injury to the manual trainer, he is afraid the school would have to pay him compensation.\n\nPersonally I consider he would be covered by the Dominion Government Workmen's Compensation Act, but I would be glad of your advice so that the Reverend Principal may rest assured on that point.\n\nWith regard to the Minimum Wage Act, we are not concerned in this case as the man was not employed by the Department whilst school was closed.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.

Also please advise me the name of the instructor and the dates he was employed.\n\nWould you kindly forward me, if possible, a copy of the Workmen's Compensation Act for the Province of British Columbia, and a copy of the Minimum Wage Act.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF.

This Act may be cited as the \"Workmen's Compensation Amendment Act, 1939.\"\n\n2. Section 8 of the \"Workmen's Compensation Act,\" being chapter 312 of the \"Revised Statutes of British Columbia, 1936,\" is amended by striking out subsection (6), and substituting therefor the following:\n\n\"(6.) A workman who becomes disabled from uncomplicated silicosis or from silicosis complicated with tuberculosis on or after the first day of January, 1936, shall be entitled to compensation for total or partial disability as provided by this Part; and where death results from such disability the dependents of such workman shall be entitled to compensation as provided by this Part; but neither a workman nor his dependents shall be entitled to compensation for such disability or death unless the workman:\n\n\"(a.) Has been a resident of this Province for a period of at least three years last preceding his disablement; and\n\n\"(b.) Was free from silicosis and tuberculosis before being first exposed to dust containing silica in the metalliferous-mining industry in this Province; and\n\n\"(c.) Has been a workman exposed to dust containing silica in the metalliferous-mining industry in this Province.\"\nfor a period or periods aggregating three years preceding his disablement; and\n\n'(d.) Has been a workman in the metalliferous-mining industry in this Province for at least three months in the five years last preceding his disablement; and\n\n'(e.) Has filed a claim for compensation while employed in the metalliferous-mining industry in this Province, or within five years after the date of leaving such employment in this Province, and in any case within one year after the date on which he became disabled:\n\n\"Provided that if it is proved that the workman has been exposed to the inhalation of dust containing silica elsewhere than in this Province, the amount of compensation payable shall be reduced by the proportion that the period he has worked elsewhere than in this Province so exposed bears to the total period he has worked so exposed.\"\n\n3. Section 71 of said chapter 312 is amended by adding thereto the following:\u2014\n\n\"(3.) The Board, subject to the approval of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, may establish and maintain a fund, to be known as the 'Superannuation Fund,' for the payment of superannuation allowances to its employees or of allowances upon the disability or death of its employees, by contributions from the employees of the Board and from the Accident Fund; and, subject to the like approval, may determine the amounts of superannuation or other allowances and the conditions upon which they may be paid and the persons to whom they may be paid; and the Board, subject to the like approval, may use the Superannuation Fund to purchase superannuation allowances for its employees from the Crown in right of the Dominion, or from the Crown in right of the Province, or from an insurance company or companies. The costs of administering the Superannuation Fund shall be part of the cost of the administration of the Act.\"\nCHAPTER 67.\n\nAn Act to amend the \"Workmen's Compensation Act.\"\n\n[Assented to 9th December, 1938.]\n\nHIS MAJESTY, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of British Columbia, enacts as follows:\n\n1. This Act may be cited as the \"Workmen's Compensation Act Amendment Act, 1938.\"\n\n2. Section 9 of the \"Workmen's Compensation Act,\" being chapter 312 of the \"Revised Statutes of British Columbia, 1936,\" is amended by inserting after the word \"railway,\" in the second line of clause (b) of subsection (1), the words \"aeroplane, flying-machine, truck, bus, or other vehicle used in transportation of passengers or freight.\"\n\n3. Section 16 of said chapter 312 is amended as follows:\n\n(a.) By striking out the words \"one hundred\" in the third line of subsection (1), and substituting therefor the words \"one hundred and twenty-five\":\n\n(b.) By striking out the word \"thirty-five\" in the third line of clause (a) of subsection (2), and substituting therefor the word \"forty\":\n\n(c.) By striking out the word \"thirty-five\" in the third line of clause (b) of subsection (2), and substituting therefor the word \"forty\"; and by striking out the word \"sixty-five\" in the sixth line thereof, and substituting therefor the word \"seventy\":\n\n(d.) By striking out the word \"sixty-five\" in the seventh line of clause (e) of subsection (2), and substituting therefor the word \"seventy.\"\n4. Section 17 of said chapter 312 is amended by striking out subsections (2) and (3) thereof, and substituting therefor the following:\n\n\"(2.) Where by reason of the payment of such lesser sum to alien dependents residing outside of the Dominion there remains an undistributed accumulation of money in the reserve provided, the Board shall pay compensation therefrom to dependent widows and children residing in the Dominion as follows:\n\n\"(a.) An additional sum to each dependent widow to increase her compensation up to the monthly sum of forty dollars;\n\n\"(b.) The sum of seven dollars and fifty cents monthly for each dependent child under the age of sixteen years and for each dependent invalid child over that age, who, by reason of the limitations fixed by the Act, are not receiving the compensation to which they would otherwise be entitled, and where the dependents are children without any widow or invalid widower, in payment of fifteen dollars monthly for each dependent child under the age of sixteen years and for each dependent invalid child over that age, who, by reason of the limitations fixed by the Act, are not receiving the compensation to which they would otherwise be entitled;\n\n\"(c.) The compensation herein provided shall be in lieu of all right to compensation to which any person may be entitled from the accumulation provided under subsection (1) of this section.\"\n\n5. Section 19 of said chapter 312 is amended by striking out the words \"sixty-two and one-half\" in the third line of subsection (1), and substituting therefor the words \"sixty-six and two-thirds.\"\n\n6. Section 20 of said chapter 312 is amended by striking out the words \"sixty-two and one-half\" in the third line of subsection (1), and substituting therefor the words \"sixty-six and two-thirds.\"\n\n7. The amendments of said chapter 312, enacted by sections 3, 5, and 6, shall come into operation on the first day of January, 1939, and shall apply only in respect of accidents which happen on or after that day; and the payments provided under the amendments enacted by section 4 shall commence with the month of January, 1939.\n\nVICTORIA, B.C.:\nPrinted by CHARLES F. BANTFORD, Printer to the King's Most Excellent Majesty.\nTAXID.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6461, file 887-11, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nre: File No.167-18-11\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo and to enclose herewith copy of the Workmen's Compensation Act as requested.\n\nThe new Principal at Sechelt Indian Residential School advised me that he made a settlement with the Manual Training Instructor, whose name is Stanton, rather than have any publicity about it, but did not tell me what he settled for, and he has been replaced by a Mr. O'Grady, brother of Rev. Father O'Grady, so there will be no similar difficulties with him.\n\nOriginally the Manual Training Instructor was an outside man who went to the School for the requisite number of hours per month. This was a clear-cut arrangement leaving no doubt or ambiguity as to his duties. When Rev. Fr. Fahlman was made Principal he changed the system, dismissing the instructor and employing another man who did other work around the school, for which they paid him extra wages, in addition to board and room, from the school grant. I do not think this system is altogether satisfactory, but it has apparently been approved by the Department.\n\nThere are two ways of viewing the matter. The School authorities say the boys get practical instruction when repairing buildings or erecting chickenhouses, tool sheds, stables, etc., and this is more valuable than purely instructional work in the class room. On the other hand, the pupils do not receive the individual instruction in fine workmanship and use of tools while working on practical jobs. In the class room they usually make tables, writing desks, ornamental boxes, chairs, etc., where joints, etc., have to be exact, whereas in the practical work the idea is to get the job done as quickly as possible. The ideal instruction, of course, would be a combination of the two.\n\nMy personal view, which counts for nothing nowadays, is that the most valuable instruction our Coast pupils can receive in manual training is in boat-building, but they receive none. There are boat at Sechelt School built by the pupils under a former instructor, but the past few instructors could not build boats. In some Agencies, the Indians compete with the Japanese in boat-building, and the School is the proper place to start instruction in this craft. I know of nothing more valuable to Indians from fishing communities than building their own boats. However, this is beside the point in question, which has apparently been settled, and the Reverend Principal does not want it discussed further.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nSechelt Residential School\nSECHELT, B.C.\n\nManual Training Grant for August and September 1940.\n\nAugust ---- $25.00\nSeptember ---- $25.00\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6461, file 827-11, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\nPay to: Sechelt Residential School.\n\nAddress: Sechelt, B.C.\n\nAllot. 78-22-158\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| 1940 | MANUAL TRAINING INSTRUCTION | $75.00 |\n\nSept.

We are obtaining monthly reports on these schools and are checking them very closely so that we can ascertain if any adjustments in the programme are necessary in order to make it as effective as possible. It is not our intention to extend the programme this year to the schools in any other parts of the Dominion. Under these circumstances we do not consider it advisable to request you to follow our programme at present. Manual training work has been carried out at the Sechelt School for several years and I feel certain that reasonable progress is being made. At the end of the current academic year we intend to give the whole matter very careful consideration and decide at that time to what other provinces we will extend the programme for the academic year 1942-43.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 11th instant, the Department approves purchase of manual training tools to a value of $460 for the Sechelt Indian Residential School.\n\nAs mentioned in my letter of February 7, regarding manual training equipment for the Kamloops School, the Department does not favour, at the present time, supplying power tools and consequently the tools in this class should not be secured for the Sechelt School.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Commissioner, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nre: File No. 215-14-1534\n\nReplying to your letter of the 24th instant advising me that the Department refuses to supply certain power tools to Sechelt Indian Residential School for manual training, I had the same opinion until recently - viz. that the boys would not have power tools on their Reserves; however, on several occasions lately, employers at mills and small boat-building places have told me that Indian employees do not know how to use such tools and have to be taught before they can expect to earn wages. That is an angle which I had overlooked and possibly it has not occurred to the Department.\n\nPerhaps if this was mentioned to them, they might reconsider their decision, although they will probably not entertain any such suggestion from a mere field man.\n\nB/DH.\n\nIndian Agent\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI would refer to your letter of the 17th instant, file 167-18-11, advising that the Department does not favour, at the present time, supplying power tools for Sechelt Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection, I enclose herewith for your information Mr. Indian Agent Ball's letter of the 25th instant advising that the lack of knowledge of handling such tools by Indians at the coast is necessitating their being trained to do so by industries in which they are being employed.\n\nIn the absence of Commissioner MacKay, the writer would advise that there may be some misunderstanding of the type of Indians who are being trained in our Residential Schools at the coast and it is thought that the enclosed photographs taken in connection with my inspection of the Cowichan Agency in 1942 may be of interest in this connection. One of these will show the Chief of the Esquimalt Reserve outside his boathouse standing beside a bandsaw which he has improvised from Ford truck wheels and using an old car engine for power. At the time of my visit the Chief was repairing a very large boat of the tug type for a white concern, this involving the use of heavy sawn timbers, mostly curved. It will be noticed from the photograph that the Chief is quite an old man and not the young ex-pupil type that would be expected to require such power tools. Indians up and down the coast are beginning to find the advantage of such machinery.\n\n(over)\nI also enclose photographs of some typical homes in the Cowichan Agency, which is not by any means outstanding on the coast in this respect, which would indicate that these Indians are rapidly passing the whipsaw stage.\n\nThe foregoing is not in any way intended to minimize the necessity of young Indians being thoroughly instructed in the use of hand tools.\n\nFor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnc.\nOttawa,\nMarch 6, 1944.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O.\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo with further reference to the purchase of tools for the manual training class at the Sechelt Residential School. In view of the information contained in your letter, the Department approves the purchase of the power tools which you consider most useful.\n\nR.A.

Calvert, Provincial School Inspector, following his inspection of the SECHELT INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL - Feb. 21-22, 1945.\n\nOriginal on 167-18-6\n\nVocational Training\n\nProvision has been made for boys to receive instruction in woodwork. Some good pieces of machinery, such as a turning lathe, band-saw, etc., have been installed recently. There is a good supply of saws, planes, and other tools. The equipment in this respect is quite good. The work benches are rather crude.\n\nThis work is carried on in an upstairs room which is far from satisfactory. A modern industrial arts room on the ground floor should be provided. These boys should be given instruction in boat-building, boat-repairing, forging, and metal work. Such training would be of great value to these boys after they leave school.\n\nThe young man who was in charge of this department and who appears to have done a good job was called to military service a few days ago.\n\nA shoe-repairing department seems to be carrying on a good piece of practical work.\nSechelt Residential School\nSECHELT, B.C.\n\nMARCH 1945\n\nTO CRAIG OR MANUAL TRAINER:\n\nJANUARY ------------ $50.00\nFEBRUARY ----------- $50.00\nMARCH -------------- $50.00\n\nTOTAL ------- $150.00\n\n[Signature]\n\nManual Trainer\n\nPrincipal\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**PAY TO:** Rev.

H. F. Dunlop, Principal of the Residential School, advises me that a number of the young unmarried men were keen to take these classes last fall so that they might learn enough to build their own houses and make repairs to them, but they all went away to work in logging camps, which are remote from the Reserve, and there are none on the Reserve at the present time.\n\nActing Indian Agent\n\nDH/EP\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa\n\nI enclose herewith a request for Manual Training supplies for Sechelt Residential School, and I would recommend that these be supplied.\n\nActing Indian Agent\n\nEncl.\n\nDH/EP\nOttawa, May 29th, 1946.\n\nMr. J.

Caldwell, replying to letter of May 29th from the Chief, Training Division, re requisition for an electric motor for use in the manual training department of the Sechelt I.R. School.\n\nIn view of the reason set forth for the purchase of this motor, will you kindly advise if purchase will be authorised. There is no doubt that it is very inconvenient to operate the band saw, which was supplied by the Department, without the motor, which is its implement, necessitating removal of a motor from another machine each time the band saw is used.\n\nAn early decision in this matter will be very much appreciated.\n\n(H.E.

F. Davey, Esq.,\nInspector of Schools,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\n325 Granville Street,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Davey:\n\nReference enclosed file received from you I would advise that I discussed the supply requisition with Rev. Father Dunlop recently and, in view of the amount of material needed for twenty-five pupils we could not suggest where any items should be deleted.\n\nA certain amount of material is inevitably wasted, especially by younger pupils who have to do assignments over again, and I am satisfied that the material requisitioned is not in excess of reasonable requirements.\n\nPaint in large containers is found less wasteful than small tins which may get taken away, mislaid, or spilled.\n\nOf the other items none is considered unnecessary.\n\n(H. E. Taylor),\nIndian Agent.\n\nEncl.\nAA.\nSeptember 29, 1948.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Manual Training Supplies\nSechelt Residential School\n\nAttached is a requisition from the Principal of the above mentioned school for manual training equipment and supplies, along with a letter in support of this requisition from Mr. Superintendent Taylor.\n\nInspector Davey is of the opinion that some of the quantities requested are excessive and he has either deleted or reduced these as indicated in red on the attached requisition.\n\nIt is recommended that this requisition be approved as amended by the Inspector.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOctober 6, 1948.\n\nMr. W. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nWe have your letter of the 29th ultimo, with reference to a requisition for manual training supplies for the Sechelt Residential School. It has been decided to allow an amount of $125.00 for materials. This sum does not include the cost of the 3\u00bd and 4\u00bd inch mails, which we do not consider necessary to be used by a manual training class.\n\nWe also feel that the quantity of lumber requested is excessive and in this connection you may authorize the Principal to purchase lumber at a cost not exceeding $175.00. We feel that this amount should purchase sufficient for the needs of the manual training class.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\nSechelt Residential School\nSECHELT, B.C.\n\nOct. 2, 1948\n\nPAY TO: ANTHONY PAIS\nSECHELT RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSECHELT, B.C.\n\nTo allowance towards salary of Manual Training Instructor\nat the SECHELT RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nFor the month of September 1948\n\nAMOUNT $60.00\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**TREASURY ONLY**\n\nPay to: Mr. Anthony Pals,\n\nAddress: Sechelt Residential School,\n\nSechelt, B.C.\n\n| DATE       | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 1948 OCTOBER | To grant towards salary of Manual Training Instructor at the Sechelt Indian Residential School, Sechelt, B.C., for September, 1948, as per attached account. | $60.00 |\n\nI hereby certify that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

This account was passed to the Treasury and we understand that a cheque has been issued.\n\nWe have not yet received the voucher from Mr. Taylor for the month of October. It is also noted that we have not received the Manual Training Instructor's report for that month.

Dunlop, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nSechelt Residential School,\nSechelt, B.C.,\n\nPP/HM.\nExtract from letter from Rev. H.F. Dunlop, O.M.I., Principal of the Sechelt Residential School, dated November 4th, 1948. Original on file 887-5.\n\nTo quote an example from among many, this year we were granted $250. for equipment. I requested among other things that out of this sum one electric motor be provided for the manual training shop. The motor was to cost $45. As my duties as principal require my presence in the school twenty four hours daily, I feel, that at least geographically, I am in a better position to state what things are most useful in the school than one, let us say, who lives 3000 miles away and has never even seen the inside of the school! Yet, this request was flatly refused although this motor was to be used for the operation of equipment already supplied by the Department. What utter nonsense is this!!\nMr. H.E. Taylor, Supt. Indian Agency, Vancouver, wrote on 18 September, 1943, as follows:\n\nRequesting equipment -\n\nOne 1/3 H.P. electric motor at $36.00 for operating power equipment used in manual training instruction.\n\nIn a letter dated October 7, 1943, the Department replied as follows:\n\nWe are not prepared to authorize the purchase of the electric motor for the Manual Training Shop.\n| REGISTRATION NO. | PUPILS' NAMES     | AGE | GRADE | OPERATIONS LEARNED & GRADE | Time Devoted |\n|------------------|-------------------|-----|-------|----------------------------|--------------|\n| 231              | Carney Point      | 14  | A     | Repair of School desks     | 13\u00bd          |\n| 212              | Junior Paul       | 14  | B     | Repair of tables and chairs|              |\n| 237              | Adam Point        | 14  | C     |                            |              |\n| 224              | Louie Lewis       | 15  | A     | 2 Storage bins             |              |\n| 232              | Leonard Johnson   | 13  | B     | Racks for musical instr.   |              |\n| 261              | Tommy Jimmie      | 14  | B     |                            |              |\n| 239              | Benny Billy       | 14  | C     |                            |              |\n| 225              | Moses Wilson      | 15  | A     |                            |              |\n| 226              | Peter Wilson      | 14  | C     |                            |              |\n| 234              | Frank Wilson      | 14  | C     |                            |              |\n| 233              | Tommy Paul        | 13  | B     |                            |              |\n\nIn the Junior Class there are 14 pupils.

Pate, am Manual Training Instructor for Skeetch Indian Residential School, under Rev. Zachariah Dunlop, O.M.I., Principal.\n\nI am informing you, Sir, on my failure to receive the monthly checks, you pay me for this work.\n\nWhen I took over this job, I was informed that the salary was $60.00 per month, payable on the 15th of each following month. I.E. September salary paid on October 15th and so on. As per these agreements I took over the job.\nI have done this work for three and one half (3\u00bd) months now Sir. I received payment for the month of September on the twelfth (12th) of November, and since then have not received payment at all. You owe me for October and November.\n\nI surely don't have to point out the impossibility of living on sixty dollars ($60.00) for three or four months! Can you do it? I'm sure that neither you nor any of your staff, if they had to wait three months for their salary, would like it.\n\nI don't wish to write you a nasty letter Sir, but surely your department can do better than you've done. If you expect me to keep my agreements surely you can keep yours.\n\nThis is the first time I have \"squawked,\" don't you think mine is reasonable. I wish to be paid according to my agreements, not 3 or 4 months later.\n\nIf you were in my position wouldn't you be annoyed and quite a little angry at\nsuch a state of affairs.\n\nI hope you will soon inform me that this situation has been adjusted.\n\nThank you. \"Sir\"\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6461, file 887-11, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**TREASURY ONLY**\n\n| DATE       | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT   |\n|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| 1948 Dec. 27 | To grant for Manual Training Instructor at the Sechelt Indian Residential School at $60. a month for October and November: | $120.00 |\n\n---\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

On reviewing our records it is noted that the Manual Training reports were submitted in the usual manner but there were no vouchers attached for payment of salary.\n\nOn the strength of the returns, we are arranging to forward payment of Mr. Pals for October and November. He will be paid for the month of December on the receipt of a Report and a voucher. I might again point out that the vouchers should be made in favour of the school reading \"To grant for Manual Training Instructor at the Sechelt Indian Residential School at $60. a month\".\n\nAs we have no completed application for the appointment as Manual Training Instructor for Mr. Pals, one is being attached for his completion and return to this office.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\n\nRev.

The Sechelt School is considerably smaller than the Alberni school and it is therefore recommended that a grant of $50.00 only be allowed in this case.\n\nW.S.

Taylor,\n416 Federal Bldg.,\nVANCOUVER.\n\nDear Mr. Taylor:\n\nAt the beginning of the school year we began a project for the children in leather work. I engaged an instructor to teach one of the staff the work in addition to supplying the necessary tools. Up to date I have expended over one hundred dollars.\n\nThe project has caught on quite well among the boys and they are showing real interest in the work. Since the project is well established and on firm ground I am hoping that the Department will be willing to aid us in continuing it.\n\nWould you do what you can to help us procure the items as listed on the enclosed forms. All items listed therein can be purchased at Bedford's Fine Leathers in Vancouver.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH. F.

Taylor,\nIndian Superintendent,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Taylor:\n\nIt has been necessary for me to engage a new manual Training Instructor and to greatly increase his salary. The Department at present allows a grant of $60.00 per month towards this salary. Could this possibly be increased to $85.00. I am doing everything possible to hold this present instructor because he is eminently satisfactory but the wage consideration is quite a hardship. Mr. Rositch is a married man, a very good carpenter, an all round handy man and is able to assist considerably in teaching the boys the guitar, accordion etc. More than any other consideration, the boys have taken or shown an attitude of respect and cooperation towards him. The Department can be assured of very capable handling of the boys by further assisting us to pay the necessary adequate wage.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nL. Viney, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nW. S. Arneil, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nOctober 11, 1949.\n\nI enclose copies of a letter from the Principal of the Sechelt Indian Residential School requesting an increase in the grant for the Manual Training Instructor.\n\nIt is difficult to obtain suitable craftsmen as instructors and wages have risen considerably, so that it is necessary to make the position attractive.\n\nI would recommend consideration of the requested grant increase.\n\n(H. E. Taylor)\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nHET/FR\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Sechelt Residential School\nManual Training Instructor\n\nAttached is an application from Mr. Superintendent Taylor for an increase in the grant towards the salary of the Manual Training Instructor at the above mentioned school. This office has no information as to the qualifications of this instructor other than the recommendation of the Principal of the school. It is thought, however, that the Department will have this on file and it is recommended that he be placed on the Manual Training Instructor's salary schedule according to his qualifications.\n\nI am also enclosing Monthly Report covering the work of the Manual Training class during the month of September.\n\nW.S.

S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMarch 25, 1950.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Manual Training Instructor\nSechelt Residential School\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 16th instant it is regretted that your previous communication was overlooked. We do not appear to have received any application form for the appointment of the present Manual Training instructor. I enclose one of these forms which you should have completed and returned here.\n\nIn the meantime we are prepared to increase the allowance to the present instructor to $85.00 a month effective December 1, 1949. Our file shows that we have paid the allowance for the Manual Training instructor at the previous rate up to November 30, 1949. Please arrange to have an account forwarded immediately for the amount due at the increased rate for the months of December, 1949, and January, February and March, 1950. The Voucher should be dated previous to March 31 so that we can pay it from our current year's Appropriation.\n\nBernard F.

E.

Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools, regarding his inspection of the SECHELT INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL on May 19 & 20, 1931.\n\nOriginal on File 167-18-6.\n\nStock:\n\n1 Horse (16 years old).\n2 Cows (Old) These give very little milk, at present about one gallon per day.\nAbout 90 chickens, Wyandotte, Barred Rocks, and Leghorns. Many of these are dying. The chicken houses on Indian Reserve lands are old and I consider full of disease, lice, etc. Many of the chickens are, I believe, suffering from white diarrhea. The only thing that could be done in this case is to build new houses for the small chickens and to burn the old houses. Many of the old birds should be killed.\n\nMilk is bought in the form of fresh cream. Water is added. Twenty-five pounds of this cream are bought per week. I am informed that the children get over one cup of this milk per day. Eggs are also bought to the extent of a case (30 dozen) per week.\n\nAll the feed has to be bought for the cows. They use one ton of hay per month, with straw and oats in addition. The hay costs $26 per ton, with an extra $4.50 for freight.\nSir:\n\nI beg to advise that the Sechelt Residential School is having difficulty in obtaining an adequate supply of milk for the pupils. The boat leaves Vancouver three times a week but there is a break from Friday to Tuesday and in the soft climate at Sechelt, milk does not keep. The Principal, Rev. F. Maillard, says they have two cows, one a fairly good milker but the other is fifteen years old and is poor. He has requested me to write you and inquire whether two Jersey cows could be supplied to the school. He would be able to feed them and there is a good barn on the premises. There are many Jersey herds in the Fraser Valley from which a selection could be made at a reasonable price.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 22, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, with reference to the milk supply at the Sechelt Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that the Department will provide one milch cow if the school authorities will provide the other. Our funds are so limited that I cannot authorize accounts for both cows being forwarded to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n519 Metropolitan Bldg.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nEXTRACT from Inspector Barry's Report regarding his visit to the Sechelt Indian Residential School on April 19th, 20th and 21st, 1932. - Original on File 167-18-6.\n\nThere are only two cows at this school. Neither of them is of much use. They do not give more than a total of two gallons per day between them. They are very old Jersey-Holstein grades. One of them is hopeless. It is useless to send cows here as there is no place to find food for them. They would have to be stall fed.\n\nThe old horse mentioned in my report under the heading \"Stock\" last year, died and was replaced by the purchase of a horse and the necessary harness at a cost of $147.50. I have the honour to request that the Department will consider the question of refunding this sum to the school.\n\nStock:- 1 Horse, 2 Cows (Old) These give very little milk and are not worth keeping. It is very doubtful if any cows could be kept at this school with profit, as hay costs $26.00 per ton, with $4.50 freight, and 50\u00a2 wharfage at Sechelt. Milk is bought in the form of fresh cream, as mentioned above. The children get at least a cup of fresh milk daily. Eggs are bought to the extent of 30 dozen per week. There are now about 50 chickens at the school. As reported last year, these are dying off. They are kept in old chicken houses which are placed on the Indian Reserve lands close to the school. These houses are full of disease germs, and vermin. The only possible course to take would be to have these houses burned down, when all the chickens now housed here have either died or been killed off.\nOttawa, August 30th, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to your 4595 of June 27th, last, and, for your information, I enclose copy of a letter which is being directed to the Reverend Principal of the Nechako Indian Residential School.\n\nPlease let the Department know the size of the mattresses that are required.\n\nWith reference to the two milch cows, the Department considers that two good grade cows, either Holstein or Ayrshire, would be suitable. However, this is only offered as a suggestion and, if you have any special reasons for recommending some other breed, you should so state in your reply. In any event, you should give an estimate of the cost that would be incurred in purchasing two cows.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF.J.C. Hall, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n622 Metropolitan Bldg.,\nVancouver, B. C.\nMr. F.J.C. Ball,\nIndian Agent,\n416 Federal Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Ball:\n\nFor some time we have felt the necessity for giving our boys training in gardening and general farming. The chief obstacle to the implementing of this plan is lack of workable land. When the School was first erected the Department set aside 4.4 acres for the school buildings. This is completely utilized now by the main building, playgrounds for boys and girls, Father's residence, barn capable of holding 10 cows, wood yard holding 200 cords, and one acre fenced off as a pasture for 5 cows.\n\nSome 15 years ago the Department arranged with the Indians to cede to the School 10.6 acres of heavily wooded land. This property directly adjoins the original grant. An attempt was made at clearing this land about \u00bd acre being prepared and gardening attempted. Since then nothing has been done until this fall when we cleared, ploughed and harrowed 2 acres which will be ready for seeding this spring. An analysis of the soil has been made and recommendations given as how best to obtain a crop. A pipe line has been laid for irrigating.\n\nAt present we have engaged 6 Indians to cut the trees in line with the part cleared. During the coming summer we can stump this and so have approximately 5 acres ready for cultivation. The expense to do this work is reasonable, but to pay all of it out of the School grant places a heavy burden upon us. We know that the Department has always been favourable to the policy of teaching the children general farming so we are appealing to you to place our case before them as stated above.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\"E.J. Cornell\" O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a copy of a letter received from the Reverend Principal of Sechelt Residential School.\n\nReverend Baxter has recently gone to Sechelt from Kamloops as vice-Principal, and is doing some general agricultural work there. He expects to clear this 10 acres and raise vegetables, and feed for his chickens.\n\nThe soil in the Sechelt district has never been considered good enough for agriculture, and will need heavily fertilizing to be productive. However, I should like to see Father Baxter encouraged in what he is trying to do.\n\nRecently he has employed four or five adult Indians from the village, besides the pupils, and they have cleared about 1/2 acre as he states in his letter, and they have cut down the brush on another 5 acres. He has requested a grant of about $200.00 to be used for wages, and claims to have spent $300.00 in wages from their own grant.\n\nIf any money is available for this purpose, it will be beneficial to the School if they can grow at least part of their vegetable requirements. Rev. Father Cornell is quite successful in his operation of this School which has been rather a difficult school to manage in the past.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner, Major MacKay, visited the School recently and they applied to him for this assistance, but he told them to write me, so that I could forward it to you. He considers the School should be encouraged in this work.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa,\nDecember 21, 1939.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 14th instant enclosing copy of letter received from the Principal of the Sechelt Residential School regarding plans that he has in mind to increase the acreage of the tillable land at the school.\n\nI note the expenditure that will be required to carry out the Principal's suggestions and while we strongly approve such action, and under ordinary circumstances would be prepared to allow the amount he requests, I regret that at the present time our funds are so limited that it is not possible for us to favourably consider allowing the amount mentioned in your letter.\n\nYou might write to me again after April 1, 1940, at which time it might be possible to provide funds from our appropriation for the fiscal year 1940-41. However, things are so uncertain that I cannot give you a definite promise at the present time that favourable consideration will be given in April but I can assure you that the matter will receive very careful attention at that time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F.J.C. Ball,\nIndian Agent,\n416 Federal Bldg.,\nVancouver, B. C.\nSechelt Residential School\nSECHELT, B.C.\n\nMar. 20, 1946\n\nMr. F. J. C. Ball,\nFederal Bldg.,\nVANCOUVER.\n\nDear Mr. Ball:\n\nOur dairy cows here at the school are of mixed breed. As you know, our grain and hay must be shipped entirely from Vancouver. In our case, where our herd is of poor breed and consequently low in milk production it is very questionable whether it pays to keep a herd at all. On the other hand we must have fresh milk for the children. New four thoroughbred Jerseys would supply us with an abundance of good rich milk. But the price of thoroughbred cattle is quite high and it would be impossible to purchase them out of school funds. Would you, therefore, place before the department a request for assistance in establishing a thoroughbred herd for the school. A jersey herd would benefit the health of the children by the richness of its milk and also it would help to lower the operational costs of the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH. F. Dunlop, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nI have received the enclosed letter from the Reverend Principal of Sechelt Residential School.\n\nThey usually have either 3 or 4 cows but they are poor grade stock. I suggested to the Reverend Principal that he should try to get better grade cows as it costs no more to feed good ones, but he considers they cannot be purchased from the school grant.\n\nThere has been a remarkable improvement at this school in the food supplied to the children. They have a flock of pure bred hens which enables the pupils to have a regular supply of eggs and each child receives fresh milk daily. They kill most of their own beef and pork, and there has been an entire absence of complaints, whereas formerly the Indians claimed their children had to be given additional food by their parents.\n\nWhile it is too late to assist the school during the present fiscal year, I hope this request will be borne in mind during the coming year, as it would be money well spent.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6461, file 887-14, part 1)\nOttawa, May 4, 1946.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.,\n\nIn a letter dated March 31st, 1946, Indian Agent Ball forwarded a letter which he received from the Principal of the Seehelt Residential School with reference to securing some better grade cows.\n\nMr. Ball states that there has been a remarkable improvement at this school in the food supplied to the children. They have a flock of pure bred hens and the pupils receive eggs regularly. He further states that there has been an absence of complaints on the part of the parents regarding the food the children receive.\n\nIn his letter Reverend H.F. Dunlop states that Jersey cattle be purchased. I am inclined to recommend holsteins, however, you are in the best position to decide what breed of cattle should be obtained.\n\nI discussed the whole matter with Mr. Hoey this morning and he states that we could purchase a few head of cattle for this school and charge the cost to the Agriculture and Stock Raising section of the B.C. Special appropriation.\n\nHow many head of cattle do you think we should obtain for this school and at what price can they be obtained?\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nFather Fleury of St. Mary's Indian School very kindly visited Mr. Evans' Jersey farm in the Fraser Valley. Mr. Evans will have thoroughbred Jersey cows for sale in about three weeks time. If the Department is willing to go ahead with the purchase he promised to pick out four for us himself. The price of Jerseys run from $175 to $225.\n\nFather Fleury was also speaking to the Inspector for Holstein herds. It is his opinion that Jerseys would be more suitable in a place of this nature where all feed must be imported and there is no grazing range. The price of Holsteins runs from about $200 to $300.\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nVancouver\n\nYour File 215-14-3841\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 7th instant in connection with supplying dairy cows to the Sechelt Indian Residential School.\n\nI have been in correspondence with Father Dunlop in regard to the breed preferred, and am enclosing copy of his letter in this connection.\n\nI am inclined to agree with the Reverend Father that Jerseys would be more suitable for him, situated as he is where all feed has to be shipped in from Vancouver.\n\nI would recommend the purchase of four young Jersey cows.\n\nActing Indian Agent\n\nEnclosure\n\nEP\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Phelan's letter of May 4th in connection with the proposed supply of dairy cows for the Sechelt Indian Residential School, I am forwarding for your information Mr. Acting Agent Caldwell's letter of May 27th and copy of a letter from the Principal of the school, wherein he states a preference for Jersey cows, which are available at a cost of from $175.00 to $225.00 each. Aside from other advantages which Jersey cows might have, in view of the fact that there is no natural grazing land in the vicinity of Sechelt and as all feed must be shipped in from Vancouver, I would recommend that authority be granted for the purchase of 4 Jersey cows for the school.\n\nD.

I believe that if we could receive a grant of $100.00 we could procure just about enough instruments to complete our Band. We already have two drums, two cornets, a baritone and a tenor which we got for about $80.00. We need two clarinets, a saxophone and a bass or trombone and I think we could get all these for $100.00 at the same place we got the others.\n\nIn one of our previous conversations you mentioned that you might be able to get us two outdoor drinking fountains like you provided at the North Vancouver School. If you can still get these for us, we would find them very useful.\n\nWithing you the best of health and hoping to see you soon, I remain\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nE.J.Cornell \"O.M.I.\"\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith copy of a letter received this morning from the Reverend Principal of Sechelt Residential School. The school has the nucleus of a band which gives the children much pleasure, and should be encouraged, as the confinement of Indian children in any institution, no matter how good, is foreign to their nature, and anything which will raise their spirits and keep them happy warrants favourable consideration. I hope the Department will be able to comply with the Reverend Principal's request.\n\nWith regard to the drinking fountains, these are a health measure. The two I recommended and placed in Squamish Residential School last year have been worth a great deal to them, and the Reverend Principal there is most grateful for them. The cost was $51.96 for the material, and the School supplied the labour. There would be a slight extra cost for freight and packing if they are supplied to Sechelt School, and if funds are available, I would recommend it as a health measure.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\n[F.J.C.Bell]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, July 8, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 21st instant, with reference to the Band at the Sechelt Indian Residential School.\n\nThe request for the Department to make a grant towards the purchase of additional instruments should have been brought to our attention at the time the estimates were being prepared for the current fiscal year. In view of the present set-up of our appropriation, it is practically impossible for us to give favourable consideration to expenditures for which funds have not been specifically provided.\n\nI regret that we cannot favourably consider the request of the Principal of the Sechelt school, but you can again direct our attention to the matter when forwarding your estimates for the fiscal year 1940-41.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nF. J. C. Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n416 Federal Building,\nVancouver, B. C.\nSechelt Residential School\nSECHELT, B.C.\n\nJuly 16, 1945.\n\nMr. F. J. C. Ball,\nFederal Bldg.,\nVancouver.\n\nDear Mr. Ball:\n\nLast year, as you know, we organized a troop of BOY SCOUTS here at the school. The results of this project were extremely gratifying. The uniform - the emphasis on outdoor life appealed very strongly to our boys. As an aid in training children I could imagine no organization more suitable. The scout code of cleanliness of mind and body; its insistence on respect and courtesy; on honor and honesty; on providing for future contingencies are all qualities usually conspicuously absent in the Indian. I intend, therefore, to carry on with scouting in a more intensified manner during the coming term.\n\nOn the girl's side we have no organization of this kind. I should like very much to form a troop of GIRL GUIDES. However I am faced with an obstacle ever present in the smaller school, namely, a financial one. The scouts up to date have cost the school $100.00. Considering that there will be more than double the number of girls eligible for membership in the Guides this project would become a severe strain on the slender resources of this school. Would you, therefore, place before the department (B.C. Special Grant) a request for $250.00 to aid in the organizing of the GIRL GUIDES in this school. I assure you the valuable training the children will receive from this organization cannot be valued in dollars and cents.\n\nAs you understand the money will be spent in the purchase of uniforms and equipment. Perhaps it might seem that uniforms are not essential, but I am sure you will agree with me that they are, for they give the children a sense of unity and pride in their club and an ideal to live up to. Lord Baden Powell whose writing show that he possessed an insight into a child's nature far beyond the average man realized fully and acted upon it.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH. F. Dunlop,\nPrincipal.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nI enclose herewith a request from Rev. H. F. Dunlop, O.M. I., for assistance in obtaining uniforms for a proposed Girl Guide Company at the School.\n\nThe Boy Scout Troup has made a very fine showing and were highly commended when they visited Vancouver recently. I would like to see this Girl Guide Troup formed if the amount can be made available. There is no question but what the Boy Scouts and Girl Guides of this School would enhance the esprit de corps.\n\nFather Dunlop has done a splendid job among these children, and they have made real progress under his care.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nFB/C\nEnc.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Ball's letter of August 21st in connection with the proposed grant of $250.00 to the Sechelt Residential School for the purchase of uniforms for the Girl Guide Troup at the school.\n\nNo provision was made in the current estimates for this expenditure but if funds are not now available an item could be entered in the 1946-47 estimates which have already gone forward to the Department.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, 5th September, 1945.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O.

On re-checking the Quarterly Return it is found that pupil 0195 Theresa Jeffries is stated to be in Grade 10. The return, however, does not indicate if she is taking Grade 10 in the school or at some other school.\n\nYou will, therefore, realize that it is impossible for us to make any extra grant.\n\nPlease let me know the names and register numbers of the children in your school who are attending the local High School. On receipt of this information, we will be prepared to make an extra allowance for both the current academic year and the academic year 1948-49.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

Dunlop, Principal of the Sechelt Residential School.\n\nI discovered accidently that the Department makes a small grant for children resident in the schools who are attending the local High School.

The grade tens started the term at Sekalft High School but for some reason they were recalled. Our Principal, Father Viney, is now visiting his sick father in Alberta. We do not know when to expect him back as his father is critically ill. Mr. Taylor, also is confined indoors because of illness, therefore, I am confident that you will solve our problems.\n\nThere are twenty four pupils in grades six to eight, and five in grade ten. I would suggest that the grade tens register as full time correspondence students, I would supervise their work and help them when necessary. In this way I could devote the greater part of the school day to the younger pupils. If you do not approve of this I would be pleased if you would allow grade ten to take Science and French by correspondence.\n\nI shall enclose a list of the students' names and ages you may need this information if you register them for correspondence. Kindly order six sets of grade ten texts.\n\nPlease order twelve copies of revised course Social Studies for grade seven, and twelve copies of revised course Social studies grade eight.\n\nThank you for all the kindness and help you have shown us in the past.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSister M. Alphonsus.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Sechelt Indian Residential School.\n\nAttached please find a self-explanatory letter from the senior teacher at the above named school. I do not understand why the Grade 10 class, which was originally admitted to the Provincial School, was withdrawn; however, it does not seem feasible at this late date to secure their re-admission.\n\nThe supply of the books is recommended.\n\nIn view of the need for immediate action, this office has authorized the enrolment of the five Grade 10 pupils for correspondence courses in two subjects. In view of the fact that the Sechelt School is receiving an additional tuition grant of $75.00 per pupil for these children, the Principal has been informed that the school administration will have to bear the cost of these correspondence courses.\n\nIf the books requested cannot immediately be supplied, will the Department kindly authorize this office to purchase them.\n\nW.

These members of the Board shall, in each other's presence, complete this memorandum, which shall then be forwarded to the Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, in one copy.\n\nThe Board of Inquiry shall, if at all practicable assemble within 48 hours of the pupil's death.\n\nThe parents or guardians of the deceased pupil shall be given notice of this inquiry and be permitted to attend it or to send a representative. They or their representative shall be asked if they wish to make a statement. In the event of their so wishing, their statement shall be attached to the report. The inquiry, however, shall not be delayed more than 72 hours after the time at which it would otherwise be held, to enable them to attend it.\n\nIf the Indian Agent is located at such a distance from the school as to make it impracticable for him to attend the Board, he shall request a responsible local resident to act for him. A suitable person for this duty would be a Justice of the Peace or a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted or Provincial Police. A more or less permanent arrangement of this kind might be necessary in some cases. The Department is prepared to pay a reasonable fee for this duty, on the Agent's recommendation. The report of the Board, in any case, must reach the Department through the Indian Agent's office.\n\nThis inquiry is not designed to take the place of, or prevent, any other inquiry, including an inquest, which may be required by law.\n\nIf the pupil died as the result of an accident, the Indian Agent is required to take the statements of the witnesses of the accident, and attach them to this memorandum.\n\nFORM No. 414.\nA.

STATEMENT OF THE PHYSICIAN WHO ATTENDED THE DECEASED PUPIL\n\nI attended George Freddie George from 22nd January 1936 to 20th March 1936. The immediate cause of death was phthisis.\n\nThe contributory cause of death was tuberculosis of right lower lobe.\n\nDo you consider that the Principal of the School, and the members of the School staff exercised reasonable care and judgment in regard to the illness and death of this pupil? Yes.\n\nDid they follow out your professional instructions? Yes.\n\nIf in either respect, you consider them to have been at fault, it is required that you express your carefully considered views as follows:\n\n[Signature]\nM.D.\nC. STATEMENT OF INDIAN AGENT\n\n1. Having heard and read over the statements of the Principal and the Physician, do you consider that all essential circumstances relating to the death of ...........................................\n\nGeorge Freddie George\n\nhave been recorded? Yes. If not, you are required to add here any further particulars which strike you as essential.\n\n................................................................................................................................\n\n................................................................................................................................\n\n................................................................................................................................\n\n2. In this space record any recommendations which the Board consider should be made to the Department in relation to the health or safety of the pupils of this School.\n\nAfter death of this pupil, the infirmary was thoroughly disinfected in accordance with instructions of the medical officer. Rev. Principal recommended that this pupil be sent to hospital in Vancouver but Dr. MacQuarrie advised he was unable to find room for him and that the school infirmary was the best which could be done for this pupil.\n\nField Ball\nChairman\u2014Indian Agent.\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a report on the death of Pupil No.182, Freddie George - registered as George Freddie George - who died in Sechelt Residential School on Sunday, March 29th 1936. By a sad coincidence, his father, Councillor Fred George, Sr., died in Vancouver General Hospital at almost exactly the same time.\n\nIt was not possible to hold the Board of Inquiry until April 2nd as the Reverend Principal was absent from the School until that date.\n\nThe history of this case is as follows: On March 19th, the Reverend Principal phoned me that he was bringing Freddie George to Vancouver for hospitalization, and asked me to advise Dr. McQuarrie, which I did. Upon being told that it was a pulmonary tuberculosis case, Dr. McQuarrie advised me it was no use bringing the boy to Vancouver, as St. Paul's Hospital would not accept the case, and all available space in the General Hospital was taken; I phoned this information to the Reverend Principal the same evening. He said he would keep the boy in bed until I could make some arrangements regarding him. Dr. McQuarrie thought the school infirmary was the best place for him under the circumstances; we could not send him to his home as his father was also seriously ill. On Saturday, March 28th, Dr. Inglis told me the boy was very sick, and said he must definitely be moved from the School as he was a menace to the other pupils. On Sunday, the 29th, at 10 a.m. I had another consultation with Dr. Inglis and told him I would have the boy removed on the first boat, and placed in a home at Squamish; arranging this with the Nurse, Miss Gerry. At 4 p.m. Sunday, Dr. Inglis called upon me again, saying the Reverend Principal had just phoned him that the boy had died, and they were taking the body to Vancouver on the boat leaving Sechelt that evening.\n\nThe Medical Officer, Dr. Inglis, states that everything possible was done for the boy at the School after he was found to be running a temperature. The mother did not wish to make a statement or attend the hearing. She had previously advised the Reverend Principal that the boy was not strong and had suffered a chest injury as a child, but there was no evidence of this injury.\n\nIncidentally, this is the second Board of Inquiry at the School within the past 7 months.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nB/DH.\n\n(F.J.C.

The inquiry, however, shall not be delayed more than 72 hours after the time at which it would otherwise be held, to enable them to attend it.\n\nIf the Indian Agent is located at such a distance from the school as to make it impracticable for him to attend the Board, he shall request a responsible local resident to act for him. A suitable person for this duty would be a Justice of the Peace or a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted or Provincial Police. A more or less permanent arrangement of this kind might be necessary in some cases. The Department is prepared to pay a reasonable fee for this duty, on the Agent's recommendation. The report of the Board, in any case, must reach the Department through the Indian Agent's office.\n\nThis inquiry is not designed to take the place of, or prevent, any other inquiry, including an inquest, which may be required by law.\n\nIf the pupil died as the result of an accident, the Indian Agent is required to take the statements of the witnesses of the accident, and attach them to this memorandum.\n\nForm No. 414.\nA.

Was up for part of the day but had no appetite. The nurse ordered him bed once more.\n\nPrincipal.\n\nNOTE: If the deceased pupil dies in hospital at a distance from the school, under the care of the physician or surgeon who attends him at the hospital, a clinical report of the patient's illness and death in the hospital is to be secured and attached to this memorandum.\nB. STATEMENT OF THE PHYSICIAN WHO ATTENDED THE DECEASED PUPIL\n\nI attended Simon Francis from Sept. 14th to Sept. 14th 1935. The immediate cause of death was Intestinal Obstruction.\n\nThe contributory cause of death was old tuberculosis, peritonitis with multiple adhesions of small intestines.\n\nDo you consider that the Principal of the School, and the members of the School staff exercised reasonable care and judgment in regard to the illness and death of this pupil? Yes.\n\nDid they follow out your professional instructions? Hospital.\n\nIf in either respect, you consider them to have been at fault, it is required that you express your carefully considered views as follows:\n\nThis patient was referred to me by Dr. J. Inglis & Co. on Sept. 14th. Upon his arrival at St. Paul's Hospital I had Dr. H. Seldon see him with me. On first admission over union I kept the case under observation until the morning of Sept. 14th when I called Dr. Seldon again to operate immediately.\n\nM.D.\nC. STATEMENT OF INDIAN AGENT\n\n1. Having heard and read over the statements of the Principal and the Physician, do you consider that all essential circumstances relating to the death of ...........................................\n\nhave been recorded? .................. If not, you are required to add here any further particulars which strike you as essential.\n\nA number of boys were taken sick as the result of eating green apples which they had stolen. All responded to school treatment except Jeffries, and the doctor was later called to attend him.\n\n2. In this space record any recommendations which the Board consider should be made to the Department in relation to the health or safety of the pupils of this School.\n\nNote - School care was judicious and everything possible was done for the boy. Dr. Inglis requests the school to notify him sooner when pupils are taken sick, but it would have made no difference in this case.\n\n[Signature]\n\nChairman\u2014Indian Agent.\nSir:-\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith the result of an inquiry into the death of Simon Francis Jefferies, late pupil of the Sechelt Residential School, who died following an operation in St. Paul's Hospital, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nThe boy's death was no doubt hastened as a result of eating green apples but his condition was serious before that although he had not reported sick, and the School did all they could for the boy. The only criticism of the school authorities is that sickness is not reported to the medical officer, Dr. Inglis, quickly enough. At the inquiry Dr. Inglis referred to an appendicitis case which is still in hospital, where he was not called until the boy was in serious condition.\n\nI have reported to the Department in connection with this School and have received routine replies which are unsatisfactory, regarding wholesale dismissals of the staff by the new Principal. I strongly objected to the action of the Principal in calling for the resignation of the manual training teacher who was appointed and paid by the Department and has done excellent work, and this matter is still being argued back and forth. He reports for duty on the appointed days but so far this term no instruction has been given as the Principal will not send the boys to his class-room. Meanwhile the pupils are without instruction in the most important part of their curriculum. I mention this as one incident of the actual harm being done by this irresponsible and unwarranted dismissing of employees. Possibly we have no say where the inside staff is concerned, but I think you should be acquainted with the facts. Dr. Inglis advises me that the Sister who has been nurse in the School for many years has been replaced in the general shake-up. The former nurse knew all the Sechelt Indians and their family histories and Dr. Inglis said he could absolutely trust her diagnosis of patients and she knew exactly when to call him. In Mr. Jefferies' case it would have made little or no difference but the appendicitis case might easily have had serious consequences and the boy is still in hospital. Dr. Inglis says that the former nurse would have recognized the symptoms immediately but by the time he was called, inflammation had become acute.\n\nI have never yet been able to obtain any clear understanding of an agent's duties with regard to residential schools. Some principals work with the agent\n\nHarold W. McGill, Esq., M.D.,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nand encourage him to inspect the school and see for himself what is going on, other principals appear to resent the agent going into the school, or taking the slightest interest in it.\n\nI know that the satisfactory standard at Seeholt School for the care of the pupils has not been maintained under the present regime and that not only is cooperation lacking but there is a veiled hostility becoming more and more apparent which I can not yet understand.\n\nThe school receives a generous grant from the Department more than sufficient to take care of these pupils and I would say that the Department's representative has a right to be consulted rather than ignored in matters affecting the education, welfare, safety and general well-being of the pupils.\n\nI am advised by some of the travelling salesmen that the amount of their orders for provisions has been greatly reduced since Reverend Father Fahlman succeeded Reverend Father Maillard last fall which would indicate that the feeding of the children is not up to the former standard, although I have no definite knowledge of this as yet. In the clinical report the pupil is shown as \"rather ill nourished\" but I presume the disease would cause that condition.\n\nI feel that it is my duty to report these matters to you even if I exceed my authority in doing so, but personally I can not see why these schools should be held sacrosanct and above all criticism.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\n\nEnclosure:\n\nB/HM.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6461, file 837-23, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith the result of an inquiry into the death of Simon Francis Jefferies, late pupil of the Sechelt Residential School, who died following an operation in St. Paul's Hospital, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nThe boy's death was no doubt hastened as a result of eating green apples but his condition was serious before that, although he had not reported sick, and the School did all they could for the boy.

Although there were no deaths at the School for a long period, there have been five since the entire staff, from Principal to janitor, was changed two years ago. A Board of Inquiry shows that each pupil died a natural death and received attention in the School sick ward after he or she had reported sick.\n\nThe Board is unable to obtain sufficient data previous to the pupil reporting sick, to make any recommendations.\n\nSome time after the Inquiry in a previous case it was reported, and I believe can be substantiated, that the boy who died of tuberculosis was punished a month or so before he died by being forced to hop on one leg up and down the school yard in spite of his protests that he was in pain. In the present case, the father of the boy said he had been told that the boy was seen at the school window calling for him and was slapped for it the day before he died. This was denied by the school authorities and could not be corroborated.\n\nThe mental attitude of both pupils and parents towards the School is very unfavourable and complaints are continually being made. One of the parents whose son was the pupil who died of tuberculosis, handed me the enclosed letter written by another son at the School. I do not place much confidence in such letters, but I feel sure that a number of changes should be made at the School, but unless definitely instructed to do so, will not make any recommendations, as the \"investigation\" held by the Reverend Father Scannell and Mr. Assistant Commissioner Perry possibly did more harm than good as it was based on several erroneous premises.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[F.J.C.Ball]\nIndian Agent.\n\nB/DH.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6461, file 887-23, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, February 9, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, enclosing a memorandum into the cause and circumstances of the death of Moses Joe, No. 166, of the Sechelt Indian Residential School.\n\nWe have also noted the contents of your letter and consider that you are not satisfied with the management of the Sechelt Residential School.

Ball, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n416 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nREPORT FOR THE MONTH OF JANUARY 1937, ON VANCOUVER AGENCY.\n\nOn the 20th the death of a pupil took place at Sechelt Residential School, and the usual investigation was held. This school was operated for several years without a death, but there have been five since an entirely new staff was placed there two years ago. The former Sister Matron had had many years of nursing service among two generations of Sechelt Indians and knew their family medical histories. This was valuable information when pupils reported sick, and the medical officer has said that he trusted her diagnosis as much as his own. There are still many bitter complaints from the Indian parents, as to the treatment of the pupils at the school, and I am afraid it may end with some untoward incident. On my last visit to the reserve, the Indians stated they were going to hire \"the best lawyer in Vancouver\" to investigate the school, as soon as they earned enough money from logging and fishing.\n\nF.

A. R. Lett, with instructions to apply these funds to the current expenses of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF. R.

I have examined this report and am pleased to learn that the deficit has been practically wiped out. Mr. Ball stated that the Rev. A. R. Lett has been started on a complete new set of books and has an excellent chance of placing the institution on its feet financially.\n\nBoth Constable MacLeod and yourself deserve credit for the management and oversight of the work from the time Rev. L. Laronde, the late Principal, left up to the date on which Rev. A. R. Lett, the new Principal, assumed duties.\n\nI am pleased that Mr. Lett impressed you so favourably and I trust that he will meet with every success.\n\nRegarding your request that an advance be sent for wages due the staff for December, I beg to say that on the 3rd instant a cheque for $1350 was sent you in favour of the Principal, being the 4th quarterly payment from the New England Company, the proceeds of which should be applied to the payment of the wages of the staff. It is hoped that the Principal will be able to dispose of some of the produce which is on hand in order to provide him with funds to carry on the work.\n\nThe December quarter return showing the attendance, etc., should be prepared and forwarded as soon as possible and when this is received any balance of the grant due for the quarter will be sent.\n\nI would point out that a cheque for $3000 has already been sent as an advance on the current quarter and there will be a very small further amount due at the end of the present fiscal year as, until Parliament provides funds, no further advances can be made on account of the per capita earnings of the next fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nSup of Indian Education\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nI have before me letter No. 229080-1 of Dec 13/21 handed to me by Indian Agent Mr. Graham regarding the necessity of a kindergarten class at St. George's School Lytton. I might say that the matter was brought before Inspector Cairns & he perfectly agreed with the proposition & saw the necessity for such in the school.\n\nIn conjunction with Mr. Graham & Mr Carins I also since coming here can see that those children coming in at the age of five & six years who are unable to take part in the outside work of the farm, should undoubtedly have an extra room for themselves. At this early age receiving proper attention a proper foundation could be laid which would be of great advantage to them when in due time they will be required to do their work on the farm. These children are attending school from nine thirty AM un_6 til four thirty PM but have no special attention at any time which they so sorely need.\n\nI have already taken steps to standardize the school to comply with the B.C. standard of public schools. This of course means a necessary rearranging of the working programme as well. My ideal is to have the teacher carry out each school day curriculum which will allow the making of one curriculum in the beginning of the year & followed throughout. Again by reorganizing the working hours of the pupils they will cover in two days the one day curriculum. In this way the child will in time be ready for high school entrance & able himself or herself to carry on with their education without starting from the beginning.\n\nCompulsory education gives us the opportunity of holding the child until eighteen years of age & surely he should receive as far as possible a standard as well as liberal education.\n\nI might say that I have just received Inspector Cairns report & have already, if it is at all possible, begun to equip the school with properly qualified teachers.\n\nI trust that you will carefully consider the kindergarten proposition & will favor us with your permission & wherewithall with which to establish this very needed acquisition. With the present construction scheme on hand I would not find it an extra burden, doing it now would mean that it would all be finished at once.\n\nYours very obediently\n\nPrincipal.\nSir,\n\nHaving further reference to my letter of the 24th of November, and your reply No. 229080-1, dated December 13th, I have taken this matter up with Mr. Lett, the new principal at St. George's School, and I am now in receipt of a copy of his letter, written to you, and posted direct, on the subject.\n\nI have nothing further to add to what I wrote, but I do think that it would be to the advantage of the children to have a kindergarten class. I have noticed so often, since I have been in charge, that there are so many small children that do not know what to do with themselves whilst out of school.\n\nI understand, from Mr. Cairns, that the principal of the Coqualeetza Institute has lately started a kindergarten class with great success.\n\nTrusting that the Department will give this matter their most favorable consideration,\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nRussell T.

I would suggest that you make an effort to secure a properly qualified kindergarten teacher. Perhaps Mr. Inspector Cairns or the Church of England Bishop could be of assistance in this connection. It has been found more economical in other residential schools if church authorities are able to nominate a teacher who is imbued with the missionary spirit.

A. R. Lett of Navan, in the Province of Ontario, was appointed to the position from the 12th December, 1931, and Mr. Lett was assured that, in order to enable him to proceed to take up his duties at Lytton, his transportation expenses, would be paid by the Department.\n\nThese expenses amounted to nine hundred and thirty-two dollars and nineteen ($932.19) cents as shown by the vouchers herewith, and the undersigned would recommend that authority be given for the payment of the same from the Vote for Indian Education, number 268.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nHerewith is a Recommendation to Council for payment of the expenses incurred in the transport of Rev. A. R. Lett from Navan, Ontario, to take over the Principalship of St. George's Industrial School for Indian boys and girls at Lytton, British Columbia.\n\nMr. Lett was assured that upon taking this appointment his expenses would be defrayed by the Department. This case is similar to that of Dr. A. W. Powers of Baie des Cedres, Que., who was recently appointed Indian Agent and Medical Attendant of Betsiamites, Que. Dr. Powers was assured that upon taking office his transportation expenses would be paid, and on the matter coming before the Auditor General's Department, that Department held that under Order in Council of 8th September, 1871, with regard to travelling expenses, the payment covered the cost of actual removal expenses and as such required the authority of the Treasury Board. (The said O. C. of the 8th September, 1871, provides as follows:\n\n\"REMOVAL ALLOWANCES.\u2014 No removal allowances can be granted except on report of the Treasury Board. No removal allowance is to be granted if the salary is increased, except in special cases, and on a report from the head of the Department. A removal allowance is not to exceed the actual cost of account rendered.\")\n\nDept. Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa, February 8th, 1922.\nOttawa, February 25, 1922.\n\nDear Canon Gould:\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs is desirous of having the Mohawk and Lytton Industrial Schools come under the care of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada. I therefore make this formal request, believing it to be in the best interests of these two institutions.\n\nIn this connection, I wish to refer you to communication to you of the 31st of October, last, which sets forth in detail the agreement between the New England Company and the Department of Indian Affairs. It will be a source of much gratification to me if the Mohawk and Lytton Industrial Schools are placed by your Board in the same category as the Church of England Indian residential schools in Canada.\n\nIt is understood that the maintenance grants provided by the New England Company will be funded with the appropriation for school purposes, to be applied towards the per capita earnings of the institutions in question.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Canon S. Gould, M.D.,\nGeneral Secretary, Missionary Society,\nChurch of England in Canada,\n131 Confederation Life Bldg.,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6462, file 888-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI have your letters of March 2nd, and February 24th, numbers 229080-3 and 10, in connection with the financial standing of St. George's Industrial School.\n\nAs you are aware this institution was left so badly in debt by the late principal, that Constable MacLeod and myself did our best to try to get it out of debt during the short time that we were in charge, with the result that we had to get advances up to the end of the fiscal year. This has naturally left the new principal, Mr. Lett, up against a hard proposition, as he has a full school of over one hundred children and staff, which have to be fed, and which cannot be done on nothing, as well as pay wages.\n\nDuring the winter months there is absolutely no chance of earning money from the farm. We have several thousand dollars worth of hay on hand, if there was only some market for this.\n\nIn my letter of the 18th ult., I asked if it were not possible to have the number increased for which there is capita grant allowed, and your letter of the 24th ult., stated that we would only be paid for an average attendance of one hundred. Now this is very hard on a school like this, that is struggling for its existence at the present time, and especially when we can accommodate more pupils who are voluntarily coming in. It is the only Church of England school in the district and we certainly do not wish to have to turn children away when we can accommodate them at all. We can accommodate them by using up the residential portion for the staff, but the school is not equipped with any isolation ward, which is a very essential thing for an institution like this and it is a matter that will have to be provided for in the very near future.\n\nWe also find that with the large number to be fed it is impossible to bake sufficient bread in stove ovens and we are at present planning on building a bakeoven, which will put us to an expense.\n\nDuring the late principal's regime supplies and equipment were let run so very low that we are finding it now impossible to get along without spending considerably on this, all of which goes to use up what small amount of money we have available, with the result that the wages are not paid.\n\nWith the spring coming on we find that we will\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSupt. Indian Education,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nHG/MD\nRussell T. Ferrier\u20142.\n\nwill have considerable expense in fencing, etc., which has all got into a deplorable condition, besides the seeds, etc., that have to be purchased.\n\nI feel quite confident that the farm can be made to pay, and the school put on a sound financial footing within the next year, but at the present moment we are certainly up against it for ready money to pay wages, and finance the institution generally for the next few months.\n\nTrusting that the Department will give this matter their very earnest attention and hoping to get a favorable reply,\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nHG/MD\nOttawa, March 16, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 7th instant, referring to general matters at the Lytton Industrial School.\n\nI have noted that you are recommending that per capita grant be allowed for more than 100. The Department is pleased to learn that you feel that the farm can be placed on a sound financial basis, but that for the next few months it will be extremely difficult to finance.\n\nIn reply, I beg to state that to tide the school over the next few months we will be, as heretofore, generous in making advances against the per capita earnings. I hope to be able to forward an advance of say $2,000 at the end of the first week in April, and we will endeavour to keep the institution in a solvent condition from time to time. As I intimated in a communication of the 25th ultimo, it should be distinctly understood that the Department expects to return to a normal per capita grant for the Lytton Industrial School as soon as the institution is on a sound financial basis; but in the interim the Department will do everything within its power to make it possible for the new Principal to bring about a more ideal condition of affairs.\n\nReferring to increasing the pupilage, you will remember that the December Quarter grant was paid on a basis of $9.49. When the average goes over the hundred, the matter will receive further consideration. For the present, active recruiting should not be practised, but you are in order to accept voluntary applicants. The applications for such, together with certificates of health, should be forwarded by the Rev. Principal to you without delay and immediately on to the Department, so that we can keep a check on the enrolment.\n\nYou might point out to the Rev. Principal that they lost per capita earnings because of irregular attendance for the quarter ending December last. There were enrolled 104 and the average attendance was barely 90. For a residential school, the Department feels that the average attendance should be at least 95% of the enrolment, and even higher during the winter months.\n\nYour plans to build a bake-oven will be commented upon in another communication.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am taking this privilege personally to write you concerning conditions at St. George's School. I am aware of the fact that all correspondence should go through the hands of Indian Agent Mr. Graham, but hope you will pardon my intrusion, and with patience peruse my appeal.\n\nAs you stated to me in your office before I came out I found the situation by no means in an ideal shape, and naturally, with enthusiasm, began to reconstruct and rearrange.\n\nI made an application to you, through Mr. Graham, for an additional schoolroom, the kindergarten, which you granted, and which I have now opened and have in full working order, excepting for some additional kindergarten material for teaching, requisition for these to be sent in shortly.\n\nIn order to properly carry on this needed work in the school and meet the additional expense, we hoped the Department would allow us to overstep our limit in numbers, which is one hundred children. We are running over that number now, and it is most essential that the Department recognize this fact by continuing our per capita grant to allow over the limitation. As you know the school is in a very low financial condition, and the taking in of children is a source of finance to us, so to be deprived of the grant would prove very serious indeed at the present time.\n\nI may say that since I have taken over the work we have had a number of voluntary applications, which perhaps has a meaning in itself, the Indians evidently already realizing the fact that it is not a period of slavery their children are being sent to, but a period of training for future usefulness. These voluntary applications, we feel cannot be turned down, even though we had to do without our grant, yet I feel sure that the Department will deal favorably in this matter. We would like the limit to be one hundred and twenty, instead of one hundred as it stands at present.\n\nBecause of the installation of the kindergarten, I am boosting the fact that parents should send in their children at the age of five and six. The financial situation, of course, is a secondary thing in my opinion, for I feel that if we are going to do the best for these young lives in helping them to pave a way for their future as capable citizens in the Dominion, and to help them rise to that standard of civilization in which the modern world lives, we must make provision for the conditions outside, which we have no hand in curbing; that is, increase of population and naturally increase of numbers here. To do this we must have finances, which although I have placed as secondary, yet they must run hand in hand. They are\ninterdependent.\n\nAs our accommodations for this greater number, we are crowded. The residence is now filled up with staff. Mrs. Lett and myself are confined to one bedroom, livingroom and diningroom. This we have no hesitation in making the sacrifice as we feel we are here to give our lives' work for the good of the cause, and inconvenience and griefs and cheerfully endured. In the course of time the Institution will have to be enlarged either by turning the residence into staff quarters and building a residence, or by building a new dormitory. This latter, my feeling is at present, more inclined to, as provision could be made for better conveniences for the children from health and sanitary points of view.\n\nWe are now passing through an epidemic of \"Flu\". It is of a very slight nature, yet it carries with it everything calling for isolation and precaution. We find isolation requirements nil. I am sure that if you were to drop in on us at the present moment you would not hesitate, at first glance, in seeing the difficulties we are contending with, and the great necessity for isolation accommodations. This department of school work is not secondary by any means. It is most important for convenience and prevention of disease. This being one of the chief factors in dealing with the Indians outside, their health conditions calling for such isolation. Also to teach them this important fact should be our aim. Later you will hear from me in detail on this matter.\n\nI have already placed my finger on many leakages about the farm, and feel certain that with a proper irrigator and plenty of water, the farm will be a source of great revenue to the school. I have already begun credit and debit the farm in order to ascertain what the farm is really doing for us. I believe I can, in time, make the situation at St.-George's much brighter and of less expense to the Department by directing my energy upon the farm as a source of financial help, and in due course we will be able to help ourselves very substantially.\n\nIn closing I beg again to be allowed to take in, at least the voluntary applicants, and that the Department will supplement our per capita in extending the limit now placed.\n\nThis appeal is wholly from the standpoint of helping the people directly implicated and in working this out to help ourselves to carry out our aims.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, March 16, 1922.\n\nDear Mr. Lett:\n\nI have yours of the 6th instant, referring to conditions at the Lytton Industrial School. I have been aware of the difficult situation which you were called upon to face and am pleased to note the enthusiasm with which you have commenced your duties. I trust that the epidemic of grippe has now run its course and that the staff and pupils are in good health.\n\nIn reply to your request for an increased pupilage, after a review of the facts which you have presented I am of the opinion that you would do well to accept the voluntary applicants that present themselves for admission. Active recruiting, however, should not be practised and further action will have to be taken by the Department when we find the average attendance running over the hundred.\n\nMake every effort to secure the perfect attendance of those enrolled, and this will keep your per capita earnings high. With an enrolment of about 110, you should aim at an average attendance of 105, and I will instruct Mr. Ferrier to allow grant for a few supernumerary pupils for the time being.\n\nThe practice of the Department is to frown on applications for the admission of children under 7 years of age. However, in view of the provisions for kindergarten work that you have been able to make, it will be in order for you to accept those a year younger. This can be considered a special privilege at this time and will be revoked when you are at full strength.\n\nI have learned, with satisfaction, that in the near future you will derive substantial assistance from the proceeds of the farm. It is extremely desirable that the special per capita grant be discontinued and the regular $150 and $20 bonus be paid to the Lytton Industrial School. I see no reason why the finances of the institution should not be in good condition when you are assured of a fair crop this coming summer. I wish you every success in your work and assure you of my continued interest.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. A. R. Lett,\nPrincipal,\nLytton Industrial School,\nLytton, B. C.\nOttawa, March 29, 1932.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 17th ultimo, referring to the payment to the New England Company of $1495.00 by this Department for the stock at the Mohawk Institute.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that this Department will place to the credit of the Mohawk Institute the sum of $1495.00. I will intimate to the Principal that this amount will be deducted from the quarterly grants received in the past by the Mohawk Institute from the New England Company. Mrs. Boyce will expect no payment from England for the quarter ending June 30, 1932, and but a partial payment for the quarter ending September 30, 1932. $1495 is, at par value, roughly \u00a3306, and the Principal may expect from the New England Company a payment of \u00a3192 for the quarter ending September 30, 1932.\n\nReferring to the stock at the St. George's Industrial school, Lytton, B.C., I am of the opinion that the Department of Indian Affairs has purchased the major portion at present at the institution. Since 1914, this Department has expended over $6,000.00 in the purchase of 2 teams of horses, one stallion, 45 head of cattle, 2 bulls and 16 pigs for the St. George's School. Further, 13 head of cattle and 4 horses of the old stock were destroyed about a year ago, upon the advice of the Veterinary Director General. The horses were unfit for farm purposes and the cattle tubercular.\n\nAt the Mohawk Institute, the stock was the property of the New England Company, but you will understand from the above fact that the Department of Indian Affairs believes that we have some claim on the ownership of such animals as are on the Lytton farm. I will make inquiries concerning the exact amount of live stock this Department received from the New England Company, and you will be further advised.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nF. R.

A.R. Lett, to furnish me with an estimate of what it would cost to maintain that School for the year 1923, his estimate to be based on the actual cost of maintenance during the last two or three years. In reply he informs me that there are no figures of any kind available at the School on which to base his estimate, and as he himself has only been in charge a comparatively short time, he finds it quite impossible to give me the information I require. As this information is altogether necessary for our Society at this time I shall be obliged if you will come to my assistance by furnishing me with an average total cost of maintaining the School for the past two years, distributed under the following headings:\n\n- Salaries of Agents.\n- Food Supplies.\n- Clothing\n- House Furnishings and Equipment.\n- Fuel, Light and Water.\n- Repairs.\n- Farm and Garden.\n- Miscellaneous.\n- Dairy.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary M.S.O.C.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6462, file 888-1, part 2)\n**STATEMENT OF THE EXPENDITURE AT THE LYTTON INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 1919.**\n\n| Item                          | Amount   |\n|-------------------------------|----------|\n| Salaries                      | $4743.22 |\n| Wages to farm help etc.       | 4789.29  |\n| Food                          | 4084.04  |\n| Clothing                      | 2604.18  |\n| Water, Light and Fuel         | 1929.11  |\n| Repairs                       | 446.55   |\n| House Sundries                | 4079.76  |\n| Implements                    | 2499.57  |\n| Seeds                         | 204.30   |\n| Feed for Stock                | 1114.93  |\n| Irrigation                    | 1363.35  |\n| Travelling, Freight, etc.     | 1833.29  |\n| Live Stock                    | 388.57   |\n| Medical                       | 4.50     |\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6462, file 888-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n## Statement of Expenditure at the Lytton Industrial School\n\nFor the Half Year April 1, 1919 to Sept. 30, 1919.\n\n| Item                          | Amount   |\n|-------------------------------|----------|\n| Salaries                      | $2016.60 |\n| Extra Labour                  | 711.60   |\n| Food                          | 1213.36  |\n| Clothing                      | 288.48   |\n| Fuel and Light                | 487.84   |\n| Building and Repairs          | 702.60   |\n| Equipment and Furniture       | 646.68   |\n| Farm and Garden               | 5753.25  |\n| Freight, Transportation and Travelling | 618.25 |\n| **Total**                     | **$12638.66** |\n**STATEMENT OF EXPENDITURE AT THE LYITON INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL FROM OCTOBER 1, 1919 TO MARCH 31, 1920.**\n\n| Item                                      | Amount   |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Salaries                                  | $5375.60 |\n| Food                                      | 2473.55  |\n| Clothing                                  | 683.66   |\n| Water, Light and Fuel                     | 988.01   |\n| Repairs, Tools and Implements             | 1193.79  |\n| House Equipment                           | 676.25   |\n| Freight, Travelling etc.                  | 946.28   |\n| Irrigation Ditch                          | 1101.55  |\n| Live Stock                                | 238.55   |\n| Miscellaneous                             | 55.22    |\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6462, file 888-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n## Statement of Expenditure at the Lytton Industrial School\n### From April 1, 1920 to September 30, 1921\n\n| Item                                      | Amount   |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Salaries                                  | $2506.05 |\n| Farm Wages                                | $4774.45 |\n| Food                                      | $1273.25 |\n| Clothing                                  | $290.05  |\n| Fuel, Light, Laundry Supplies              | $507.76  |\n| Building and Repairs                      | $114.99  |\n| Equipment                                 | $290.09  |\n| Farm and Garden                           | $885.62  |\n| Irrigation Ditch                          | $465.25  |\n| Transportation                            | $490.33  |\n| Miscellaneous                             | $1230.32 |\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6462, file 888-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n## Statement of the Expenditure at the Lytton Industrial School from December 15, 1921 to March 31, 1922.\n\n| Item            | Amount   |\n|-----------------|----------|\n| Salaries        | $1589.00 |\n| Farm Wages      | 505.00   |\n| Food            | 218.35   |\n| Clothing        | 39.73    |\n| Fuel and Light  | 300.00   |\n| Freight         | 251.37   |\n| Repairs         | 145.41   |\n| Miscellaneous   | 204.21   |\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6462, file 838-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nOttawa, July 5, 1922.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant, requesting to be furnished with the cost of maintaining the Lytton Industrial School during the past two years, distributed under the headings mentioned by you.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that during the principalship of the Rev. Louis Laronde, no statements of expenditure were furnished. We understand that he sent these statements regularly to the New England Company. The Inspector of Indian Schools, who visited this school semi-annually, in his reports of inspection furnished the Department with a statement showing the expenditure. I am enclosing copies of same, from his report, beginning with the year ended March 31, 1919. These are complete to September 30, 1920; between that period and up to December 1921 we received no statement showing expenditures at this school, as Mr. Laronde kept no accounts the last year he was principal.\n\nThe present Principal, Rev. Mr. Lett, has been instructed to keep a proper set of books showing all receipts and expenditure. We have not received any statement since he took over the principalship of this school, and regret that we are unable to furnish any further information than that shown by the enclosed statements. It is hoped that these may be of some assistance to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, Miss.

McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRevd Principal,\nLytton Industrial Indian School,\nLytton, B.C.\nOttawa, September 22nd, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Saunders,\n\nUnder date of the 8th February last I made a report recommending the payment of the removal expenses of Rev. A. R. Lett from Navan, Ont., to Lytton, B.C., amounting to $932.19. The Treasury Board replied stating that they were unable to submit the matter for favourable consideration as it is not the practice to pay transportation expenses in the case of a first appointment. On account of the unusual circumstances in this instance I would ask the Treasury Board to reconsider the matter.\n\nThe Government recently took over from the New England Company the schools which they had conducted for many years at Brantford and Lytton. The Company's funds would no longer bear the expenditure of keeping up these institutions, both of which, however, were doing splendid work and fill an important place in our scheme of Indian education. It was then decided that the Government should become responsible for the maintenance of these two schools.\n\nIn the case of the Lytton Institute the management during the time of the last incumbent appointed by the Company had been most unfortunate, and the school was decidedly unpopular with the Indians.\n\nJ. C. Saunders, Esq.,\nSecretary of the Treasury Board,\nOttawa.\nIt was necessary to take radical steps to restore the institution to its former standard.\n\nThe Department appealed to the Missionary Society of the Church of England to nominate a principal who should be a capable administrator. After extended negotiations the name of Rev. Mr. Lett, of Napan, was submitted to the Department, and he appeared to have the necessary qualifications. The salary, however, was none too attractive and the cost of moving his family such a distance prohibitive. He, therefore, made it a condition of his appointment that his removal expenses to British Columbia should be paid. Under the circumstances the Department agreed and I am, therefore, of the opinion that these expenses are a legitimate charge against the fund provided by Parliament for the education of Indian children.\n\nIn view of this explanation I trust that the Treasury Board will see fit to pass favourably upon my memorandum.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nSuperintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\nSeptember 25, 1922.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHonourable Charles Stewart,\n\nWould you have the kindness to sign this letter to the Secretary of the Treasury Board. The Board has refused to pay the transportation expenses for the reasons stated. It was a very exceptional case, as we had after great difficulty found a man for the position who is proving to be a successful administrator, and I think the Board ought not to demur paying his expenses. He went out over the Canadian National. If the Board does not pay it, we will have to get the authority of Parliament.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDUPLICATE, FOR DEPARTMENT.\n\nBank of Montreal,\n\n$1325.00\n\nOttawa, Sept. 25, 1928\n\nRECEIVED from New England Co.\n\non account Duncan Scott, Dept.

Lett,\nPrincipal,\nLytton Indian Industrial School,\nLytton, B.C.\nAt the time of my visit this summer, I noticed that barns will soon be needed and, eventually, a building programme (less chapel) will have to be considered. A site near the centre of the farm should be considered. The school owns 100 acres of land in the hills 7 miles away.\n\nIn the near future, the Principal should be given an opportunity to build, by day labour, a dormitory building and other out-houses such as residences for staff. The Department would be put to little expense, as they have facilities for their own lumber. More pupils - and there are many voluntary ones - could then be taken. The present needs are as follows: an electric light plant, a start on a good dairy herd, a bake oven, dormitory flooring, threshing outfit, lavatories for boys' dormitories, and perhaps two more bath tubs.\n\nWater - not land - is the great care here for successful farming. A reservoir is needed for domestic purposes and for the lawns, also for hydrants which should be installed for fire protection. Later on, if the Botanic dam was raised, the 100 acres in the hills could be irrigated. Inspector Ditchburn promised to send an engineer, at no expense to the Department, to look over the Botanic dam project. The Inspector was a little doubtful about the advisability of preparing more land for cultivation, because he felt Mr. Lett, the Principal, might work the boys too hard.\n\nI should write to Mr. Lett, instructing him to get in touch with the Rev. Father Murphy, Principal of the Kuper Island Industrial School, to arrange for a game of basketball in Vancouver. Mr. Lett's connections in Vancouver could arrange for the sale of tickets to cover expenses.\nNovember 16, 1922.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have also to inform you that the M.S.C.C. have not as yet assumed any responsibility with reference to the St. George's School at Lytton, B.C., and they have no intention of doing so at the present.\n\nDuncan C.

A. Lett, principal of St. George's Indian Industrial School, here, in connection with the general welfare of this school.\n\nAs you no doubt are aware, this school had progressed under Mr. Lett, until we have now worked it up to its fullest capacity, as far as pupils are concerned, in fact we have a waiting list of a great number of children, if we only had more room.\n\nWe have already filed what we consider is necessary for the coming year for the improvements on this school, which if granted will give us more accommodation.\n\nAs you know the school had been allowed to run down to such an extent that Mr. Lett started in with a very large deficit, which he has been gradually working off, but it is very disheartening having this hanging over one's head, especially when it has been taken over by the Department. I am taking this opportunity of applying to see whether or not it would be possible for the Department to wipe this debt off, so that the school could start the new year with a clean slate, and I feel sure we can keep it that way, as well as improve generally.\n\nThe farm is paying for itself when we take into consideration what the school gets out of it, but owing to the fact of the low market on everything this year we have not been able to sell anything that we could make a profit out of. We have lost it and say that we could have sold but as the market is now it meant holding these over for another year which means that all profits have been eaten up.\n\nThe ranch had been let run so low that we have a great deal of fencing to do to get it into anything like good shape. Then again all the school clothing, bedding, etc., had got so low that it means putting all these in new gradually.\n\nIf you can possibly see your way clear to granting this request, I feel sure that we can show you some returns in the very near future.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6462, file 888-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, Jan. 11, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Mathews:\n\nI have to inform you that the Lytton Industrial school under the principalship of the Rev. A. R. Lett, concerning whom I have already written, has been administered for the past year by this Department. It was found advisable to keep a direct oversight from this office, and the services of Department representatives in the field have been utilized in this connection.\n\nWe have lately increased the pupilage to allow a greater per capita earning power which will result in regular grants of approximately $15,400 for the fiscal year ending March 31st. In addition, the quarterly payments from the New England Company have been forwarded to the school, to be applied towards current expenses. The deficit incurred during the principalship of the Rev. Mr. Leronde has not yet been completely wiped out, and I am seriously considering making a special grant at this time, to enable the Rev. Principal to start the new fiscal year without this extra burden.\n\nIt has been rather difficult to finance the institution this year. The surplus stock and hay have not been sold as yet, because they would have been marketed at a loss. Next year, I trust that they will prove a source of revenue.\n\nThe money forwarded by the New England Company, from the Guarantee Society Limited, has been given to the Rev. Principal for the purpose of erecting a dairyman's cottage, a small outdoor infirmary and for some fencing that was necessary.\n\nThe Department has made, in addition to the payments mentioned above, certain grants for needed equipment and alterations: a threshing outfit, complete with tractor ($2500), 4 milk cows ($500), bake oven ($800), plumbing fixtures ($1100), flooring ($600), a kitchen range ($200), 36 tons of coal ($900), and smaller items aggregating roughly $500.\n\nIt is my intention to ask Parliament to appropriate, in the near future, $2,000 for an electric lighting plant, $8,000 for a temporary outside dormitory building, which will permit of larger pupilage, and $1,000 for the raising of the Bottanie dam - which action will ensure a more adequate water supply.\n\nErnest Mathews, Esq.,\nGovernor, New England Co.,\n26 Bloomsbury Sq.,\nLondon, W. C.,\nEngland.\nDepartment officers have been instructed to give special attention to this school and to the Mohawk Institute, the only Indian residential schools in Canada that are not directly supervised by a Church Missionary Society or Order.\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Lett and our Indian Agent, in their latest reports, are most enthusiastic over the opportunity of developing the work. Recruiting is no longer necessary, as voluntary pupils have filled the institution to the limit of its accommodation. The Rev. Mr. Lett is a strong disciplinarian and a splendid boys' worker, and I look for a career of much usefulness in the case of the Lytton Industrial School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, Jan. 11, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Lett:\n\nThe Governor of the New England Company has requested that I ask you to send a quarterly report to him, concerning general conditions at the Lytton Industrial School. I am preparing a comprehensive writing at this time, concerning the school, so it will be quite in order if your first report is directed about the first of April. The address is 26 Bloomsbury Square, London, W.C.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Superintendent-General.\n\nRev. A. R. Lett,\nPrincipal,\nLytton Industrial School,\nLytton, B.C.\nOttawa, Jan. 11, 1923.\n\nMemorandum.\n\nMr. Scott:\n\nAt the time the Rev. Mr. Laronde left the Lytton Industrial School, there were outstanding accounts amounting roughly to $7730. Under the supervision of Mr. Indian Agent Graham and Mr. McLeod, this deficit was reduced to approximately $2500. During this time, practically no equipment was renewed, and the institution was somewhat run down when the Rev. Mr. Lett took over the principalship.\n\nWe are paying a per capita grant of $175 instead of the regular grant of $150, and, in addition, are forwarding the quarterly grants from the New England Company to assist with the current expenses.\n\nAt the beginning of this fiscal year advances totalling $7000 were made against the per capita earnings. It was the intention to deduct $3500 from the grants at the end of the September and December quarters. The Rev. Mr. Lett and Mr. Indian Agent Graham were unable to sell to advantage the surplus stock and hay, and we were forced to make an advance of $2000 in October, last. Such an advance to be deducted from the quarter ending March 31, 1923. The Rev. Principal has, on several occasions, requested that this Department wipe out the deficit at the school, and he has again made a strong plea, through Mr. Agent Graham, that the Department place him in the position of starting the new fiscal year with a clean sheet. I am not hopeful that the institution will remain in a solvent condition if we deduct $3500 from the per capita earnings for the past quarter and $2000 from the earnings of the present quarter.\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Lett has been requested to prepare a financial statement, and, upon receipt of this, we can estimate more definitely the exact deficit at the present time. I am of the opinion that he is about 6 weeks behind with his accounts, or roughly $3,000.\n\nIf this estimate is approximately correct, I would strongly recommend that the Minister's authority be secured and a special grant made to the St. George's Industrial School. I believe funds can be found from the Appropriation for Indian Education. I will write a hopeful letter, for your signature, to the Rev. Mr. Lett, if you concur in this connection.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, Jan. 13, 1923.\n\nMemorandum.\n\nMr. Scott:\n\nWith further reference to the subject matter of the memorandum hereunder, I have to state that the lease of the Lytton Industrial School property requires this Department to pay yearly, on the 2nd day of January, to the New England Company the sum of \u00a3400. The first payment is now due. The terms of the lease require the New England Company to return to this Department the amounts actually received in respect of the annual rental of \u00a3400 - such amounts to be spent by us in addition, repairs and replacement to the school.\n\nI would recommend that we request the New England Company's permission to make this annual payment of rental direct to the Rev. Principal at Lytton, to be used for replacement and general current expenses.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, Jan. 16, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Mathews:\n\nI have to refer to the clause in the lease of the Lytton Industrial School, which stipulates that this Department pay to the New England Company the sum of \u00a3400 as annual rental. The lease reads, further, \"that the Company will return to the party of the second part the amounts actually received in respect of the annual rental of \u00a3400, as and when paid; the amounts to be spent by the party of the second part in addition, repairs and replacement to the school\".\n\nThe annual payment of rental is now due, and I would be pleased if you would intimate the nature of the return that would be satisfactory to the New England Company. It has occurred to me that we might prepare copies of accounts having reference to expenditures for plant at Lytton. These could be properly certified or supported by affidavit.\n\nI am pleased to inform you that since my communication of the 11th instant, with reference to general matters at the Lytton Industrial School, I have been able to arrange for special assistance to the amount of nearly $2,000 to relieve the Rev. Mr. Lett of the greater part of his financial burden.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nErnest Mathews, Esq.,\nGovernor, New England Co.,\n26 Bloomsbury Sq.,\nLondon, W.C.,\nEngland.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6462, file 888-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, Jan. 15, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your No. 1-06 of the 18th ultimo, with general reference to the financial condition of the Lytton Industrial School. Careful consideration has been given to the request of the Rev. Principal and yourself that the school finances be brought up to date by a special grant. I am pleased to refer to official letter 229080-8 of the 12th ultimo, and I have to instruct you and the Rev. Principal that this $1721.60 may be applied to the general expenses of the Lytton Industrial School. I trust that, with this assistance, the financial burden will be largely removed.\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Lett has been authorized to build a dairyman's cottage, an outside infirmary and to do a certain amount of necessary fencing. This Department will meet, from parliamentary appropriation, the expenses in this connection. Competitive prices must be secured for any materials purchased, and the accounts should be presented to this Department for payment. Vouchers must be properly certified by yourself and should be supported by a list showing the firms asked to quote and the prices quoted. If any outside labour is employed, proper time sheets must be kept and submitted to the Department with the regular voucher forms. The expenditure for the cottage, the infirmary and the fencing must not exceed $1750.00.\n\nA proper accounting for all receipts and expenditures must be made quarterly by the Rev. Mr. Lett. The Department would also be pleased to receive, as soon as possible, the financial statement requested in our official 229080-8 of the 26th ultimo.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of this communication for the information and attention of the Rev. Principal.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B. C.\nOTTAWA, January 3rd, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\n(with cheque - #2984)\n\nThe Department has received from the Bank of Montreal here the sum of $1350, the proceeds of a draft deposited by the New England Company, being the 4th quarterly payment due in respect of St. George's school, Lytton. A cheque for this amount is enclosed herewith, drawn in favour of the Principal, Rev. A. R. Lett.\n\nYou will be good enough to hand this cheque to Mr. Lett, the proceeds of which should be applied to the current expenses of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI herewith beg to enclose a letter and a statement from the Rev. A.R.

Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nHG/MD\nMr. Scott:\n\nThe National Railways are again asking for payment of their account amounting to $932.19 for transportation furnished Rev. Mr. Lett.\n\nPossibly if the Treasury Board realized that payment is due the Canadian National Railways, it would be authorized, as there is no doubt about the Railways needing the money, and it will have to be paid in some way.\n\nAccountant.\n\nOttawa, 16th February, 1923.\nOttawa, Feb. 20, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Saunders:\n\nI wish to refer to your Mr. Foster's letter, No 102454-B, of September 30th, last, and this Department's answering communication of October 2nd, with reference to the removal expenses of the Rev. A. R. Lett from Navan, Ont. to Lytton, B. C., amounting to $932.19. An Order in Council in this connection has not as yet been passed, and as the railway company is pressing for payment, I am drawing the matter to your attention again.\n\nIt is possible that, if the Treasury Board realized that the money is due to the Canadian National Railways, who supplied the transportation upon a warrant issued by this Department, the necessary authority for payment would be given.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nJ. C. Saunders, Esq.,\nDeputy Minister,\nFinance Department,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, Feb. 23, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 1-06 of the 7th instant, enclosing a financial statement of the Lytton Industrial School for the month ended January 31st, and requesting an advance on account per capita earnings for the quarter ending March 31st, next.\n\nIt was hoped that the special grant of $1721.60, made to the school by the Deputy Superintendent General's letter of the 15th ultimo, would largely remove the financial burden. I note, in the financial report for January, that no item is included with respect to this special grant. However, I am instructing that an advance of $1500 on the March quarter be made, and a cheque is being directed, under separate cover. I wish to draw your attention to an earlier advance of $2000 that will be deducted from the earnings of this present quarter. The probable payment at the end of March will be in the neighborhood of $1500, i.e., the earnings of, roughly, $5000, less the two advances of $2000 and $1500.\n\nNo answer has been received to the Deputy Superintendent General's communication of the 15th ultimo, and, as the Department was hopeful that a special grant would place the Lytton Industrial School on a firm financial basis, your answering communication and a frank statement from the Rev. Principal are awaited, with interest.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nSir,\u2014 \n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of departmental letter number 229080-1 dated February 23rd, in which you acknowledge receipt of my letter number 1-06 of the 7th ultimo, with the financial statement of Lytton Industrial School, the contents of this letter having been duly noted, and I am taking the same up with the principal.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General's letter of the 15th of January was answered when I forwarded the financial statement, the balance of the letter cannot be attended to until the material, etc., is purchased, and vouchers submitted as instructed. This will be attended to in due course.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H. Graham)\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssist.

Mr. Lott on February 7th,\n\nI have the honor to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n(H. Graham)\nIndian Agent.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nH.G.MD\nOttawa, March 9, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 1-06 of the 3rd instant, enclosing a communication from the Rev. Mr. Lett - both referring to the need of a cream separator at the Lytton Industrial School. I have noted that the old one is beyond repair; and I am pleased to state that, in view of the urgent request, the Department will make arrangements for the purchase and shipment of a cream separator to Lytton.\n\nI wish to refer to your remark that it is quite impossible for the school to make this purchase themselves, without going further into debt. The Department was of the opinion that the special grant, made under cover of the Deputy Superintendent General's communication of January 15th, would have placed the school in a sound financial condition. The financial report for the month ended January 31st, last, showed outstanding accounts amounting to $906.91. The special grant was quite sufficient to pay the outstanding accounts and to add materially to the bank balance as on February first. Please instruct the Rev. Principal to prepare, as usual, the quarterly financial report, and forward copies to the New England Company and to the Department. The copy for the Department should be properly certified by you and should be accompanied by a statement from the Rev. Principal, indicating the probabilities of a successful financing in the future. It is our intention to place the Lytton Industrial school on a regular per capita grant, as soon as possible, and to retain the New England Company's quarterly payments at Ottawa, for replacements to equipment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The Board are of opinion that such an unusual charge would likely be open to serious criticism; in fact, under date of February 22nd, 1922, the late Auditor General specially called the attention of the Board to this charge.\n\nThe case will be held by the Treasury Board pending the receipt of your reply.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary.\nMarch 31, 1923.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of March 29, I have pleasure in stating that Mr. Lett was engaged as Principal of the Lytton Industrial school on August 9, 1921, and payment of his transportation was authorized by the Honourable the Superintendent General and I informed Mr. Lett of this authorization myself. This was a special case, and I had discussed it with the Minister, with the result that it was decided to pay Mr. Lett's transportation. The circumstances are fully explained in the Hon. Charles Stewart's letter to you of September 22, and you will observe that Mr. Stewart supports the payment.\n\nWith reference to the charge for the freight on an automobile, if the Board finds the charge improper, I will not ask that it be included in the amount to be paid.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

Report for quarter ended March 31st. from the Rev. A.R. Lett, Principal of St. George's School, Lytton, dated 10th. April.\n\nLytton, B.C.\n\nApril 10th., 1923.\n\nNew England Company.\n\nSirs,\n\nBy request I take pleasure in reporting the welfare of this school. I hope you will pardon some detail. I have now been somewhat over one year in the position of Principal and feel I have grasped an intimate knowledge of the situation both as regards the past and the present conditions (the former only as I found them when taking over) of the school separate from the community or those upon whom we draw for pupils and also knowledge of the community.\n\nA. The Children.\n\nThe Children were when I first arrived generally unhappy with a feeling of slavery existing in their minds, no aims, no feeling other than \"I have a certain period of my life which perforce I must put in at St. George's school and the easiest way possible out of it is my thought\". I saw at a glance that this feeling righteously existed as the children were ill fed and ill clothed and turned out into the cold to work and that without leadership.\n\nStealing was chronic and from all, this was done without hesitancy. One would think they felt they had a right to everything belonging to the school and if it is not given me I shall get it anyway. This feeling I have no hesitancy in saying was inculcated by example, and conditions existing prior to my coming.\n\nMorale of the children are low at any time and were exceedingly so at my beginning. Mrs. Lett, who is House Supervisor, and myself were in constant dread lest we should find the worst among the girls, yet thus far we have gone along and still have the bright side to look at.\n\nThe first of these I combated by using a firm loving hand, gaining the confidence of the individual child. They at once realized that they were going to receive a square deal and I began to see smiles here and there. After I had been going for some three months I had occasion to be away on business at the coast for three or four days, and on my return one of the smaller girls wandered into the office and said \"My Mr. Lett, we are glad you are back for we were all lonesome for you\", this naturally did me as much good as if some good Samaritan had endowed the place.\n\nThe Children were lean, anaemic and T.B. Glands were running in many cases. Energy was at its lowest ebb. Five\nminutes leap-frog was the most I could get out of the boys at first. In examining the Hill of Fare I found that here lay the source of a great deal of trouble in the health and welfare of the children. They were not getting enough to eat and I immediately increased the fare and served it as much as possible. This had its desired effect and hearts gladdened, thieving stopped to a large degree, clean skin and rosy cheeks appeared and more energy in work and play resulted. Enough to eat without wasting and warm clothing was my slogan and it worked miracles.\n\nIn the schoolroom I found a great lack of necessary training. Mathematics, reading and writing were the only subjects taught. This was insufficient and I immediately set out to establish the B.C. curriculum for the High School. This took time and thought and selection of staff. This curriculum is now established and working smoothly with certified teachers installed. The head master has begun Cadet training for the boys the girls receiving the physical drill with them.\n\nThe half day system is in use in the school. Children are divided into A. and B. divisions. When I first took over the smaller children of each division, who were not able to receive industrial instruction, were allowed to run loose while the larger pupils fulfilled their obligations. This has been changed. Those not able to work go to the schoolroom all day and when old enough their work will take their place in the several industrial departments. At present there are forty receiving trade instruction out of one hundred and fifty enrolled. The remainder I feel are too young to work and special attention is being given them in the school-room, by so doing they should get a fair foundation and perhaps be able to prepare for High School entrance. The Indian Dept. at Okaaw are shortly beginning to build a High School for Indian Children and it is my aim to at least prepare for entrance to this school some of these children. I feel this can be accomplished with the present system arranged. The standard of entrance to the High School is qualification certificate per B.C. Public School curriculum.\n\nB. Conditions existing in building and Depts. of same when taking over and at present.\n\nDormitories in bad repair, no cleaning had been done for years evidently floors worn out in places. Ventilation poor; beds in poor condition; these have all been rectified. In the boys dept., there was only one bath tub and one toilet to accommodate fifty boys. The Dept. has now installed an extra tub and two more toilets so that has overcome an unsanitary difficulty.\n\nThe girls dept. needed an extra tub and washbowls, these have also been installed.\n\nKitchen cooking apparatus was in very poor condition in fact I had to agitate for a new Range which has been installed and is giving good satisfaction. The Dept. has also furnished a Bake Oven which is an endless boon to the kitchen as the children themselves go through an average of one thousand loaves per month. The boys do the baking under supervision of the Farm Manager who learned the trade when he first started out in life.\n\nThe corridors and kitchen floors have been covered with linoleum supplied by the Dept.\n\nNew lockers have been installed. The Children were obliged to use their suitcases for their belongings. These were kept under their beds and are now stored away.\n\nC. Conditions existing outside the school.\n\nThe Parents had to be forced to place their children in the school. There were in the school when I began eighty children.\nThis number has increased to one hundred and five which over-\nspacitates our dormitory space. I have on file about fifty\nvoluntary applications which shows that I have already gained\nthe confidence of the parents. In some cases parents have\ntravelled miles to place their children in the school only to\nbe turned away because there is no room for them. When I\nthink of the possibilities of these children I feel that the\nabove state should not exist and certainly so when H.C.\nInstitutions are waiting to be hold of every little soul and\nwe may lose them all eventually. I feel sure that we could increase\nour numbers to one hundred and seventy-five in less than one\nmonth's time if we only were able to accommodate men and this\naccommodation should be given us without delay. Only a very\nshort time ago I had to turn away six children, one of them\na boy of fourteen.\n\nD. The Farm.\n\nHaving had some experience in farming in Ontario and know-\ning something of the occupation I naturally have taken a keen\ninterest in this Dept. As in the schools I found the farm in a\nsad state of equipment, repair and fertility. This will take\nyears to overcome especially recuperation of fertility. In some\ncases fourteen crops have been taken off without rotation.\n\nThere is only one barn on the place of any size or capacity\nand this has been condemned by the Vet. Dept. as full of T.B.\ngerms which owing to it being built of logs with plank floors,\nno amount of cleaning and disinfecting would stop infection.\nDuring the past three years some eighteen head of cattle have\nbeen condemned and destroyed. Only last autumn we lost four\nthrough test, two of them being two\u0433\u043e\u0434ling an average of\nsixty pounds per day each. They were also the beginning of a\ndairy herd. I believe the Dept. are going to build a new barn\nthis summer.\n\nHogs are inbred and naturally scours. I have taken steps to\novercome this by breeding with pure bred stock.\n\nMachinery old and in bad repair. The Dept. has given us\na new Mowing Machine, also a 10-20 Tractor and Thresher. The\nEngine is very handy as we have power to be used for threshing,\nhaying, sawing, ensilage cutting, etc.\n\nE. Orchard.\n\nThe old orchard has been so neglected that it will take at\nleast another year to bring it back into shape. A new orchard\nof about three acres was planted but hogs and cattle were allowed\nto run at large in it and consequently about 70% of the trees\nwere destroyed. This spring the Dept. has given us two hundred\ntrees which have just been planted.\n\nThe farm and climate are very adaptable for alfalfa hay. We\nhope to increase our acreage in this line of fodder as three crops\ncan be cut in one season.\n\nThere are as you are aware 700 acres in the property. Of\nthis about 175 acres is being cultivated and only about one\nthird of this acreage is in shape from a fertile standpoint.\n\nF. Financial condition.\n\nBy dint of close economy the debt of \u00a37000 has been reduced\nto \u00a33000 during the past year. This debt has been considerably\nencumbered. Because of it I have not been able to go along\nas rapidly as I would like to. \u00a34000 would have enabled me to\nget more land in shape and make other necessary improvements.\nForced economy after all is the most uneconomic and is in every\ndisheartening to one who is at all aggressive and wishes to make\na success of the business. I have been living as it were from\nhand to mouth or from month to month hardly knowing where I was\ngoing to get money to pay salaries and meet accounts. The Dept.\nmeeting our requirements with advance grants which is not\nthe most satisfactory yet it gives us a firm standing and\nenables us to go along.\n\nWhile this report may seem tinged with pessimism throughout\nyet there are great possibilities for the school if we can get at\nthem. This will take time. Patience, perseverance and prayer\nsolve great difficulties and I can see a bright future for us.\nThere is always a business side to any occupation one may take\nup which must not be neglected.

A. R. Lett from Navan, Ontario, to take over the Principalship of St. George's Industrial School for Indian boys and girls at Lytton, British Columbia.\n\nMr. Lett was assured that upon taking this appointment his expenses would be defrayed by the Department. This case is similar to that of Dr. A. W. Powers of Baie des Cedres, Que., who was recently appointed Indian Agent and Medical attendant of Betsiamites, Que. Dr. Powers was assured that upon taking office his transportation expenses would be paid, and on the matter coming before the Auditor General's Department, that Department held that under Order in Council of 8th September, 1871, with regard to travelling expenses, the payment covered the cost of actual removal expenses and as such required the authority of the Treasury Board. (The said O. C. of the 8th September, 1871, provides as follows:\n\n\"REMOVAL ALLOWANCES.\u2014 No removal allowances can be granted except on report of the Treasury Board. No removal allowance is to be granted if the salary is increased, except in special cases, and on a report from the head of the Department. A removal allowance is not to exceed the actual cost of account rendered.\")\n\nDept. Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa, February 8th, 1922.\nIn submitting the case of Mr. Lett for consideration of the Audit Office attention was called to the following:\n\n(1) That the case of Mr. Lett does not come under the provisions of the Order in Council of the 8th September, 1871 re removal expenses as he was not in the service prior to his appointment as Principal of the Industrial School and although there are a few precedents, yet it is not the custom to pay removal expenses of new appointees.\n\n(2) As to payment of freight on an automobile being allowed as \"removal expenses.\"\n\nThe Auditor General in his letter of the 22nd February, 1922, returning the case to the Board agrees with No. 1 above, stating as follows:- It is not the practice to pay transportation expenses in the case of first appointments, but I presume it is within the competence of the Governor in Council to do so.\n\nIn regard to No. 2 above, the Auditor General states \"The claim for freight on an automobile is an unusual charge in transportation expenses.\"\n\nN.B.

A. R. Lett, from Napan, Ont., to Lytton, B.C., amounting to $932.19, was before the Board at a recent meeting.\n\nAs the Board are unable to submit the matter for the favourable consideration of Council I am returning the case to you, enclosed herewith.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSecretary of the Treasury Board.\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst.

A. P. Lett from Navan, Ontario to Lytton, B. C. amounting to $932.19, which was returned to your Department by direction of the Board the 11th July last.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nS.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, October 2nd, 1922.\n\nDear Mr. Foster,\n\nIn accordance with the request contained in your note of today's date, I am returning, herewith, the Report to Council of 8th February last recommending payment of the removal expenses of Reverend A. R. Lett from Navan to Litton, amounting to $932.19, which report had been returned to this Department by direction of the Board on the 11th July last.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. B. Foster, Esq.,\nTreasury Board,\nFinance Department,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 22nd. 1922.\n\nDear Mr. Saunders,\n\nUnder date of the 8th. February last I made a report recommending the payment of the removal expenses of Rev. A. R. Lett from Navan, Ont., to Lytton, B.C., amounting to $932.19. The Treasury Board replied stating that they were unable to submit the matter for favourable consideration as it is not the practice to pay transportation expenses in the case of a first appointment. On account of the unusual circumstances in this instance I would ask the Treasury Board to reconsider the matter.\n\nThe Government recently took over from the New England Company the schools which they had conducted for many years at Brantford and Lytton. The Company's funds would no longer bear the expenditure of keeping up these institutions, both of which, however, were doing splendid work and fill an important place in our scheme of Indian education. It was then decided that the Government should become responsible for the maintenance of these two schools.\n\nIn the case of the Lytton Institute the management during the time of the last incumbent appointed by the Company had been most unfortunate, and the school was decidedly unpopular with the Indians.\n\nJ. C. Saunders, Esq.,\nSecretary of the Treasury Board,\nOttawa.\nIt was necessary to take radical steps to restore the institution to its former standard.\n\nThe Department appealed to the Missionary Society of the Church of England to nominate a principal who should be a capable administrator. After extended negotiations the name of Rev. Mr. Lett, of Navan, was submitted to the Department, and he appeared to have the necessary qualifications. The salary, however, was none too attractive and the cost of moving his family such a distance prohibitive. He, therefore, made it a condition of his appointment that his removal expenses to British Columbia should be paid. Under the circumstances the Department agreed and I am, therefore, of the opinion that these expenses are a legitimate charge against the fund provided by Parliament for the education of Indian children.\n\nIn view of this explanation I trust that the Treasury Board will see fit to pass favourably upon my memorandum.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nChas Stewart\nSuperintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n5th October, 22.\n\nThe Hon. Chas. Stewart,\nMinister of the Interior,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Stewart,\n\nAs requested at the meeting of the Treasury Board yesterday I am forwarding to you the enclosed cases, namely:\n\nINDIAN AFFAIRS:\nRev.

A. R. Lett from Navan, Ont. to Lytton, B. C., amounting to $932.19. An Order in Council in this connection has not as yet been passed, and, as the railway company is pressing for payment, I am drawing the matter to your attention again.\n\nIt is possible that, if the Treasury Board realized that the money is due to the Canadian National Railways, who supplied the transportation upon a warrant issued by this Department, the necessary authority for payment would be given.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nJ. C. Saunders, Esq.,\nDeputy Minister,\nFinance Department,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Treasury Board at the meeting this morning had under consideration the payment of expenses incurred by the removal of the family and household effects of the Reverend A.H. Lett from Navan, Ontario, to Lytton, B.C., amounting in all to $932.15.\n\nExcept in very special cases, removal expenses in connection with appointments are not allowed by the Governor in Council.\n\nAttached to the papers was a memorandum initialled by yourself under date of the 8th February, 1922, stating that \"Mr. Lett was assured that on taking this appointment his expenses would be defrayed by the Department.\" The Board desire information as to who gave such assurance to Mr. Lett and on whose authority.\n\nI was instructed to direct your special attention to a charge of $272.75 for freight on an automobile. The Board are of opinion that such an unusual charge would likely be open to serious criticism; in fact, under date of February 22nd, 1922, the late Auditor General specially called the attention of the Board to this charge.\n\nThe case will be held by the Treasury Board pending the receipt of your reply.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd.

This was a special case, and I had discussed it with the Minister, with the result that it was decided to pay Mr. Lett's transportation. The circumstances are fully explained in the Hon. Charles Stewart's letter to you of September 22, and you will observe that Mr. Stewart supports the payment.\n\nWith reference to the charge for the freight on an automobile, if the Board finds the charge improper, I will not ask that it be included in the amount to be paid.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

This is a decided disadvantage to us as we were able to choose the most convenient article best adaptable, most servicable & naturally have the proper attention given by the Firm represented.\n\nWould you kindly take this matter up with the Dept. with a view of obtaining a written recognition of our Govt status in order that we might set these Lyttom Merchants in their proper places. It is their aim to make us purchase through them. This is an impossibility as we would not exist any great length of time paying four prices for our commodities.\n\nI trust you will see fit to give this your earliest attention.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nSir,\n\nEnclosed please find a letter from the principal of St. George's School re the action taken by the 'Retail Merchants' against wholesale firms supplying St. George's School with the necessary supplies. The merchants claim that the school is a privately owned concern, belonging to the New England Company, and that we have not the right to purchase wholesale from the wholesalers through their travellers. If the school is barred from doing this their expenses would be very much higher, and we could not afford to purchase retail.\n\nTrusting that the Department will send me a letter showing that the school is now a government institution, entitled to purchase wholesale,\n\nI have the honor to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H.

I investigated the charge carefully and found that the statement of the chief is true.\n\nMr. Graham has in many places and on several occasions invited Catholic parents to send their children to Lytton Anglican School. He said that one school is as good as the other... Lytton is the same as Catholic School.\n\nI do not deny that the School of Lytton is efficient, but it is an Anglican School for children who belong to the Anglican Church. Moreover, I do resent very much this interference of an Indian Agent in religious matters. I should like to know, dear sir, if this conduct of Mr. Graham has the approval of the Indian Department, encouraging religious strife and division in Indian Reserve? In the Indian Dept., approving indirect proselytizing on the part of its agent.\n\nI have been laboring among the Indians of the Fraser since 1871. I have baptized most of the Indians on the Fraser. I mention plenty of the couples that are married. Until now I have lived in peace and harmony with the agents of the government. I have helped them as much as possible - I will continue to do so, but I love my own work and will protect them at all costs.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nE. C.

Your report, the tone of which excites my thanks, has caused much regret, and I hasten to assure you that it is the Department's wish that our representatives interfere not at all in religious disputes.\n\nI am pleased to inform you that a communication has been addressed to Mr. Graham, and I hope there will be no cause to complain of his recruiting activities in future.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. E. C. Chirouse, O.M.I.,\nSt. Mary's Mission,\nMission, B.C.\nAugust 25th, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nIt is my duty to inform you a report has reached the Department to the effect that you have invited Roman Catholic parents to send their children to the Lytton Residential School. I am sure you appreciate the advisability of a Department officer refraining from any activity that might cause criticism on the part of a Church representative. It is true that a recent interpretation of a portion of Section 10 of the Indian Act permits of the admission of a child of Roman Catholic parents to a Protestant school, when it is clearly the wish of the father. The Department wishes, however, to guard against the abuse of this privilege, and we must bend every energy to conform to the general intention of the Act. Roman Catholic parents must not be informed that their children may be placed in a Protestant residential school until every tactful measure and compulsion is exhausted.\n\nI shall be pleased to have an acknowledgment of this communication.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of August 23rd, in which you state that a report has reached the Department to the effect that I have invited Roman Catholic parents to send their children to the Lytton Industrial School.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that this is absolutely untrue. I might say, though, that hardly any goes by that I do not get applications from Romans to send their children to the Lytton or Coghlanetza Schools. In every instance I advise them that there is the Roman Catholic School at Mission for them to send their children to, but they emphatically say that they will not send them there. Only on Friday last, I had an application from an Indian at Lillooet to send three children here. When I asked why he did not send them to Mission he stated that he would send them there, if they never went to school, as they could not afford to always be paying for them as the priests insisted on them doing.\n\nI beg to draw your attention to a letter I wrote to the Department, 1-02-12, March 10th, in which I enclosed copies of letters from Dennis S. Peters, which will speak for themselves.\n\nThe Indians are all quite well aware of the order in council, as I was informed by one of the chiefs that this matter came up at a meeting of the Allied Tribes.\n\nThe education of Indian children is a matter that I am deeply interested in, and I never lose an opportunity when on the reserves of bringing this very matter up, and very often they say to me, \"Where can we send them?\" and I inform them according to their religion, which school they are to be sent to.\n\nI am quite aware that any officer should refrain from any activity that might cause criticism on the part of church representatives, but Indians invariably will blame the Agent when the priest threatens them.\n\nTrusting that this explains the whole matter,\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6452, file 838-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, Sept. 11, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your l-06 of the 3rd instant, being in answer to my communication of the 28th ultimo.

Mr. Lett, the Principal, seems to me to be a most capable and energetic manager. Mr. Graham, the Agent, informs me that the improvement under his regime is most noticeable, and I understand that he has already considerably reduced the debt against the Institution. I am sure he is not the kind of man who would ask for expenditure by the Department, unless the matter was really pressing, and I think his efforts to make this Institution a success should be as largely encouraged as possible. I have spoken to Mr. Lett upon the matter of more education for the children along practical grounds, and he has promised that this shall be attended to. This is a matter to which I have before drawn attention, as being badly wanted in all the schools I have so far inspected, and which also would largely meet the requests of the Indian parents themselves.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.)

He seems to be doing good work there, and the Company naturally takes keen interest and would like to hear more about it.\n\nThe question of Fire Insurance has cropped up with regard to both the Schools. We understand that the policies in respect of St George's have lapsed, and also that although Mrs. Rogers has kept the Mohawk Institute provisionally covered pending instructions, we understand that it is not the practice of the Department to insure.

I shall be very pleased if you can assist him with band instruments for the boys, and the Department will try to make provision for some tuition of the players.\n\nI regret to state that the incurring of Indian residential schools is not in harmony with our practice, and, if you wish to cover your equity in the buildings at Lytton and Brantford, I should be pleased if you would make arrangements direct with the principals.

My monthly report will I am afraid, show very poorly, and my quarterly earnings, when the advance grant of $1500.00 is taken out, will just be sufficient to carry me over one month. It is true, I shall be able, later on, I hope, to dispose of farm produce will net us some cash, but it will have to be used to offset the standing debt, when same could be used profitably in necessary improvements.\n\nWe have in the new barn a source wherein we might make good, and will when we have it filled with cows. The process of building up a herd is so slow, that it will take at least two years of heartrending waiting before we can say it would be of any material benefit financially. Five or six cows would strengthen us here, one at least, if not two of them registered animals, as Mr. Timms, the dairyman, is rather anxious to experiment, and this would be a possible feeder to dairy farms about to be established in the community.\n\nWith every dairy farm, naturally, follow hogs. We should have a good pigsty in connection with the farm. Mr. Timms has been successful in raising bacon hogs, and is very anxious here also to get to work.\n\nFeed for stock is now no question. We have both silos filled with about 120 tons corn silage, and the remainder, 20 tons of alfalfa. This amount of silage is sufficient to feed 33 head of cattle, 40 lbs. per cow a day for six months. We harvested in the neighborhood of 275 tons alfalfa hay, and threshed 800 bags of grain. We shall have about 40 tons beet root. This means in silos and root cellars, 160 tons. The farm end, I can safely say, is advancing rapidly, and I would venture to say that the Department should not hold us up any longer than can be helped, as it is tiresome, and is not conducive to continued aggressiveness, having a great tendency to make one feel as though it is no use continuing with hands tied. To be candid, I might say that lately I have felt as though I would not be able to continue, being so handicapped in so many different quarters. The men are all so willing, but have no opening for their energies, and are continually approaching me from a get ahead point of view.\n\nThe blacksmith and one of the men on the farm also have something done in the way of better housing accommodation, and all four houses should have bathtubs, toilets and so on.\ntanks. Comforts are conducive to contentment, and I have a good bunch of men around me at the present time. It would, I feel, be disastrous to lose anyone of them.\n\nHen coops are another needed acquisition, which could be made payable, even to the extent of feeding the children. I have managed to erect two coops, but have no accommodation for scientific production, which is so necessary in a place of this type, in the training of boys. We have now on hand seventy laying hens, and have been able to give the children eggs twice a week.\n\nSo much for the farm. Now I would like to say something of the school building itself. I find it rather hard to keep a staff steadily, as there is no accommodation. Supervision is so hard, that the staff find that they cannot measure up to the standard asked, for insufficient equipment, and no proper division of both sexes, keeps everyone in constant strain, myself and Mrs. Lett, included, as the whole falls upon the head. I am beginning to wonder just how I have continued thus far. Mrs. Lett, at the end of the last period, was on the verge of a breakdown, due to nothing else than being in constant contact with the staff, and work of the school. I am thankful to say, she has regained some strength, and is again more or less feeling herself.\n\nIf we had much longer to continue in the building, (old part) new roof will have to be put on, as since the rains, I have been constantly patching and tarring. The sinks and wash troughs, bathrooms, etc., will have to be rebuilt, and new flooring will have to go in, in the bathrooms and dormitories. I have already patched the dormitories' floors.\n\nIn the dormitory we have a moral problem, which owing to the arrangement of that part of the building, we are unable to combat. We had one of the boys run away two weeks ago, and questioning him on his return, found out that the bigger boys were using him to commit sodomy, hence, his getaway, afraid to come to me. I suspected this for sometime, but myself and the supervisors had not been able to check up on it. It at least will be an impossibility to eradicate it, until we have proper accommodations where-in we can separate the older boys from mediums and youngsters.\n\nThe situation of the toilets, is such, that the boys, of necessity, are continually running to the dormitories, thus making no end of confusion, and necessary supervision.\nWe are forced to use the children's dining room to afford the boys some room for recreation in the way of small games. This does not lend itself to a tidy and clean dining room. The boys have no play room, in which they could occupy themselves on autumn and winter evenings. It is much easier to direct in a proper manner young energies, then it is to curb. The lack of proper playing quarters is a very hard proposition to cope with, and endless supervision is therefore called for. I have no hesitancy in saying that a great deal of moral trouble in dormitories is due to the fact that the boys are perforce held in too much.\n\nThe girls on the other hand are not too badly provided for, but could do with a great deal of improvement.\n\nThe water situation is critical. In the course of a short while new tanks will have to be built, but on second thought, the springs that have heretofore given us ample supply for domestic purposes, are gradually failing. We have had to use the irrigation ditch this summer, and I am hoping the fall rains will so increase the springs that they will supply us for the winter. The water situation gives us no fire protection.\n\nAs above mentioned, or touched upon, our own situation is by no means ideal. We have at the present time, nor have we had since coming, any home life. Mrs. Lett, baby and myself, occupy one bedroom, not even having a spare room for visitors. The livingroom and the dining room are so public that we dare to talk over business affairs, and repair to our bedroom, but then must confine ourselves to whispers. The main corridor running through our part, and the staff (three members) living upstairs, sharing our toilet and bath, gives no privacy, which is so much needed under such strenuous conditions of work. We long for some place where we could be separate, for at least a time, and could enjoy home by ourselves. With the children's diningroom on one side, dormitories overhead, playroom below, we cannot have much peace.\n\nOur little girl is now growing up, and the constant contact with tubercular and syphilitic children, and immorality, does not make our feelings any brighter. To the above I attribute Mrs. Lett's condition. We cannot afford to allow ourselves to go on in this way indefinitely, and finally emerge broken. No use in Indian work, or anywhere else. We love the work for the work's sake, and hope at least in the near future to receive some encouragement in the way of a home of our own.\nI also would make a general plea for the outside, (farm situation), which would give me a chance to do something, and a new school, as soon as it is possible, as we are badly in need of new quarters from so many points of view.\n\nRe the extension of the dam at Bootahnie Lake. This work is setting me back $5.00 per day, and will run me into a bill of about $300.00. Owing to so much fall work here, I could not in any way allow the school teams to go there, hence $4.00 a day for team and teamster, two teams being my division of the work. This work if finished will give us added tonnage at Lot 47, as it will provide for an added crop, and with it, a permanent man, and a span of horses will have to be provided.\n\nIn conclusion, I might say that I am at the present time, feeling rather upset, in mind, because of the fact, that I am unable to pick up owing to financial strain, the financial end of the school work. As I go on with my hands tied, the work becomes more and more burdensome, and I feel that it is time the Department was placing the institution on a permanent, businesslike basis, so that I will be enabled to relieve the burden and strain carried.\n\nTrusting to hear favorably from you at your earliest convenience,\n\nYours obediently,\n\n(Rev. A.R.Lett)\nPrincipal.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont., Canada.\n\nAL/MD\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI have just received a letter from Mr. Lott of St. George's School, Lytton, which causes me some anxiety.\n\nHe seems quite discouraged. I feel apparently that he lacks not the support that he needs for the successful carrying on of the work.\n\nI should be glad if I could see you.\n\nI should be free early on Monday afternoon next if you can kindly make an appointment.\n\nBelieve me\n\nYour very truly,\n\nJohn Charles Roper\nBishop of Ottawa.\nOctober 31, 1924.\n\nDear Bishop Reper,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 29th instant, with reference to Mr. Lett, Principal at the Lytton Industrial School, B.C.\n\nI shall be free on Monday afternoon, next, and shall be pleased to make an appointment with you at any hour that will be convenient.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRt. Rev. J. C. Reper, D.D.,\nBishop of Ottawa,\n140 Bay Street,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 4, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Lett:\n\nYour general letter of October 15th has caused me much concern. His Lordship the Bishop of Ottawa and Mr. Ferrier were in my office yesterday and we discussed remedial measures at some length. Relative to your general financial condition, I believe you have done as well as could be expected, considering the difficulties. There is being directed to you under separate cover a cheque for $1270, which is on hand from the New England Company. Please use this for outstanding accounts, so that some of the worries of current financing will be relieved.\n\nTo further release per capita earnings for regular current expenses, you should request authority for all repairs and replacements other than those of a minor nature. Whenever funds are available, favourable consideration will be given to meeting these costs from Appropriation or future payments from the New England Company.\n\nI understand from your letter that you are in favour of capital expenditure in connection with:\n\n1. Hogpen and henhouse.\n2. Milch cows, hogs and chickens.\n3. Employees' residence.\n4. Bath and toilet accommodation for two residences.\n5. Principal's residence.\n6. Proper living quarters for boys.\n\nI believe funds can be found for some of these needs now and I am prepared to place an item in the Estimates for the more costly undertakings. If the Government allows the item the work could be undertaken next spring. Give serious consideration to the various questions and telegraph me, estimating the cost concerning what you would like to undertake immediately.\n\nRev. A. R. Lett,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nLytton, B. C.\nIndicate if the building activity you request in your telegram can be undertaken by day labour, under your supervision and that of the Indian agent. Further, let me know if stock should be purchased this fall, as I notice you have plenty of feed.\n\nIn the light of your letter, I consider that one of the most important requirements is the provision of a residence for yourself and family. You might let me know if a building of this type could be erected now and indicate the probable duration of the building season at Lytton. Upon receipt of your telegram, I will endeavour to secure the authority of the Superintendent General for the activity that is considered necessary now, provided the funds are available.\n\nAs it may not be possible to provide a new main building at Lytton in the near future, I am inclined to ask for a Vote for a boys' dormitory and playroom combined. Please let me know by letter what you think of such a building and indicate whether it would be satisfactory to place it on the site that would be suitable for a new main building. We could perhaps use such a structure for classroom purposes in the future. In your letter you might intimate whether or not residence accommodation could be provided in the main building for the two employees who are not well housed, i.e., the boys' dormitories, wash rooms, etc., were released by the provision of a special boys' building.\n\nI was very pleased to learn that you have done so well on the farm and I wish to assure you of my active interest and assistance.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDear Dr. Scott:\n\nSome time ago I visited St. George's School at Lytton, and found the Principal, Rev. Mr. Lett almost in despair, and sadly in need of some encouragement, particularly as to the future prospects of the school.\n\nAs you doubtless know from reports you have received, he has certainly worked hard, under most adverse conditions. He has kept the school well filled, and has put the agricultural side, anyhow as regards crops, on its feet, which I believe no other Principal has been able to do before. With, however, the load of debt on his shoulders he has now reached the limit of business capability, unless the Department comes to the rescue. He has, I am pleased to say, received every possible support from Mr. Agent Graham, but I do think that more support should be forthcoming from his own brother churchmen.\n\nHaving, however, proved the need of this school by raising the attendance despite adverse conditions, I think that still further support should be forthcoming. As I have already pointed out, he has been able to raise large forage crops, but they, of course, do not pay unless you have, as in this case, the dairy stock to feed it to, which stock will then bring in the much needed income. He has not the money to purchase same, and under present conditions, it will take a number of years before the capacity of this new dairy barn, which should be the paying side of their agricultural activities, can be filled. Pigs are also a good paying side line to dairy farming.\n\nI should therefore advise that the barn be utilized, otherwise the erection of same was waste, and six grade cows be purchased, and some pig pens erected, so much for the immediate necessity of help on the agricultural side, which should materially help put the school upon a self-supporting basis.\n\nFrom the school side the matter is even more pressing. I have already reported fully upon the deficiencies, and unsatisfactory state of the building, and you have doubtless heard of the difficulties of running the school efficiently, owing to these drawbacks. One of the most pressing and immediate troubles is the shortness of water, which apparently cannot be rectified at the present site of the school. This is dangerous, both from the health point of\n\nDr. Duncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nDr. Duncan C. Scott. -2- November 5, 1924.\n\nview and safety from fire, besides causing much unnecessary labour.\n\nStructurally, too, the building is tumble-down and totally inadequate, and its site is poor also, from the point of view as to supervision of agricultural work. It will really have to be rebuilt.\n\nDoubtless, all this is already known to you, but I am writing in hopes that some encouragement as to prospects can be given to Mr. Lett. I am sure he deserves every consideration we can give him.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n(Geo. S. Pragnell)\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nSir,\n\nWithin the last few weeks, I have gone into the St. George's School situation very thoroughly with both Mr. Inspector Pragnell, and School Inspector Gairns, at the request of the principal, the Rev. Mr. Lett.\n\nAs far as the farm is concerned, this I am glad to say is about on a paying basis, but in order to make it a little better, there is great need for some more milk cows, and a piggery. With these the school should be put on a good paying basis. As far as the farm is concerned, cream could be shipped and surplus milk used for pigs, which are always a paying line. At the present time there is no piggery near the new barn. The old one, which was absolutely useless, is situated up by the old barn.\n\nIn regard to the school building, this, as you know, is very old, and the plan is so antiquated that it makes supervision very difficult, especially in the wintertime when the dining-room, for instance, has to be used as a playroom for the boys. All this necessitates the keeping of a larger staff than I would consider necessary, and consequently increases the expenses and difficulties of the Rev. Mr. Lett has in financing this institution.\n\nThe greatest trouble that we have is the shortage of water. Owing to the springs from which the domestic water supply was obtained having dried up last winter, every atom of water for the building had to be hauled in barrels, and up to the present time when then the school has relied upon irrigation water, which is none too good for household needs. This is now turned off and it is doubtful whether we are going to get sufficient water from these springs again this winter to supply the school. This naturally makes it very dangerous, both from a sanitary point of view, and also in case of fire.\n\nIt has been intimated to us on several occasions, that we are next in line for a new building this coming year, and I sincerely trust that the Department will do all it can to get this started.\n\nI might add that even the Indians are beginning to notice the defects in the building, and fire risks that we are running owing to shortage of water.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H.

I have to inform you that the Department has had some correspondence with the Rev. Principal in this connection and on the 4th instant a special grant was made for the purpose of paying outstanding accounts. The Deputy Superintendent General is also giving favourable consideration to the supplying of stock, a hog pen and it is hoped that an appropriation for a principal's residence and perhaps for other buildings will be made by Parliament at the next session.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

With kindest regards,\n\nBelieve me, to be,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGovernor,\n\nDuncan Scott Esq., D.Litt.,\nThe New England Company.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSt. George's Industrial School,\nLYTTON, B.C.\nNovember 14th, 1924.\n\nTo:\nD. C. Scott, Esq.,\nGenl. Mgr.,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYours of the 4th inst. to hand, and I wish to sincerely thank you for the whole-hearted hearing you have given me. Needleless to say, I have conscientiously worked and feel I have not yet arrived anywhere, yet yours together with a letter of encouragement from Bishop Popper, has, I feel, for the present opened a way out of the difficulty.\n\nOwing to the fact of so many weeds on the farm I have not been able to get a proper catch of alfalfa. In one case of some eight acres of land which has been seeded twice in succession, I have not had a catch. I have spent some $400 on alfalfa seed without results and this summer after fertilizing for three years with barnyard manure, tried a potato crop in order to get cultivation, with the result that I hope in the early spring to get a catch, but the potato were not a crop and I lost out in my estimation of having one or two cars of potatoes for sale. Next spring I expect to seed all land available as alfalfa is the only paying crop here outside of roots, potatoes and corn. Grain is a failure because of the fact that there is so much waste through irrigation and results are not very high in comparison with three crops of alfalfa.\n\nSince submitting my report, Inspector Cairns has visited the school, and we had a long talk on ways and means of relieving the situation. Mr. Cairns suggested doing away with the blacksmith-shop as this particular department has not been paying. I believe this would be a good step, as I have found a deficiency here ever since taking over the work. I have not reported this simply because I was of the firm opinion that this being the only department where a boy could really receive a trade training, the department would insist on its being carried on, but since Mr. Cairns has stated otherwise, I would advise closing up the shop with your permission.\n\nMr. Cairns also advocated giving away the greater part of the farm, but with this I do not agree as the ranch at the present time is paying its salaries and expenses. I shall submit a financial report on the farm herewith. I feel that the next two years will show a fair dividend from this department.\n\nMy present financial strain is due to one outstanding factor and that is that I am of necessity carrying a staff that would care for 135 or even 140 children. On the day of Mr. Cairns inspection, we had 93 on the roll, with 92 in the school, one being sick in the hospital. We could handle eight more children. Mr. Indian Agent Graham is shortly sending in a number, and Indian Agent Helmeingof Kamloops is\nnow taking a census of his agency, and I hope to have a report from him saying that there are a number available in the Nicola valley. I arranged a trip through the Nicola with Mr. Helmsing, but unfortunately, Mr. Cairn's visit here and his trip through the Nicola collide and I consequently had to cancel my visit. I hope later on to make this trip and to do some volunteer recruiting. While, with one hundred children, we are overcrowded, yet I am obliged to carry them in order to make ends meet. This is not at all conducive to good health among the children.\n\nSince we cannot increase our number, I must needs turn to immediate means of remedy, hence the report to you with its suggestions.\n\nWe can do with the cows right away. The dairy at present is supplying the needs of the school with butter and milk, but with some additional cows we would be able to ship cream, thereby making a cash surplus which would help the financial difficulty. The additional skim milk used in feeding hogs could be made a payable factor, hence my asking for a hog pen.\n\nThe chicken coop would be an asset from the point of view of school-scrap feeding and run on a scientific basis would no doubt develop into quite an income, even from feeding children and tending to the local market. This should be built to accommodate about 300 laying hens. We have about 80 hens now on hand and with the purchase of a few roosters, an incubator with 500 egg capacity, by next autumn we could fill up our hen-house. The new employee's residence to be built should be provided with a basement which could for incubators, as the man occupying this house on completion is to have charge of the chickens.\n\nThe three houses in which the farm hands are living need sanitary appliances in the way of bath-tubs, toilets and septic tanks. An ice-house with two refrigerators, one each for butter and meat, has been included in the estimates. At the present time there are no refrigerators on the place.\n\nThese are needed improvements and would make us feel that we can take a greater pride and interest in our property.\n\nRegarding the new residence, both Mrs. Lett and myself really feel the necessity of a place separate from the school. Mrs. Lett especially feels this as her condition of health, owing to so much steady contact with routine coupled with the care of our child, is gradually telling, and a nervous breakdown will eventually be the result. The doctor has already told her that she must get away, at least for a time, in order to regain her former self.\n\nThe situation of this building will have to be considered in conjunction with the new school, and I presume built in uniformity.\n\nI have no hesitation in repeating what I have already stated, that there would be no common sense in building on the present site. From the following points of view a new school on the present site would be an absolute absurdity:\n\n1. Water, which is vital.\n2. By moving down on the farm we would be in the centre of operations.\n3. A room for necessary playgrounds, and easier supervision on the playgrounds.\n\n4. An opportunity for beautifying the place.\n\nBy subheading the above, I could go into detail in showing the great advantages each would present.\n\nProper living quarters for the boys. I trust you will hear with me in dealing with this question from a common sense point of view taking into consideration the temporary and the permanent building. Temporary additions to this building would not be feasible, nor practicable from many angles. In erecting a temporary building it would have to have in it a playroom and classroom, as an increase in numbers would mean extension, first of dining room, and secondly more classroom. The only way this could be done would be to open up the senior class-room and extend the dining-room into it. This would mean a large expense, even though it were of a very temporary nature. Water supply is just barely carrying us at the present time and to spread it out would be cutting our supply considerably. The heating plant is not large enough to carry any more radiation. With increased numbers, more laundry room and equipment would have to be installed.\n\nA Dormitory as a unit of the new building. This would have its advantages and disadvantages, yet I feel that a permanent dormitory on the new site would be much better than adding expense to this building. We have plenty of water on the farm, thereby relieving the present situation; the boys would be in the centre of farm activities, but, this situation would mean, added staff which we cannot afford; the children would have to come up here for meals and classroom work; laundry etc would have to be brought up here, etc.\n\nIn conclusion I would say that if the Department cannot see fit to commence construction on a new building of permanent type, which indeed would be the solution of the entire problem, that it would be wisest, even with its manifold drawbacks, and certainty of expense, no matter how temporary, to construct a temporary building at the school here, to house a dormitory, class-room, and playroom, with necessary accommodation for supervision, but I feel that it must be clearly borne in mind that this building would have to have a separate heating plant, and where water for it would come from, in view of our present serious shortage, I do not know.\n\nTrusting that this has stated our position to you, and that some remedial measures may be undertaken to ease a situation that to me is a continual source of worry.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL.\n\nARL/FNA.\nOttawa, November 26, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Lett:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, with further reference to general conditions and to the needs of the Lytton Indian Residential School. I am writing another communication relative to buildings; but I wish you to know that I am giving very favourable consideration to your requests as our Estimates are being presented to the Superintendent General. I am also writing to the Governor of the New England Company, explaining our aims and asking that they give a grant to supplement Parliamentary Appropriation, so that a commencement can be made on a new main building next year.\n\nI believe you would be well advised to discontinue the blacksmith shop. There can be only two reasons for the activity, i.e., financial and vocational training for boys. It is doubtful if any of the pupils will become blacksmiths, and as the department operates at a financial loss, I consider it could be dropped.\n\nYou will receive a separate communication with reference to the purchase of stock.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. A. R. Lett,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nLytton, B. C.\nOttawa, November 27, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Mathews:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to the Lytton Indian Residential School. There is no doubt in my mind as to the extreme difficulty of managing and financing this institution with its present buildings and equipment. The school itself is badly laid out, unsanitary and is in a dilapidated condition. Further, if a fire secured any headway the entire structure would be doomed, because of its inflammable nature and the small water supply. Residential facilities for the principal and family and for other married members of the staff are inadequate. More stock is needed, so that the barn, which has been erected on the new site, and the farm produce can be utilized as financial assets.\n\nWe have been fortunate in securing the services of the Rev. Mr. Lett, who is not easily discouraged and who has done exceptionally well, considering the difficulties with which he has to contend. Upon receipt of his letter of the 15th ultimo, I decided that improvements must be effected without delay and I immediately directed that $1270 be sent to Mr. Lett to pay outstanding accounts. This was the balance of the account in which the New England Company payments for Lytton are deposited. Further, I included items for buildings at the Lytton school in the estimates which are now being presented to the Government.\n\nThe discipline problems and the difficulties of supervision demand a new main building on the new site, as soon as funds can be provided. The inadequacy of the water supply at the present site is another important reason why the school activity should not be carried on in the old building any longer than necessary.\n\nThe erection of a portion of the new main building, which could be used for a time as quarters for boys, requires a large vote but may effect a saving eventually. There are many pressing claims on Parliamentary Appropriation for Indian Education, but I am hopeful that something can be done next year. Would it be possible for the New England Company to make a grant for this very necessary building activity? We have discussed Estimates with the Superintendent General and I hope that Fifteen or Sixteen Thousand Dollars will be provided. If you could add Ten Thousand to this\n\nErnest Mathews, Esq.,\nGovernor, New England Company,\n26 Bloomsbury Sq.,\nLondon, W.C., 1,\nEngland.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6462, file 833-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\namount a wing could be built, which would form a portion of the new main building of the future.\n\nI am also prepared to ask for funds to erect some outbuildings. A residence for the farmer on the new site and a fitting up of the present farmer's residence as a temporary home for the principal and his family will make the management and staff more comfortable. Further, temporary improvements can be made on the other staff buildings. I am proposing to erect a hen house and a hog pen on the new site as soon as the 1925 building season commences. These building activities will be provided for, I trust, by Parliament at its next session. A few days ago the purchase of additional stock was authorized, so that the facilities and produce can be utilized with financial profit during the coming months.\n\nThe time has come when considerable capital expenditure is necessary at the Lytton Indian Residential School if our work there is to prosper. I wish to assure you that I am giving most favourable consideration to the requirements of the institution and I am convinced that Mr. Lett, who has been informed of my aims, has attacked his problems with renewed vigour and optimism. If the New England Company and this Department can provide funds to start a new main building next year, the school will enter a new era of much usefulness.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nKamloops, B.C., November 24, 1924.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your 165-0-1 of the 17th inst., and am pleased to hear that assistance to St. George's Industrial School at Lytton is being considered.\n\nI am sure that this consideration is deserved, and undoubtedly a new school will have to be erected there before very long.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Geo.

A school with less than One Hundred pupils should have not more than twelve on the staff. This school finds it impossible to pay its way. The staff should be gradually cut down. There is a loss of $675. in the Blacksmith shop alone. Here are the figures that the Principal gave me:\n\nBlacksmith shop:\nIncome for one year $536.45\nWork for farm 544.65\n$1081.10\n\nExpenditure:\nWages of Blacksmith $900.00\nMaterial 505.64\nExtra work 300.00\n$1755.64\n\nLeaving a loss of $674.54\nThis is the loss in one department. I am sure that three men and a Chinese are not needed in the Winter to run the farm. I am sure a great reduction in the number on the staff without impairing the efficiency could be brought about. There is not work full time for a carpenter and two or three boys.\n\nI would recommend that this whole matter be carefully studied and an attempt be made to put the Institution on a paying basis. The efficiency of the school is hampered on account of the lack of money to do things necessary.\nOttawa, December 10, 1924.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI should be pleased if you would make a report relative to the advisability of decreasing the staff at the Lytton Indian Residential School. There appears to be 18 officers engaged and the salaries paid are somewhat higher than at most institutions of like character. The Deputy Superintendent General's letter of this file number of the 26th ultimo suggested that the blacksmith activity be discontinued. Would it be possible to get along with fewer lady officers? I should be pleased if you would make a general report relative to this question at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev.

I know from observing the schools at Sardis and at Fraser Lake, what a difference is made by having modern equipment, and I trust that the excellent results now being obtained under Mr. Lett's management, that he will be given such help from the Department as will enable him to make still more satisfactory progress.\n\nIt is now nearly fifteen years since the New England Company asked me to be the official visitor to the school, and I can safely say that I have never made a visit any year and found better conditions obtaining, than at the present time.\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nA.

In connection with the Agreement of Sale, the consideration for the real estate is \u00a36,400 - $8,000 to be paid upon the execution of the document, $8,000 in one year, $8,000 in two years and the balance of the consideration plus interest due at 5% in three years' time.

MacKenzie,\nActing Deputy Secretary\nUtah.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have yours of Dec. 10th No 165-0-1 relating to Inspectors report advising the reduction of staff in this School. I have to make the following remarks after careful consideration.\n\nI had a long chat with Inspector Cairns on this matter & I must say that he did not give a sympathetic hearing in every sense of the word. I called his attention to the fact that with proper equipment & a properly building in which to work a reduction in Staff would be quite feasible & justified. While he readily agreed that I was working under very great difficulties yet he utterly failed to be guided by the following facts.\n\n1st that the majority of his schools are new & furnished with modern equipment with which to do the work.\n\n2ndly that I am of necessity carrying a Staff which could easily look after the needs of one hundred & thirty or forty children provided we had the proper building & equipment.\n\nThe question of fewer lady officers is a question that I have gone into at several occasions. The present situation is this. Their must be at least five Matrons to look after our present number of children. At the present time we have six. The dining room matron who attends to the setting of the children's tables & division of food, also assists the boys matron in the mending & darning of the boys clothing. If the present sewing room were large enough to accommodate the required number of girls the boys repair work could be done by the girls but as the room is small measuring 19x12 with table, three sewing machines, & cupboards there is not much room left for matron & girls. The laundry with its ancient Armstrong equipment, has to be kept in operation six days in the week 8 o'clock A.M. until 4 P.M. so that there is not much opportunity for relief here. If a proper laundry & larger sewing room the dining room matrons work could be divided among the remaining matrons thus doing away with this extra but with the present numbers & present equipment we are obliged to carry this matron so that she can relieve where relief is necessary.\n\nThe baking of the children's bread should come under the supervision of the kitchen but owing to the position of the bake-oven being apart from the kitchen Mrs. Lett as house matron is obliged to supervise this work. I have tried to take this work away from Mrs. Lett as I do not think she should have it to do but I cannot see how or where it could be placed without taking supervision away from some department where it is needed. I might say in passing that the bake house having no facilities for heating except a small stove it falls to my lot to fire once or twice during the night in order to keep the dough warm during these cold nights.\n\nIn doing away with the house masters position would involve the teachers. One cannot expect efficiency in this most-needed department if a teacher is obliged to rise at 5:30 o'clock supervise until nine, teach until twelve noon; supervise until 1:30; teach until 4 & supervise until 9 p.m. It is true this could be divided between\nteachers but even then they would be over worked especially so as there are no playrooms for the boys & we are obliged to utilize children's dining room & every place available to give some form of recreation to the detriment of each department involved. If we had them inside to house the carpenter & a farm hand, they could be made responsible for early call & supervision until 7 a.m. but as these men are obliged to live outside it is hardly a feasible proposition.\n\nI may say that it would look as though I was carrying unneeded help on the farm. I could, for the winter months do with less but is it policy to do away with your efficient help when there is plenty of work for them to do in the way of cleaning up land. This work now will not show returns, but the work must be done before returns can be expected & by letting men out here advance would be checked for at least six months.\n\nI have already intimated that the blacksmith shop could be closed as it has not been covering expenses. Taking into consideration the repair work on the farm, this dept. for the past few months has been paying but a great deal of this work could be done by the farms hands if they did not have a shop to go to.\n\nRe the height of salaries in comparison with other institutions of this nature. I do not intend asking any person to work for starvation wage. I believe in holding a good man when you have him. In a number of depts I have reduced salaries, for eg Irrigator when I came here was getting $125.00 now he gets $75.00 Farm Manager $100.00 now $80.00 Dairy man $75.00 now $70.00; Farm Hand $65.00 now $55.00; Laundry $45.00 now $40.00; Boys Matron $50.00 now $40.00; House Matron $40.00 now $30.00. This is a reduction of $115.00 dollars per month. I have on the other hand raised the teachers $15.00 each per month & according to Mr. Cairns I have efficiency here where it is most needed. From a business standpoint efficiency cannot be had without paying for it.\n\nOn the other hand outside of my Per Capita earnings, I have no source of financial assistance, while other institutions in the majority of cases are attended to in the way of children's clothing & bedding by Woman's Auxiliaries or Aid Societies of some nature. The farm here in the near future, will be a source of income & I am looking forward to independence with Per Capita grants.\n\nAllow me to say in conclusion that the only way out of the difficulty is the building of a New School. I do not see where I can easily dispense with any member of the staff & carry on as it should be under the present circumstances & in as efficient a manner as it is possible. The building & equipment does not lend itself to a minimum expecting maximum results.\n\nI am yours very sincerely\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nOttawa, December 31st, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, and I note that you have given serious consideration to the question of cutting down on the staff at the Lytton Indian Residential School.

Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, January 5, 1925.\n\nDear Mr. Bush:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th ultimo, with reference to the Lytton Indian Residential School, and I note with satisfaction that the Court of the Company at its next meeting will give consideration to the provision of funds to assist this Department with a building programme.\n\nYou will find enclosed a certificate that the sum of \u00a3400, payable by this Department as rent under the terms of the lease, was expended in repairs and replacements to the mechanical plant at the school.\n\nFor the three calendar years ended December 31, 1924 - the first three years of the lease - the Department has expended from Parliamentary Appropriation the sum of $28,674.05 for repairs, replacements, additions and improvements, as follows:\n\n| Description                                      | Amount   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Replacements to house equipment                  | $1,136.19|\n| Horses and milch cows                            | 786.55   |\n| Irrigation, etc.                                  | 3,309.41 |\n| Agricultural implements                          | 2,659.05 |\n| Repairs and replacements to buildings and mechanical plant | 2,883.05 |\n| Electric light installation                      | 4,955.92 |\n| New barn                                          | 12,943.87|\n\n$28,674.05\n\nIn addition, per capita grant and other current expenses have during the same period amounted to $52,061.66 - a total expenditure from Parliamentary Appropriation of $81,725.71.\n\nThe twelve quarterly grants of \u00a3300 which have been received from the New England Company during the three calendar years and the special payment of \u00a3300.17.9 which you forwarded from a trust company, amounting altogether to $18,080.52, are accounted for as follows:\n\n| Description                                      | Amount   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Directed to school management to be applied towards current expenses and to pay off deficit | $15,373.62|\n| Car for the Principal                            | 932.00   |\n| Agricultural implements                          | 365.23   |\n| Unexpended                                      | 1,411.62 |\n\n$18,080.52\n\nThe payments which you directed to me prior to commencement of the lease were applied towards current expenses at the school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

The four quarterly payments in 1922, the four quarterly payments of 1923 and the first quarterly payment of 1924 were all directed to the management of the school, to be applied on the deficit and for current expenses. The last three quarterly payments of 1924 were deposited in Trust Account No. 460 and are being directed from time to time to the management of the school for current expenses, improvements or replacements.\n\nPrior to the quarterly payments of 1922, the Department received from the New England Company the quarterly grants which had earlier been sent direct to the management of the school. These were all directed to the Indian agent for current expenses and to pay off the deficit. The statement in the letter to the Charter Clerk of the New England Company refers to the period January first, 1922, to December 31st, 1924, and to the Lytton Account in Indian Education ledger and to Account No. 460 in the Trust Account ledger.\nDuncan Scott Esq., Litt.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Doctor Scott,\n\nAt the Court of the Company held on February 11th last, the following letters and reports were considered:\n\n1. Your letter to me of November 27th 1924.\n2. Your letter to the Company of January 25th 1925.\n3. A letter from Mr Lett to the Company dated December 17th 1924.\n4. A copy of the report from Mr Lett to you.\n\nI am sure you will understand that the Company are much surprised and disappointed at the disturbing nature of Mr Lett's letters, considering the previous reports we have from time to time had of the School, the buildings and the farm.\n\nThe Company's decision to build a School at Lytton was taken after thorough consideration of the questions raised by the site and its proximity to Lytton and the Indian Reserve.\n\nWhen the School was visited by the late Governor, Mr Ford, and myself in 1916, the buildings were well constructed and there was a good supply of water; the crops, stock and general management of the place seemed most satisfactory. Successive reports or which a synopsis is appended for reference supported the favourable opinion formed by us on our visit.\n\nNothing was said about the inadequacy of the buildings when in or about 1916 the Company were encouraged to lay out a considerable sum of money in bringing water by a \"flume\" from Botanie Lake; it is only surprising to learn now that the water supply is inadequate.\n\nNor again was any doubt suggested when in 1918 the Company were asked to add to the buildings a large block of rooms containing accommodation for 40 girls.\nIt has been impossible for any members of the Company to visit Canada since 1914, but they have heard from time to time that St. George's School is one of the best of the Indian schools, while the Chapel has always been described as one of the best in Canada.\n\nNow suddenly without any previous warning the Company are faced with a report that \"the School itself is badly laid out, insanitary, and in a dilapidated condition.\"\n\nWhether this state of things is in any way due to Mr. Laronde who succeeded Mr. Dawson as Principal it is unnecessary for me to speculate, but if so it is unfortunate that the deterioration of all the buildings and the bad state in which everything was left were not reported to us at once.\n\nLooking to the obligations of the Company as covered by their Charter, I feel that to spend large sums on pulling down and re-erecting buildings not more than 20 years old would hardly be justified, because under our present agreement with the Indian Department if all that Mr. Lett requires were done at once and paid for by the Department the lien on the Company's property at Lytton would be very heavy, and objected to on the ground that we are spending money on the secular education of Indians, a work now so well carried out by the Indian Department.\n\nThe Court discussed the matter at length and eventually came to the unanimous conclusion that if you are satisfied that removal and reconstruction are essential the best course open to them would be for me to enquire from you definitely whether the Indian Department would be prepared to buy the property at Lytton, in which case I am authorised to say that the Company might be willing to continue the grants which they now give, and also probably give the bulk of the interest derived from the purchase money to the Indian Department.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGovernor,\nThe New England Company.\nAPPENDIX.\n\nEXTRACTS FROM REPORTS RECEIVED BY THE COMPANY.\n\nThe Rev. E. Green, Inspector of Schools, visited the School in June and October 1912 and reported that \"the School owns over 366 acres of very fine land. 200 acres are under cultivation. The soil is sandy but they have it all well irrigated. The building was well ventilated, and drains in order. There is an abundant supply of spring water piped into covered tanks. All parts of the building seemed to be in good repair. A dairy had been added.\"\n\nMr. Dawson, who succeeded Mr. Ditcham as Principal, reported in March 1913 \"that the buildings have been kept in good repair, and various additions have been made to them. The sanitation is good and we have a good water supply. The farm and garden operations have been satisfactory.\"\n\nMr. T.J. Cumiskey, Inspector of Indian Agencies, reports for the year ended March 1913: \"I inspected the School on February 24th 1913. There were 33 pupils present on the date of visit. The buildings are well adapted for the work for which they were built, and the farm is conducted in a first class manner.\"\n\nA report from Mr. H.F. Graham, Indian Agent, accompanied the above: \"The buildings are very compact and airy, having large and well ventilated dormitories capable of accommodating about 50 boys. There is a large farm in connection with this school and the boys are given practical lessons in all branches of farming as well as shoemaking, carpentering and blacksmithing.\"\nOttawa, June 27, 1925.\n\nDear Mr. Mathews:\n\nI have given much thought to the subject matter of your letter of March 20th, with reference to the Lytton Indian Residential School. The future of this school has been discussed this week with the Principal, the Rev. Mr. Lett, who is now on holiday. I am satisfied that removal and reconstruction of the buildings are essential if the work at Lytton is to go forward and the Department will give favorable consideration to the question of purchasing the property.\n\nSome funds are now available for the Lytton School and might be used in connection with the purchase, and I should be grateful if you would let me have at your earliest opportunity a statement showing the lands to which the New England Company has title. The matter would be expedited if you would intimate what consideration would be acceptable to the New England Company.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nErnest Mathews, Esq.,\nGovernor, New England Company,\n26 Bloomsbury Sqr.,\nLondon, W. C., 1,\nEngland.\nDear Doctor Scott,\n\nIn reply to your letter of 27th June, I enclose an extract from the Lease of St George's School, the original of which is in your possession. This Schedule shows the extent of the lands owned by the New England Company at Lytton.\n\nWith regard to the consideration which the Company would be disposed to accept, the land and buildings, apart from maintenance, cost the Company \u00a312475.13. 2, and the School stands as an asset of that value in our books.\n\nIt is however recognised that the Indian Department has expended considerable sums on repairs and improvements and the Company would be prepared to treat this expenditure as in some degree a set-off against the purchase price and might therefore accept something less than the sum above mentioned.\n\nUnder their Charter the Company have power to make grants in this part of Canada, and even if they parted with the ownership of the School, they would undoubtedly, as already indicated in my previous letter, be inclined to assist the Department in this way, particularly in relation to the religious side of the work, and I feel sure that terms to ensure mutual understanding between the Department and the Company could easily be arranged. The actual cash\npayment might be spread over a period of years if that were more convenient to your Department.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nErnest Matthews\n\nGovernor\n\nThe New England Company.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nReceipt attached to file\nDuplicate surrender with lease\n\nR.H.\nOttawa, August 20, 1925.\n\nDear Mr. Mathews:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd ultimo, enclosing a description of the lands owned by the New England Company at the Lytton Indian Residential School. I note that the Company has a capital investment of approximately $60,000 and that, in the event of transfer, you might accept something less than this sum, because of the Department's expenditure for plant and equipment.\n\nFor your information, I wish to state that this Department has expended for buildings, etc., at the Lytton School up to March 31, 1925, the sum of $38,030.53, as follows:\n\n| Year   | Description          | Amount |\n|--------|----------------------|--------|\n| 1914-15 | Equipment            | $57.50 |\n| 1920-21 | Stock                | $4,243.58 |\n|        | Mechanical plant     | $656.74 |\n| 1921-22 | Live stock           | $879.78 |\n|        | Mechanical plant     | $691.16 |\n|        | Irrigation Equipment | $2,934.64 |\n|        | Equipment            | $156.45 |\n| 1922-23 | Live stock           | $475.75 |\n|        | Mechanical plant     | $1,596.43 |\n|        | Equipment            | $629.50 |\n|        | Farm machinery       | $2,540.30 |\n| 1923-24 | Miscellaneous        | $868.07 |\n|        | Mechanical plant     | $3,956.44 |\n|        | Outbuildings         | $12,974.10 |\n| 1924-25 | Miscellaneous        | $299.09 |\n|        | Mechanical plant     | $1,129.49 |\n|        | Outbuildings         | $1,516.83 |\n|        | Live stock           | $865.35 |\n|        | Irrigation           | $1,670.33 |\n\nErnest Mathews, Esq.,\nGovernor, New England Company,\n26 Bloomsbury Sq.,\nLondon, W.C., 1,\nEngland.\n\nIt may be -\nIt may be interesting to you to know that, in addition to this capital expenditure, the Department has paid a per capita grant and other maintenance expenses during the 23 years ended March 31, 1925, amounting to $176,332.13.\n\nI should be grateful if you would intimate what consideration the New England Company would accept for their interest at Lytton. I feel that I should point out that the buildings on the old site will not be used by this Department as soon as adequate replacement can be made and that it is the lands, improvements other than buildings, and chattels in which we are interested. The present chapel, of course, will not be demolished; but this building is situate, as you are probably aware, on the Indian reserve.\n\nI am directed to thank you for the Company's offer to continue the grants which they now give and to add thereto the bulk of the interest derived from the purchase money. It would be a source of much satisfaction to this Department to have the New England Company continue its association with us in the conduct of this institution.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D.

This offer is without prejudice to the suggestion contained in my letters to you of 20th March and 23rd July last, relative to grants in aid of religious instruction at Lytton which the Company may from time to time be willing to make.\n\nIt is of course understood that if such a sale is effected, the conditions of the Lease are automatically determined.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nGovernor\nThe New England Company.\nCANADIAN PACIFIC RAILWAY COMPANY'S TELEGRAPH\n\nTELEGRAM\nCABLE CONNECTIONS TO ALL THE WORLD\n\nJ.

Laronde, the former principal of St. George's School, I had some correspondence with the Department in connection with a loan of $100.00, he had borrowed from one of the members of the staff, Mr. L. Stemp.\n\nMr. Laronde acknowledged having borrowed this, as he was short of funds at the time, in order to pay off one of the staff he was letting go. He was under the impression that the Department was in his debt, and stated that as soon as he got what was coming to him, he would pay this back, but as it was proven, that there was nothing coming to him, the result is that Mr. Laronde never has been in a position to pay back this money.\n\nMr. Stemp, who is still a member of the staff, has again approached Mr. Lett, the present principal, about this matter. The principal has just been in discussing it with me. He states that he is not in a position to pay this, but thinks that Mr. Stemp is entitled to it, as it was borrowed by the former principal for school purposes, and it should be repaid, as it is owing him, and he is in need of the money at the present time.\n\nTrusting the Department will give this matter its favorable consideration,\n\nYours truly,\n\nAssist. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Ind. Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\n(H. Graham)\nIndian Agent.\n\nHG/MD\nDecember 4th, 1925.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nA communication has been received from Mr. Agent Graham, Lytton, B.C., relative to a claim made by Mr. L. Stemp, an employee of the Lytton Residential School, to be reimbursed to the extent of $100, the amount of a loan he made to the Rev. L. Laronde, a former Principal of the School. The facts in the case as appear from our files are as follows:\n\nOn the 31st of March, 1921, Mr. Laronde, who was at that time about to give up duties, borrowed $100 from Mr. Stemp for the purpose of paying off the farm instructor, stating that he had no money in the bank at that time, but would reimburse Mr. Stemp as soon as he received further funds from the Department.\n\nLaronde proved to be a defaulter and left the school in a hurry, and Mr. Stemp has never been reimbursed. He claims that as this money was given for the purpose of paying a member of the staff it is a bona fide claim against the Department. This matter was brought to the attention of Mr. Agent Ball when he audited the accounts of the school after Laronde left. The cheque which Mr. Stemp gave Laronde was cashed by him at the bank and, in proof of this loan, the cheque was shown to both Mr. Ball and Mr. Agent Graham. Mr. Stemp is still a member of the staff and again requests repayment by the Department.\n\nFrom time to time there are funds available from the New England Company grant which are sent the Principal for current expenses, and for which he has to make no accounting to the Auditor General. I would recommend that from the next payment made the Principal, he be instructed to pay Mr. Stemp the sum of $100, as there is no doubt his claim is a reasonable one.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, December 9th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, relative to a claim made by Mr. L. Stemp, an employee of the Lytton Residential School, to be reimbursed to the extent of $100, the amount of a loan made by him to the Rev. L. Laronde, a former Principal of the school.\n\nThe Department has reviewed this matter and favourable consideration to this claim has been given. There is being directed to the Rev. Principal a payment of $500 from the New England Company funds. This should be applied toward current expenses, and from it Mr. Stemp should be paid.\n\nA copy of this letter is enclosed for the information of Mr. Lett.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nDuncan Scott Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Doctor Scott,\n\nThe Bank of Montreal are mailing to you the usual quarterly amounts of \u00a3250 and \u00a3300 in respect of the Mohawk Institute and St George's School respectively.\n\nThe Court of the Company next meets on February 10th, and I hope that by that date I may hear from you in reply to the Governor's letter to you of 22nd October.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nCharter Clerk.\nThe Crusader\n\nA Quarterly Review of Current Events in St George's Residential Indian School\n\nLytton B.C.\nTHE CRUSADER\n\nA quarterly review of the doings and happenings at St. George's Indian Residential School, Lytton, B.C., Canada.\n\nVolume 1. Number 1.\n\nIn presenting this, our first effort in magazine publication, to you, we do so in the hope that it will, should you not have been to Lytton, a means to an end, that of interesting you in our school; and should you be one of the many who know Lytton, and St. George's, that it will revive memories of past days, and give you an insight into any progress that has been made since last you visited with us.\n\nMuch of the material used in this short magazine has been prepared by the children themselves, thus providing them with some very essential practice in elementary composition. They have taken a great interest in this first edition, and we would be grateful for a word to tell them that their efforts were worth while.\n\nTo those of our readers to whom St. George's is but a name, we would endeavour to pass on a little information regarding our school. The early history of the school and its founders will be dealt with by our Principal, Rev. A.R.Lett, but much else can be said of the school to-day. We are endeavouring, under rather trying conditions, to impress upon some hundred odd Indian children, enough knowledge and training to equip them for life's battle when they leave here; whilst to those who show the mental aptitude, and the necessary physical equipment to handle it, we strive to put them through the Entrance Examination of the Province, and so on into High Schools. In the classrooms the children are taught many practical subjects outside of the classrooms; the girls, baking, sewing, laundry, cooking and housework; whilst the boys undertake to assist in working a very large farm; have a chance to learn blacksmithing, and rather elementary shoe-repairing, to learn gardening, and some of the older ones help in the management of a very fine herd of Holstein Dairy-cattle, which supplies the school with much needed milk.\n\nThe school is situated some two miles from the village of Lytton, on both transcontinental railroads. To one side of the school, the Fraser River flows, whilst from the east into Lytton come the Thompson River; but both rivers being very rapid and dangerous, we cannot boast of having an \"Old Swimmin Hole\" for our children. The buildings are old at St. George's, very old, some of them, and we hope and pray that the day is not far distant when we will get our long-lacked-for new school. Many new outbuildings have gone up in the past few years, the school being a large dairy-barn, hog-pens, chicken-houses, silos, besides the new staff cottages, so we have much to be thankful for. But although we cannot get a new school-building just yet, we will carry on and do our best by these entrusted to our care and teaching, and hope that they will grow up to be useful and energetic citizens.\n\nIn closing, we will take this opportunity of wishing you one and all, kind readers, the Compliments of the Season, and to all,\n\n\"A Very, Very Happy Christmas, and Happiness in the New Year.\"\nI do not think I could do better than to say a few words about the unique foundation of St. George's Indian Residential School. The school was built by a missionary society known as the \"New England Company\", founded in 1649, under charter from Charles the Second, who wished to take care of the subjects in what was then known as the New England States. In drawing up the Charter by which the Company should be governed, the King was careful to include within its scope the aboriginal peoples of the newly settled States; hence the interest taken in our Indians by this Company received its birth.\n\nAfter the U.S.A. gained their Independence, the Company transferred their interests to Canada and worked wholly with our Indian peoples. They built and supported a school for Indian children at Brantford, Ontario. This school served the Mohawk Indians. Finding that they had sufficient funds to bring it out, they built the present school at Lytton in 1902, and since materially added to the building.\n\nWe now have a school handling over one hundred children belonging to the tribes of the Thompson Indians. The school, situated as it is on the banks of the Fraser River, and in the midst of the Cascade Range of the Canadian Rockies, has a particularly picturesque appearance. Nature in all its beauty presents itself to the eye, in the greatness of the mountains, reaching high into the clouds, and extending their snow-capped tops far above the timber line; whilst at their feet or as it were, in between flows the turbulent water of the Fraser, with an altitude at Lytton of six hundred feet.\n\nThis comparison of altitude gives the reader an understanding, to a degree, of the vastness of God's book of Nature. And with this wonder, comes a message at this Christmas tide. In the glory, beauty, and vastness, is enveloped the thought of the Christ Child, who although born of humble parentage, wrapped in swathing clothes, and laid in a manger, is above all, and through all that we see. Truly we can say, \"Who hath at the end of these days spoken to us in His Son, whom He appointed Heir of all things, through Whom also He made the Universe.\" This thought ought to come home to us very strongly when we realize in a greater grandeur and lovelier way that He who was born a babe in Bethlehem is Master of all, and we as His servants unite, yet let us who working in co-operation with one another and with Him as guide, sustainer, and Master, we can carry out the Angelic proclamation, \"Peace on Earth, Good-will to Men.\"\n\nMay we approach this Christmas tide with a message from our surroundings surmounted by the infinitely beautiful message of the Angels, so that the New Year will begin with a stronger incentive to be true and faithful servants to Him who is our Pattern, Priest, and King.\nWe welcome but three new members to our staff this year, the school maintaining most of its old staff, which to those versed in work among Indians, is a good sign. We will deal with the new-comers in order.\n\nMiss Aileen McCarthy, our Girls' Matron certainly cannot be classed as an amateur in Indian work. Coming from Alert Bay or somewhere along that treacherous coast, we understand that Miss McCarthy has been many, many moons engaged in teaching, patronizing, and the various other jobs that fall to the lot of the Indian worker. We hope that she likes her new surroundings, in which already she has done good work, particularly in connection with the Girls' Concert recently held in Lytton.\n\nMiss Robson, also, can hardly be classed even as a new comer, for we find out that she was here in days gone by. With many years experience in Indian work, however, we welcome Miss Robson back again, where we know she will stay long with us in her new position that of House Supervisor.\n\nMr. W. Hargriff, the new Junior Room Teacher, is a new-comer to this type of work, but he seems to have already found a firm footing, and the children in his room are getting along well.\n\nThere are several changes in positions on our staff, which we feel might be of interest to our readers:- Mr. W. Rowe, who for three years has presided over the destinies of the Junior Schoolroom, has now taken over the coveted position of Housemaster.\n\nMiss Muir has taken over the duties of the Boys' Matron, where she rules the Kellys, Terry's, and Bakers with kindness, but as becomes such imps of mischief, strictness is also very essential. Miss Robson took over Miss Muir's work in the Dining-room, in addition to her new work.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Lett, and Marjorie have now moved into their new quarters, and the Staff have accordingly moved into the Residence Dining-Room, which gives them more congenial surroundings. (For the house-warming at Mr. and Mrs. Lett's, you are requested to come in parties of four, as accommodation is limited.)\n\nCongratulations are in order to both the Steen's and Demer's families, on the arrival, in each case, of a baby boy. Mr. Demer's newest little boy was baptised the other Sunday, and christened Edwin Carson, Miss Mitchell and Mr Anfield acting as god-parents.\n\nWe wish to announce that after long and patient waiting, the Stamps, with their little girl, have moved into their new house, where we are sure they will be very happy. Practically all the staff cottages have recently been fitted with full plumbing, which will prove a boon to all concerned.\n\nWe are gratified to learn that Mr. Tim has benefited greatly by his short holiday, and trust that he is now fully recovered from his slight indisposition.\n\nThe Members in Occupancy of the \"STACK\", have forwarded to the editor of this magazine, a most moving letter, detailing the fact that while the other cottages are getting full plumbing, they have been left with a four-gallon coal-oil tin. Their letter has been referred to Mr. Stevens for report of the possibilities of installation.\nSchoolroom notes, cont'd.\n\nAll members of St. George's kept Armistice Day with the customary two minutes silence, and in both schoolrooms, special lessons were taught to show the children, many of them hardly understanding what war really is, the true lessons of the Great Struggle for Freedom. In the senior Room, it was decided to hold a competition in the form of a prize essay, the two winners for the Senior Grades being; Peter Antoine, age 18, Spence's Bridge, Grade VII. Eva Tooney, age 14, Grade VI, Ashcroft.\n\nThe two compositions are re-printed herewith.\n\n\"Why we keep Armistice Day\"....Peter Antoine.\n\nArmistice Day is kept throughout the whole Empire and every Canadian should faithfully observe the request of our beloved King to observe the \"Two minutes silence\" in honor of those who went and fought to defend our country, King and Empire.\n\nThis war was the bitterest and most terrific ever known in the whole history of the world, the whole of Europe being at war, namely, Germany, Turkey, Belgium, France, Balkans, Russia, Palestine, Egypt, Italy, East Africa, and a battle was even fought on the southern coast of South America, near the Falkland Islands.\n\nThe human cost of this horrible war was estimated at twenty million soldiers wounded, nine million were killed, three million were taken prisoners, nine million helpless orphans whose parents sacrificed their lives for others, and also five million war widows whose husbands were killed in their effort to save our freedom and Empire. After the war, an epidemic of influenza broke out, caused by the filth of the battlefields, and thirty million civilians died of the dread disease. The calculation of dead during the war was sixteen thousand per day, whilst the material cost of the struggle was $358,000,000,000 or nine million dollars for every hour of the war.\n\nOur Canadian Indians played a great part in that war, in which some five thousand of them went willingly and they proved to be brave and obedient soldiers.\n\nIn the fourth year of the war, the whole world was disgusted with fighting and were now rising for peace, especially Germany who needed it most, for Germany was in utter despair.\n\nThe end of the war came when the Armistice was signed on the morning of November eleventh, 1918, when all signs of fighting ceases and sadness turned into joy.\n\nThe result of the war was that many factories and mills closed down, unemployment was rife, and many were homeless.\n\nIn June, 1919, a Treaty was signed at Versailles, France, and the League of Nations was formed to enforce just dealings and to protect the smaller countries, and to try and prevent wars.\n\nQuite recently, the Locarno Treaty has been signed in which all the nations have promised never to start wars anymore.\n\nOn each Armistice Day, we usually go to Church and there observe the two minutes silence and we should pray for those who are still in agony, for many are still suffering from wounds they received in the war.\n\nOur duty is that we should keep the example of loyalty they set for us, and to be loyal to our King and country, and to keep faith with those who died for us.\n\nThe other composition, under the same title, written by Eva Tooney, is given overpage.\nSchoolroom notice.\n\nWe keep Armistice Day all over the British Empire to remember the first day of peace when the World War ended in 1918.\n\nThere were a lot of countries at war, many of them hardly understanding the reasons for fighting. Among them we find Russia, German, Belgium, Egypt, Austria, France, Turkey, Italy, Africa, Palestine, The British Empire, and the Falklands. In fact, they seemed to be at war all over the Old World.\n\nThe loss of the war was terrible, nine million soldiers being killed, thirteen million dying with a disease called influenza, which was caused by filth and dirt; twenty million soldiers came from the war wounded; nine million orphans who have lost their parents during the war, two million who lost their homes, and five million women who lost their husbands in the terrible war. The money cost of the war was three hundred thirty-eight billions of dollars, which means nine millions of dollars an hour.\n\nEvery country that was at war was desiring peace, and when they got peace, they were so glad that they thought that was the greatest blessing God could bestow upon them.\n\nThe end of the war was a great improvement to the world, and now they are signing a Treaty of Peace in Europe showing that all countries desire to have peace.\n\nFrom the Great War we get Armistice Day, when the first day of peace the World had had since the war began, was celebrated, and on this day we keep the two minutes silence to remember the war. In those two minutes, we keep silent and think of the soldiers that went at the war, and pray for the people that had relations killed, and we hope that God will give protection to the children whose parents were killed in the war.\n\nIt is our duty to those who died for us to consider their brave deeds, and to try and sympathize with and help the ones they left behind them, and we must try and be worthy to carry on where they left off, and if we do try, God will bless us for our efforts.\n\nWe have had two visits from our Inspector this school-year, and we are pleased to say that Mr. Cairns was very satisfied with our work, but that we must keep on trying all the time. To use his own words, \"Education can never stand still.\"\n\nWe wish to thank the Dept. Of Indian Affairs at Ottawa for their kindness in granting us a mimeograph, and to tell them that it certainly fills a long felt want. But for this little machine, we would still be thinking about a school magazine, instead of reading from its pages, for no matter how much we would like a magazine, costs of printing are out of the question.\n\nPictures, or to use the more popular expression, the movies, are running again this year in our school, and with a program every two weeks, the children no sooner get through one show, than they begin counting the days to the next one. The film serving costs but little as we show in the village of Lytton, charging just a nominal sum to make our expenses of giving a free show to the children.\n\nTwo visits from the Dominion Veterinary Inspector gave us the happy assurance that our dairy and range horses are in fine condition, free from all disease to which cattle are heir.\n\"Echoes from the girls' side.\"\n\nWe graduated four girls from St. George's School last term, in the persons of Mamie Mike, Matilda Boston, Ada Angus and Christine Spike, all of whom we were sorry to lose. Matilda Boston has found that life at St. George's was not so bad after all, as since her graduation she has been unfortunate enough to have to stay in hospital, suffering from glandular troubles.\n\nMamie Mike has taken amicably to the dishpan to ease her heart, which we understand was broken at having to leave S.S.S.\n\nChristine Spike has multiplied her troubles since leaving us, by taking unto herself a \"better half.\" We wish her all happiness.\n\nAda Angus, another of our graduates, is helping her sister-in-law with housework.\n\nEllen Sherwood\n\nSeveral new arrivals now grace the girls' side, in the presence of Lavinia Terry, Mary Jane and Minnie McIntyre, Helen Kanaka, Sarah Blatchford, Emily Bob and Emily Spye.\n\nA Freshman's life is one of turmoil and trouble, as can be seen by the following:- On her second morning here, Minnie McIntyre was busy upstairs, when her little sister, Mary Jane, a little cupid, came racing up, loudly crying, \"Where's Minnie? Where's my Minnie?\" She seemingly thought that for a few days, the new comers were carefully deposited in some dark corner.\n\n\"Babe Terry\", her twin cupid, but sometimes known as \"Vinegar\", had a splinter in her finger and whilst it was being removed, suddenly drew her hand away, saying, \"Not you, not you, me go to Mr. Anfield\", and off she fled to the Senior Room.\n\nMargaret McIntyre\n\nFor the past few terms, the beauty and progress of some of our girls have been marred by the presence of enlarged tonsils, but we are pleased to tell you that in October, the skill of Drs. Wilson, Senior and Junior, enabled these horrible lumps to be removed, and now thirteen girls are making rapid progress.\n\nRos\u00e9e Cisco\n\nAll the girls and boys in the Senior Room now keep \"Health Charts\", and they are trying hard to obey all the good health rules on them. Two of the Grade VII pupils managed to make perfect scores for teeth cleaning for two months. Both Mr. Lott, and Mr. Anfield, our Senior Teacher have remarked on how much healthier we are looking.\n\nAdeline Phillips\n\nA very pretty cantata was given by the girls of St. George's Sch. during the latter part of October, featuring Elvira Nowell as \"The Moon Queen\", Bessie Walker as \"The Sun\", Ellen Sherwood and Ros\u00e9e Cisco as \"The Princes\" and \"Princesses\", Margaret McIntyre and Ellen James as \"morning and Evening Stars\", and many others. The whole girls' school provided the choruses. The proceeds which amounted to about forty dollars were used to purchase a gramophone and records for the girls' side.\n\nEva Tooney\n\nThe girls are taking a great interest in their drill and singing\nEchoes from the Girls' Side. (Cont'd).\n\nThe Girls' motto may be summed up in these words, \"Early to bed, early to rise makes us healthy, wealthy and wise, when mixed with plenty of exercise.\" We wish you to take notice through the coming term of the strides of progress that the girls are going to make.\n\n........Gladys Wish...........\n\nThe Lord Bishop of Cariboo, Dr. Walter Adams, who was recently consecrated at Kamloops, paid us his first official visit on Sunday, Dec. 6th. The Bishop took the early service, and preached at the eleven o'clock service, at which there were a large number of Indians, as well as many of the Lytton people. He preached to us about \"Life,\" telling us that it meant \"Love, Innocence, Fear, and Endurance.\" All the children liked the Bishop very much. Mr. Hart told us that he would try and have a Confirmation class the next time the Bishop came to our School.\n\n........Bessie Walker..........\n\nWe had the pleasure of a visit from Mr. Cairns, our School Inspector, the other week, and we are pleased to hear that we received a good report. During the inspection, the girls held their own against the boys, which shows that the girls are working hard at their studies. Like the \"Hare and the Tortoise,\" we believe \"Slow and steady wins the race.\" The girls will win out yet, so you boys, watch out.\n\n........Janet Peters..........\n\nThe weather at Lytton is now quite cold and chilly, but we have not had much snow yet, although we are now in the month of December.\n\n........Mabel Bertrand..........\n\nOur readers will be pleased to learn that the back cover of this little magazine was taken from an original design drawn by one of the girls, Janet Peters, Grade VII.\n\nThe front cover is the work of our Drawing Teacher and Headmaster, Mr. W.S. Rowe, whose hard work has enabled us to win many prizes for art at the Provincial Exhibition during the past two years.\n\n...........\n\nWe would like to ask our readers who receive this edition by mail to send us if the copy does not, as we hope it will, reach them by Christmas. We have been rather rushed in school lately, and have not got down to business quite in time.\n\nBy the way, if you should write to us to tell us that you like our magazine, would you put in a stamp or so for the next edition. We, like all Indian Schools, are poor, and as we are printing one hundred copies, and do not want to make any stated charge, leave it up to our readers. Thank you.\n\"Thunder from the Boys' Side.\"\n\nWe have pictures, or movies, every two weeks, and we are usually very interested in them. Our shows are on Fridays at the school, and the show is then run in Lytton for the people there. Our picture machine is insured against fire and theft.\n\n...........Williamson Walkem...........\n\nThe boys of this school are very interested in sports, and especially the active ones. The following games are played: Baseball. We have played many teams, and have usually been able to beat them. Basketball is the next game that the boys play very much. The boys are very fond of this game which is played in the winter months. Football has been started recently, all the boys from big to little ones taking part in this game which is under the direction of our Junior Teacher Mr. Hargitt. We have also decided to start the game of Rugby. The boys of this school all try to be good sports in their games.\n\n...........Simon Baker...........\n\nWhen Mr. Rowe told us before the holidays that all the good drawings we did would be sent to the Provincial Exhibition at New Westminster, we all tried very hard, and some of the work was very good. This work was sent to New Westminster and we are glad that we won first prizes for what we sent in.\n\n...........John James...........\n\nWe have had five new boys this term. Francis Walkem from Spencer Bridge; Sandy James from Lillooet; Tommy Hewitt from Ashcroft; Joseph Swakam from Merrit; and Benjamin Thomas from the Seven Mile at Lytton.\n\n...........Jimmy Peters...........\n\nMany new buildings have been erected recently. The construction is as follows: A large barn, a pig-pen, and a chicken pen which some of the boys helped to build. Two houses for the farm staff and a house for the Principal and his wife. All the new buildings are situated in good places, lots of water, and water that no cattle can get into and cause disease for those who use the water.\n\n...........Joseph Antoine...........\n\nThe boys have drill twice a week in which they have lots of fun and enjoy themselves. First we go through strenuous exercises, and after drilling we play basketball and other indoor games. Drill is one of the factors of the Health Game, and it strengthens our whole system, and develops our bodies.\n\n...........Peter Antoine...........\n\nPlease address all letters in connection with this magazine to,\n\nP. Earl Anfield,\nSt. George's School,\nLytton, B.C.\nDecember 25, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of \"The Crusader\", a quarterly review of current events at St. George's Residential Indian School, which I shall read with much interest. Please accept my best wishes for yourself and those under your charge for a merry Christmas and every happiness and success in the New Year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nReverend A. R. Lett,\nPrincipal,\nSt. George's Residential Indian School,\nLytton, B. C.\nJanuary 22, 1926.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHonourable Charles Stewart,\n\nIn 1902, the New England Company, of London, England, erected an Indian residential school at Lytton, B.C. It has been maintained by the Department's regular per capita grant, supplemented by New England Company funds. In 1920, the New England Company pointed out that their income was fixed, and, with increased costs of living, their purchasing power had decreased. The Department was asked to assume the financial responsibility. Rather than have the school closed - it is a very important unit in our establishment for Indian education in British Columbia - the Department made a special increase in the per capita grant and leased the institution for a period of 21 years commencing January, 1922. I even suggested to the New England Company that it might be advisable to transfer title to the Dominion Crown as I wanted to secure the institution as a permanent factor in our programme.\n\nThe increased per capita grant and a better management has placed the school's finances in good condition and I am hopeful that in future it can be maintained on the regular per capita grant plus the \u00a31,200 per annum grant, which the New England Company continues to make. By the terms of the lease, the Department allows the New England Company an annual rental of \u00a3400. This amount is not directed to London, but is used for repairs and replacements at the school.\n\nPrior to the leasing of the institution, the Department had made no special grants for capital expenditure; but, during the last few years, approximately $41,000 has been used for mechanical plant, irrigation, farm machinery, live stock and outbuildings. In 1923, a modern barn was erected, and, during the past year, two cottages for the staff have been completed.\n\nThe main building at the school, although but 24 years old, is most unsatisfactory. Its layout is bad; it is of frame construction and is a veritable fire trap. The school is now a popular one and more accommodation should be provided without delay. I consider it false economy to add to the present main building and am of the opinion that our work will suffer if a new, modern institution is not commenced this coming summer.\nI acquainted the New England Company with the situation and asked them if they could assist in the construction of a new school. Their reply was that the terms of their Charter would hardly allow them to spend capital funds for this work and the Company Court formally inquired if the Indian Department would be prepared to buy the property at Lytton so that nothing would interfere with the reconstruction of the School. I asked what consideration would be accepted and the company replied that, although their capital expenditure at the school amounted to approximately \u00a312,900 and the institution stood as an asset at that value in their books, they were prepared to sell all their interest for the sum of \u00a38,000.\n\nThey offered, further, that if the sale is effected, they would continue their grant of \u00a31,200 per annum for current expenses and would add thereto the bulk of the interest derived from the purchase money. The conditions of the lease would, of course, automatically determine. I still consider that the Lytton Indian Residential School fills an important place in our work; and, as the value of the lands alone is roughly estimated at \u00a340,000, I feel the offer of the New England Company should be seriously considered.\n\nIt will be necessary to secure a valuation of the property, and, as it may be possible to find funds in the current Appropriation for Indian Education - the vote for the Cecil Jeffrey School being unexpended - I should be pleased if you would give me the name of a gentleman in the Fraser Valley to whom the commission of appraisal could be given.\n\nThere is an item in the Estimates for the coming fiscal year to provide for a wing of the new main building and I hope that sufficient funds to complete the establishment will be available for the building season of 1927.\n\nDuncan C.

It was established by the New England Company, of London, England, which Company operates under a charter granted by Charles II for the education and evangelization of aborigines. The history of the Company's work in this country is interesting, and it has centred of late years at Lytton and at the Mohawk Institute, Brantford, Ont., established for the Six Nations Indians. The Company found that, owing to the increased cost of living and the increase in taxation, their fixed income failed to meet the charges against it, and the Department took over their two institutions in this country. I need not now refer to the terms upon which we took over the Mohawk Institute. We leased the property at Lytton for twenty-one years at \u00a3400 a year, which amount is annually turned in for improvements at the school.\n\nWhen the Department took over the management, the Lytton school was in an embarrassing financial position. Canon Gould, of the Church of England, was associated with me at that time in the appointment of a highly competent principal, who has been able to restore the financial standing of the institution. The buildings were in a very bad state of repair and, in many respects, wholly unsuitable. The situation has been gradually improved\u2014a barn and other outbuildings having been erected. The main building of the school, however, is most unsatisfactory. It is of frame construction and is so planned and added to that it is not an exaggeration to say that the lives of the staff and children are in constant danger from fire. On the other hand, the farm, comprising 691 acres, is admirably situated and well irrigated and, under proper management, has proven most productive.\n\nLytton is central to Church of England work among British Columbia Indians and I am very desirous of constructing a new main school building. There is provided in the current Estimates an item of $35,000.00, which is sufficient to begin the work.\n\n- The Lytton school\nThe Lytton school is not conducted by the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada, but this Society considers it one of the most important Anglican institutions for Indian work and was pleased to learn that we proposed its early reconstruction.\n\nI acquainted the New England Company with the situation and asked them if they could assist in the construction of a new school. Their reply was discouraging and the Company Court formally inquired if the Indian Department would be prepared to buy the property so that nothing would interfere with the reconstruction of the school. I asked what consideration would be accepted and the Company replied that, although their capital expenditure at the school amounted to approximately \u00a312,500 and the institution stood as an asset at that value in their books, they were prepared to sell all their interest for the sum of \u00a38,000.\n\nThey offered, further, that if the sale is effected, they would continue their grant of \u00a31,200 per annum for current expenses and would add thereto the bulk of the interest derived from the purchase money. I consider that the Lytton Indian Residential School fills an important place in our work; and, as the value of the lands alone is roughly estimated at $40,000, I feel the offer of the New England Company should be accepted.\n\nI wish to recommend that the Company be asked to give us an option on the property for ten years. If we fund their annual grant of nearly $6,000 for seven years, the purchase price would be available without asking Parliament for an appropriation.

Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nP. R. Bush, Esq.,\nCharter Clerk,\nNew England Co.,\n26 Bloomsbury Sq.,\nLondon, W. C. 1,\nEngland.\nThe present time, with Mr. Lett in charge, and likely to remain for some time, seems to be very opportune for negotiations; from what I can gather from dealings elsewhere, the Department may be trusted faithfully to adhere to any agreement they make as to the religious training and atmosphere of the school. They do, I fancy, welcome such supervision by a clergyman, especially when they can have the services of such a practical and delightful superintendent as Mr. Lett is. He has done wonders with the Farm as well as with the education and moral tone of the children. The children are very happy and natural, and among the Indians the School is in good favour.\n\nI ventured to cable so that you would gather that matters were urgent. Needless to say I can assure your Board that the School in the years past has been of great and inestimable value to the Indians and to the Community, and its usefulness would be increased if more modern buildings are erected. I hope your Board will be able to arrange with the Indian Department the transfer under such a charter as will preserve the very happy relations which have previously existed between the School and the Bishop and Diocese.\n\nIf I can help in any way, please call on me.\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nWALTER CARIBOO,\nBishop of Cariboo.\nNEW ENGLAND COMPANY.\n\nCORRESPONDENCE FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COURT\nON WEDNESDAY, 10TH, FEBRUARY, 1926.\n\n1. Letter from the Bishop of Cariboo to the Clerk.\n\nNovember 23rd., 1925.\n\nDear Mr. Bush,\n\nAs I promised, I have been to the Lytton School and find there that the buildings are in a truly sorry condition. I have also seen the Inspector (Col. Fragnell) who tells me that he condemned the buildings a year or two back and has been constantly pressing on the Department at Ottawa for action.\n\nHe feels that Mr. Lett is doing splendidly and is worthy of all encouragement.\n\nThe particular points on which the school buildings are unsatisfactory are:\n\n(1) Wholly inadequate water supply - for the last two winters water for domestic purposes has had to be hauled in barrels to the School and there is no pressure, except in the spring, to cope with any outbreak of fire.\n\n(2) The sanitary and lavatory conditions are very poor not to say unhealthy.\n\n(3) The lower part of the boys' part of the building is in very bad repair - and their playroom is gloomy and the floor rotten.\n\n(4) The wooden part of the boys' building is very much perished by exposure; doors and windows are now badly fitting, so much so that in the winter when the usual cold snap comes even the school classrooms are intensely cold and work has to be abandoned.\n\nAll this I saw with my own eyes and was amazed at the wholly unsatisfactory condition, taken as a whole, of the School. Especially the boys part. Those who have seen the place feel that it is little short of a scandal that such a number of children should be so housed.\n\nI understand that the Indian Department want to remedy things at once, but are held back somewhat by the Treasury and expense.\n\nA vote was passed in 1925 for the purchase of the property from yourselves. Now, possibly owing to difficulties arising from the recent elections, the Department asked Mr. Lett if he would wait another year. Col. Fragnell feels, however, that this ought to be resisted, and pressure brought to bear with the government to make them go straight ahead with the rebuilding.\n26. Bloomsbury Square,\nLondon, W.C.1.\n\n11th February 1926\n\nDuncan Scott Esq., D.Litt.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Doctor Scott,\n\nI have been asked by the Court of the Company to forward to you a copy of a letter received by us from the Bishop of Caribou.\n\nIn view of the facts as stated in that letter I write to ask you whether there is any possibility of an early reply from you with regard to the purchase of St George's School property by the Government.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGovernor\n\nThe New England Company.\nOttawa, March 26, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Mathews:\n\nI have delayed answering your letter of October 22nd, last, until I had explored all the possibilities in connection with the situation at Lytton. I wish to acknowledge also your letter of the 11th ultimo, enclosing a copy of a communication from His Lordship the Bishop of Cariboo.\n\nThere is no doubt about the extreme desirability of undertaking a building programme without delay and I am hopeful that Parliament during the present session will appropriate sufficient to commence the work. I have only recently learned that it will be impossible to secure in the immediate future funds for the purchase of the New England Company's interest in the property. I trust, however, that funds for the purchase can be found within the next few years and I should be grateful if you would consent to give the Department a ten year option. Such an instrument would enable us to proceed with the new building, for without title, or prospective title, it would not be possible to undertake valuable permanent improvements.\n\nBefore formally presenting this proposition to the Company, I wish to secure a valuation of the property by an independent, competent appraiser, and as soon as possible I shall again communicate with you.\n\nAs you have stated, when the transfer is complete, the conditions of the lease will automatically determine. I am also glad to learn that the New England Company would be willing to assist the Department by continuing its grants for the religious side of the work. I am even hopeful that you would do as was suggested in your letter of March 20th, i.e., add to your grants the bulk of the interest derived from the purchase money.\n\nI am writing this interim letter so that you will know my plans and will be prepared for developments.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, April 16, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Mathews:\n\nWith further reference to my letter of the 13th instant, concerning the Lytton Indian Residential School, I wish to explain that it was with considerable regret that I dropped the item for the purchase of the property. I had received explicit direction from the Government to limit my requests for this year's appropriation. I am now obtaining a valuation and I have no doubt that the appraiser's finding will be such that we shall be able to satisfy the price of \u00a38000, which you have placed on the New England Company's interest.\n\nAlthough I was compelled to limit my appropriation for this school, I succeeded in obtaining a sufficient amount to begin building operations, the absolute necessity of which has been again brought to our attention by His Lordship the Bishop of Cariboo. It would not be permissible to spend a large amount of public money on a site, title to which is not in the Crown; but the suggested option would enable the Department to begin construction early this season.\n\nThat you may have a clear idea of our intention with reference to the future of this institution, I have pleasure in enclosing photographs showing the front and side elevations of the main building of an Indian residential school, which the Department has lately established, near Cardston, Alta., for the Church of England Missionary Society in Canada. This is the type of school that will be erected at Lytton. There will be some changes, of course, to meet the local requirements. To construct and furnish a building of this type and to provide suitable outbuildings and equipment will cost approximately $150,000.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nErnest Mathews, Esq.,\nGovernor, New England Company,\n26 Bloomsbury Sq.,\nLondon, W.C. 1,\nEngland.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6462, file 888-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n26th April 1926\n\nDuncan Scott Esq: D.Lytt.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Doctor Scott,\n\nI have to acknowledge with many thanks receipt of your letter dated 13th April.\n\nI will bring this before the next meeting of the Court of the Company on the 16th June.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nGovernor\nThe New England Company.\nMr. Ferrier,\n\nWhen the property for the Lytton residential school is to be valued, the valuation is to be made by Mr. Frank B.

As you know I am much interested in the development of this school. We have a most excellent Principal.\n\nI have given attention to the preservation of the chapel. It would be impossible to move it; and I think we should leave it where it is, repair it if necessary, and keep it in good order and condition.

Thanks.\n\nAnd so we come to the end of another school year, for by the time many of our readers receive their copy of the Crusader, the school will be silent for the \"Long Vacation\", looked forward to by one and all. The children will all have gone to their homes, which are more or less scattered from Vancouver to Kamloops, all anxious to make every minute of that precious six weeks last a year. They are our only advertisement, for what the children are, so is the School, and it is indeed our wish and prayer that they will one and all reflect credit on St. George's School; that their parents will see with pride some progress over the last arrival home, both physical and mental and moral, that other parents with children not yet in school, will look on them that who wish to send their children to school as well, will be the aftermath of association with any or each of our own scholars.\n\nThis year has gone, and although we have, during its passing, been visited with much to try us, in the form of epidemic sickness, we hope that the very trial has been as a spur, to urge one and all to greater endeavours, to realise, that although much time was lost, yet a mightier effort could make much of it up. In spite of the sickness, we have much to be thankful for, and we are indeed grateful for the many pleasant times that have been ours in this past twelve months, and especially so to those who helped to make them possible.\n\nTo those, who with the end of the school year pass on to new endeavours, whether they be children of the school, new graduates, or members of the staff, we can only say one thing. May all that is well and good go with you into your new life, whatever it be, and may the lessons learned at St. George's long remain with you. We wish you all success, and in the case of the graduates, hope and pray that the memory of the days spent at this school may remain with you as a very bright beam of light among many such that we hope will shine on your life in the days that lie before.\n\nFor a more detailed account of some of the outstanding events of the year, for a message from our Principal, for a glimpse at our staff, for glimpses into the children's work, we beseech you turn the pages, and trust that therein you will find much to interest and please you.\n\nEditor.\nPage 2\n\nEducation of Indian children in the St. George's School, and its relation to the institution and the child's relation to the future life in the community.\n\nBy Rev. A.F. Lott, Principal.\n\n\"It is not my privilege in a small school magazine to deal with this subject in detail but in a cursory manner, I trust, give our readers some idea of our purpose and aim.\n\nThe child's education is liberal and scientific. It is our aim in so far as possible to fit the child for post-school days, taking into consideration his surroundings and environment together with relations to others.\n\nBy a study of the Indian home life, with its primitive and listless methods, lack of family discipline, slight knowledge of physical care, lack of thrift and consciousness of what the morrow may have in store; naturally calls for an all-round preparation and knowledge of the essentials of home and family life. To cover the above needs each department gives the child an opportunity to acquire not only a knowledge, but form habits which will to a large degree at least in a great many cases lead to a change, from the primitive life, to the modern ordinary civilized methods of living.\n\nTo carry out this aim our schoolrooms are equipped with the latest and most up-to-date necessities in enabling the teacher to give every attention to the academic training of the child, equal to any public school in the province. This not only gives the child from the part of the school a fair standing with every child, and also from the child's outlook a feeling of equality and consequent fearlessness.\n\nFrom the schoolroom we turn to the separate departments wherein is given the practical scientific training demonstrating if possible, the academic work of the schoolroom. The girls receiving instruction in domestic science, sewing, laundry, and music and needlework, i.e., darning, knitting, and crochet-work. The boy receiving a general training in carpentry, blacksmithing, shoe-repairing, harness repairing, and a scientific training in agriculture in every department covering crops and growth of field crops, animal husbandry, horticulture, poultry, etc.\n\nThe agricultural curriculum included throughout calls for a staff efficient in individual departments, and also a knowledge of health, welfare, and mental study. Psychology is a necessity in order that the best may be drawn out of the individual child. We realise the outstanding fact that a child's character may be made or broken during this critical period of mental development. A very close study of each child is stressed as a very important factor. Children being imitators, carefulness, watchfulness, on the part of the staff must be constant and exacting, remembering always that the tremendous responsibility of the care in bringing up young lives, no setback must be fostered, prejudices must be cast aside; quality recognition, and every opportunity must be given to a graduate of an Indian residential School in the needed sustenance of uplift which he or she has been so carefully taught through school life.\n\nA study of the home as we have seen is essential to the training of the Indian child. The general advance of the Indians to the modern civilization has been rapid and great care must be taken to enable the child to become his own judge in accepting on the one hand, the higher ideals, and on the other, to reject that which might tend to retard and degenerate his training.\n\nApplication of the child's scientific training is in a great majority of cases, and impossibility. When he graduates, he returns...\"\nto the reserve to settle on his little ranch, but finds that when his mind would work, his hands are tied because of lack of initial pecuniary assistance to equip his ranch with those things with which he has been taught to work. This difficulty should be looked into by those in authority and a larger opening made for this condition.\n\nWe have also to say that the Indian child has in his white brother a handicap in the fact that that confidence which the child has learned to partake of during his school days is not a strong as it might be. We therefore would ask that in conclusion, our readers will think of those who are giving their life for the uplift and advance of the aborigines of our land, and even a word of encouragement, or an act of kindness to those who have been our care, would be some reward for our energies and prayers.\n\nWe would ask, in conclusion for everyone \"not to think of his own things only, but in also of the things of others.\"\n\nSchool notes. (An essay written by a pupil of only two years attendance)\n\n\"Our Flag\".\n\nThe flag of our nation is made of three parts. One is St. George's Red Cross with a white background, the second one is St. Andrew's Cross a white cross with a blue background, and the third one is St. Patrick's Cross, a red diagonal cross with a white background. Long ago, the flag of England was only the Red Cross with a white background, then Scotland joined with England, when they had the red cross with the white cross with the blue background together for a while. Afterwards Ireland also joined with them, thus the three countries joined together with their flags to make one flag, with the three crosses. The colours of the Union Jack are Red, for bravery, white for purity, and blue for loyalty.\n\nJames Raymond.\n\nSense for cents.\n\nOne evening, our Principal was strolling through the Boys' basement, when he detected Henry Spinks, a humorous little individual, playing with the boys' towels. The Principal looked strongly at him, and said \"Well, young fellow, what do you think you're doing?\" \"Where do you keep your sense?\" He thought a moment and replied, \"In my pocket, sir.\" \"How much?\" \"Two cents, sir\". The Principal laughed, and left him.\n\nSimon Baker.\n\nExhibition work.\n\nThe children are industriously preparing for the coming Exhibition at Vancouver and New Westminster. The exhibit we are sending consists of paintings, drawing and needle-work. We are competing against many other schools. This year we are sending it to Vancouver and New Westminster Exhibitions, and we hope to capture the first prize for the third time. The money that was won last year was well spent, for we bought a \"Health-O-Meter\" Scale, for the purpose of keeping a record of the children's ever increasing weight.\n\nPeter Antoine.\nThe following are compositions written by pupils of the Senior Grades as prize compositions in connection with special weeks or seasons, such as \"Save the Forest Week\", and the Bounty Season on Crows, etc.\n\n\"Our Forests\"........Kenneth Walkem, Age 16, Grade VIII.\n\n\"The four principal trees of British Columbia are the Douglas Fir, Red Cedar, Western Hemlock, and Western Spruce.\n\nThe estimated amount of lumber in British Columbia is over 700,000,000 feet, board measure.\n\nWe are told that the last great stand of timber trees in the world are in British Columbia, and that is because all the other trees have been either burned, used up for lumber, or attacked by some disease.\n\nThe Douglas Fir is over one hundred fifty feet in height, and from four to eight feet in diameter; the Red Cedar is about one hundred fifty feet high, and four to nine feet in diameter; the Western Hemlock is about a hundred feet in height, three to six feet in diameter, and the Western Spruce is about one hundred fifty feet high and has a diameter of three to six feet.\n\nThe Red Cedar is light, red, and will not shrink or expand when dry or wet. The Hemlock is pitchless, strong, white in color, and light. The Spruce is light, while the Douglas Fir is a very tough and heavy wood.\"\n\n\"Our Duty to Our Forests\".......Kenneth Walkem.\n\n\"Last year, in 1925, there was reported a total loss of over two million dollars by fire, and all this occurred in 2,521 fires.\n\nDo you think we could decrease this amount? Yes, we could, but we must remember that this has been going on for fifty years.\n\nIf we let our forests burn, we will have no more timber to build our new schools and houses, and where will the poor children live. We MUST save the forests.\n\nDon't let there be only one \"Save the Forest Week\" in a year. Let all the fifty-two be forest weeks.\n\nIt costs money to put fires out, but if people will take more care, there will be more money saved.\n\nForests give a living to millions. We must save our forests.\"\n\n\"The Crow, an Asset or Liability\"......Janet Peters, age 17, Grade VIII.\n\n\"The Crows are birds that like to live where human habitation is, and are seldom found in barren lands.\n\nIn British Columbia, there are two kinds of crow to be found, the American and Coast Crow.\n\nThe American Crow is the most destructive of the two, as it lives farther from the coast, where the land is not densely covered with thickets, and so has more chance of getting at bird-nests; while the coast crow is less harmful.\n\nEvery year during the three months of spring is when they are the most bothersome. They destroy the birds' nests, eat their eggs, and young, none of which would be of great value as game and insectivorous birds. The marsh-nesting birds, such as grouse and pheasant are more easily destroyed as they are the most helpless.\n\nAlthough the crow is so destructive, they do a little good.\"\n\"The Humble Crow\"...........Peter Antoine, age 16, Grade VII.\n\n\"There is much talk about the crow these days, and people are debating whether the crow is useful or destructive. The Provincial Government has put a bounty on the crow in the hope of reducing them in numbers. They have increased in number greatly and are a menace to our useful birds.\n\nThere are two species of crow in B.C., the Coast Crow, a less destructive creature, and the American Crow, the brainiest of all birds, and very cunning in his ways, and has the reputation of a robber. In the nesting season of the birds, the crows devour young insectivorous birds, and destroy the eggs. In this way the crow is very destructive as the birds he kills, would have done ten times as much good as he would.\n\nIt seems that the only enemy of the crow is man, and the crow is very wise to man's ways. It would take a good hunter to get at them nowadays, but man takes advantage of them in the nesting season, as it is the only opportunity that man has. It seems very cruel to attack them at this time, but he is compelled to do so, in order to check their increasing numbers.\n\nThe crow is a friend in some countries and an enemy in others, and I do not know if we should condemn this creature entirely, as he is useful to a certain extent, but not enough to balance his wickedness, and therefore I think that man is only right to declare war upon this cunning black outlaw, because he preys upon many insectivorous birds that are beneficial to farmers.\"\n\n\"The Hawks\"...............Adeline Phillips, age 16, Grade VII.\n\n\"There are eleven kinds of hawks, some are destructive and some are useful.\n\nThe destructive ones are the Cooper's Hawk, Hoshawk, Pigeon Hawk, Sharp-shinned Hawk, Hen Hawk and Duck Hawk. They should all be destroyed. The useful hawks that should not be destroyed are the Red-shouldered hawks, Red-Tailed Hawks, Marsh Hawks, Sparrow Hawks, Fish Hawks and Night Hawks. The Red-Tailed and Red-Shouldered Hawks are the biggest and yet more useful than other hawks. You may wonder why I say the Fish Hawk is useful, but it is because the fish hawks eat the dead fishes that got swept ashore by the tides.\n\nThe destructive hawks that were mentioned in the second paragraph eat the smaller birds that really do more good to the plants, than the destructive hawks, which also kill the chickens, ducks, and other barnyard species.\n\nThe useful hawks eat insects, worms, and other little harmful bugs that do nothing but destroy the crops which are so valuable to the farmer.\n\nSome hawks should be all destroyed for they are of no value to farmers, while others should be left alone to increase in number.\"\n\n\"The Crow\"........Joseph Antoine, age 15, Grade VII.\n\n\"The Crow is a carnivorous bird and will carry away any carcasses that he finds. He is very destructive because he steals the birds' eggs, and even kills the valuable birds around the farm, which are the farmers' friends, and even attacks the game birds.\"\nsuch as grouse, pheasants, ducks, etc. The grouse is not destructive because he could kill more grasshoppers and insects in one day than a crow could in a week.\n\nThe Crow is useful for two months only, July and August, but when the grain ripens, he eats more than what he is worth.\n\nThe Crow is very cunning and follows man, and the only enemy is himself mankind.\n\nIt is said that if there are less crows, there will be more game and song birds, and the farmers will not have such a heavy loss.\n\nCrows are regular pests pretty nearly all the year around, excepting July and August.\"\n\nSchool Notes, supplied by the pupils.\n\nEMPIRE DAY.\n\nEmpire Day is a special set apart to commemorate the birthday of our most beloved Queen, Victoria. On this day, a lot of people came to our school, as they usually do, to see the athletic sports. There were various kinds of races in which many children took part. Everybody was happy and it was quite an enjoyable day despite the fact that the weather was not very pleasant.\n\nPeter Antoine.\n\nSchool Bazaar.\n\nThe Girls held a bazaar on the 24th of May, with the view of starting an organ fund. We are sorry to state that it proved unsuccessful because everybody thought of candy and ice-cream and ignored our little bazaar. We made only $10.30, which we handed in to our Principal, Mr. Latt, for the organ fund.\n\nRosie Cisco.\n\nDISCHARGES.\n\nThere are not many pupils leaving this term, in fact, I believe there is only one, his name being Peter Antoine. This month he writes his Entrance examination, and we hope he is successful, and also in his undertakings when he leaves school.\n\nEllen Sherwood.\n\nEMPIRE DAY.\n\nOn the 24th of May, as you all know, we keep Empire Day or Queen Victoria's birthday. She was a very good Queen, and that is why we remember that day. We celebrate with sports and games, and try to enjoy ourselves as if she was still the Queen. We finish our day with a picture show.\n\nGladys Vash.\nSchool news.\n\nQuite one of the most eventful incidents of our school year was the visit of our Bishop, the Rt. Rev. Walter Adams, M.A., D.D., Lord Bishop of Cariboo, for the purpose of conferring the rite of Confirmation on one of the largest classes ever assembled at this school. The evening of April 22nd, the eve of our patronal festival of St. George, will be long remembered by many, especially the following, who that night, quite willingly and gladly, took on their own behalf, the fuller duties of the Christian Life; Elizabeth Walker, Margaret McNally, Mary Murray, Jane Brizman, Rosa Thom, Elvira Newall, Alice Clark, Eliza Edwards, Julia Marshall, Gladys Wish, Willie Smith, Norman Dunstan, Kenneth Walker, Joseph Antoine, John Brizman, Allan Pizzey, Samuel Henry, Tom George, as well as eight adult members of the white community outside of the school.\n\nA beautifully decorated chapel formed a beautiful setting as the Bishop, vested in full robes and mitre, exhorted the candidates in the new duties that they were about to take upon themselves; then, with the words of the \"Veni, Creator Spiritus\" still in their hearts and minds, each candidate came forward for the \"laying on of hands.\" The Bishop met each of the candidates after the service, and in honour of the great event, asked the Principal for a special half-holiday for all the children of the school, which request, needless to say received the unanimous applause of all the children, who hang in this manner to extend their thanks to Bishop Adams for his kindness.\n\n---\n\nIt was on January 23rd, that the first signs of impending sickness broke out in the school, and in two weeks time the place was under quarantine for small-pox. About twenty-five of the youngsters were down with the dread plague, but we are indeed thankful and happy to say that it was of a mild type, and that thanks to the close care of Dr. Wilson, the school physician, all the children got over it well, and are now fully recovered. Two of the children developed scarlet-fever and were isolated for a while, but are fine again now. We sure do not want to have any more of that kind of trouble in St. George's.\n\n---\n\nA campaign for better health was instituted among the children in the school-rooms at the start of the school year, with emphasis on the increased use and value of milk, butter and eggs, and to show that the results were at least worth while, we quote the following gains in weight for the school-children, whose number has averaged 95:\n\nFor the half school-year, ending February 28th, 1926.\n\n| Senior Room | Girls |\n|-------------|-------|\n| Boys........| 138\u00bd lbs. |\n| Girls........| 214 lbs. |\n\n| Junior Room | Girls |\n|-------------|-------|\n| Boys........| 187\u00bd lbs. |\n| Girls........| 204\u00bd lbs. |\n\nTotal boys....| 326 lbs. |\nTotal girls....| 418\u00bd lbs. |\n\nTotal gain in weight for the school..........................| 714 lbs. |\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6462, file 888-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSchool Notes (Cont'd).\n\nThe difference in gain between the girls and boys, although the girls are fewer in number than the boys, may be accounted for, not so much by increased interest in the drinking of milk, but by the fact that they were more seriously underweight than the boys who spend more time in outdoor occupations. The children are very pleased with their record increase and are all out to make it even greater in the half-year that this issue brings to a close. The number of children now underweight according to the American Child Health Association Scale is now negligible, and these children are receiving special attention.\n\nOur school uses on an average of 100 quarts of milk a day, all produced from a herd of Toasted Holsteins, many of whom are pure-bred; the whole herd being quartered in a first class barn, all cattle therein being tested regularly for T.B.\n\nIt is also interesting to those interested in feeding children, that this increase of 745 lbs. cost the school exactly $2.23 to obtain, as the cost of milk, butter, and eggs for the half-year amounted to just $1700. But that it is well worth it is clearly shown in the happy faces, increased interest in study, and healthy dispositions of the children.\n\n---\n\nIt is not often possible for the children to be entertained by outside people, on account of the distance of Lytton from the city; but we cannot let this issue appear without extending our sincere thanks and appreciation to Miss Lillian Hovay of Sheffield, England, who as the guests of Mr. and Mrs. Graham, came to the School in May, and gave an entertainment that will long be remembered by all who were privileged to attend, and we all hope that Miss Hovay will come again.\n\n---\n\nWe are now living in hopes of the new school being started this year. The plans are completed and the surveyor has been to look over the proposed site, which is situated on the farm near the new barn. Nearly a mile from the present school, the new building will overlook the Fraser River, giving a far better location to the building than the one we are in at present. The picture on the back of this issue shows the present building which is now twenty four years of age, and is in need of immediate replacement. Just what is to be done about moving the beautiful old church which the spiritual life of the school revolves, is not yet decided, but we hope that it will be possible to move it down, as it is one of the finest church buildings in the interior of the Province.\n\n---\n\nWe wish to extend our thanks to the various kind friends and well-wishers who wrote to us regarding our first issue. It is nice to find that our efforts to tell just what is going on here are appreciated and we hope that this issue will please all who read it.\nSchool notes, (Cont'd).\n\nCRIMINAL PRIZE LIST.\n\nThe Senior Teacher awarded the following prizes to the pupils who headed their classes at the Xmas exams. Grade III, Peter Antoine; Grade VII, Adeline Phillips; Grade VI, Hazel Phillips; and Grade IV, Mary Clarke. Two special prizes were awarded to Joseph Antoine and Elizabeth Walker for special proficiency in spelling.\n\nJenny Peters.\n\nNote: It might be interesting to know that the last two mentioned scholars have each written weekly spelling tests amounting in all to 2000 words, without a single error, and their spelling books are to be exhibited in the Exhibition. Editor.\n\nST. GEORGE'S DAY PICNIC.\n\nWe had a picnic on St. George's Day, when the senior boys went to Stryne Creek. The boys ran to the ferry, and then had a long walk to Stryne, where they had lunch. After that the boys went away in parties, so as taking pictures of the scenes at Stryne Creek, and some walked up the river, but everyone had a good time.\n\nWilliamson Walken.\n\nCROWNING OF THE MAY QUEEN.\n\nAll the girls were invited to a May Day party, and we had to elect a May Queen. After the election of Margaret McIntyre as Queen, she was crowned. Everybody was thankful for the good time they had had.\n\nAdeline Phillips.\n\nVISIT OF MRS. HERRICK.\n\nA Sunday School Teacher from Victoria came to visit us, whose name was Mrs. Herrick. She had a little talk with us on Sunday, and she has now come back to her school in Victoria to teach her pupils.\n\nEthel Bertrand.\n\nSPECIAL CONCERT.\n\nNot long ago we had a very interesting visit from a lady whose name was Miss Hovey. She, accompanied by her brother, were taking an educational tour of the world.\n\nShe was a highly accomplished lady, a splendid pianist and singer. During the evening she sang many interesting songs and told us about her travels, and also recited various pieces. A very pleasant evening was had by all.\n\nMargaret McIntyre.\n\nEMPIRE DAY CONCERT.\n\nOn the evening of Empire Day, we had a picture show called \"The Cub\", and it was very successful. The \"Cub\", who was a man, asked for a taxicab and they brought him a donkey, and of course he put\nPage 10.\n\nall his baggage on, an' then got on hi self. Just as he was about to approach the house he was going to, the donkey stopped and wouldn't go another step, so he just got off and left the donkey with his baggage and went into the house, and there he asked for the bath, and the man showed him the duck pond, but some ducklings were in swimming before him. In the last reel of the picture, he saved a girl and her father from a terrible disaster.\n\nEva Tooney.\n\nSPORTS DAY RESULTS\n\nWe celebrated Empire Day on the twenty-fourth of May. The sports started out at half past one. The first race for the girls was the seventy-five yard dash, which was won by Janis Adams. The girls' novelty race was won by Winnie McIntyre. Carrie Kelly won the leadle race. Janet Peters and Margaret McIntyre won the three-legged race, Sally Job won the 30 yard dash for Juniors, Ethel Bertrand and Lessie Baker won the three-legged race, and Lessie Walker won the fifty yard dash. There were lots of races for the boys, which will be written about by one of the boys. We all had a happy time, and had lots of ice-cream and candy to eat. The day ended with a picture show which was very nice.\n\nLessie Walker.\n\nBASEBALL GAMES\n\nOn Empire Day, May 24th, the St. George's School \"Wizards\" took on the Lytton Indians to the tune of 13-12. Unnumbered people watched the game while the team struggled for the championship. The game was called on account of darkness.\n\nOther games have been played by the \"Wizards\" with the Lytton Indians and \"Whites.\" The second game of the season was played against the Lytton Indians and the score was 16-16. In the third game, the Lytton \"Whites\" defeated the Wizards 14-5, but in the fourth game, the Wizards once more scalped the Lytton Indians 19-11.\n\nThe Wizards are quite willing to play any champion team that comes to try and stop them. All the members of the team have played well, only once having come down to defeat, when their star pitcher, \"Simp\" Baker was unwell. The games were all arranged by the Principal, Mr. Lett. The team is as follows:\n\nCatcher...........Peter Antoine\nPitcher...........Tony Bertrand\n1st.-base.........Joe Grey\n2nd.-base.........Joseph Antoine\n3rd.-base.........Sam Henry\nShort Stop........Raymond Thos.\nR.Field..........Ernan Dunstan\nC.Field..........Jim Raymond\nL.Field..........Simon Baker.\n\nRespectfully submitted by the \"Third Jumper of the Wizards\".\n\nSam \"BOSS\" Henry.\n\n\"Long may they bewitch their enemies.\"\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6462, file 833-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nPage II.\n\nOdds and ends.\n\nAscension Day Trip.\n\nOn Ascension Day some of the staff and the girls took a trip up to Botanica Lake, which is about twelve miles from the school, and had a picnic there. Twenty of the senior girls had to walk a part of the way, going up whilst the rest rode. We got there about noon, and ate our lunch, then we went around the lake picking wild flowers, and visited the lake. Then after having a most enjoyable time, everybody started again.\n\nJanet Peters.\n\nPretty Green.\n\nThe farmer had just married a girl from the city. As he came into the house one day, she exclaimed, \"Oh, John, I found two ducks' eggs, among the dozen you brought in this morning.\" \"Ducks' eggs,\" said John, \"How do you know they were ducks' eggs?\" \"Why,\" answered his wife, \"I put them in the water and two of them floated.\"\n\nBoys' Sports Results, Empire Day.\n\nSenior 100 yard dash...

We hope to carry off the first prizes again, as we did last year, but we will have to work hard, as we are competing against several very good schools.\n\nCharles James.\nNo Change\n\n\"I don't Like this film.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"It reminds me too much of my boarding house.\"\n\"How's that?\"\n\"Five years are supposed to elapse between the first and second parts, and they don't even change the table cloth.\"\n\nDan. Baker.\n\nSchool Inspector's Visit.\n\nWe had a visit from our School Inspector, Mr. Cairns, quite recently, and he was pleased with our work. He told us that he was glad to see the children all in good health.\n\nJoseph Antoine.\n\nBoys Picnic to Strygne Creek.\n\nAscension Day, being a school holiday, all the Senior boys were going to take a trip to Strygne Creek. There was an early service in chapel that morning at 7:30 a.m., and then having had breakfast, and got the lunches ready, we started off for the ferry. Across the river, the boys headed off for the creek. On reaching there, we had our lunch, and then we went up the creek and fished until it was time to come back again, but no one was successful in catching any fish.\n\nJohn James.\n\n\"Mother, are there any men in heaven?\"\n\"Certainly\"\n\"But I never see any pictures of angels with whiskers\"\n\"No, my son,\" replied the mother, \"Men get in with a close shave.\"\n\nBenny Wells.\n\n---\n\nIn closing our little magazine, I would like to put in a very wonderful piece of poetry that just seems to express something that we would like to put across to the children. Mr. Buckpitt, our Junior Teacher, passed it along with this introduction:\n\n\"Poems convey the thoughts so expressively that I hunted the little poem that a beautiful day-dream that need not be broken. The man who wrote it was once traveling along a hot dusty road in the late afternoon. He came to a cool arbour, and immediately upon a table were fresh food and milk. He found that the old couple who lived in the farm house behind the arbour thought it their duty to cheer weary travellers who passed that way. This is the poem he wrote, and we put it on the next page in its entirety, and trust that some of the children will think it beautiful enough to memorise.\"\nPage 13.\n\n\"Friendship\".\n\nThere are hermit souls that live withdrawn\nIn the place of their self content.\nThere are souls like stars that dwell apart\nIn a fellowless firmament.\nThere are pioneer souls that blaze the paths\nWhere highways never ran.\nBut let me live in a house by the side of the road\nAnd be a friend of man.\n\nLet me live in the house by the side of the road\nWhere the race of men go by.\nThe man who are good, the man who are bad,\nAs good as bad as I.\nI would not sit in the scorner's seat\nNor hurl the cynic's ban.\nLet me live in the house by the side of the road,\nAnd be a friend to man.\n\nI see from my house by the side of the road-\nBy the side of the pathway of life\nThe man who press with the ardour of hope\nThe man who are faint with the strife.\nBut I turn not away from their smiles and their tears,\nBoth part of an infinite plan.\nLet me live in the house by the side of the road,\nAnd be a friend to man.\n\nI know there are gladdened meadows ahead\nAnd mountains of wearisome height,\nThat the road runs on through the long afternoon\nAnd stretches ahead into night.\nBut still I rejoice, when the travellers rejoice,\nAnd step with the strangers that mean,\nBut let me live in my house by the side of the road,\nLike a man who dwells alone.\n\nLet me live in the house by the side of the road.\nWhere the race of men go by.\nThey are good; they are bad; they are weak; they are strong;\nWise- foolish- as I am.\nThen why should I sit in the scorner's seat,\nOr hurl the cynic's ban?\nLet me live in my house by the side of the road\nAnd be a friend to man.\nOttawa, June 25, 1926.\n\nErnest Mathews,\n26 Bloomsbury Square,\nLondon, England.\n\nAm anxious commence Lytton school\nWill company grant option.\n\nDuncan C.

A. R. Lett\nBankers: Bank of Montreal, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nLyttelton, B.C., Nov 29th/26\n\nMr. D. C. Scott,\nDept. Sup. Of Indian Affairs\nOttawa,\n\nDear Mr. Scott\u2014\n\nI am anxious to know whether the Dept. intends to proceed with the erection of more than one unit of the new school, as a great deal hinges on this possibility of my being able to get turned this coming year.\n\nI have lately had a delegation of my outside staff asking if I had thought of any arrangement for the education of their children. I have on the staff four married men with families ranging in number from one to three; four of these children together with my own child are of school age and it is natural that we should become anxious.\n\nI have for the coming winter arranged a program whereby I intend sending two of the outside staff to the University for courses on Breeding of cattle and hogs and Poultry raising. Both men approached me concerning the possibility of their continuance on the staff, owing to the above coming difficulty stating that they did not think it would be fair to the school to accept this training and perhaps in six months have to resign their positions. I of course from a business point of view could not provide this course unless a guarantee of continued service could be given. Both men are agreed to give this service provided I am in a position to provide means for the lower school education of their children. Both are good men and are good for years in the school. They have gone so far as to say that they are willing to spend their share in paying a teacher if some provision for a school room could be made.\n\nIt has been my object to make provision for these children as well as my own in the New School which could easily be done with the two units of the school built and the Principal's residence attached.\n\nYou may perhaps think there is no necessity for scientific training of outside staff but in order to compete with the scientific advance of agriculture and to run the farm and make it a financial success it is a necessity besides we are training boys to go out on ranches on the several reserves and they should be trained to make success of the work. This can only be accomplished by having a touch of scientific training during their school days.\n\nI am interested in the work here and feel I can make a success but wider scope must be given else the School is bound to come to a standstill and I am sure this is not what the Dept. wishes any more than I do myself.\n\nI have written re the status of our Dairy herd and it is essential that I should take every care in the development of the herd as it is now, and will in the future become more and more a great financial source but without an efficient herdman.\nit cannot go forward as it should. There must be individual responsibility and interest. This Mr. Tims gives and his departure at the present time would be sadly detrimental.\n\nWhile Mr. Stemp is not in immediate need of education for his child it will not be long ere he too will have to vacate his position for the same purpose.\n\nThe Farm Manager and The Handy Man are now approaching the same difficulty to say nothing of my own little girl who could readily be sent to school after next midsommer vacation, and for whom I shall have to make provision.\n\nIt is needless for me to go into other details concerning the immediate attention of getting into new quarters as these you have had and know the difficulties surrounding the work here. I can truly say that we would be much happier in our work and administration if we could expect to be rehoused in; or during the coming year.\n\nI hesitate somewhat in presenting these things to you as you have many demands but one cannot allow them to remain in obeisance when confronted with them.\n\nTrusting to receive a favorable reply which will allow the needed assurance to the men and will also comply with my present plans in making provision for more scientific training for the boys. With this training the men could make the work on the farm more interesting in the way of judging, maximum production, and study of soils, filling a gap in the necessary education of the boys.\n\nYours very obediently\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nXMAS NUMBER.\n1926.\n\nThe CRUSADER\n\nA Quarterly Review of Current Events in St George's Residential Indian School\n\nLYTTON B.C.\nTHE CRUSADER.\n\nCHRISTMAS 1926.\n\nEDITORIAL.\n\nA quarterly review of current events in the life of St. George's Indian Residential School, at Lytton B.C.\n\nOnce again at the approach of the festive season of Christmas, so dear to the heart of the child and grown up, we present to our readers just a summary of events that have taken place in St. George's School in the term now closing, with the hope that therein they will see signs of progress, or advancement in the work of the children. In our own small world it is sometimes hard to note progress and this sending abroad of our efforts is done with a view to receiving kindly criticism. Our thanks go out to those who so kindly wrote about our Midsummer Number, and their suggestions are deeply appreciated.\n\nNothing very exciting has happened in the school this term. We have more children than ever before, with a rapidly growing waiting list. This condition seems to be typical of all the residential schools, a sure sign of increased interest and desire for education on the part of the Indian people. And this interest is real, is strongly evidenced by the parents of many of our children, who constantly visit the school and urge and encourage their youngsters to greater and bigger efforts. And the children themselves seem to become more and more interested as the years go by, and now that we have started to get pupils into High School the work should broaden and become more intense. It is not easy to teach Indian Children, they are tremendously handicapped; but they do try; they are the whole very very good, and they want to learn. So it is worth while.\n\nThe children are all looking forward with the keenest anticipation to the annual visitation of childhood's greatest hero, Santa Claus himself and we hope that it will be possible to give them just as good a time as they have ever had, and better if we can.\n\nSo in closing we would like to wish all our friends the true blessings of Christmas with the hope that the New Year will be one of success and fulfillment of hopes, and we ask you to remember us at St. George's, to think of the children, to pray and hope for them that they may reach manhood and womanhood, filled with health, of success, spiritual and material which will enable them to go forth as leaders of their race and tribe.\n\nEditor,\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6462, file 888-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nA CHRISTMAS MESSAGE\n\nFrom The Principal\n\nTHE hands of Time's clock have again made the complete circuit and we find ourselves approaching Christmas of 1920. It seems only but a short period since our message of this season one year ago was asked for.\n\nDuring the year changes have taken place. We miss old faces that now have taken their place. Our numbers have increased. We are thankful and trustful that all has been God guided and while we visualise these additions and changes we realise that in our lives there enters again, in a deeper sense at Christmastide the Babe in Bethlehem stall. The year has brought its changes but in that Child we find no change. We can truly say that \"through all the changing scenes of life there is one 'who changeth not' but whom is the same Christ Child 'Yesterday today and forever'.\" He is still the One whose face is radiant with God given love, still the Saviour Who, although with Him no change is found, has seen the scenes of changing hearts and minds in years gone by, and we find ourselves one as \"He is one\", sometimes perhaps with hearts wrapped in swathing clothes yet one as found in Him. This thought brings us closer to each other and although changes have taken place we find, influenced by the Christmas message of last year, we who are left of the old together with the new, have on the whole prepared ourselves for a brighter and happier Christmas now upon us.\n\nWe need not repeat again the message of last Christmastide but bid ourselves call to mind what was said and in a wider sense find the Christ Child in our work, in our play and in our worship, so that with hearts and minds uplifted by the Holy touch we may not hesitate to chant again, with the angel hosts,\n\n\"PEACE ON EARTH GOOD WILL TO MEN!\"\n\nMr and Mrs Lott and Staff wish all the boys and girls and all our friends\n\nA MERRY CHRISTMAS\n\nand\n\nA BRIGHT AND HAPPY NEW YEAR.\nSCHOOL NOTES.\n\nENTRANCE PUPILS.\n\nWe have four pupils in Entrance class this year, Simon Baker, Williamson and Kenneth Walkem, and Janet Peters. They attend school all day and we wish them all success in their attempt to follow Peter Antoine's example of last year.\n\n############\n\nEXHIBITION WORK.\n\nFor the third successive year our children under the expert guidance of Mr W.S.Rowe, our drawing instructor, were successful in taking the first prize home for drawing at New Westminster. We also took firsts in writing, fancy work, darning, and needlework. For the first time we exhibited at Vancouver and were successful in winning two prizes. The prize money was spent for books and needed school room equipment.\n\n############\n\nMr ROWE'S DEPARTURE.\n\nIt was with regret that children and staff alike said farewell to Mr W.S.Rowe, our genial Housemaster and Drawing Instructor. The children will miss him in their drawing work at which he was an expert, whilst the staff will miss his dry humour and Scotch amiability. We wish him all success in his new field where he hopes to put his artistic attainments to practical use in the field of commercial art.\n\n############\n\nSIMON BAKER.\n\nAPPRECIATION.\n\nFor three years running we have won the Provincial Drawing exhibition, and we are all proud of our work. Mr Rowe our drawing instructor has left this school, and we all thank him for the work he did for us. We hope that we will be successful in winning the prize again next year.\n\n############\n\nDRILL & BASKETBALL\n\nWilliamson Walkem.\n\nWe are having basketball games every Tuesday and Thursday and are already competing with the Kamloops team and are hoping to win. We have drill on the two nights that we have basketball and have done so well the last time that Capt. Cummings came that he gave us a prize, which we might use for better equipment in our drills.\n\n############\n\nPETER ANTOINE who is the first pupil of this school to pass his entrance examination is now in his first year of High School. We expect to have three or four more this year, but we are just having a test to see who will really have to try.\nChildren's Contributions to the 'CRUSADER'\n\nA CHRISTMAS LEGEND by Kenneth Walkem.\n\nWhen the three wise men set out on their journey to bring presents to the King, they stopped for a night at a jolly, red nosed man's house. The man told his wife to give the men something to eat and make the beds ready for them to retire. When morning came he asked the three wise men where they were going.\n\nThey told their story of the Child Jesus who was to be their future King, and they were going to bring Him presents, and the star was their guide. The jolly red nosed man said \"I will bring Him presents too, but I will start to-morrow\". The next morning he started out, but there was no star to guide him. So he traveled and traveled until one night he stopped at a lady's house. She had a little boy so he thought that it might be the child he was looking for, so he gave his presents to the child, but the mother told him that the child he was looking for was still far away.\n\nSo now he still travels and travels looking for the Child Jesus until now. Every Christmas he comes down the chimneys to bring presents to the boys and girls, so he might happen to give a present to the King.\n\nSo this man whose name is Santa Claus still travels around the world and he is the oldest man on earth. Just you take a look at his white hair and beard next time you see him, but he has not lost his red nose and he is as jolly as ever.\n\n-------------------oo-------------------\n\nJoan of Arc by Eva Tooney.\n\nOnce upon a time there was a French girl named Joan. She lived with her father and mother. One night Joan went to bed and dreamed that a voice was calling her to help in the war against the English, so she jumped up and told her father about it, but he only laughed and said \"What can a girl do in the war?\"\n\nAt last she persuaded her father to let her go. When the English soldiers saw Joan carrying the Fleur-de-lis in the lead of the French army they thought she was a witch and turned around and fled from their enemies.\n\nWhen King Charles of France heard of Joan he said that she must stay and help them in their wars. The next time the English troops came they seized the French soldiers and put Joan in prison, and afterwards put her to death by burning her slowly as a witch.\n\nThe French will always remember Joan of Arc for her gallant deeds.\n\n-------------------oo-------------------\n\nTeacher.\n\n\"Robert, who will officiate if all the members of the Cabinet died.\"\n\nRobert thought hard for a moment and then replied,\n\n\"The Undertaker Sir.\"\nLAURA SECORD'S BRAVERY by Ethel Bertrand.\n\nJames Secord a Canadian, lay sick when he heard the plans of the Americans. Only twenty miles away his fellow men were waiting death and there was no way of warning them. \"They must die for lack of warning\" he said to his wife. But Laura offered to go, for she was brave and loved her country.\n\nHer journey began hour by hour she walked and scrambled onward. The sun sank, but still she journeyed, until at last her labour ended. The Indians rushed at her from behind a tree, then she thought her labour was of no use and that death was to be her fate. But she soon saw that they were friendly to her and led her to the officer who listened to her story. They lauded her for warning them and brought her to a farm near by to rest.\n\nThe officer made new plans and at the dawn of day the battle began and lasted for two hours than the Americans gave up the fight with the Canadians, and even to this day Laura Secord's brave deed is still remembered.\n\nVANCOUVER IN THE YEAR 2000. by Rosie Cisco.\n\nThe city of Vancouver was named after the great explorer Captain George Vancouver, who explored around the South Coast of British Columbia in the year 1791-1792.\n\nVancouver's population at present is 117,000, but it will increase in the years to come. It is situated near the coast and has a port where exporting and importing is carried on to a great extent from all parts of the world, all through the year.\n\nIn 73 more years, Vancouver will develop into one of Canada's greatest cities, airplanes will take the place of automobiles and electric trains will be invented, that will go at the rate of a hundred miles an hour or more.\n\nThose who wish to live in Vancouver in the year 2000 will have to keep their health rules.\n\nI hope those who read the story above won't consider me as a prophet, for I only hope to draw your attention to what I imagine Vancouver will look like in 73 more years.\n\nA FRENCH EXPLORER. by John James\n\nIn the year 1678, La Salle one of the great heroes of France set out to explore a vast river which was called afterwards the Mississippi River. For company our hero had with him a brave Italian officer, Tomi, two missionaries, a ship called The Griffin, and a few Indian guides.\n\nHe sailed from Montreal down through the great lakes to Lake Michigan, but when he reached there he found out that the food supplies were not enough for the expedition. So with an officer in command he sent The Griffin back to Montreal for more supplies.\n\nWhen the boat had been absent for a long period La Salle\nIt was approaching winter, so La Salle decided to walk on with his little band on foot and after having a long and weary walk, he stopped at a place on the bank of the Illinois River. Here La Salle left his men, retraced his footsteps back to Montreal for to get food. In his absence, the mates he left behind were attacked by the Iroquois Indians and on La Salle's return he found that only a few of his men were left. So with the few men who were left La Salle set off once more in a small canoe that he had brought with him down that icy and dangerous river, but after toiling for some days the rapids soon became at ease and it got wider and wider until at last La Salle filled with great joy saw before him the shimmering blue waters of the Gulf of Mexico. For having reached there in safety they all sang praises to God, and built a pillar on which they floated the Flag of France.\n\nLa Salle thought that it would be better to colonize the area he had explored and build a city at the mouth of the river. With this in mind he went back to Quebec and sailed back to France to tell the news to the French Government. The government was very pleased to hear this and the following year scores of men were sent over to build the city, La Salle in command.\n\nAs they sailed down the St Lawrence River and through the lakes they stopped at an old fort. While in the fort some of his men grew mutinous and one of the ringleaders of the mutineers stabbed La Salle in the back and that was the end of this great hero-explorer of New France.\n\n---\n\nFlorence Nightingale\n\nFlorence Nightingale was born in a small village of Derbyshire, and while yet a little girl, everybody noticed how kind she was to animals and poor people.\n\nOne day a shepherd was going to shoot his dog because he thought it's leg was broken, but Florence Nightingale came to its rescue by bathing its leg and finding out that it was only badly bruised.\n\nShe spent her youth in learning how to nurse the sick and care for the poor. So when the Crimean war broke out she went with some trained nurses to care for the wounded soldiers who were in bad need of proper care.\n\nWe think of her as one of the bravest women we know and are proud of her, as she was the first lady to establish a hospital for wounded and poor.\n\n---\n\nConductor: \"Willie, how old are you?\"\n\nWillie: \"I don't know, but I have three ages. I am thirteen when I go to school, I am fourteen when I go to work, but I am eleven when I get on trains because I always like to have a cheap ride.\"\nA CHRISTMAS STORY.\n\nBY\n\nADALINE PHILLIPS\n\nIT was the night before Christmas and everybody was expecting St Nicholas to fill their stockings. Freddie and his little sister Anne were anxious to know what they were to get as presents. So thinking to wait and watch St Nicholas fill their stockings they tried to stay awake, but alas! before Santa's sleigh was heard both Freddie and Anne were fast asleep.\n\nWhen morning came Anne was awake before anybody else, and being too excited Anne woke her brother and together they enjoyed their presents. The day was spent in happy games with other little children. Anne and Freddie invited many children to share the Christmas tree with them. When the children all arrived they had a big party.\n\nAfter the party was over they all went into the sitting room where the Christmas tree was found. The presents were presented to each person by Santa Claus who after distributing the presents also distributed many jokes with the happy children. When it was time to go to bed the children all said that they enjoyed the Christmas tree, and so ends my story as two little sleepy heads go happily to bed.\n\n#############################\n\nMADALINE'S BRAVERY.\n\nBY\n\nGladys Wish.\n\nIN New France a fort had been built by settlers who left it along with two soldiers and an old man, women and children. Madaline and her brothers were amongst them. Madaline was only fourteen years old.\n\nThe girl thought it was safe to go outside the fort so she went out to the river's edge. She had not been there long when she heard a yell from the woods. Knowing the Indians came to attack them she ran quickly to the fort which seemed so far away. She shouted for help but none came to her aid.\n\nMadaline got inside the fort and was safe; but for only a little while. She saw logs had fallen from the walls so she asked them to help her put them back. When they had done this Madaline went to where they kept the gunpowder. There she saw the two soldiers one holding a match which was lighted. Madaline asked what he was going to do, he said he was going to blow the house up. \"You coward!\" Madaline said \"go and help us fight the Indians\". The soldiers went.\n\nMadaline took a gun for herself and gave one to each of her two brothers and told them to fight for their lives. They had been fighting all day but when night came the Indians went away thinking there were more than a hundred men. Madaline being the Captain put her little bunch at their posts, and told them to keep up during the night. All had been quiet for a part of the night and then one of the soldiers called Madaline and showed her dark figures outside, which they found out afterwards to be cattle which had not been captured by the enemy. They brought these cattle in one by one in case the Indians had been hiding behind them.\n\nThey had been fighting for six days now and were very tired at last Madaline sat down and went to sleep. When she woke up she heard heavy footsteps, so she ran out to the gate and said \"Who's there\", they replied \"France\". Madaline was very glad so she opened the gate for them. They had come to help these people so Madaline and her friends were relieved from their task in keeping the fort from being destroyed by the enemy.\nChildren's Contributions to\nTHE CRUSADER\n\nSCHOOL NOTES.\n\nTHANKSGIVING DAY\n\nResia Ciseo\n\nThanksgiving Day, being a holiday, was celebrated by all the children of the school. Towards the afternoon our matron, who tried to keep a surprise for us, was rather disappointed when she found out that her secret was known, but however we walked for about three miles to a rabbit farm, which belonged to Mr. and Mrs. Puttnay, who told us that some of them had won five prizes when shown at the Exhibitions. Most of the rabbits had names, all but two which we had the honor of naming Lena and Bossie, so it was worth while visiting that most interesting place.\n\nNEW PUPILS.\n\nEllon D Sherwood\n\nAfter our summer vacation we had a little new girl who came to school, her name is Adeline Wallum aged 7 years. Her home is at Sponson Bridge. Then two more new pupils arrived from Morrist during the month of October, their names are Nelly Bonny aged 10 years and Mary Shuter. There are quite a number of new boys too, but we hope to have more new girls when the new school is built.\n\nHALLOWE'EN PARTY\n\nMaggie McIntyre\n\nOn October 30th the children celebrated their Hallowe'en party. The previous days to Hallowe'en were very exciting to the children, all the girls and a few of the boys dressed themselves representing different characters such as devils, puppets, ghosts, clowns and etc. The little boys gave a very amusing performance before their audience, until everybody was present to begin the little dance we had for awhile.\n\nAfter the dance, we all had cocoa cakes and some candy, the evening was spent with all sorts of amusements, which all the children enjoyed heartily.\n\nPRIZE MONEY\n\nEva Toomey\n\nThe girls won ten dollars for sending their needle-work to the Exhibition. The money was spent on books and games, we bought 25 very interesting books, and a few amusing games which we all enjoy.\nAt Lytton, B.C.,\nDecember 1st, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI am just in receipt of a copy of a letter sent you by the Rev. A.R. Lett, principal of St. George's Indian Industrial School, in which he is pointing out the difficulties under which he is laboring, and asking about the prospects for the new school building.\n\nMr. Lett talked this over with me, and is most anxious, if possible, to try to get the two units built this coming spring, as the appropriation was not passed last spring, which necessitated the postponement of the building for a year, so he is wondering whether it would be possible to have what was expected to be appropriated last year added to this coming year's appropriation, and thus get the two units built at the one time.\n\nI might state that Mr. Lett is doing excellent work and working up both the school and the farm. Things are certainly in a far more satisfactory state than they ever have been, and I certainly would like to see the start of a new building. Under the existing conditions it is so difficult to keep a staff, due to the unsatisfactory conditions under which they are working all the time.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n(H.

I note that you are concerned with the education of the children of the employees at the Lytton Indian Residential School. Would it be possible to let them have a row of seats in one of the regular classrooms? At certain of our institutions, the employees' children drive to the nearest white school. I doubt the advisability of a classroom for white children only in an Indian residential school.\n\nI approve of your action in sending two members of the staff to the university for short terms. Let me have a special report concerning the cost of this activity. There is no doubt that the Indian boys at the school will profit by better trained instructors.\n\nI am keeping before the Honourable the Superintendent General the needs of our work for the coming fiscal year and the urgent need of a new main building at this school is being kept well to the fore.\n\nThe Compliments of the Season.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Gen.\nIndian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Scott\u2014\n\nYours numbering 165.0.1 of the 22nd inst. to hand.\n\nRe same I must say that there is no possibility at the present time of making provision for the white children in the class-room as they are both filled to overflowing.\n\nAgain these people being three miles away from the nearest white school, which is in Lyton, this also is out of the question not only from the point of view of distance but one cannot expect a child six or seven years old to drive a horse over such treacherous roads as we have in these mountains.\n\nThese men in all cases have served in schools of this type for upwards of ten years and I do not see why their children should not be given an opportunity to have public school education separate from the class-room provided for the Indian children. Like myself they do not feel that they should expose their children any more than it is necessary to the low standard of morals, disease and etc inherent in the Indian child.\n\nThere must be some assurance as to how these men are to be provided for in their anxiety else I shall loose the bunch which, to say the least, would be very detrimental since they would not be easily replaced and for the past five years have worked with me and know what I want. I am not anxious to train another lot of men but would much rather overcome the difficulty by making provision for them. Their loss to the school would not be overcome for some time.\n\nIn the meantime I would propose turning my present office into a class-room for their convenience which would tide the situation over and would allow the men to proceed with the proposed Short Course in Agriculture, which in your letter you have approved of. The provision would entail a small expenditure to the school besides making provision for a teacher, but need not be taken into consideration before the spring. We afterwards could ascertain what could be done re making provision for them in the New School.\n\nI cannot say now whether own position will be if, at least two units of the New building do not materialise this year, as the present necessary strain is wearing. I cannot develope as I wish, and with hands tied as they are, it really seems a waste of time in many instances.\n\nUnder separate cover I am submitting at your suggestion an approximate estimate of the expenditure I will entail sending two men to University for Short Course.\n\nI wish to thank you for this offer and also for the seasons good wishes. May I extend same to you and wish you every prosperity for the New Year.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6462, file 333-1, part 2)\nLytton, B.C.,\nDecember 25th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have yours of December 23rd, enclosing a copy of one addressed to the Rev. A.R. Lett, Principal of the Lytton Residential School.\n\nIn your letter you mention the desirability of arranging for a new building at Lytton Residential School. This is not what Mr. Lett wanted. It was for an extra room that could be used for the purpose of a classroom. They do not like the idea of putting a row of desks in the Indian children's classroom, owing to the great amount of tuberculosis which is cropping up amongst the Indians all the time.\n\nThe staff members who have children to education are quite willing to club together to pay a teacher's salary, but only wanted provision made for a small classroom.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H. Graham)\nIndian Agent.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nHG/MD\nJanuary 7, 1927.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nI wish to draw to your attention a request of our representative at Lytton - that a small classroom for employees' children be provided in the new Indian residential school building. Generally, I could not recommend this course; but, in view of the representations of the Rev. Mr. Lett, I consider it would be advisable to give favourable consideration. To my own knowledge, the road from the school to the town of Lytton is too dangerous for any but expert drivers.\n\nRussell Hevier\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nJanuary 7, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Lett:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo and I have today directed that a small classroom to accommodate ten desks be provided in the new Indian residential school building at Lytton. It is understood that the employees will be responsible for the salary of the teacher they engage for their children. The Department will provide the necessary furnishings in this room.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. A. R. Lett,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nLytton, B. C.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nIn view of the scientific advance of the Agricultural Industry throughout the Dominion, necessitated by forced competition internationally, it is my belief that wherever possible this spirit of advance should be fostered in our Indian Schools.\n\nOur Indian population throughout the Dom. if properly equipped in districts where agriculture predominates, could be taught to take care of a part of this vast industry. This training can be readily and successfully handled through the schools established by the Dept. for the education of the Indian child.\n\nThis training would vary according to situation and should be adapted to natural climatic production and change of surrounding individualized production, for e.g., we in B.C. must adapt an extensive mixed farming training while in the middle west a scientific knowledge of wheat growing.\n\nIt seems to me that this is, every day, becoming a great need from two points of view.\n\n1. Wherever a farm is connected with the school, no matter how large or small it may be, it cannot be run in a hap-hazard manner else it will soon become a liability instead of an asset and the Dept. will be obliged to carry it at a severe loss. The day even of a successful practical farmer has passed, and he finds that he must accept science with it else he finds himself at the wrong end of his financial sheet. This I am afraid has been the case with many of our school farms and except we observe scientific production, and everything that goes with it, we cannot produce the required marketing standard in order to compete with producer who is alive to the assets of scientific production grading and etc., and who by his quick adaptation of science acquires the highest value for his production.\n\nThis year at the school we produced thirty-two head of select hogs on which we made a clear profit of three hundred and twenty-five dollars. These pigs were all marketed before they were six months old and commanded a premium of two cents a lb. for select. I also had one batch of pure bred Birks two of this batch I sold for herd sires to ranchers in the neighborhood and brought me ten dollars each over the marketing value. Three sows I have kept for breeding and the remainder sold as selects.\n\nThis condition is applicable to every branch of the farm and pays in every case.\n\n2. The training would give greater interest to the Boys in their work. They could be taught judging of animals; judging and sel-\nof poultry; judging and selection of seed; grading of fruit and\netc.\n\nIt would also equip the boy to take care of his future in\ngiving him trained scope to compete with his white neighbor\nand in many cases take away from him the fact that, espe-\ncially in this province, he is obliged to look to foreign\nelement for his training. On the other hand be obliged to work\nfor undesirable instead of becoming a citizen worthy of the\nIndian Departmental School.\n\nThis year I have planned to send two of the men employed\nas instructors to the University for Short Courses in Agri-\nculture and will perhaps take one myself if it is possible\nfor to work it in. In this manner I could with no great ex-\npense begin opening up the way for such training as is neces-\nsary to keep the school on a scientific productive standard\nand also to give the boys a trained opening into a lively-\nhood wherein they would stand not as wards of the Dept.,\nbut as independent citizens needing no help other than their\nschool training and perhaps an initial start. This latter of\ncourse governed by the aptitude and general display of interest\nand etc., the boy shows in his school period.\n\nThe courses this year following each other it will not mean\nextra help as during the winter months things are a little\nslack and the regular work can be easily carried on with the\nremaining members of the staff hence the expense incurred\nwill not exceed railway and streetcar fare board and lodging.\n\nThis would amount approximately from fifty to sixty dollars\nfor each man, and I would be greatly obliged if the Dept could\nsee fit to carry the expense incurred.\n\nI am firmly convinced that this course of procedure will\nin every way help us over a number of difficulties.\n\nI wish to thank you for interest taken and trust the New\nYear will bring with it many prosperities for the Dept.\n\nYours very obediently\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL\nJanuary 14th, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Lett:\n\nI was pleased to receive your letter of the 2nd instant, explaining in detail the programme you have considered for better instruction in agriculture at the Lytton Indian Residential School.\n\nI am hopeful that much good will come from this activity and I shall arrange a special grant to cover the costs of the special training.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

These furnishings could afterwards be removed to the new quarters. The men are very anxious about their children and are looking forward to some provision being made as soon as the spring comes.\n\nI have already intimated that the room occupied by myself as an office could be used for this purpose; it would serve the purpose well and would also serve to quiet anxiety. To wait for the new class-room would mean at least one year for these children and they are now ranging in age from six to eight years.

R. Bush, Esq.,\nCharter Clerk,\nNew England Co.,\n26 Bloomsbury Sw.,\nLondon, W. C. 1.,\nEngland.\nSir:\n\nHerein, I would like to draw to your attention some of the conditions existing at St. George's Industrial School.\n\nThe boys and girls dormitories are both over-crowded and the ventilation is wholly inadequate. The boys dormitory is so poorly lighted and dark that very little sunlight enters the room. The beds are so close together, in both dormitories that there is scarcely room to get between them.\n\nThe heating system cannot supply the necessary heat, during the colder months.\n\nWater has to be drawn at times and pails used to flush the toilets. With this condition, toilets have become plugged and overflowed and the contents have leaked through to the basement.\n\nThe laundry, I do not consider fit for any person to work in, particularly in cold weather. The floor which is of boards built on the ground is falling in, in places, and the building is in such a state of dilapidation that wind blows through it. The children working in the building are cold, while breathing-in damp steamy air.\n\nSince school opened last fall, seven cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis have developed among the children. I think that the conditions cited above are to be seriously considered as predisposing factors to the development of this disease, to which Indians are very susceptible.\n\nThese conditions have existed since my coming here over three years ago, but as there have been rumors from time to time, of a new school being built, I have hesitated about writing you.\n\nThe Principal is doing the very best he can under existing circumstances, and it is only, I think, the fact that he has hesitated in adding expense to the Department that he has carried on to this period. Furthermore he has intimated his resignation if conditions are not changed.\n\nAs Health Officer, for this district, I will have no hesitancy in recommending the condemnation of the present buildings if some move is not made to better conditions before the beginning of the next term. The only remedy is, the erection of a new school, which should be proceeded with, without further delay.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.

Wilson, the contents of which will speak for themselves.\n\nI regret very much that he has had to report in this way, but there has been a great deal of sickness in the school of late, and no less than seven children, as he states, have done down with pulmonary tuberculosis. This sort of thing reflects on the school.\n\nI am living in the hope that I will hear from the Department that arrangements have been made for the erection of the new building, for things got to such a state this last winter, owing to the fact that the heating plant was quite inadequate, and the children certainly suffered, and if we had had it any colder, it is quite possible we certainly would never be able to carry on in the present building without extra heat.\n\nI have the honor to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H.

Lett,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nLytton, B. C.\nAN EASTER MESSAGE FROM MR. LETT.\n\nThe Editor of our school magazine suddenly appears before me, intimating that an Easter message would not be out of place. A busy principal wonders what he shall give.\n\nA thought of the past three months brings with it the passing of a strenuous winter, during which sickness has left its mark among the children. Two, our Father, in His infinite mercy, has called others home unfit for school work. New faces have appeared to take their places. So the quarter has gone emerging in Springtime and Easter, the former with its sunshine and flowers, the beauty of God's creation; the latter with its message that one day all shall meet again in the glorious and triumphant resurrection. Difficulties arise, sorrows sorrow fill the heart, vacancies appear; but to us, as to Mary Magdalene in the garden, a risen Christ spoke: \"He Is Risen\". Only these three words, but what a meaning. Members of the Staff, children and readers, what a warmth of comfort and assurance the words carry. A living Jesus to cheer our way, to guide our goings, to listen to our prayers and help us over our difficulties. These words however full of meaning can take their place. How beautifully the thought blends with the life of Spring, everywhere presenting itself. Surely we should be thankful for the life that lives and truly sing on Easter Morn, with hearts of love and joy:\n\n\"Christ is Risen, Christ is Risen, He hath burst His bonds in twain\"\n\"Christ is Risen, Christ is Risen, Alleluia! Swell the Strain.\"\nArising to the feelings of one who has grasped in reality the supreme thought, \"Christ is not dead but He is alive forevermore.\"\n\nEFFECT OF HABIT. SOME DESIRABLE HABITS\n\n\"Habit is a cable. We weave a thread of it each day, and it becomes so strong we cannot break it.\"\n\nScientists tell us that each thought and act of mind leaves a path on the brain. Repeated actions deepen this path and makes it more difficult to act in another line, and easier to follow the beaten path. An education along any line is but the result of path making. We can see, then, the importance of making paths both good and true, and of changing very quickly when a wrong course is begun.\n\nDuring the early years of our life we may acquire good habits nearly as easy as careless ones, so in our daily actions we need to have this object in view above all others\u2014character building.\n\nA few of these desirable habits we should all strive to acquire, as follows:\n\n1. The habit of happiness.\n2. The habit of thoroughness.\n3. The habit of neatness in our work.\n4. The habit of promptness.\n5. The habit of politeness.\n6. The habit of appreciation.\n7. The habit of attention.\n8. The habit of cleanliness.\n9. The habit of thoughtfulness.\n10. The habit of pleasure in work well done.\n11. The habit of correct speaking.\n12. The habit of unselfishness.\n13. The habit of mastering difficulties and not complaining.\n14. The habit of telling the exact truth.\nACTIVITIES AMONG THE GIRLS.\n\nIt seems but yesterday since we were exchanging Xmas and New Year greetings and now these winter days lie far behind us and Spring is in the air. We have had a number of ups and downs among the girls in the last three months. First of all we had the flu epidemic which drove more than half our number to bed when we were all nicely better, hence made its cruel attack and has been most reluctant to leave us. Now everyone is getting quite chirpy again with the exception of two girls still in hospital and we trust they will soon be better and back amongst us.\n\nDuring the winter we commenced a course of lectures on First Aid and sick nursing for the seniors. Everyone was very enthusiastic and entered into this important study with great zest.\n\nWe have also had special nights for drill games and basketball, these evenings I need hardly add were enjoyed to the full.\n\nJust at present our entire energy is being devoted to our concert which we hope to give about the end of April. The seniors are giving a dialogue which includes songs, pianoforte solo recitations etc. The 'Sons' are doing their bit too and working hard with their singing and hope to cheer everyone up with their \"Songs of the Fair\". Last but not least we come to the tiny tots. These little ones have worked splendidly this winter and just now they are passing away with their fun drill and action songs and they wonder if you will like them in their fairy costumes.\n\nOur week end rambles get more and more interesting, for each time there is some fresh token of Spring to cheer us on our way, and as we climb up and up through the scented pines we feel that it is good to be alive and able to enjoy all the beauties of God's wonderful world.\n\nIN MEMORIAM\n\nWe were all exceedingly touched by the passing over of Mary Clarke. Her sweet and gentle manner made her greatly beloved by the girls, and we shall miss her very much.\n\nOne of our older boys, Samuel Justice, has also been recently called from our midst, and is greatly missed by all of us.\n\nSPRING'S MESSENGER.\n\nI met a merry little breeze Then o'er the meadows swift it flew,\nAs it went gaily by, I heard it whisper to the trees, This little mused breeze,\n\"Lo! Spring is coming nigh.\" Arousing every flower it knew.\n\nThen bending low I heard it say And waking all the trees,\nTo the sleeping flower beds, Until at last the whole wide earth\n\"Awake! Awake! Spring's on the way, Was clad in garments fair,\nCome, raise your dainty heads.\" And Spring itself had given birth\nTo blossoms everywhere.\nTHE CADET CORPS.\n\nThe work of the Cadet Corps during the past five months has been full of interest, pleasure, and profit for boys and instructors alike. The course of training is extensive and varied covering such subjects as Squad Drill, Physical Training, Signalling, lectures on First Aid, Health and Hygiene; Clean Speech, Sport, and Living, and last but not least Basket Ball, Volley Ball, and baseball games, all of which go a long way in developing a boy's body, mind and character.\n\nAt first our Physical Training and games were confined to Tuesday and Thursday evenings, but it was soon found that this was impracticable as the number of boys was too great for the limited space in the play room where our drills and games are held. In order then to get the greatest possible good out of our work, the classes were divided into Juniors and Seniors in the afternoons taking P.T. and games from 4-45 to 6-35. The seniors and the juniors who work in the afternoons taking the evening classes at 7-15.\n\nThe boys right from the beginning have shown wonderful aptitude in learning the new exercises, so much so that now they can go through all of the 40 different exercises 32 times each in their proper order with very few words of command or instruction.\n\nIn the past few weeks we have been practicing building pyramids for our concert which we hope will take place next month.\n\nAfter the P.T., the juniors play basket ball quite a number of whom are showing signs of becoming really good players before another season comes around. The seniors in their snappy white Gym suits play after the juniors. They play a series of five games, the team winning every out of five are declared the winner of the series.\n\nNow that the evenings are getting longer we will soon be practicing squad drill and signalling outside where we will have more scope.\n\nThe boys have shown a great interest in the First Aid lectures and demonstrations which are given on Monday and Friday evenings in the dormitory. Talks on Health and Hygiene, and on Clean Speech, Sport, and Living are also given on these evenings and are having an influence on the lives of the boys.\n\nBesides Basket ball the boys now play baseball and volley ball at every opportunity. We expect to begin a series of games with the boys from Lytton in the near future.\n\nAbout the end of Feb. a system of prefects was instituted the following five boys being elected by ballot. Norman Dunstan head prefect, Simon Baker Charles James Kenneth Wallis and Raymond Thorpe. They are responsible for promoting a good feeling amongst the boys and creating a spirit of loyalty to the School. Each Prefect has his own particular duties to perform in connection with the work of the Chapel School and Farm, and so far has been very successful.\n\nWe have had a few hikes since Christmas, the first one was to the Rabbitry an account of it will be found elsewhere in this issue. The Flu' and the bumps put an end to our hikes for a time but since then the boys have been to Lytton two or three times, across the river twice and once on a moonlight hike up the 47 road. We left the school about 9 o'clock and went quite a way up the mountain behind the school stopping now and again to admire the wonderful view of the mountains across the river. We got back about 9-15 everyone having enjoyed the outing very much.\n\nWe will soon be starting training and getting into shape for Sports Day on the 24th of May when the boys expect to break a few \"world records\".\nA BIT OF POETRY? OR SHALL WE SAY DIAMONDS IN THE ROUGH\n\nTHE NEW SCHOOL\nMary Ann Phillips\nGrade 5.\n\nThe children's eager eyes are hoping\nThat the new school soon they'll see;\nTo one another they are saying\nWhat a difference it would be.\n\nI can see us in the bright place,\nWith all our peoples and our friends,\nWith voices shouting loud and free,\nHurrah! at last the school is built.\n\nIsan see the playground stretching\nOut in the green grass wide and free.\nWe would give the whole wide world just\nFor the new school to be built.\n\nOUR SCHOOL FLAG.\nRegis Cisco\nGrade 7.\n\nHi-h up on the lofty pole,\nA ragged flag I see,\nAll tattered and badly torn,\nBut still waving bravely.\n\nBut alas! on rainy days,\nIt droops as if with sorrow;\nFor 'tis hard to be happy,\nWhen you're shivering with cold.\n\nBut when the sun shines forth,\nIt seems to say, \"cheer up!\"\nAnd the poor old bit of bunting\nWaves its banner bravely on.\n\nSONG OF SPRING.\nGladys Wish\nGrade 7.\n\nWhen in the trees the birds are singing,\nAnd in the meadows the flowers are blooming,\nWe do not have to be asking,\nWhat season it is that's coming.\n\nFor the children, their games are playing,\nAnd the flowers they are gathering;\nWith the songbirds they are joining,\nThen their joyous shouts are ringing.\n\nThe farmers their seeds are sowing,\nAnd the strong herds are plowing;\nSo we do not have to be asking,\nWhat season is it that's coming.\n\nNOT LIKE \"THE CRUSADER\"\n\nWhere did you put father's book last night?\nIn the bath, father said it was too dry for him.\n\nEthel Bertrand\nGrade 7.\n\nOur new has ended,\nSpring is here;\nThe rising have come\nTo cheer us up.\n\nA robin was singing\nIn a tall cherry tree\nCheer up! cheer up! cheer up!\nCheer up!\n\nSun in all day so merrily.\n\nDan Baker\nGrade 6.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6462, file 888-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nHEALTH HABITS.\n\nMost defects in children, yes in grown-ups too, are due to our general ignorance of the laws of health. Getting rid of these bodily defects is only the beginning of health work. Every machine not only needs occasional repairs but must have plenty of good fuel and oil and frequent cleaning in order to do its best work. In like manner the human body must always be given opportunity to renew its activities from day to day by rest, sleep and proper health habits.\n\nThese health habits are as old as the hills. They have been necessary for health for ages, and their faithful practice has kept wild animals in an enviable state of physical perfection. Human life, however, has lately become so complicated by the many discoveries and inventions and offers such a great choice of conduct that we need supervision and guidance in our daily programme, in order that the doing of a few things which make for health may become regular and habitual.\n\nA few of these habits are as follows:\n\n1. Eating the right foods at the right time.\n2. Sleeping until fully refreshed and taking needed rest between times.\n3. Breathing pure air and seeking the sunlight.\n4. Vigorous of body and mind.\n5. Regular use of the toilet.\n6. Keeping clean without.\n7. Keeping in good humour.\n\nSuch habits are simple and easy enough for the child of any age, if conditions for their practice are kept favorable. By practising them ourselves and encouraging their practice at home and school, we can do much to develop the right type of happy, healthy, young Canadians.\n\nKEEPING FIT\n\nBreathe deeply when in the open; breath is life. Every breathing means an even pulse. Anger and jealousy shorten the breath and shorten life, because they disturb the circulation and interfere with digestion. Bathe regularly; thus is the skin kept active and elimination made easy and natural. Drink a glass of warm water before breakfast and before bed. As for your enemies, forget them. Besides your daily work have a hobby\u2014music, chess, books, gardening, riding. Every day read a little poetry, look upon a beautiful picture, hear a piece of choice music. These things love the soul; they rest and they refresh.\n\nMary Ann Phillips.\nHOW THE BAD-HABIT FAMILY GOT INTO KINGDOM HEALTH!\n\nOnce in a time, there wandered to\nThe gate of Kingdom Health,\nA sad, Bad-Habit family,\nIn search of Fame and Health.\n\nAnd all their pleadings were in vain.\n\"I shall not let you in\nUntil you mend your ways,\" heart said\n\"All right, sir, we'll begin!\"\n\nSo Carrie Coffee and her\nfriends,\nPoor nervous Trudy Tea\nDrank only milk, and soon\ntheir cheeks\nWere glowing rosy.\n\nThin Tillie Tonsil and her twin\nFrail Addie Adenoid, spent\nA short time in hospital\nAnd gained fifteen percent fail.\n\nAnd Tommy Toothache never\nTo brush his teeth at night\nAnd morning, too, and so\nHis smile\nBecame a pleasant sight.\n\nAnd Sammy Skimp held up\nhis head\nAnd straightened out his spine.\nMy! He was proud because the\ngirls\nAll thought him strong and fine.\n\nThen back they marched to Kingdom Health. The gate was open wide.\nAnd this GOOD-HEAT family Run joyously inside.\nWESTERN YELLOW FIR\n\nIf we were to examine the trees found in this locality we should find that which largely predominates is the Western Yellow Fir, or commonly called the Bull Pine. I shall give you a few facts about this tree:\n\nThe tree is found in the drier regions of this province. It does not grow in dense forests like the Douglas Fir. And other conifers; it is a beautiful tree-like these. The size of this is about 30 to 100 feet high and 2 to 4 feet diameter. The cones grow in bunches of two, three, and even four. The bark of this tree is dark brown when it is young but when it is matured it is of a lighter shade. The seeds are quite large and these formed a part of the natives' diet when they collected them for winter use.\n\nJim Peters.\n\nIN LIGHTER VEIN...\n\n\"Hullo! Hullo! What's your name?\"\n\n\"Watt,\" my name.\"\n\n\"Yes what's your name?\"\n\n\"I say my name is Watt. Your Jones?\"\n\n\"No I'm Knott.\"\n\n\"Will you tell me your name?\"\n\n\"I'll Knott.\"\n\n\"Why won't you?\"\n\n\"I say my name is William Knott.\"\n\n\"Oh I beg your pardon!\"\n\n\"Then you'll be in this afternoon, if I come around Watt?\"\n\n\"Certainly Knott.\"\n\n(And they rang off).\n\nMinny Albert.\n\nTHE SCHOOL\n\nSt. George's School has not got very many children like Vancouver. It is two miles from Lytton and we can get down there in no time when boys want candy very much. This school is getting old now but we can stay in it yet. We get school supplies every one or two months. The big boys have a new dormitory over by the blacksmith shop. We have lots of fresh air every day or three minutes when the wind is blowing. You can always hear the boys in this school shouting. We ever you go, shouting and shouting, but when their master tells them to shout out loud they hardly shouted at all. The school farm will start up very soon. Then they will plough fields up and dig ditches make new roads and cut branches from trees.\n\nWilson Albert.\n\nA FAIR QUESTION...\n\n\"No, sir, ah don't never ride on dem 'things', looking in on the merry-go-round.\" \"Why, de other day I see Rastus JOHNSON G IT ON AN RID & A DELILAH'S WORTH an den git off at de same place he started at.

The wasps' nests are made of paper which they make of wood; the bees' homes are made of wax. Both wasps' and bees' nests cells are six-sided. Wasps always eat anything they can like people but they can't eat honey. They eat sugar when they can't find honey. Bees have kind of a tan color, lighter than the wasps, which are yellow. The bees are shorter than the wasps. The bees are always inside boxes or their own hives but wasps live outside. People don't keep wasps. The wasps always have their cells turned downwards but bees put theirs straight up and down, so the little ones won't fall out.\n\nJoy Dunstan.\n\nITEMS OF INTEREST.\n\nTHE HUDSON BAY RAILWAY.\n\nAs the government has lately started work on the Hudson Bay Railway, I will try to write a brief note on that railway.\n\nYou would think that a railway track was always level and the rails always parallel, but this one is different from those of other railways. It is winding, sliding, and looping, and is crazier than any one you have ever been on. Often the train will run off the track or stop for repairs, which takes a lot of work for the section-men, who are our track makers.\n\nIn order to come this railway will be of great importance, it will be able to bring manufactured goods of Europe right to the back door of the prairies. It is 670 miles from the centre of the prairies to Edmonton, the terminus of the railway, and about 2,000 miles to Montreal.\n\naggie c. Intyre.\n\nSILK FROM THE ORIENT.\n\nSilk is manufactured from cocoons spun by which are raised in China and Japan. These silk worms are kept and fed with mulberry leaves until they spin their cocoons. The Japanese get these and pull the silk very carefully so it will not go to pieces.\n\nAs soon as they get more and more silk they send it to Vancouver, Seattle and San Francisco. By eleven days' travelling from Yokohama the Empress of Russia reaches Vancouver with 4,000,000 worth of silk. This is quickly unloaded and put on a very fast special train. It is rushed to Montreal or New York to be manufactured into dresses, handkerchiefs, shirts, table cloths etc. China exports the most silk.\n\nDan Baker.\n\n\"Mushrooms always grow in damp places, don't they, father?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said father.\n\n\"Is that why they look like umbrellas, father?\"\nA NEW INDUSTRY IN B.C.\n\nAs we all know fishing is the most important industry of our province. Referring to the most valuable of our fish we immediately think of the salmon or of the halibut which are caught every day along the B.C. coast. But the one most important fish of today is the pilchard, which a few years ago was unknown to fishermen. Its importance lies in the oil that it produces. Every month hundreds of tons of pilchard oil is shipped to large factories where a great amount is made into soap, perfume and other articles for toilet use. A few oil plants have been built along the coast and are now in operation. The industry is growing every year in importance.\n\nJohn James.\n\nWASHING GOLD\n\nHave you seen the number of white men and Indians dredging and panning gold in the Fraser River near Lytton? I am afraid that hardly any are making fortunes, though some, like a man we visited have made from four to five dollars a day since winter.\n\nWilliamson Walkom\n\nJUDGE. - What's your name?\nPRISONER. - Smith.\nJUDGE. - Occupation?\nPRISONER. - Locksmith.\nJUDGE. - Lock Smith up.\n\nCARRYING MAIL IN NORTHERN B.C.\n\nThe men and women who live in the very cold northern part of our province are very glad to get their mail. In the summer it clears up and the mailman has a much easier time than in the winter. He has a very dangerous job but I guess he likes it. In the spring, when the ice is breaking up, he has to carry the mail on canoes and these are often upset in the rough rivers. In the winter he carries the mail on sledges which sometimes slip over the mountain-side. Once in a great while the mailman has passengers. He is quite happy then as he can talk to them. At times a mounted policeman goes with him. Once he took with him a murderer and a mounted police. The murderer's name was Davis. He had killed his partner but couldn't be buried alive on account of the frozen soil. He kept the frozen body in his cellar but he was out of luck for the mounted police passed that way. He asked where the partner was and asked other questions then got a little suspicious when he heard the answers to his questions. He made a search and of course found the body and arrested his murderer. Even bishops travel across the frozen north to preach to and confirm Indian children. They have missionary stations up there. I wouldn't like to live there myself.\n\nHenry Jacott.\nA VIEW OF LYTTON FROM THE TOP OF THE HILL\n\nLyttton is a little village situated about two and a half miles from St. George's School.\n\nWhen we are going to town and are just at the top of the hill, first of all we see many different kinds of houses which form the village. A road winds up towards E.W. (then see the two stations), one above Lyttton and the other below. The top one is the C.P.R.'s station and the bottom one the C.N.R. Just below the lower station we see the Thompson River and the Fraser River joining together and a bridge across the Thompson. We also see a railway bridge across this river just a little above the other bridge. The Thompson River flows from the east and the Fraser flows from the north. There is another railroad bridge built across the Fraser a little west of Lyttton. When we look a little north we see the ferry boat that crosses the river.\n\nJane James.\n\nDAIRYING\n\nCHARLES JAMES.\n\nWe have reason to be proud of our dairy herd at St. George's School. The best modern methods are used in every department. Our fine Holstein herd has been recently tested by the Government inspector, and it is perfectly free from T.B. or any kind of disease. After one more inspection our herd will be registered as a credited herd. The milk was also tested by the Inspector and the average butter-fat content was 3.6%, the cow went as high as 4.1%.\n\nOur barn here is up to date in every way. It is equipped with the most modern kind of stables. They have been recently putting an expansion to the barn to accommodate more dairy cows.\n\nThere are two large silos that are connected to the barn and a feed manger at cellar and a feed room to keep other stuff that is required for the dairy herd, and there is a feed carrier which is used to carry the silage.\n\nEverything is kept in good condition. The barn is cleaned daily. The barn floor is cement which is washed and cleaned to keep it free from any infectious disease. There is also a piggery connected with the barn.\n\nAN AMERICAN VIEW OF CANADA.\n\nA rather amusing article which recently appeared in the New York Times book review illustrates the lack of knowledge of Canada particularly of our Western Provinces, among our American neighbors. Speaking of Canada the article reads as follows:\n\n\"The Red Maple, symbol of fruition in the national emblem of Canada. All through the Eastern provinces of the country it flourishes, showing the fertility of the soil. But it is absent in the western region where furs and fisheries constitute the source of revenue to the settlers.\"\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6462, file 388-1, part 2)\nIt is interesting to know that the first Canadian book to be translated into the language of all nations \"Hesperanto\" is the well-known biography \"Beautiful Joe\", written by Mrs. Sarah E. Henderson of Toronto. The picture of the author and the translator, Nicola Kolov of Zagreb, Yugoslavia, appeared in Sunday's Province, April 3.\n\nExtracts from \"Readers\" by J. B. Priestley:\n\nWe are often addressed as \"gentle reader\" but never as \"ardent reader\". Yet real enjoyment of literature requires an \"ardent reader\". We are too apt to think or read as the most passive of our pursuits and to forget that, though it demands a passive body, it requires a most active and adventurous mind.\n\nWe are all readers now-a-days; that is we all devour masses of print, but there is reading and READING. The average educated person of today probably scans more words in a day than a scholar, a man absolutely devoted to learning, of four centuries ago. But let us ask ourselves are we really reading, are we engaged in an active pursuit, rambling with another mind, living strenuously for the time being in another world or are we merely staring at print with only part of our mind engaged. The latter type of reader will be satisfied with almost any rubbish, but the former literature will not do at all because it has no much it is a tonic, not something to doze over, something to keep a person from thinking, as is a great mass of our books and magazines of today.\n\nThe reading of these literary masterpieces however, demands an arduous and adventurous spirit. We first must master the words, then the thoughts and pictures to be reproduced in our imagination. Then there is the progress of the story to be followed, its scenes lived in the mind, its emotion caught and felt. Consider what adventures the mind undertakes in such reading and then dare to say that this is a pursuit for an idle hour, first cousin to an after-dinner nap.\n\nShould we be fortunate enough to meet the author even the most unlettered person amongst us would be quivering with excitement and enchanted by his words. But in his book we have something that his friends never had, we have him hour after hour at his topmost height, his tales shaped and refined by art, his thoughts purified and perfectly phrased.\n\nTo the ardent reader, then, good books are the gateways to real adventures.\n\nWISDOM\n\nWhen you get to the end of your rope tie a knot in it and hang on.\nChildren's Contributions to the\n\n'CRUSADER'\n\nKenneth Walkam.\n\nSPORT\n\nCANADA is always a sport-loving country. All the year round thousands of Canadians take part in some kind of sport, and also spend a great deal of time in, and money on, sport.\n\nE.W. Beatty, the president of the Canadian Pacific Railway is a great sportsman, many people give him the title of being the best half-back that ever booted the pickin oval.\n\nSir Henry Thornton another president of a railway, our famous Canadian National, was also quite a sportsman. In his early youth he was a football star in an American University and was also a good tennis player.\n\nOur new Governor-General Viscount Willingdon was a captain of a famous cricket team.\n\nSir Charles Tupper, who was one of the Ministers of the Cabinet at the time of Confederation and who died at Vancouver not long ago was also a keen sportsman. He was captain of a cricket team in Ottawa and was also a football star.\n\nNot only pure Canadians of British origin take part in sports but members of other countries also. In recent years most of Canada's best boxers have been Hebrew boys and sons of Italy.\n\nThe Indians of Canada are real sportsmen too. Tom Longboat, an Iroquois Indian won a great race in the Olympic sports, and the Pacific Coast Indians are great lacrosse players.\n\nThe sports of Canada also enables the people of the different provinces to come together for games. Sometimes teams from one part of the country want to play with another team somewhere and could not raise enough money, they could see Charles Bunning, Minister of Railways and try and get him to persuade Mr. Beatty or Henry Thornton to cut rates of travelling down.\n\nRecently the Toronto Grade players against the Fort William team at Vancouver, to decide who are the Hockey champions of Canada. The winners will also take a trip to Europe to play at the Olympic Sports next year. The Toronto Grads won the Championship.\n\nOUR MOONLIGHT HIKE\n\nSilas Pierce.\n\nOne Friday night, our House Master took us out for a moonlight walk. On our way up one of the boys hid himself behind a stump and just as the rest of the boys were passing the stump, he jumped up and scared some of the boys. Some other boys tried the same trick after but it did not work as the boys knew it.\n\nOne of the boys looked up the mountain and thought he saw a fire, so we all stopped and looked but could not see any sign of one. We continued our walk till we reached the top of the hill, a little farther up was Alkali Flat. Herman who knew all about the place showed us a short cut back to the school. The boys turned in that direction, some running and some walking; and soon we reached the dormitory.\n\nWe were soon all undressed and in bed for we were all tired after our long walk and in a few minutes we were asleep.\nChildren's Contributions to the\n\n'CRUSADER'\n\nA VISIT TO THE RABBITRY\n\nSimon Baker.\n\nOn New Year's afternoon, Mr. Henderson took about fifteen boys for a visit to the Rabbitry which is about a mile and a half from here. It took us about twenty-five minutes to walk it, as the road was wet and muddy which made it a little difficult in walking. Some of the little boys who went were behind us walking fast, trying to keep up with us. As we were nearing the Rabbitry we saw five cows grazing beside the road, three of which were white in color. We took a rest for awhile where a sign was put up for the Rabbitry. We went down a road which led towards the river a little ways and we reached the Rabbitry. Just as we met in the gate we saw a sawmill which is run by an old fashioned engine which has been there for about five years. When we reached the place where the rabbits were Mrs. Dewdney took us around showing us the rabbits and telling us the different names and some other things.\n\nFirst we looked over the ones which were in the barn. They are kept in there for the purpose of breeding. There were another bunch or about a hundred yards away from the barn which were kept in a handy box. The boxes are moved to a different place daily. It leaves the manure just where it is and the rabbits have their box clean. The ones in the barn are harder to clean than the formula is done at morning and evening. They are fed with hay and chop.\n\nThey have eight different kinds of specimens which are as follows: Squirrel, New Zealand, Silver Tavern, Chinchilla, which are the majority of the rabbits, Silver Glaciers Havana Silver Blue Cosmos and Blue Cosmos, a new breed which is also called Silver Tips. A lot of the rabbits had very excellent fur. Some of them won First Prize at the Vancouver Fair.\n\nWe spent over an hour at the rabbitry during that time we had looked over all the rabbits that they had about 300. Some of them are for meat and some for fur. Their fur is worth from $10-00 up and a pair of rabbits is also worth from $10-00 up.\n\nThere are also 15 or 20 chickens and two goats at the rabbitry one of the goats being milked twice daily.\n\nAfter we had finished looking over the place we started back to school. It was windy and raining a little when we returned. We were exhausted when we arrived at school from the long walk we had.\n\nHARD TO HOLD.\n\nThe station master, hearing a crash on the platform, rushed out of his room just in time to see the express that had just passed through, disappearing around the curve and a disheveled young man sprawled out among a confusion of milk cans and the scattered contents of his travelling bag. \"Was he trying to catch the train?\" the station master asked of a small boy who stood by, admiring the scene. \"He did catch it,\" said the boy happily, \"but it got away again!\"\n\nGuide arriving at ancient castle with party:\n\"We first reach the moat, which you now see before you. Are there any questions you want to ask?\"\n\"Yes,\" said an honest seeker for information, \"how could a fellow get one of them in his eye?\"\nTHE LIFE OF ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON\n\nHazel Phillips Grade VI.\n\nThe life of Robert Louis Stevenson shows how weak and courageous can overcome everything. Almost from his birth in the year 1850 he was handicapped. Because of his mother's ill-health he grew up as a sickly child. He spent his childhood in his nursery, gazing through the window at the busy streets below.\n\nHis old nurse would tell him fantastic stories of Scottish peasant life.\n\nWhen his parents took him away from school, he accompanied them on their journeys in England and through the continent of Europe, and sometimes would write down anything that was interesting.\n\nWhile he was at the University in Edinburgh, his friends judged him by his ungainly walk and untidy clothes and they considered the shall of more importance than the kernel. They did not take notice of the hours he used to spend with pen and paper figuring some difficult problem of composition not to make a reward but to attain a far distant goal. In this way who could later see the wonderful faith in his own talent which characterized his whole life.\n\nHis parents next forced him to study for the law in which he managed to pass his final examination with credit.\n\nHe wrote more and more industriously and finally won had some of his works published. When he was 23 years old his health broke down completely and even his life was \"dispirited,\" but mind conquered body and he recovered enough strength to struggle bravely, on his self chosen path.\n\nHe left Scotland and went to live in London and Paris and there he found more appreciation.\n\nThe first of his writings of any account which reached publication appeared in 1876 when he was 26 years old. These were essays which were afterwards put together and entitled \"Vitrinibus Pudicisque\" and familiar stories of men and books. These showed that his toil was bearing fruit. Even these were coldly received by the public. In the next two years he managed to get a little over $200-00 for the first time.\n\nAfter fourteen years R.L.Stevenson attained his ambition and fame. He now took his place at the head of a band of English writers who were greatly encouraged by his example. He crossed the Atlantic for the second time to New York and there he made a great success. Then he sailed to Honolulu and from there to Samoa. He bought an estate and lived there for the remaining fourteen years of his life. These last four years were filled with many great works. One of his best books is \"Catriona\" and best of all is \"Weir of Hermiston\" unfortunately he did not finish it.\n\nFew men of note have been more criticized in their early days and more honored in their later ones.\n\nS M I L E S.\n\nMr Crawford: Dan Baker, what is an average? Dan: Something the hens lay their eggs on, sir. Mr Crawford: Why Dan what do you mean? Dan: Well sir, Mr Stamp told us that the hens lay about 200 eggs a week, on an average. Check a decade so.\nMr Crawford had tried in vain to impress on Henry Jason's mind that it was incorrect to say 'have went'. As a last resort he told him to remain after school and write on the blackboard 100 times the words 'I have went'. When the laborious task was complete Henry waited for Mr Crawford to return. When Mr Crawford failed to put in an appearance Henry in desperation wrote beneath his completed task: 'Mr Crawford, I have wrote 'I have went' 100 times and have went out.'\n\nHear'd in the kitchen\n\nAllen Jason: There isn't any coal man.\n\nMiss Dalgleish: Why did you not let me know sooner?\n\nAllen: There was none then, man.\n\n**********\n\nNo charge for this hint.\n\nMiss MacNeil wants to know how to remove a stain from the carpet in her room.

That an' he been doing?\n\nSimon: Oh! he stole two bases in that last game we played.\n\n**********\n\nMr Crawford was teaching a geography lesson the other day on the harbors of Scotland. The map was old and worn and torn. Pointing to a spot on an island off the north of Scotland he asked what harbor it was. For a while there was no reply, then Peter Under put up his hand and said \"It's torn away, sir.\" Quite right Peter said Mr Crawford \"Stormaway\" but don't be so long in answering next time.\n\n**********\n\nReassuring\n\n\"I say, my good man\" began an anxious old lady on a steamer \"I say are we going up or down?\" \"Well\" replied the surly deck hand \"as she is a leaky old tub, I shouldn't wonder if she might go down and then her boiler ain't none too good so she might go up.\"\nITEM OF INTEREST\n\nThe World's Highest Buildings\n\nNOT long ago, New York's highest building was the Singer tower on lower Broadway. Later the Metropolitan Tower on Madison Square eclipsed it. This in turn was exceeded by the Woolworth building. Just recently the construction of a still higher building in Detroit known as the Bank tower is planned to exceed the Woolworth building by 27 stories. This will be the first time that New York will lose the honor of having the highest office building. But some New Yorkers are dreaming of building a Larkin Building as high as 1200 ft. or 200 ft. higher than the Eiffel tower Paris which has been the highest man made structure since its erection in 1889.\n\n==============================\n\nTHE TALLEST BUILDING IN THE EMPIRE PLANNED FOR MONTREAL.\n\nAs the concrete foundation and retaining walls of the new head offices of the Royal Bank of Canada on St James Street is completed, progress is rapidly being made in the steel superstructure which is already showing above the surrounding fences. When it is completed it will be 350 ft. above the sidewalk. There will be 21 stories above the street level and two below. It will be the tallest building not only in Canada but in the British Empire.\n\n==============================\n\nBRIDGING SYDNEY HARBOR.\n\nAt Sydney New South Wales spanning the entrance to its magnificent harbor, one of the world's largest bridges is under construction. As this work so closely resembles the proposed bridge over the Lions Gate Vancouver, it might be interesting to know about this bridge. Sidney's bridge, the contract for which was let in 1926, has been under discussion for fifty years. In fact the first reported design seems to have been prepared by Mr Peter Anderson. His scheme however was not carried through as the people were afraid that if two bullock wagons happened to meet in the centre the structure would collapse.\n\nMeanwhile the population of Sidney was increasing at an enormous rate until today it is 1,250,000. By 1921 traffic had increased across the harbor from 16,500,000 to 42,000,000 passengers and it was admitted on both sides that something must be done immediately. The contract calls for construction to be carried on from both sides at once, the bridge to be completed in five years that is by 1931. Certain of the lighter steel materials must be made in Australia, the granite for the foundations must be taken from New South Wales quarries. Already 150 men are employed in these quarries and will be for the next five years. It is anticipated that the undertaking will provide work for 1500 men for several years.\n\n==============================\n\nMarking time will kill a man much more quickly than marching at a quick step.\nThis is a specimen of the clothing woven formerly by the Indians of northern B.C. Many shirts, such as this, the blanket proper, which was worn over the shoulders, and lassings are in Eastern and European museums. The children of the school have worked drawings in this style.\nTHE LEGEND OF THE CHILICAT BLANKET\n\nIn mythical times the daughter of a chief went out with a party of women to search for wild fowl. Stepping in a bear track she loosened her pack and impatiently cursed the bear family in gnarls. She started to adjust the pack and lost composure. Dusk was coming on, and she heard a footstep behind her. Turning around she found herself in the embrace of a youth. He whispered soft words in her ear; he was handsome; it was dusk; she followed him to his house to become his wife. Deep in the forest they reached a village of bears where she learned her husband was of that tribe.\n\nEventually she escaped and flew to the shore. Seeing a fishing boat she cried for help. But the fisherman would not approach until she promised to be his wife. When he touched the canoe with his killing club and the vessel sprang to land, the woman stepped in just as the bear and his friends emerged from the woods. The rescuer was human but was the benevolent sea-spirit Chilicat.\n\nThe canoe, with its occupant, now put out to sea, and descended to the bottom where the spirit lived in a great stone house. He told the woman he was already married to the Lynx but he would kill her, as she ate human flesh and was cruel to man. Upon arriving he wrapped the woman in his canoe-mat and carried her through to the rear apartment. He told her not to pay any attention to anything she might see or hear but she passed through. She saw the Lynx wife weaving a beautiful robe. This first Chilicat blanket.\n\nMETHOD OF WEAVING CHILICAT BLANKETS\n\nAnyone looking at the forms overleaf would at once say that they were those used in painting, never in weaving. Naturally, for these Indians did all their weaving of this type from painted models. Before a woman attempted to do the weaving she would get some old man, known to be artistic, to make her the pattern-board. This would be on the same scale as the final blanket but would consist of only the right side. As the woman worked she would measure off, exactly, the distance off a colour she wished to make. Two blankets can often be seen with barely a stitch of difference.\n\nThese blankets were woven only by the northern Indians and they had plenty of whale or goat wool. To shear the coat they first killed and skinned it; the women could now pluck off wool and hair, throwing away the latter. The women would squat down with a basket of this wool and roll it into a thread on the thigh with the palm of the hand. Then there were elaborate ceremonies in connection with dyeing the wool. Only three colours were used, black, yellow, and blue. The blue was obtained from copper, the black from huckleberry, and the yellow from a kind of moss. Where two colours met the uneven edge was embroidered in white, as can be seen in a coloured picture.\n\nAll this careful work was done by hand. It would take about a year for a woman to make one blanket and she would use three goat skins. Although a blanket brings good European money, women can make many in other ways such as in the cannery. This is a pity but it will be even more of a pity when the British Columbians of the future have to go to Berlin or London to study the work of their own Indians. However most of this work is outside the province.\nHave you seen how the class speeds up its drawing lesson after a quarter past four?\n\nHave you seen how hot the Guernsey is Monday and Friday?\n\nHave you seen a boy come into the kitchen with his cap OFF???\n\nHave you seen a thrush bird telling you to be always cheerful and jolly?

They find they have not enough for the fare yet they have worked for months and never thought of the future. The first thing that enters their head is to jump on a passing freight train. Perhaps not all of them do this but there are some why is it that some of them do not try and pass for entrance and seek for a better position than working on the section?\n\nHave you seen the poetry in this magazine?\n\nHave you seen a girl that could not talk, when she answered it was just like a mouse squeaking?\n\nHave you seen the army of workmen down on the farm?

I shall pay all expenses here. Is there any tribal or any other fund whereby I may get a refund.\"\n\nIn regard to this matter I beg to say that I arranged for the removal of the body to the undertaking parlors of Harron Bros., North Vancouver, to await arrangements for burial, on Saturday the 26th. ult. On Sunday, May 1st, I received a telephone message from Mr. Andrew Paul, Secretary of the Squamish Tribe, stating that a new casket would be required for the burial of Jim Baker. I telephoned to Harron Bros., undertakers, to find out the reason for this request and was informed by them that whoever shipped the body from Lytton crammed the remains into a coffin which was too short by eight or ten inches, and that the relatives were greatly disturbed on this account and had demanded that a new coffin be supplied so that the body may be buried decently. Mr. Paul was to have been at my office by appointment at ten o'clock this morning to further discuss the matter but up to the present moment - 4:30 P.M. - he has not arrived. I understood from him that the Indians wish the Department to pay for the additional service.\n\nIn answer to your enquiry as to whether any funds are available for a refund of the expenses incurred by you, I wish to say that if the body had been shipped in a decent and proper manner I would gladly have recommended to the Department reimbursement of any reasonable expenses from the funds of the Squamish Band as the boy Baker was an orphan and therefore\n\nRev.

Before I can take further action\nI would like to have a report from you on the subject.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(G.C. Perry)\nINDIAN AGENT.\n\nP.S. I have since ascertained from Harron Bros.,\nundertakers, that the Indians who accompanied the body to\nVancouver called their attention to the fact that the\ncasket was too short, and that is the reason why they\npromised to look into it and opened the box.\nDear Mr. Perry:\n\nYour letter of chastisement received and must hasten to say that I am extremely sorry this trouble has occurred. It really has added to my weariness over the loss of so many children this winter. I have to date lost from the school 13 children 6 of whom I buried within the past three weeks. I held out hopes for Jim to the very last as he was so robust and STRONG.\n\nI personally helped put his body in the casket. The undertakers evidently made a mistake in my order as when we went to put the body in it was short but with a little elevation of the knees it seemed quiet comfortable and I did not really think that there would be any necessity for re coffining. If I had thought this I certainly would have returned it for another.\n\nSimon was with me and I asked him to tell his grandmother of the shortness. I really was at a loss to know what to do as perhaps none others were in stock and the matron wishing to get the body away. The grandmother also wished to get away so that she could bury on Sunday.\n\nThis occurring has given me an added feeling of sorrow and regret, unable in reality to express my feelings.\n\nThe telegram to you was sent forward in the best of spirit before the casket came and thought if there was any possibility of getting the expenses returned I would be grateful as I can ill afford the extra expense however I shall bear these cheerfully together with Simons fare to Vancouver.\n\nAgain let me express my sincere regrets.\n\nBelieve me\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nSGD. \"A.

Principal that during the past winter thirteen pupils of this school have died, four of whom were buried within the past three weeks preceding these letters. I consulted on this matter with Mr. R. H. Cairns, Inspector of Indian Schools, for British Columbia, who informed me that he for the month of February last had addressed a report to the Department setting forth the adverse conditions under which pupils were living at this school. Mr. Cairns, I believe, pointed out to the Department that there were ninety-five out of approximately one hundred pupils had influenza at the school, that eleven had developed mumps and that one had died of pneumonia. He recommended the closing of the school and the return to their homes of the pupils unless steps could be taken by the Government to provide comfortable housing for them.\n\nThe spring having now come, improved weather conditions will possibly remove for the summer season\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nthe menace\nMay 6, 1927.\n\nthe menace of cold which is thought to have been responsible for so many deaths.

Not only has Parliament provided sufficient funds for a new main building, but we have received a reasonable offer from a responsible contractor. Complete plans and specifications were prepared some time ago and I called for tenders, which were opened recently. The Department is quite satisfied with the figure $139,000, which was entered by Addison and Hill, of Vancouver, who have been found quite capable of handling the work. I am directing to you, under separate cover, a set of the plans and specifications, so you will know exactly what type of building is being erected. The dormitories and classrooms will be made ready for an initial enrolment of 150. However, if all available space is used, the building will accommodate 180 children besides the staff.\n\nIn addition to funds for the main building, Parliament has provided $27,500 for water supply, sewage disposal, shelving, cupboards, furnishings, salary of the Inspector of Construction and a horse barn. There was also a vote of $10,000 for a first payment towards the purchase of the property.\n\nI have arranged application to His Excellency in Council for authority to award the contract and I wish to take advantage of the New England Company's offer to sell their equity in the property attached to the school for a consideration of \u00a38,000. The Superintendent General has approved of this scheme and the Department will be glad to accept the proposal of your letter of June 22nd, last, i.e., spread the payment of the purchase money over a term of years.\n\nI am making arrangements with the Department of Justice for the appointment of a lawyer in British Columbia, who will search title and prepare the necessary legal instruments. I am suggesting an Agreement of Sale with a consideration of \u00a36,400, indicating a payment this year of \u00a38,000, \u00a38,000 in one year, \u00a38,000 in two years and the balance of the consideration plus interest due at 5% in three years' time.

The Department will use your grants for replacements and repairs and will continue the school as an educational centre for Indian boys and girls, or both, and shall train the pupils in the teachings and doctrine of the Church of England. Further, the Department's intention is to have the position of Principal filled at all times by a Church of England clergyman.\n\nYou will be distressed to learn that the Rev. Mr. Lett, the present incumbent, who has done so well, is now in hospital after an operation for appendicitis. The latest reports indicate that he is rapidly recovering. Our officers are lending special aid during the present difficult time and I am hopeful that, when the new building is completed this fall and Mr. Lett is entirely recovered, the school will be in a splendid position to continue its career of much usefulness.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

GEORGE'S RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL: I also visited and went over this school. However, they were in the process of breaking up, and there was no work being done in the class rooms. I might say that Mr. Lett, the Principal, who has been very seriously ill, had returned for two or three days to see that the children were properly despatched to their homes. Personally, I did not think he was fit to be doing this work. On my second visit I went round there with the Deputy Superintendent General. The kitchen was clean and tidy, as were the lavatories. I found the fire fighting apparatus in good order and fire escapes accessible, and it was reported to me that the hydrants and hose were in good working order.\n\nThe school farm has very good crops and, apparently, is very well run. The milk herd seemed in excellent condition and giving plenty of milk for the use of the school. The Manual Training done by the boys since my last visit is also very good, and they had done a lot of work in the way of gates and other things around the school property.\n\nI am glad to report that at the time of my last visit there, I was informed that Mr. Lett, who was away taking a rest, has greatly improved, and considering that he was given up, he has made a marvellous recovery, and he hopes to be back, fit for work, at the commencement of next term. I do, however, think that an addition to the staff should be made, and trained by Mr. Lett, so that in case of sickness, there will be somebody who can take hold. It would also relieve him of a lot of the work that he is doing himself now, and which he should not have to do if things were properly arranged.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Geo. S. Pragnell)\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nDESCRIPTION OF THOSE PARCELS OF LAND THAT COMPRIZE THE PROPERTY OF THE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL AT LYTTON, B.C.\n\n1.

Lett has tendered his resignation as Principal of the St. George's Indian Residential School. He wishes to be relieved of his duties by July first, next.\n\nThe St. George's Indian Residential School is near Lytton, B.C. It is located on Lot 11, adjacent to Reserve No. 2, in the electoral district of Cariboo.\n\nThe St. George's Residential School was taken over by the Department from the New England Company in 1922. During the fiscal years 1927-28 and 1928-29 a new building was erected. There is accommodation in this school for 180 pupils. Approximately 210 acres of land is under cultivation. A great deal of this is irrigated land.\n\nThe selection of a Principal for this school is in the hands of the Department - the understanding with the New England Company being that the Principal shall be a clergyman of the Church of England.\n\nBefore securing Rev. Mr. Lett's services, the Department communicated with Rev. Canon S. Gould, M.D., D.D., D.C.L., General Secretary, Missionary Society, Church of England in Canada, and it was on his recommendation that Mr. Lett was chosen.\n\nRev. Mr. Lett has been allowed salary at the rate of $1,200 a year and Mrs. Lett, who acted as matron at the school, was allowed $240 a year. In addition to these salaries, living accommodation and maintenance are provided for the Principal and his family.\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n(RG 10 Volume 6462)\n\nFile 888-1, part 2\nLytton Agency - St. George's Residential School -\nGeneral Administration 1922 - 1934\n\nFile 888-1, part 3\nLytton Agency - St. George's Residential School -\nGeneral Administration 1927 - 1928\nJuly 12, 1927.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your B-5447 of the 8th instant, and in reply, I have to inform you that I have asked the New England Company to concur with your suggestion that they give us deed and bill of sale forthwith.\n\nI am today taking steps to secure an Order Council authorising the purchase.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Chubb, the well-known Architect, who is a member of the Court, was requested to represent the Company at the opening ceremony of the new St George's Institute. Mr Chubb will probably come to Canada early in May, and I am hoping that I may be able to accompany him. As it will be necessary to make many arrangements, so as to enable Mr Chubb to visit the Mohawk Institute and the Grand River Reserve, I should be most grateful if you could let me know definitely as soon as possible the date of the opening ceremony. In your last letter you mentioned June 15th as the likely date.\n\nThe Memorial Tablet is now in course of preparation. It will be ready to be seen by the Members of the Company at the Court on April 18th and will be sent out to you immediately after that date.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCharter Clerk\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6462, file 888-1, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nFebruary 23, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Lett:\n\nThe Charter Clerk of the New England Company has written that Mr. J. B. Chubb will represent the Company at the opening ceremony of the new building at the St. George's Indian Residential School. Mr. Chubb, who will probably be accompanied by the Charter Clerk, will be leaving for Canada some time in May, and they have requested us to fix a date for the official opening. June 15th has been suggested as suitable. Would this meet with your plans? It would be better to have the ceremony some weeks after the school is occupied and after the grounds have been put into good condition.

That as to Conditional\nWater Licence 7857 - 8, the New England School had until November,\n1920 to complete the works and to put in water.\n\nThat as to Conditional Licence 687 on Botanie Creek, the\nProvincial District Engineer reported that none of the appurtenant\nland had been irrigated up to 1922, but that in 1925 the Department\nof Indian Affairs, in taking possession of the lands of the school,\nhad applied for an extension of time for two years. In the meantime,\nthe District Water Engineer is reporting on this licence as to what\nextent the water is, or may be, used.\nThere was only one additional matter of inquiry. The new New England School building was being erected some half mile from the original building, and in a different locality altogether. I had Mr. Tredcroft, the Dominion Water Engineer who is superintending the installation of water works in the school, go over the Government maps with me, and also the plans. I satisfied myself that the lands on which the New England school building is being erected, are included in the lands being conveyed to the Crown.\n\nI am requesting the local representatives for the New England Company to turn over to me the Conveyance and Water Records.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSGD.

I think it is now practically certain that I shall be able to accompany Mr Chubb, but as I must be back in England not later than June 30th I have to make my arrangements accordingly. We shall therefore come by the C.P.R. steamer which leaves Southampton on May 12th arriving at Quebec and Montreal on May 19th. It was then our intention to go first to Ottawa where we hoped to have the pleasure of calling on you about May 21st to 23rd. We should then go to the Mohawk Institute for a few days. I do not quite gather from your letter whether you are likely to be in Ottawa at the time I mentioned, and as it is of primary importance that we should call on you we should of course vary our plans to meet your convenience. I should therefore be greatly obliged if you could as soon as possible let me know whether you are likely to be in Ottawa between say May 21st and 29th, or if not, then the earliest date after then that we could\nthere.\n\nFrom Brantford, where it is important that we should see the Company's lawyer, Mr Brewster, we shall go across to Vancouver, with a break in the journey giving a day probably at Lake Louise, and from Vancouver we have various people to visit. At Kamloops we shall be seeing the Bishop of Cariboo, to whom the Company has made a grant for a Missioner whose work lies among the old pupils of St George's School. At Vancouver we have to see the Archbishop of New Westminster with regard to another Mission which the Company is supporting or assisting in the neighbourhood of Alert Bay. A visit to Lytten, including the opening ceremony, will be the last of our undertakings, and I hope to be back in Quebec in time for the C.P.R. steamer leaving on June 23rd. I expect to have two or three days in hand at that end of the journey, and in that case it would be possible for me to call on you in Ottawa, if your engagements do not permit of our seeing you on our way out.\n\nI expect the memorial tablet to be ready for inspection by the Court of the Company on April 18th, and it will then be sent forthwith to you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCharter Clerk.\nMarch 23, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Bush:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant and I note with much pleasure that you will be able to accompany Mr. Chubb to Canada.

I am enclosing a statement showing the grants for current expenses that have been made from the time of Mr. Lett's appointment to the present date. You will notice that the school has cost the Department considerably more than the usual per capita grant. The most recent financial statement from the Rev. Mr. Lett is that for the month of January, last, and shows outstanding accounts of over $3,000. As you are aware, the entire responsibility for the conduct of this institution is now in the Department. Although Mr. Lett is in Holy Orders, we cannot ask either the diocesan authorities or any missionary society to assume financial responsibility.\n\nI have recently received an anonymous letter and also a communication from Mr. B. Hodgkinson, senior teacher at the school, concerning whom Mr. Cairns reports very highly. These are enclosed for your perusal. I believe there should be a serious and careful enquiry into the management of the school. I have always been satisfied with the integrity of the Rev. Mr. Lett, but it is possible that he is not the good business man we require for this particular post.\n\nI should like you to go to Lytton at your very earliest convenience for the purpose of a general enquiry.\n\nEnc.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nBox 666,\nVictoria, B. C.\ninto conditions. You should take with you an accountant who will examine the books, receipts, etc., for a period of at least the last two years, and, if possible, from the beginning of Mr. Lett's incumbency.\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Lett has had a very trying time, and I am desirous that he be worried as little as possible by your investigation. He will perhaps be glad to have the accountant's check on the finances at the school, but the investigation into the complaints of the staff, of necessity, will be more or less unpleasant. However, I know that you will exercise your usual good tact and get to the bottom of the difficulties if at all possible. In addition to the financial management, the reasons for the chronic truancy and for the dissatisfaction of the members of the staff should be determined. I know that living conditions in the old building were far from pleasant; but, apparently, there are other causes for the unrest and lack of harmony.\n\nI am informing Mr. Lett that you have been requested to make a general inspection. Even if there were no complaints concerning conditions at the school, it is now timely to have an accounting as we are taking over the property from the New England Company. Further, as the Company is sending a member of its Court and the Charter Clerk to Canada for the opening of the new school on June 15th, it is desirable that there be an inspection to see that conditions are generally satisfactory.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMarch 30, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Lett:\n\nI have to inform you that final plans have been made for the official opening of the new building at St. George's on June 15th. Mr. J. B. Chubb, a member of the Court of the New England Company, and Mr. F. R. Bush, the Charter Clerk, have arranged to be in Lytton for the occasion.\n\nIn view of the approaching ceremony at the school and our recent purchase of the property from the New England Company, it is now timely to have a general inspection and an audit of the books. I am asking Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn to go to Lytton at his earliest convenience and to take an accountant with him. The Commissioner will enquire into the general management and conditions at the school. The audit of your books should cover the period since your appointment, if possible. The last independent accounting was in Dec., 1921. Please give Mr. Ditchburn every assistance.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. A. R.

I believe it would be well for you to cooperate with Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn in the preparation of a programme for the official opening on June 15th. You should arrange for invitation cards, which should be sent to all those that would be interested. Care should be taken to include on the list for invitations officials of the various churches and both Federal and Provincial representatives. Special invitations should be sent to those who, if they accept, would be given a place on the programme such as Archbishop Sheen, the Honorable Mr. Berton, the Honourable Mr. Stewart, the Honourable Mr. Macdonald and Mr. H.

Ditchburn has just finished his investigation re anonymous report and financial conditions of the school.\n\nAs a result of his work he has found that the former is absolutely without foundation and with no warrant. It was the result of one of the members of my staff wishing to create a position with the Dept. for himself and thought the old conditions existing would be sufficient to make a report and the time opportune, undertaking evidently thereby a blow at myself as administrator of this Institution, anonymously allowing the report to go before the Dept. in order to leave and opening thereafter, if his efforts should prove fatal to me, to make application for the position.\n\nThe utter ignorance and folly displayed of his efforts will no doubt be forwarded to Mr. Ditchburn in due course. He had it true gathered around him three other members of the staff, which he, during the meeting of the staff, chaired by Mr. Ditchburn, termed represented the consensus of the opinion of the staff of seventeen.\n\nNeedless to say that I was by no means a little disturbed, and keenly felt the reaction he had driven us to especially since he always met us with a smile and was a regular communicant at the Chapel Alter. In spite of this fact I had seen through him and I had for the past month filling up information that might be used in case something should arise yet in some way not contemplating it would not be of such nature as that you have been obliged to enforce.\n\nRe the financial condition of the school Mr. Ditchburn has found everything in order and the outlook of the School in this department in the very best condition.\n\nWe have been occupying the New Building for three weeks and are now very well established. We are already finding the work lessened and the organization and supervision easier maintained.\n\nThe lawns are seeded and the drive ways ready for gravel.\n\nI sincerely trust that Parliament will be progressed and in time for you personally to be here on June the 15th.\n\nI sincerely thank you for undivided interest and am thankful myself that the atmosphere has now been cleared.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nMay 21st, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Lett,\n\nI have your letter of May 11th.

I believe the representative of this Department should be given a more prominent position on the programme. My suggestion is that he follow the representative of the New England Company. I had hoped that I would be present upon this interesting occasion; but I regret that it will be impossible for me to be in British Columbia so early in the year. Our Estimates have not been considered by the House and the date of prorogation is uncertain. I am writing to Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn, asking him to represent the Department and to convey the best wishes of the Honourable the Superintendent General and myself.\n\nI have not yet received the invitation list that Mr. Ditchburn and yourself have prepared. You might let me have this as soon as possible. Before arranging for the printing of the programme, you should be sure that all those mentioned therein will be present.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. A. R. Lett,\nPrincipal,\nSt. George's Indian Res. School,\nLytton, B.

It is about time somebody took the trouble to look into the treatment of the children and the staff there during this past winter in food, fuel, warmth and general comfort. Also - why is the staff always changing? What money is received and how is it spent.\nWhy does the principal keep his staff without wages from middle of December 1927 to end of Feb. and why is there no housemaster in the place since Christmas Day.\n\nYou have an inspector on the new School Building, then why is the principal always down there instead of on duty in the school.\n\nThere have been far too many running away since last summer for things to be going on all right.\n\nCan you not send your school inspector round to look into these things and make a\nReject on it, and if it is incompetency, then get someone in who can manage properly; many of the staff would write, but with so many out of work at present, they are all afraid of their positions. It would be interesting to know what an Indian School wants with three Motor Trucks, when it is so much in debt all over the place. Perhaps a newspaper enquiry would enlighten us better!\n\nYours\n\nA lover of fair play to our Indian Children.\nSt Georges Indian Residential School\nLytton B.C.\nMarch 1928\n\nReports on present conditions of work in above school\n\nStaff.\u2014 This school is capable of producing and maintaining good results among our Indian Boys and Girls here, but its usefulness is much crippled by a weak policy of administration.\n\nThe school has been without a housemaster since Christmas\u2014by May 1927, and the work has had to be divided up on to the present staff, particularly falling heavy on the Boys Matron and the Senior Teacher.\n\nBoys Matron and Girls Sewing Matron are also very much overworked for want of further assistance, the latter particularly needing assistance in the making of necessary garments\u2014blankets, sheets etc., needed for the new school.\n\nThere are many other points that might be discussed with profit, but all could be remedied by foresight and re-adjusted by any practical man of tact and common sense.\n\nFinances.\u2014 These are in a most deplorable state and I believe the only remedy here is for a departmental audit of all accounts both past and present, and thus put the institution on a sound business base.\n\ne.g.\u2014The expense and receipt accounts given at the recent inspection for the month of January, could not possibly bear scrutiny, as there is no attempt at showing a true balance.\n\nThe staff received no salaries from Dec 15th 1927 until Feb. 17th 1928, when they each received two months arrears. Since then\u2014nothing.\n\nWe are living from hand to mouth daily, and the place hopelessly in debt.\n\nFarm.\u2014 No preparation as yet for any work there, most of irrigation pipes channels full of weed, sticks and stones. A very poor lookout for this year's crops.\n\nFuel.\u2014Bad, and has been all through the winter, with the results that we have had bitterly cold rooms, much sickness and general discomfort, much of which could have been avoided by a little care and attention.\n\nSchool.\u2014Rooms on various occasions being only 40\u00b0 44\u00b0 48\u00b0 and 50\u00b0 for working in.\n\nClothes could not be washed and dried as they ought etc.\n\nDairy.\u2014O.K.\n\nSport, Recreation etc.\n\nWretched, little interest, leading to unrest, mischief and constant running away.\n\nWith reference to this latter item, I may that since re-opening school since the summer vacation we have had no less than 35 runaways giving an aggregate loss of 235 days up to date.\n\nSupervision\u2014for this current year practically nil, owing to principal supervising building operations at the new school.\n\nThat this report on conditions as they are here,\u2014is incomplete\u2014will be very obvious to you, but sufficient has been mentioned to call for some remedy, re-organization, and re-adjustment in order to ensure success.\n\nThe inside staff have striven hard to keep things going, but the breaking strain is now reached, and hence this report.\nYour inspector Mr. Cairns has visited, but whether he has made his report or not is unknown to us, but each one is ready and willing to continue his or her work ungrudgingly to the end, if only we can work under a semblance of human sympathy and living conditions.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nOne of the Staff.\nSt. George's Indian Residential School\nOriginated by the New England Company\n(The oldest English Missionary Society, founded 1849)\n\nVisitor: The Bishop of New Westminster.\nPrincipal: Rev.

Hodkinson\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 30th of March asking me to make an investigation into the financial condition of St. George's Residential School, at Lytton, B.C., and also with regard to the general management, I beg to say that as a report on financial situation was forwarded to you on May 21st, I will now deal with the question of management and the complaints contained in an anonymous letter which the Department received through Mr. B. Hodkinson, the head teacher.\n\nIn this connection I beg to say that I went to Lytton on the 8th instant and to the School on the 9th to look into the complaints above referred to, and while Mr. Hill was auditing the books, I investigated the conditions at the new School as well as making a full examination of the old buildings, which I found must have been such as to preclude economical and efficient management. Of this, however, I feel that you are already aware.\n\nAt the new School I met Mr. B. Hodkinson, the senior teacher, privately, and informed him of my intention to investigate the complaints contained in a letter signed \"One of the Staff\" which he had forwarded to the Department with his letter of the 24th of March, and I asked him if he was prepared to support the charges for which he apparently had taken responsibility, and he stated that he was so prepared. I then informed him that I would hold a meeting of Dr. Duncan C. Scott, Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6462, file 888-1, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nthe full staff at which Principal Lett would be present to defend himself. At this meeting I laid before the Staff a summary of the complaints, but as Mr. Hodkinson stated publicly that he was responsible for the letter, I then read it in full to all the members of the staff which comprises thirteen persons. After reading the anonymous letter and hearing Mr. Hodkinson's statement that he took responsibility for it and that it represented the consensus of opinion of the full staff, I was very much surprised to learn from ten of the thirteen members that they disclaimed any knowledge of the document whatever, and stated that they had no complaint to make; they had found the Principal, the Rev. Mr. Lett, extremely sympathetic and that he had tried to do everything humanely possible to keep them comfortable under very trying circumstances. There is no doubt about it but what conditions during the Winter at the old school were anything but favourable in the way of supervision, heating and general accommodation. There appears to have been plenty of fuel, but the boilers of the heating plant were corroded owing to the use of the alkali water and consequently it was impossible to get but very little heat.\n\nWith regard to the first complaint that the usefulness of the School had been crippled by the weak policy of under-staffing, I am of the opinion that such is not the case, as the staff at the school was sufficiently large to fully manage the institution. It is true that at the time the anonymous letter was written (March) Mr. Shoregold, the headmaster, was absent on account of illness, but it was found inadvisable to make another such appointment in view of the fact that it was not definitely known whether Mr. Shoregold would be able to return to duty or not. I am inclined to the opinion that the complaint in this connection was made by Mr.\nMr. Hodkinson with a view to the possibility of his promotion to the position of head-master, if not to the principalship of the School.\n\nThe financial situation of the School has been fully reported on already, but in passing I may say that it is difficult to understand just how Mr. Hodkinson, or any other member of the staff, was cognizant with the matter, as Mr. Lett gave me to understand that he had not informed any of the staff as to just how matters stood.\n\nThe complaint that there had not been any preparations made on the farm and that most of the irrigation ditches were filled with weeds, sticks and stones with the consequence that the outlook for this year's crop was very poor, I may say that this complaint was not found to be correct, as it was clearly shown by Mr. Stemp, the irrigator, that the ditches were cleaned out a full week before the water was turned on. The farm itself at the time of my inspection was in splendid condition and the outlook for a bountiful crop this season is assured, barring some unforeseen circumstance.\n\nWith regard to the complaint about lack of opportunity for recreation, there appears to have been some merit in the same so far as it applied to the old premises, but conditions were unavoidable in view of the fact that the stoves had to be set out in the boys' recreation room for heating purposes and no organized games could be carried on. This condition, no doubt, led to unrest among the pupils as on account of the severity of the weather, sports on the playgrounds were practically impossible with the consequence that a number of the pupils left the School without leave.\n\nThere is some merit also in the complaint that the supervision of the School had not been all that it should have been owing to the Principal giving more attention to the construction\nconstruction of the new buildings than to the management of the School itself. As the new School is at least half a mile distant from the old one, it, of course, was impossible for the Principal to have as much oversight of the School then operating as was necessary, and it would have been much better had he confined his attention to the old School altogether. His action in this regard, however, may be excused to a considerable extent as he was extremely anxious about the new buildings and there had been considerable delay in the starting of progressive construction. With regard to this particular complaint, I took occasion to point out to the Reverend Mr. Lett that as he had a competent staff to operate his farm, he, for the future, should confine himself to the efficient management of the School, and he agreed that he would follow this course.\n\nUpon conclusion of my investigation, I pointed out to the Staff that the letter sent to the Department by Mr. Hodkinson was extremely ill-timed in view of the fact that it must have been written practically on the eve of moving out of the old School into the new one where the conditions provided for plenty of recreation room, good heating, fuller control of pupils both inside and outside of the institution, and better management than had ever been possible in the old building.\n\nIn conclusion I deem it important to inform you that Mr. Hodkinson is leaving the School during the month of June as he is going to marry Miss Spencer, one of the sewing matrons, and as the building will not afford any accommodation for he and his wife, he has tendered his resignation. I feel that it is in the best interest of the School as the conclusion I have formed is that he is inclined to fault-finding and trouble-making, notwithstanding his ability as a teacher.\n\nI am\nI am returning herewith copies of the documents which you forwarded to me with your communication.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E.

D. M. of J.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nArchbishop de Fencier, of the Anglican Church, Vancouver,\n\nMr. Chairman, Lord Bishop, Ladies and Gentlemen,\n\nI want today for a few minutes to take your minds back in retrospect\u2014a backward look, and then when we compare the things that have been with our present undertaking we will all, of every race, of every age, whether the little ones or the old folk, or those of us who do not yet like to be called the old folk, have cause for rejoicing.\n\nIt is only a little over sixty years since the first Bishop of old British Columbia landed at Victoria, when the Right Reverend George Hills came to the new colony in 1860 and there were three clergy to meet him\u2014three missionaries who crossed the gulf and went up the mouth of the Fraser and he came to a place where is now the City of New Westminster. There were four missionaries there and with these three made seven and the Bishop, who went up the country with horses visiting the natives, speaking to them of things of gold, not the love of earthly things but of the eternal gold which does not perish, and as he went through the country it was struck with the appearance, the vitality the foresightfulness and the intelligence of the original inhabitants of the land of your fathers.\n\nAbout the same time a British Admiral was sent out to chart the coast, and that Admiral went up 300 or 400 miles to about opposite Metlakatla, when some war canoes of the Haidas and Nisgaas came along, and in the bottom of one was a heap of something. When they took off the cover here were the heads of enemies, as they had been on a war expedition. One of their Chiefs was in that canoe and that chief's name was Edinshaw. The Admiral returned back home that here was need of missionaries for British admirals have ever been men who have feared God as well as being loyal subjects to King and Country, and backed up the Bishop in the efforts he was making. Here are a people, the original inhabitants in this British Columbia, whose mental ability can be seen in their faces, their thoughtful look; strong in physique, and with intelligence in their faces; and soon a missionary came for the north. I mustn't dwell at length on that work, that is just one little item.\n\nThe week before last I was in the City of Prince Rupert, attending a meeting for the election of bishop and representatives for the synod of Canada. The Church has led the way and shown the State, and the Church will yet continue to teach the State, as it is here to do. At that synod there were representatives from Indian villages who had equal right to vote for Bishop with their white brothers, and surprising to me, one strong bodied, intelligent Indian was elected to represent that diocese at the synod, the general synod of Canada, and that man's name was Edinshaw, the grandson of the old Chief of Edinshaw, who met the Admiral with his enemies' heads, a man who can stand on any platform and speak with intelligence equal to that of any man. That is what the Church has done for the red Indians of British Columbia.\n\nI was in\nI was in a little church in an Indian village just last week\u2014forty-eight or fifty came for Confirmation\u2014a church built by the Indians themselves; a fine building, with a good choir, a young Indian with his baton leading, sang an anthem that would not have disgraced any white church. On the wall, this is what took my eye, was an inscription with the names of some young men of that village who had given their lives for king and country, the same as our sons had given their lives. That also is the result of the teaching that is given the Indians in our province. I might speak at length, if time permitted, of the men of the Indian race who served overseas with the Canadian battalions. I always made a point of enquiring if there were any Indians in the different divisions from Canada, and always I found some of them, fine young men who were just as eager to do their part as any of their white brothers. All this is the result of the Church and school education.\n\nI can think with a very vivid recollection of coming to St. George's School, Lytton, eighteen years ago, and looking at the beautiful home on the hillside, one couldn't but appreciate the foresight of those who selected these lands for this purpose. Many were the interesting and I hope pleasant and inspiring meetings I had with many of you. We had two hundred Indians in church. I remember going across the river for Confirmation services, and coming down this side of the river and meeting almost all the settlers, and very happy these recollections were. What the first workers in this province eighteen years ago were able to undertake, are now having this delightful result.\n\nAnother memory is in London, England, of many business engagements there, and of going up to the court of the New England Company. I certainly enjoyed it as over there they take time to enjoy these things, more than we allow ourselves from business. We do not divide the time well, as at the lunch where everybody took the time to do things as they should be done; to tell of the interest that they had and continue to have for the Indians in our Canada. It was a delightful memory of goodwill and fellowship extended to a fellow traveller in a far country, and all were heartened and helped considerably by the warmth of your representative who assured me that they would stand behind any effort for our Indians which was considered and accepted by those in authority here.\n\nI am sorry I was so late but misfortunes will happen and when I saw the Indians still coming up the hill in their wagons and on foot I knew that I would not be so very late. Among several things that held us back was puncturing a tire about four miles below Lytton, which makes me think of a story,\u2014for we wanted to be at Lytton, but could not get there. There was an old darky called Sambo, who had rather an affection for his neighbor's hen roosts, but he went the way of all flesh and left a wife, and she prayed thus for Sambo, \"Oh, Sambo! Oh, Sambo! I hopes you is, where I knows you ain't,\" so I wished I was in Lytton at St. George's School, where I knew I wasn't.\nAddress of Bishop Adams, of Cariboo, B.C.:\n\nThe New England Company is not going to give up its work with the Indians of British Columbia entirely, and that is how Mr. Riggs came as an extra missionary to Lytton. It is part of his work to look after the old boys and girls who have left the school.\n\nI wish the Thompson Tribe to remember that the New England Company is continuing the work that built the old school.\n\nAddress by Rev. Mr. Ditham, superannuated Anglican clergyman, who founded the St. George's Indian School, at Lytton, B.C.:\n\nThis is the first school with Indian boys in Lytton, which was started at the old Court house. The school was a night school from 7 until 9, when it was dark.\n\nThe next school was at Yale. I had a fine lot of boys there, good boys; and then Bishop Sillitoe came and asked me to go to the girls' school to see if I could do something for them. I went to help the school and then came up to Jacob's Mt., Gus Benson had a hotel which we bought for $400.00, lock, stock and barrel. We took that land to establish a school. It was a good school, and was called an industrial school. One day a lad, now an Indian teacher, was going down to Yale, and saw a sheep running away, and he couldn't catch it, and after the sheep came Mr. Small in his cassock, and after him came Mr. Edwards in his cassock, with a big knife. They had a bad time at that school. Sometimes hadn't much to eat. Mr. Keefers, the C.P.R. engineer, after whom Keefers was named, used to get them over on Sundays, and other times, and give them a feed. They sometimes had nothing to eat down there. They did not know how to kill a sheep, and the sheep got away.\n\nAfter the Yale school was established, Bishop Sillitoe and Mr. Moody, who was on the court of the New England Company at Yale girls' school, and Sister Althea, who was instrumental with her father in having me look around to find out a suitable location to build a boys' school. I went to a good deal of trouble about it, and after a while decided to buy Tom Seward's ranch, and my commission from Mr. Moody was to come up to Lytton and lick it into shape, and I think I licked it into shape. The New England Company wished to provide education for Indian children. No man's work is more telling than building up and making a people. That was a doubtful question at one time, \"Mr. Ditham,\" said Mr. Lett \"built up the school,\" and Mr. Lett called me an old man; and Mr. Moody told me to lick that school into shape, he better be careful I don't lick him.\n\nMr. Lett: The boys know it sometimes takes a little licking to keep it in shape.\nAddress by Rev. G. H. Raley, of the United Church of Canada, and Principal of the Coqualeetza Residential School, at Sardis, B.C.:\n\nMr. Chairman, Archbishop, Lord Bishop, Ladies and Gentlemen:\n\nI am very pleased this afternoon to be here, but I can assure you my words will be few.\n\nIt was perhaps through the New England Company, I might say, that in 1898 I had the pleasure of crossing over to a little Island church in Ontario in order to take the opportunity of preaching for one year at this place in the place of the Rev. Mr. Roberts to a number of Troquois Indians, and I think it was that touch with the Indian people that caused me in 1891 to come to British Columbia, and from that time to this I have been enjoying the work with the Indians, especially amongst the boys and girls.\n\nNow I wish to say to you boys and girls here that your school life is part of you, it is part of your heart and soul, and when you go out of St. George's School you will carry in your heart part of the school, part of St. George's School, and you must try to be a credit to your school.\n\nWhen I was leaving for this visit to St. George's School, I asked Peter Antoine, a boy who used to attend St. George's School, what he would like me to say to the boys of St. George's School, and he said for me to wish you luck, and I do, I wish you luck from myself and my school and from Peter Antoine. I wish you every success now and every success in the future.\n\nI hope that what you are taught in St. George's School will become such a habit that you will always carry this teaching with you, and become an influence for good in your home and on your reserves. That you will always remember the good teaching of Mr. and Mrs. Lett, and I extend to both you and them the good wishes for every success of the Coqualeetza School.\n\nAddress by Rev. A. H. Lett, Principal of the St. George's Residential School, Lytton, B.C.:\n\nThe Archbishop, the Bishop, representatives of the New England Co., representatives of the Department of Indian Affairs, the Chief and Chiefs of the Tribes of the Thompson Valley, and friends:\n\nThis is the occasion in the history of St. George's School second, I suppose, to only one. If I said it was the first or greatest, Dr. Bitchen would make an objection.\nAddress by Rev. Mr. Lett (cont'd)\n\nobjection because I said it was the greatest. He would say, \"No, the first is the greatest, then the first school was started. The first occasion should be termed the greatest when the old school was built up on the hill.\" We have Mr. Ditchan with us today, and I am sure he will be glad to tell us how that foundation was laid and how he started the school. I, myself, am very proud, very proud indeed in taking a secondary place. Last night when at the consecration of that great chief David Spintlum, Mr. Ditchan said that he was the cause of all this advanced education of the children. I do not intend to go over the history of the school. Since I have been principal I have reached that stage in my life which is the happiest of my life and I am this day one of the happiest men, I think, in the school. To the Indians I might say that we have now a home, thanks to David Spintlum, thanks to the New England Company, thanks to the Department of Indian Affairs. We are proud of our Indian school at Lytton, and we are proud to say that we have children to put in there. I can only say that I have put my whole heart and soul into the work of this school. I had hoped that we might have had the honour of having with us men representative of the Department at Ottawa, and also of the Government, and I have here a few regrets to read before I call upon the next speaker.\n\nRev. Mr. Lett:\n\nOn behalf of the school I want to say that we have room for fifty more children, and would like to feel in my heart that it is in the heart of every Indian father and mother to send their boy or girl to St. George's School next term. We are here to do the very best we can for them. We will work and do all we possibly can to educate them and look after their welfare. We have three children in High School at the present time and are buying the Entrance Examinations. St. George's School will show the Indian Department and everybody else concerned that we are maintaining a high average and, I am sure, we will have boys and girls who will be credit to us. We have now one boy taking High School work thanks to Mr. Raley at Coquale whom thank God, is going in Holy Orders. That boy is Peter Antonio. I also wish to say that the Department money will not be thrown away as long as Mr. Lett is principal of St. George's School.\n\nAddress of Mr. Chubb, Member of the Court of the New England Company, London, Eng-\n\nMay I say something first of all about myself? For a great number of years it has been my greatest desire to visit British Columbia. Everything I have every heard and read about British Columbia has only intensified that desire, but to one living in London, England, a man busy in the city, with very few holidays to look forward to, such a desire has very little chance of ever being fulfilled. Now, at the end of a long and not too well spent life, I find myself at last transported to your wonderful and beautiful country, and, if I may say so, in the midst of the most\nAddress of Mr. Chubb, (cont'd.)\n\nhospitable and charming people, and to add to my pleasure,\nI have been sent out here by the New England Company to\nrepresent them at the opening of your beautiful building.\n\nI want to say something about the New\nEngland Company. I find that many people entirely mis-\nunderstand the company, and what it stands for. The name\nseems as if it ought to be a commercial company; as though\nit should be the New England Company Limited. There is\nnothing limited about the New England Company except its\nnumbers and the good things it would like to do if it only\nhad the money and the opportunity. The New England Company\nis a very old missionary society. It is three hundred\nyears old, and was begun by the efforts of Oliver Cromwell.\nShortly after his time it got a charter from Charles II, a\nmonarch who did not interest himself particularly in\nmissionary endeavor, but it was in his time that the com-\npany was formed, and a great and good man, called Robert\nBoyle, became the first governor, and from that time for\nabout one hundred years the work was carried on by mission-\naries near Boston, Mass.\n\nYou will remember that towards the end of\nthe 18th century we had certain political differences\nbetween American and the old country. The company trans-\nferred its activities to the other side of the St. Lawrence,\nand settled in Canada, and there the work has been carried\non nearly ever since amongst the Indian people of the Six\nNations at Niagara. This is the greatest part of the New\nEngland Company's work, but about thirty years ago this\nproperty here was bought and the old school, which is still\nstanding, was then built, and the good work which has been\ncarried on for thirty years is due entirely to the work of\ntwo men, and those two men are, first of all, Mr. Pitcher,\nthe great pioneer of the early days, and Mr. Lett, who came\nforward at a very difficult time, and helped the school\nthrough considerable trouble. To those two gentlemen the\nNew England Company owes a very considerable debt of\ngratitude, and, in the name of the New England Company, I\nhave to thank them both very sincerely for what they have\ndone.\n\nA few years ago, the company heard with some\nsorrow, that the school buildings were in very bad repair,\nand were not suited to modern requirements, and when it was\nproposed that the school should be transferred to the\nIndian Department of the Dominion, the company was very\nglad to fall in with that proposal, and I want to say here and\nnow, that the company feel very grateful indeed to the Indian\nDepartment for the help that they gave to the company during\nthose negotiations, and to Dr. Scott himself on behalf of the\nDepartment, the company feel they owe a great debt of\ngratitude for all the kindness and courtesy in his dealing\nwith the company.\n\nDr. Scott also\nAddress of Mr. Chubb (cont'd)\n\nDr. Scott also proposed that a memorial tablet should be put up in the hall of this school, to commemorate the connection of the New England Company with the school. That memorial has been made, and it is a very beautiful thing, but it has not come. It has been sent over and is somewhere in Ottawa, but we hoped it would have been put up before this meeting. On the border of this memorial we have put the English rose and the maple leaf at each side, in order to express the love of the company for you both nationally and individually.\n\nI have now to carry out the duty with which I have been charged today, and that is to tell you how fully in heart and mind the New England Company is with you today, and how sincerely they trust that the work that they began thirty years ago may go on and prosper more and more as the years go by.\n\nAddress by Sub-Chief Harry Thom, of Sparrum Indian Reserve, Lytton Band, Thompson Tribe of Indians - to the Representatives of the New England Company:\n\nGentlemen, we are very pleased to meet you here today to hear what you said, that you have come here to see us. We have listened to what you said about how you built the school for us; how you started building the school for us to help educate our children. And now through you they have a nice house to live in today. If they are well taken care of we will be only too pleased to have them come here. The Indians will all be only too pleased to have them come here, and attend school; and I thank you gentlemen for helping us out to educate our children.\n\nAddress by John Raphael, Chief of the Lytton Band, Thompson Tribe of Indians:\n\nI haven't much more to say outside what my friend has just said, but I appreciate it very much what you have done for us.\n\nAddress by Henry James, Chief of the Spuzzum Band, Thompson Tribe of Indians:\n\nI am very pleased to have met the representatives of the New England Company, and thank them for their kindness to the Indians and their children.\nAddress by W. B. Pitchburn, Esq., Indian Commissioner for British Columbia:\n\nMr. Chairman, Archbishop, Lord Bishop,\nLadies and Gentlemen, and Indians of the Thompson Tribe:\n\nAfter having listened to such fluent addresses from these different gentlemen, who have covered the ground so well, I can hardly know what you can expect me to say on this occasion, because it has left very little to be said in the way of sentiment and appreciation. It is possible, however, that I may be able to give some information as to the amount of work the Department of Indian Affairs has done for the Indians of British Columbia on educational lines. I had fully hoped that the Deputy Superintendent General would have been here, and he fully expected to be present, but he did not remain in session so long, and only prolonged this last Monday. However, I think he will pay British Columbia a visit this summer, and I am sure he will take great pleasure in coming to Lytton, and pride in visiting St. George's School.\n\nThe completion of this school, while it is only one of the many in the links of the Department's chain of education, shows evidence of the desire of the Department to endeavor to put the Indian children of British Columbia on the same plane educationally as their white brothers, provided those Indians will take the opportunity of allowing their children to become educated. There are facilities in this school, and in all other residential schools just as good for making first class scholars and students, as are in the Public Schools of the Province for white children. In fact, I am pleased to say, to those who do not have the opportunity very often of visiting Indian schools, that the progress made by these Indian children is remarkable when they pay any sort of attention to their studies, and when you take into consideration the fact that these Indian children only study on the half time system the progress they make is marvelous. It is really wonderful how they get along, and I can assure you that compared with white children the progress made by Indian children is equal, if not better than that made by white children.\n\nWe have in British Columbia sixteen or seventeen residential schools of the same class as this. We also have in the Province, forty-two day schools. The Department finds it necessary to establish day schools. We prefer residential schools, as it is more permanent, but in many cases the day school is found necessary on account of the physical condition of the children. Ordinarily before a child can become a pupil of a residential school it must pass a medical examination, and only those who are qualified can enter; therefore it is necessary that the education of these others should be taken care of as far as possible under the circumstances.\n\nIn the sixteen residential schools there are 1700 pupils at the present time, and in the forty-two day schools where the education is more or less intermittent, approximately 1400. We have between 83 and 8400 Indians in British Columbia, and in the vicinity of 3200 children attending school, and as time goes on, facilities for attending will be improved.\n\nOur programme\nOur programme of construction is not complete by any means, and consists of the rebuilding of Indian schools and building of new ones. It is not many years since the Government of Canada decided that the education of the Indians should be a capital charge against the administration of the country, and therefore my Department, since that date, has been in a position to lay out a programme and consequently large amounts of money are being spent every year. When British Columbia first came into the Confederation in 1871 I don't think there were any schools in the Province. There were certainly none in Colonial days, and the Colonial Government put no expense whatever in the matter. In 1872, when British Columbia entered the Union, Indian education was then taken up more particularly by the Missionaries and Churches, assisted to a limited extent by the Department of Indian Affairs. It went along that way for a long time, with very little action on the part of the Government, but as time progressed the Missionary Societies called upon the Department for greater assistance, with the consequence that amounts have crept up tremendously, until about twenty years ago, the Department went into cooperation with the churches and societies on a fifty-fifty basis. The Church would spend so much and the Government a like sum until the last few years at which time the whole cost of the Indian education was taken over by the Government, assisted to some extent by the churches and Missionary Societies. As an illustration of that statement, I will tell you that for the first seven years after 1871, the total amount of money spent by the Government was only $12,000.00; from 1881 to 1891, it jumped to $71,000.00; from 1891 to 1900, it was $451,000.00; from 1900 to 1910, it rose to $766,000.00, and in the next ten years it overdoubled at a cost of $1,694,604, and during the last eight years a sum or over $6,000,000 has been spent. I think it only fair that I should let the general public know to what extent the Department is going in its endeavours to place the Indian children in a very real position to get a fair education. It is not our fault if the Indians themselves do not take advantage of the opportunities offered.\n\nNew schools have been built at Sechelt, Kuper Island, Sardis, Fraser Lake, Cranbrook, Kamloops, and lastly, this beautiful school at Lytton. On the programme the schools to be built are a new school at Alert Bay, and another will be necessary for the Indians in the Chilcoten country, and also one near Prince Rupert, also the old school at Mission Junction will have to be replaced by a new one in the very near future.\n\nWhen that programme is finished, I think that the Department will feel that it has done all that it is necessary to do to afford a reasonable amount of education amongst the Indians. I know that these schools are doing good work, how good I will leave to Mr. Cairns to tell you as he is the Inspector of Indian Schools and keeps trace of what advance is being made in education.\n\nI cannot think of anything more to say except to express my pleasure at being present at the opening of this beautiful school, which has taken the place of the school on the hill, which has outlived its purpose.\nAddress by Mr. R. H. Cairns, Inspector of Indian Schools of British Columbia:\n\nI am very pleased to have the opportunity of standing before you and telling you a few things about our school system.\n\nA few years ago we found ourselves in peculiar circumstances. We had no Course of Study nor authorized text books for our Indian Schools. For instance a teacher would come here from Prince Edward Island say, and ask, \"What books have you got?\" We would have to say \"We have no books of any sort. No Course of Study of our own.\" As the capital of Canada is in Ontario, all our books came from there, and they had the viewpoint of Ontario. But we have changed that now. Although we have no Course of Study of our own, we unify our work in this way. Each Province has its own Course of Study and its own schoolbooks for Public Schools, so we use the text books and Course of Study of the Provincial Schools of each Province. That is, take St. George's School, we use the Course of Study and text books of British Columbia, as we do in all other schools for Indian children in this Province. The Indian Schools in Saskatchewan use the authorized books of that Province; and so on throughout Canada.\n\nToday we have a number of young people educated in our Indian schools who are taking a course following out their Public School course with advanced work, where they work in High School or college side by side with children of the white schools; and according to the last report, we have in Canada 190 pupils who have finished their Public School course and are now taking High School, Business College, University and other advanced work. In the case of these last, the Department assists. In our own Province, we have in round numbers 3000 pupils, and in a small population like this, there must be quite an influence on the Indian race, as we are turning out about two hundred pupils a year.\n\nAs an example of an Indian pupil taking advanced work and coming out with flying colors, take the case of a little Indian girl of the Haida tribe from the north. She was ten years of age, couldn't speak English and hadn't been inside a school in her life. She was brought down to Coghataetza, where she attended classes on the half time system. In the six years she passed her Entrance, which is less time than the average child takes in the white schools, where the course is for eight years full time. She went through High School, and then I had her sent to Normal. She got her teacher's certificate and went to teach in a school up in the Cariboo, where she taught for months. The trustees were very pleased with her teaching and had no idea she was an Indian, thinking she was French, so she did not meet them crying to the prejudice against Indians in some quarters - against an Indian teaching in a white school. But unfortunately for our experiment as to her future progress, she met a white man, married him, and is now living happily in domestic life near Fort Simpson.\nTHE CRUSADER.\n\nST GEORGE'S SCHOOL, LYTTON, B.C.\n\nEDITORIAL.\n\nThe term just closing is possibly the most important one in the history of St George's. First of all about the middle of April we left the old school to enter the fine new building, an event to which many of us had looked forward to with bated breath for a long time. But it was worth waiting for and we can all look forward to the future with renewed vision and brightened hopes.\n\nThe school was however not officially opened until June 15th when before a large and representative gathering the Arch Bishop dedicated the New Building to the education of the Indian children.\n\nThis service has been dealt with at length elsewhere, so I will pass on to other matters.\n\nAnother very important event in the life of the school was the confirmation of a large number of boys and girls by Bishop Adna, on Sunday 24th June. The service was a very impressive one and will be long remembered by all who were present.\n\nOn June the 17th the ladies of the Sunday School Van gave an address to the children who all listened very attentively.\n\nOur Sports Day May 26th was again very successful John Johnson winning the Bishop's Cup which is presented annually to the best all round athlete, and John Walker winning the Principal's Cup.\n\nIn spite of adverse circumstances the Cadets were highly commended by Capt. Currie, the Inspecting Officer for their discipline and the manner in which they executed the various movements and exercises in their Squad Drill and their Physical Training.\n\nA new venture in the school is the formation of a troop of Girl Guides and Boy Scouts, the girls in blue and the boys in khaki looking very fine and smart.\n\nWe are glad to report that this year we have three scholars taking High School work and six writing their Entrance Examinations. We wish them all success and will be looking eagerly for the results in a few weeks time, very confident that all the names will appear on the \"Pass\" list.\n\nJust one word in closing. I hope that all the children will remember Bishop Adna's message to them. Let us repeat it here.\n\n\"For this God is our God for ever and ever. He will be our guide unto death.\"\n\nMr and Mrs Lott and Staff all join with me in wishing you all a happy holiday.\n\nThe Editor.\nThe formal opening of the New Building of St George's Indian Residential School took place on the 15th inst. This marked an occasion in the history of the School, second only to its foundation by the New England Co (the oldest \"missionary Society existing\") in 1901.\n\nThe gathering was very representative of the community: the Indians, The Dept of Indian Affairs, The New England Co and the Church.\n\nThe proceedings opened by a short address by the Principal followed by the singing of 'O Canada' by the children. The Principal then took the primary part of the Dedication Service followed by the 'Nativity Prayers' by the Bishop of Cariboo in which district the school is situated.\n\nArchbishop De Banziger addressed the gathering and finished the service with the Blessing. During the service Psalms No. 127 and Hymn No. 606 were sung; both appropriate and in keeping with the service.\n\nThen followed speeches by the representatives of the Dept of the New England Co, Mr Batchelor, Mr Riley as representing the his school at Bardie and the United Church of Canada, and the chiefs of the Thompson Indians for whom children the School was founded built and rebuilt. We have now a modern Residential School very highly equipped in every department and will be a joy to the parents of the children under education here, to the children themselves and also to the Principal and his staff.\n\nEXTRACTS FROM THE REVIVAL SPEECHES DELIVERED:\n\nMr Lott opened the proceedings by saying that he welcomed all on behalf of the school. It was an occasion for rejoicing, an occasion in history second only to the foundation of the school by its first Principal, Mr Batchelor, and while he would like to call it the first yet he was proud to call it second and glad to be able on this occasion to be second to its first Grand Old Man.\n\nI have reached a place in my life Mr Lott continued which perhaps tops the happiest. We are now in a position to give every attention to the children committed to our care.\n\nLast night we took part in the dedication of a special Cross erected to the memory of that great Indian Chief David Spintlus. We have here to thank the Christian efforts of this most chief, the missionary efforts of the New England Co, and the sympathy and money spent by the Dept of Indian Affairs, for the magnificent new home we have just moved into and now are gathered together to open in the name of Our Father in Heaven, and the welfare of his lambs herein housed and to be housed.\nI have to present to you the report of the Hon. Senator Macdonald, the Hon. J.C. Stewart, and Mr. W.C. Scott Deputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs who have been detained by duties in Ottawa and not able to be here. All of whom wish every success to the new undertaking.\n\nThe Arch Bishop who spoke next took his audience back over the missionary history of the Church among the Indians and endeavored to compare the present Christian outlook with that of the early days of Islam, saying that the rapid development was an occasion of rejoicing for young and old alike.\n\nOnly sixty years ago the first Bishop of all British Columbia landed at Victoria. When the New Gas. Mills came to the new colony in 1850, three missionary clergy set out together with four others situated at New Westminster\u2014seven in all\u2014they visited the natives, traveling on horseback, and were struck with the grandeur and intelligence of the original inhabitants of the land of your fathers.\n\nThe first British Admiral who came out to chart the coast set aside Indians with orders of the \"friendly and peaceful\" returning with presents and under-Indian war councils\u2014under Chief Shanahan. The Admiral called in the missionaries and they the grandson of Chief Shanahan represented the Indians on the Synod of the Diocese of California, and was elected to represent the Diocese on the General Synod of all Canada.\n\nI have lately visited a little Indian village and in their church I had about 30 for confirmation. A church built by the Indians themselves. A young Indian with his band led the chief choir and an anthem was rendered again to another choir in the province. On the wall hung a tablet sacred to the glory of these young men of their tribe who fell in the Great War. These fine young men who were just as anxious to do their duty as were their white brothers are the results of the teaching of Church and School.\n\nLyttton there are I came to Lyttton and saw St George's School and admired the choice of situation and selection of lands for school purposes. I also met and had service with some 200 Indians in their church at Lyttton and have traveled up the Thompson and Fraser rivers holding confirmation services in all your churches. This work is now having its delightful result in the gathering and purpose of today.\n\nAnother story that I enjoyed was a visit to the Court of the New England Co in London Eng., and found a man who extended to a fellow traveller from across the sea. They have assured us of their undivided help toward the educational and church work among the Indians, and I am glad to be with them on the same platform to assist in the same service, and to assure them of every care of those to whom they had sent in the early days of 1901.\n\n\"Service is Life, for only through service can we live at our highest and best.\"\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6462, file 888-1, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSpeech of Mr. Umphr, Member of the Court of the New England Co.\n\nInterpreted by Miss L. Blackford.\n\nLytton, B.C.\n\nMay I say something first of all about myself? For a great number of years it has been my constant desire to visit British Columbia. Everything I have ever heard, seen or read about British Columbia has only intensified that desire, but to one living in London, England, busy in the city, with very few holidays to look forward to such a desire has very little chance of being fulfilled. Now at the end of a long and not too well spent life, I find myself at last transported to your wonderful and beautiful country, and if I may say so, in the midst of the most hospitable and charming people, and to add to my pleasure, I have been sent out here by the New England Co., to report upon them at the opening of your beautiful building.\n\nI want to say something about the New England Co. I find that many people entirely misunderstand the company, and want to stand far from it. The name alone or if it might be a commercial company; as though it should be the New England Co. Ltd. There is nothing started about the New England Co., except its history and the good things it would like to do if it only had the money and the opportunity. The New England Co., is a very old missionary society. It is three hundred years old, and was begun by the efforts of Oliver, a man who did not interest himself particularly in missionary endeavor, but it was in his time that the company was formed, and a great and good man, called William Penn, became the first governor, and from that time till for about one hundred years the work was carried on by missions started near Boston, Mass.\n\nYou will remember that towards the end of the 18th century we had certain political differences between America and the old country. The company transferred its activities to the other side of the St. Lawrence, and settled in Canada, and there the work has been carried on nearly ever since amongst the Indian people on the Six Nations at Niagara. That is the greatest part of the New England Company's work, but about thirty years ago this mission house was bought and the old school, which is still standing, was then built and the good work which had been carried on for thirty years is due entirely to the work of two men, and these two men are, first of all Mr. Dickens, the treasurers of the early days, and Mr. Lett, who came forward at a very difficult time, and helped the school through considerable trouble. To these two gentlemen the New England Co. owes a very considerable debt of gratitude, and in the name of the New England Co., I have to thank them both very sincerely for what they have done.\n\nA few years ago, the company heard that some concern that the school buildings were in very bad repair, and were not suited to modern requirements, and when it was proposed that this school should be transferred to the Indian Dept., as the Indians, the company was very glad to fall in with that proposal, and I want to say here and now that the company feels very grateful indeed to the Indian Dept. for all the help that they gave to the company during those negotiations and to Dr. Scott himself on behalf of the Dept., the company feels it owes him a debt of gratitude for all the kindness and courtesy in his dealings with the company.\n\nDr. Scott also proposed that a memorial tablet should be put up in the hall of this school, to commemorate the connection of the New England Co. with the school. That memorial has been made, and it is a very beautiful thing, but it has not come. It has been sent over and it is somewhere in Ottawa, but we hoped it would have been put up before this meeting.\nput up before this meeting. On the border of this material we have put the English rose and the maple leaf at each side, in order to express the love of the company for you both nationally and individually. I have now to carry out the duty with which I have been charged today and that is to tell you how fully in heart and mind the New England City is with you today, and how sincerely they trust that the work that they began thirty years ago may go on and prosper more and more as the years go by.\n\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF INDIAN EDUCATION.\n\nMr. Ditchburn Indian Commissioner for B.C. spoke on the development of Indian education in the province beginning with the period immediately after confederation, pointing out that the rate of education had increased very rapidly and during the period of 51 years beginning with 1871 the Dept. of Indian Affairs has spent $6 million and a half of dollars towards the academic uplift of the boys and girls of Indian parentage. Today there are 16 residential schools handling 1700 children and 42 day schools with an average attendance of approximately 1400.\n\nThe program of construction was not in-sufficient and the Dept. wished to conclude this program as rapidly as possible so that the children out of a population of some 25,000 Indians in B.C. could be simply cared for adequately.\n\nThe Dept. of Indian Affairs was now co-operating with the several churches and should be a means in this way of Christian growth as well as spreading broadening of mind and intellect.\n\nThe aim of the Dept. was to give the Indian child an equal opportunity for development side by side with his white brother and so endeavor to make them responsible citizens and co-workers in the future growth of this fair Dominion.\n\nMr. R.H. Cairns Inspector of Indian Schools told of the development of Class Room work. The organization had now developed to the stage where the curriculum of the province was a workable factor in the schools, resulting in the fact that 171 Indian children were taking High School and other advanced work. Normal Training Depots were being established and it should not take many years before results in this important line of education should be seen.\n\nMr. Riley Principal of Sequaletza Institute expressed his gratitude in being able to be present at this important function in the history of St. George's School. Milestone No. 2 has arisen and I wish to tender the hearty good wishes for your success on behalf of himself staff and children and also for his church.\n\nIn speaking to the children he said that the ideal and its teaching would become part of their very being and hoped that as they physically grew to man and womanhood that they would individually and collectively be a credit to their mother school.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6462, file 888-1, part 3)\nThe Bitcha, first principal of St. George's School spoke of the first night school of 4 or 5 Indian boys, who ran away at first when they saw him, saying \"Sai-seo 'ni-do'\" (meaning Ghost) but found that this feeling of fright did not last long as the boys quickly responded to his teaching and love.\n\nA school was established at Yale for boys and afterwards a party at the foot of Jackson Mountain was bought for $400-00 and an attempt was made to establish there. Eventually the present site was chosen which marked the beginning of Indian education.\n\n---\n\nTHE PRINCIPAL'S MESSAGE:\n\nI am glad to be allowed to write a little message for I want to say how thankful we ought to be to the people of Canada and our English friends for taking such interest in us and giving us such a wonderful school.\n\nNow in nut there are two very necessary parts, the shell and the kernel. You have got a splendid shell and the boys and girls by your work and conduct make the kernel, and that really is the most important.\n\nOn the opening day when we were all gathered in the gymnasium everybody seemed so hopeful, I shut my eyes and wondered what the school and the Indians would be like in 30 years time\u2014well it depends upon a lot of very important persons, who generally are really not so bad after all.\n\nTHE PRINCIPAL OF ST. GEORGE'S SCHOOL.\n\n---\n\nI just want to say a word to you about our newly formed motto. The word \"George\" is taken direct from the Greek and means \"husband man\". We have added the word \"work\" and \"HOLY\" which translated as the words stand means \"The Holy Husbandry of God\".\n\nThe motto perhaps is obvious taken from the Greek as it is yet our readers will see that it covers our situation very nicely. To God we are dedicated to care for the children whom God has committed to our hands are workers of the human soil and builders of character. The spirit and love of our Father must govern our every thought and action and while we do take from of fine old heart and the young souls develop, we must turn to their life work and in looking over our surroundings one sees that our leading trade taught in agriculture, so we must turn our eyes in fruiting a noble the name of our patron saints and do in a presentation of our work as caring for souls as well as nourishing the tillers of the soil. We pray God that our work among these young Georgians may be the basis of such training that will make them God fearing citizens of the Kingdom of Heaven and law abiding citizens of our fair Dominion.\n\nWe have had a heavy year but thankful that the term is ending.\nThe Principal's Message\n\n(continued)\n\nvery happily and everyone is happy in the new house so lately formally opened and dedicated to God. Having personally had an opportunity to thank those who so nobly assisted in the success of the work and program, we would do so again through our quarterly magazine.\n\nThe term has come to an end abruptly as it were and we feel somewhat behind in the work of the school yet in good shape to begin the new life just dawning and trust that after our needed vacation we shall be ready to put into effect our dream of the past years. The spirit lying dormant has arisen with fresh vigor so that we hope to see great things accomplished in our future.\n\nOur numbers have increased but still have room for some forty children. We would therefore ask that the parents of children and others interested will renew their faith and the faithfulness of Alumni should see our new building filled to capacity.\n\nMay the Great Architect preserve and keep you throughout the vacation. Remember that every individual has a plot in their own soul to work and cultivate. You should therefore take the greatest care to give to your Father in heaven the best service possible.\n\nCONFIRMATION SERVICE\n\nSunday June the 24th was a red letter day in the spiritual life of our school when the Principal presented thirty-three candidates to the Bishop of Cariboo for confirmation. This is the largest class that has ever been presented at one time. These boys and girls will receive their first communion on Friday morning just before going out for vacation. Rev. W.W. Watson missionary at Lytton will celebrate.\n\nCANADA'S BIRTHDAY\n\nThe birthday of our Dominion on the first of July awakens only pleasant recollections. Looking back we see how patriotism had a rebirth at Confederation. It became possible for all Canadians to think and speak of Canada as \"my own my native land.\" They were able to pronounce their desires and opinions with the voice of a united powerful nation. They could with united soul and force offer needed assistance to the Empire in times of necessity.\n\nWe have the example of the Christian Church, with its Christmas Easter and other great festivals to prove to us the exercising force of commemorations. That the Church even to these celebrations can never be provincialistic.\n\nCanada needs Dominion Day to keep it up to the mark in patriotism and loyal enterprise. It is ours to realise and expand the ideals of the Fathers of Confederation.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6462, file 888-1, part 3)\nCONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE CHILDREN TO THE CHURCH.\n\nOUR NEW SCHOOL\n\nby\n\nOur new school has been planned for some time, but it was not until last August that the contractors began work on it. It is two or three times larger than the old school, so there were quite a lot of contractors, bricklayers and others working on it.\n\nIn the winter when it was very cold part of the crew had to be lay off because the bricklayers could not go on during the cold weather. But while this cold weather was on none of the inside work was done.\n\nWe moved into the new school just after Easter. We got all the furniture down that was needed during the day, then after we had our last supper in the old school we put all our private belongings and bedclothes and started them to the new school.\n\nWe were all very glad to get down to our new house because everything is better and so much more comfortable than in the old school.\n\nTHE GIRL GUIDES\n\nby\n\nOur girl guides company started about two months after our holidays last year. Miss Richard is our Leader. We now have four patrols with eight girls in each. They are called the \"Forest Patrol,\" \"Tri royal,\" \"Buffalo\" and \"Flag Bear\" patrols.\n\nWe have our girl guide meeting on Mondays and Saturdays. We have camping trips and hikes during the summer. We must tell you of a girl guide picnic we had this year on Annapolis Bay, up at a place we call forty seven. First we fitted up our pavilion for two weeks, then we arranged to have the truck to take us there. Then we arrived at our chosen spot for the picnic, we had half an hour rest just before dinner. We divided our group into four parts such as the wood patrol cooking patrol water patrol and serving patrol.\n\nAfter our dinner we had a wonderful afternoon spent on exploring, getting off trail and treasure hunting. We brought a lot of wild flowers and brought up of shrubs down, the colors and beauty of which were very beautiful.\n\nWhen we finished our supper we waited for the truck to come back for us, our umbrellas and our flowers shrubs and plants.\n\nAt last the trucks arrived and we all climbed on for the homeward trip.\n\nWe had a concert during the winter and made enough money to get our hats belts shoulder straps and badges.\n\nOur sewing room patron and a few of the girls and our dresses, and soon we will all be in full uniform.\n\n\"I'M PREPARED!\"\nTo the Representatives\nof the\nNEW TIMLA D COMPANY\n\nCHIEFS\n\nSub-Chief Harry Thompson of Sparrow Indian Band, The Lytton Tribe of Indians says:\n\nGentlemen, we are very pleased to meet here today to hear what you have said, that you have come here to assist us. We have listened to what you said about how you build the school for us; how you started building the school for us to help educate our children, and now through you they may have a nice house to live in tomorrow. If they are well taken care of we will be only too pleased to have them come here. The Indians will all be very pleased to have them attend school, and I thank you gentlemen for helping us out to educate our children.\n\nJohn Raphael, Chief of the Lytton Band, The Lytton Tribe of Indians says:\n\nI haven't much more to say outside what my friend has just said, but I am grateful for very much what you have done for us.\n\nHenry James, Chief of the Sparrow Band, The Sparrow Tribe of Indians says:\n\nI am very pleased to have met the representatives of the New Timla D Company, and thank them for their kindness to the Indians and their children.\n\n---\n\n\"Fight the good fight with all thy might,\nChrist is thy strength and Christ thy right.\nJoy hold on life, and it shall be\nThy joy and crown eternally.\"\n\nRun the straight race through God's wide arms.\nLift up thine eyes and look His face.\nLife with its way before us lies.\nChrist is the path and Christ the prize.\nRev.

It is, however, understood in respect of the last mentioned licence that it is doubtful if the flow of the various springs is greater than the domestic requirements.\n\nWith respect to Conditional Water Licences 7857/3, the time for completion of works and putting water to beneficial use does not expire until the 1st November 1930.\n\nThe time for completion of works and putting water to beneficial use authorized under Conditional Water Licence 687, Botanie Creek, was limited to the 1st November 1920, and the report of the District Engineer, submitted in 1922, disclosed\nthat none of the appurtenant land had been irrigated. The Department of Indian Affairs, however, in 1925 obtained possession of the land and applied for an extension of time for two years. The application is held pending a report by the District Engineer on the Botanie Creek licences, and until his recommendation has been made I am unable to state to what extent, if any, the water is being used.\n\nAs it is understood from your letter that the matter is urgent, I would suggest your communicating with Mr. Varcoe in this particular.\n\nAccording to our records the above recited licences are the only ones issued appurtenant to the lands described by you. The Department of Indian Affairs is not required to pay an annual rental.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nChas. A.

In reply I have to inform you that the Department makes this special grant, when Indian residential school pupils are attending a nearby high school or collegiate, or when an extra teacher is employed for high school work only. There are many high school pupils in Indian residential schools where no extra grant is given, as the advanced students are enrolled in the regular senior classroom at the school.\n\nYou might inform the Department just what arrangement is made for these four pupils at St. George's, and then I will be in a position to know if any special payment can be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Asst.

A. R.

The customs authorities are unable to arrive at a valuation and require the invoice showing the cost.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will forward, at your early convenience, the invoice or a certified copy of same direct to Rev.

In employing the teacher I had this in mind and set her salary accordingly, feeling that no difficulty would be in the way.\n\nI trust that you will find the above of sufficient assurance to warrant the issuing of the grant.\n\nYours very obediently\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nOttawa, October 11, 1928.\n\nRev.

This grant is in excess of the usual per capita grant allowed. It will be paid separately during the quarter ending June 30, 1929, upon receipt of a request from you for the amount due.

GEORGE'S SCHOOL SEPTEMBER 1928 LYTTON BRITISH COLUMBIA\n\nEDITORIAL PAGE\n\nThe holidays to which we all looked forward so eagerly are over, and oh! how quickly the weeks flew by. I am sure that we all enjoyed them however and are so much better for them that now at the beginning of this new term we are ready to put in a good year's work. The class rooms have all been reorganised and are doing good work. The Girl Guides and Cadets have made a good beginning with their Fall and Winter program. Both of these activities will be dealt with elsewhere in this issue.\n\nA new departure this term is the giving of physical training and organised games to the intermediates and the juniors. We trust that it will be the means of building them up into strong healthy boys.\n\nEveryone is looking forward with a great deal of curiosity and interest to the entertainment that the boys are giving on the 1st of November. We hope that those boys and girls whose parents live in or near Lytton will write to them and tell them about it. The boys say that it is going to be the best entertainment ever held in St George's.\n\nWe are glad to see quite a number of new boys and girls in the School this term. We hope that they will be happy in their new homes.\n\nWe extend to the new members of the staff a hearty welcome to our School. Each one in his or her own sphere is doing a work which is bound to have a lasting influence on the lives of the children.\n\nWe would draw your attention to the front cover of our magazine which is the work of John James, and also to the back cover the work of Jane James. This is the result of a competition which was held amongst the senior boys and girls. Prizes were given by the Boys' Supervisor and the Girls' Matron. We congratulate all of those who took part on the very fine work which was produced, some of which is reproduced in this issue.\n\nWe hope that all the boys and girls in all grades will work hard this term, and we wish both Staff and children all success in their work.\n\nTHE EDITOR\nTHE PRINCIPAL'S PAGE\n\nThe vacation has expired and the school is again in full session. While the children have enjoyed the holiday of six long weeks at home, we find that they have returned with smiling faces evidently ready for a good year's work.\n\nSince the new school has become a reality, there have been three or four new depts. in our work opened up. The continuation class room will afford opportunity of high school to four of our children who were successful in their entrance to high school exams. Another room has been opened up which we term the \"Opportunity class room\". Here we are trying out a new phase of work. A number of children who have lately entered school are of advanced age, ranging from 12 to 16 years. We can not do more than teach them the \"three Rs\". We are specializing in domestic training for the girls, such as sewing, laundry and kitchen work, etc., for the boys in the different departments of agriculture, and in the manual training room. The manual training dept which the new school has made possible has already proved its attraction for the boys. Creative ability is highly noticeable and we hope that during the year great results will be acquired.\n\nPrizes are being offered for proficiency in all depts. both for the boys and the girls, which will be given at the year's work. Class room prizes are also being offered in each grade.\n\nSome good news has come to us of late. We note that the Dept of Indian Affairs are contemplating moving our Chapel, which when accomplished will be a spiritual vacancy filled. We wish this work God speed. A store room is also being contemplated. Being short of storage capacity we feel that the Dept. is seeing into our wants in time to prevent any great loss which may occur owing to the lack of room to store our extra furniture tools, etc.\n\nA new dairy will be built shortly of concrete construction with modern equipment installed. We should be able to take good care of the milk which is such a necessity for the health of the children. In passing I might say that the children at the present time are consuming per capita, one and a quarter quart of milk per day.\n\nThe farm on the whole has had a good year. We have just finished harvesting the third crop of alfalfa, and are now busy allowing twelve acres of corn. Potatoes and mangles are still yet to be harvested.\n\nOur numbers have increased and we are expecting shortly to have 150 children in the school.\n\nWe are glad that the Boy Scout and Cadet movements for the boys and the Girl Guides for the girls are being continued. These organisations are working wonders with the children.\n\nThe new personnel on the staff are carefully working into their the grooves allotted to each, and all are on the whole looking forward to renewed life for the new era just begun. We all I am sure realise the importance of our individual positions in playing our parts in one whole organization and I hope with a prayer in our heart we trust that God in his infinite mercy will be our guide in this greatest wonderful work\u2014the education of the Indian children of the Thompson tribes of B.C.\nTHE CRUSADER\n\nACROSS THE SEA\n\nP.C. Merratt.\n\nTRAVEL to some of us, is an experience, to all it is part of our education. To myself, during my trip from England to Canada it was both. Amongst other things, the awfulness and beauty of the ocean was shown to me as well as the care that is exercised by the shipping companies in transporting passengers across the sea.\n\nNow take with me in your imagination, an ocean trip from Southampton England to Quebec Canada. The whole of the wharf to which the ship is tied is bustle and excitement as passengers endeavor to make their way to the ship upon which they are sailing. Cars rush to and fro, porters loaded with the grips of passengers hurry from shore to ship and back again fearful lest they shall lose a goodly portion, cranes groan under the weight of their loads, the winches shriek and strain as pressure is put upon them, passengers rush hither and thither to see to the last of their baggage, and friends rush after them in case they shall be lost in the maze of corridors and last goodbyes must be said over the ship's side to those on the wharf.\n\nHoot! Hoot! The ships siren shrieks its warning and the cry of \"All visitors ashore\" comes from the deep throated members of the crew. Goodbyes are brisk partings quickly over and the last visitor has descended to the shore; the gangway slides from the side of our ship, ropes and hawsers are loosened and all is ready to head out to sea. Already the little tugs attached to bow and stern are snorting away like growling puppies on a leash, anxious to pull the great ship into the wider water.\n\nA further shriek from the siren and we are off, slowly but surely our ship gathers speed, our tugs have done their work and are heading for the open. Away behind us the shore fades away into a mist, and sentimental members of our band crowd to the stern rail and watch old England disappear from sight.\n\nNow all the passengers are not aboard yet for we have to pick up some more at Cherbourg on the coast of France, but fog and mist delays us and by this time we reach there night has settled and the fog has thickened. So dark is the night and so thick the fog that it is impossible for any big ship to enter port so she drops anchor out side and patiently awaits the coming of the tender from the shore that shall bring aboard the extra passengers. Soon the shrieking of a siren announces that the tender is approaching and our ship sends a reply, and then from out of the fog appears a multitude of lights which slowly take the form of a ship. This is what we are waiting for. It is truly a wonderful sight. Now she is alongside she has dropped her anchor, a gangway is put across between the two ships and the passengers begin to come aboard. Again there is much hustle and excitement but the whole business does not take long, and all being over we set sail again to the accompaniment of \"Bon voyage\" from the sailors on the tender, and the screech and rattle of chains as the anchor ascends from its ocean bed.\n\nHoot! Hoot! is the constant cry of our ship as she ploughs her way through mist and foam, and from the distance comes an answering hoot from some other ship whose lights we can dimly discern on the starboard.\n\nThe hour is now late and it is time for us to descend to our cabin, a tiny room but very compact with two beds fixed to the wall one bed over the other. It is easy for the man that sleeps in the\nlower bed, but the man who sleeps on top has a little climbing to do before he can lie down. Sleep comes easily for the motion of the ship is more conducive to sleep than the rocking of a baby's cradle. Morning with the steward and a cup of tea, comes all too soon, but the smell of breakfast acts as a magnet to those who are hungry and one is nearly always hungry at sea.\n\nBreakfast is now over and we wander on deck, gaze at the sea, talk to fellow passengers, perhaps read a book, or write a letter or perhaps we play some game such as quoits, shuffleboard, deck tennis or the like. At night after supper we read play cards or dance; anything for amusement, and as we play the ship continues her steady way across the ocean with the Captain and his officers constantly on the lookout for anything that may arise.\n\nSo the days pass on, full as we like to make them or as empty as it is possible for a day to be. Days and dates are lost right count of, only the number of the days aboard or the number of days to come are remembered.\n\nIt is now the sixth or seventh day and all is agog with excitement. Fellow passengers in the dining room ask us \"Have you seen them?\" \"What?\" \"The berg,\" and as soon as breakfast is over we rush up on deck to view the sights. There they stand great masses of ice many times larger than this school, but as soon as they get into the gulf stream they will melt and become mere spots on the ocean.\n\nNext day there's the cry \"Land have you seen it?\" and looking away to our right we can dimly make out the coastline of Labrador, and there on the left Newfoundland.\n\n(In this little trip we have not been worried with sea-sickness\u2014good for us that we have not for it is one of the most unpleasant experiences to encounter. In my own short attack of one evening's duration, to die or feel the ship sinking would have been a pleasure.)\n\nThe great ship carries on; each minute brings us a clearer view of the land ahead; each turn of the screw nearer to the land of our desire, yet farther from the bleak Home Country.\n\nNow the land has become quite close; now we can see houses now cars moving along the road and here comes two tiny tugs to pull us into dock. Our sailors now throw rope to the waiting tug and as soon as these are attached the little tugs commence their work and tow their large sisters to the place where she is destined to rest.\n\nAs we near the shore more ropes are thrown and the ocean greyhound is made fast, the gangway is hoisted to the side of the ship, the ship settles down to a well earned rest and the passengers hurry to the shore glad to feel terra firma beneath them once again.\n\n\"Press on! If once or twice thy feet Step back and stumble, harder try,\nFrom him who never fears to meet Danger and death, they're sure to fly.\"\nTHE CRUSADER\n\nTHE FORMATION OF THE \"GUIDE COMPANY\"\n\nMargaret McIntyre\n\nLAST year in the month of October one of the teachers of the School, who once belonged to a company of guides, suggested the idea to the girls of forming a company of Guides.\n\nOne evening we all assembled in the recreation room, and sat down in a semicircle in front of the speaker. All were very much interested, and when the question was brought up, as to whether we would agree to the idea or not, you could hear nothing but a chorus of 'yes yes' from the girls.\n\nOur Captain picked out three girls whom she thought would be capable of being leaders, and seconds to assist them. This all met with our approval. The first thing, the leaders and seconds had to get busy and learn the Guide Laws, Guide Promise and useful knots, so as to pass their Tenderfoot tests.\n\nA friend of our Captain came for a few Saturdays and gave us lectures on being Guides. It was all very interesting. When the leaders and seconds passed their tests, they then got busy and trained the patrols for their tests.\n\nWe have every Wednesday evening and Saturday afternoon for Guide meetings and how we look forward to those days. We open the meeting by singing the National Anthem, then inspection takes place. After that we play competing games, and conclude the meeting with a sing-song.\n\nThe next question was about our uniforms. That was soon settled for the girls got up a concert and made enough to supply the company with belts and hats. The sewing matron and the girls were kept busy making our uniforms, but it was not very long before we were all equipped.\n\nWe were all excited when our Captain told us that our Commissioner was coming to enroll some of our Guides. At last the day arrived. We were determined to look our best. We took our solemn vow the Guide Promise in the new School which was not yet complete. We had little pins shaped like a clover leaf with our motto \"Be Prepared\" on them, pinned on our ties.\n\nWe are now all trying very hard for our second-class pins, which are more difficult but more interesting to obtain.\n\n##############\n\nTHE BOYS LABOR DAY PICNIC.\n\nFRANCIS WALKER\n\nWe packed up in the morning to go for a picnic, then we started off across the Fraser river on the ferry boat. We started to walk on the other side of the river until we saw a little stream running by and there we stopped for lunch. The boys began to play among the trees and bushes and across fences and back again to the shore. We went down to where we were before, and started making the fire to cook our dinner. After dinner we walked to David Spencer's fruit ranch where we got some nice apples, then we went swimming in the river. Mr Henderson took two pictures of us in the water. We all had a good time and came back to school ready for supper.\n\n##############\nON THE FRASER RIVER\n\nWilliamson Walkem\n\nLAST June when I was to write my first year High School examination I had to go to Chilliwack for there was no High School at Lytton.\n\nThe Bishop of the Cariboo was here with Mr Cooper a friend of his from Pavilion, to confirm the older boys and girls of the School. Mr Cooper saying that the country was much to his liking was at once invited to go with us.\n\nOne Sunday afternoon we started off about two o'clock; we had a very nice trip although we had a blowout on the way. It was a lovely trip to Lytton where the Thompson River joins the Fraser. After leaving Lytton, we went far up the side of the mountain where the road was hardly passable although skilled engineering work had been done. We came to Jackass Mountain near Boston Bar, where once a whole team of mules had rolled over the mountain side into the river. Here we were about seven hundred feet above the river.\n\nLeaving the mountain we reached Boston Bar and saw North Band just across the river. There were tunnels, bridges, springs creeks and two railroads far below us as we again left Boston Bar for Spuzzum where we crossed the Fraser and continued on our travels.\n\nThe river from Boston Bar is full of canyons, torrents and whirlpools; when we were far up the side of the mountain we could hardly see the river at Hells Gate Canyon, which is one of the most noted canyons anywhere in the world. It is about thirty feet wide and the river had been cutting its way through the solid rock for centuries.\n\nLeaving Spuzzum we saw the most beautiful scenery in British Columbia. We stopped at the toll-gate and again when near Yale, where we saw salmon just filling a creek which meets the muddy Fraser at this point. Proceeding on our way we saw great canyons with the mountains towering above the river on each side.\n\nNear the Chilliwack the river widens out and flows very slowly compared to the upper part of the river. This part of the road was much better. The cherries were ripe and the people were selling them to the tourists who were passing along the highway. We left Hope after supper and made a hurried trip to Chilliwack which was the end of our journey.\n\nIMPRESSIONS OF THE PROVINCIAL EXHIBITION\n\nMr Emmott\n\nOur Editor wishes me to say a few words regarding my trip to the Provincial Exhibition at New Westminster. Many thanks to the Principal and Mr Tims for the privilege. I was attending to the swine that was exhibited by the School and which was awarded a silver medal. The Principal bought a fine pig which was awarded first prize at Victoria and New Westminster. There was a magnificent display from every field of industry; the effort is made to provide some educational value as well as to present a pleasing display. I hope by another year that St. George's School will have a fine exhibit.\n\nLet the children take an interest in their work and take for their slogan, \"Excalibur.\"\nTHE HIGH SCHOOL\n\nMISS GREGGOR\n\nTHE High School section of St. George's School is the last lap in the race for an all-round education. A race not one of plundering blundering endeavor, but a race for the fulfillment of high or ambitions and noble aspirations.\n\nIt is here that the youth discovers in himself founts of untold hidden wealth. He is by this time, beginning to realize more fully that he is an individual, a personality with powers of his own to express; these powers is his chief ambition. He may have as a young child, vowed to have done those things which he felt he could do, but he did it for the sake of the act itself, for the mere desire of doing. When he reaches the High School age he wants more than this. He wants to become a man, to do things because they are of value to himself and to others. Feeling that he is necessary in turning the wheels of the circle in which he moves, he forces his way into various channels which appeal to him endeavoring to make a name for himself. Respect and admiration he wants irrespective of what he does or where he goes. If only lawyers and judges would remember this fact when they sentenced juveniles, many a mother's heart would be spared a grievous wound.\n\nAlthough the High School section of the School was at a disadvantage to begin with in not having proper accommodation and the necessary books, it has been able to carry on. Now it is well established and undertaking tasks with real vim. New subjects such as Physics, Chemistry and Geometry are tackled and mastered. Plenty of opportunity is provided for mental gymnastics within the curriculum. In their work as well as in their play, they are learning of things about them and accordingly, how to adapt themselves to different situations which may arise. Thus equipped they should be able to face the world prepared and unafraid. It is really up to us to give them all the sympathy and encouragement we can.\n\nLet me for one, be always able to say with the poet:\n\n\"May every soul that touches mine--\nBe it the slightest contact, get there from some good\nSome little grace, one kindly thought\nOne aspiration, yet unfelt, one bit of courage\nFor the darkening sky, one glimmer of faith\nTo brave the thickening ills of life,\nOne glimpse of brighter skies beyond the gathering mist,\nTo make this life worth while,\nAnd Heaven a-surer heritage.\"\nForest Products of British Columbia.\n\nJOHN JAMES\n\nALONG the Pacific Coast of British Columbia as far north as the north end of Vancouver Island, grows the most valuable timber in the world.\n\nAmongst them the Douglas Fir is the most valuable. Its diameter averages about eight feet and its height from a Hundred and Fifty to Two Hundred feet. It is chiefly used in the making of bridges, wharfs, masts, Hardwood floors and furniture.\n\nThe next tree of importance is the Western Red Cedar which grows to a height of about a hundred and fifty feet. It is used in making shingles, canoes and laurels.\n\nThe next comes the Sitka Spruce. It grows mostly in the Queen Charlotte Islands and is used usually in the pulp-mills and for the making of aeroplanes.\n\nThe Western Hemlock is also of some value, but is surpassed in quantity by the inferior Hemlock of Canada.\n\nTHE FRASER RIVER\n\nPaddy Kelly\n\nTHE Fraser, the largest river in British Columbia, runs past our school. It is eight hundred and forty miles long. The Thompson River is the largest tributary, it flows into the Fraser at Lytton.\n\nThere is good fishing at its mouth, and numerous ships and smaller fishing vessels travel upon its waters. Large canyons and rough rapids occur frequently.\n\nThe river starts in the Rocky Mountains near the Yellow Head Pass. As it nears Lillooet the roughest rapids called the Alexandra Rapids occur.\n\nNew Westminster is the largest city along its banks. The two railroads, The C.P.R. and C.N.R., and the Cariboo highway follow the course of the river as far as Lytton.\n\nThe river was discovered by Simon Fraser in the year eight-hundred and eight, and was named after him. It is rather a muddy river flowing very swiftly in some parts.\n\n\"How many legs has a sheep, calling the tail a leg.\"\n\"Five\"\n\"No, Four. Calling the tail a leg doesn't make it one.\"\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6462, file 888-1, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nTHE OLD SWIMMING HOLE\n\nWE have a swimming hole 'way up the river and just below the farm. It's just like a little bay in the side of the river. Every Saturday or Sunday afternoon Mr Henderson takes us down to our favorite spot, and there we swim and dive and play around in the water or lie basking on the hot sand. Sometimes we catch hold of Sandy Mr Henderson's dog, and throw him into the water and watch him swim back again.\n\nSometimes the dog chases the boys into the water and they like that very much. On our way to and from the swimming hole we go into the orchard and get one or two apples which we enjoy.\n\nA TRIP TO THE ORCHARD\n\nEVERY evening when the girls have finished their work, the girls' matron used to take them to the orchard as a great treat. I am sure they were hungry for apples, and that jumping business meant that they were very pleased. We were lined up in twos and started off to the orchard. When we got there the girls scattered about like sheep, running from tree to tree seeing which was best. But alas, Mr Stemp said that we were doing too much damage so our nice trips are now all over.\n\nTHE NEW STAFF\n\nWhen we came back from our holidays we were glad to welcome four new matrons. They were Miss White, Miss Digby, Miss Brown and Miss Jobling. Not long after Mr Marrett the Manual Teacher and Miss Tebutt the whites childrens' teacher came. Later still Miss Gregor the High School teacher arrived.\n\nWe hope that they will be happy at St George's and like us as much as we like them.\n\nOUR NEW HOME\n\nWe no more have the wish\nFor the day to come\nThat we would dwell\nIn our new home\n\nBut alas! the same old reply\nA few more weeks yet\nThe weeks seemed months\nWhile we waited to dwell\nIn our new home\n\nMany a visit we took\nTo see if it were ready\nMany a question we asked\nIs our new home really?\n\nThe joyful day arrived\nOn our dear Principal's birthday\nWe wished him a happy birthday\nAnd we ourselves enjoyed this day\nFor then we entered into\nOUR NEW HOME.\n\"THE CROSS OF SAINT GEORGE.\"\n\nRev. S.F. Higgs\n\nBoys and girls and peoples! I wonder how it is that we usually measure happiness. Is it by what we receive or by what we give? Most of us will agree that there is something much more joyful in giving than receiving, and so some measure of joy is mastered out to me in so far as I am giving some little time to writing this, and maybe the joy is not all mine, for by the time you have read this you will find that you have had to sacrifice some of your precious minutes to give something for nothing. So we are all happy.\n\nNow let us for one minute, take our minds off all but just one thing with which we are familiar, the School Flag, the emblem of St. George of England which is the central structure of the flag of the British Empire.\n\nWe can rightly be proud of our flag\u2014the broad red cross on the white background\u2014and is there not a great significance in this emblem for us? Red is the color of blood and blood is the sign of life, the purer and richer and redder the blood, the stronger and purer and sweeter will be the life. Then the blood red cross on our banner means LIFE! And the background is pure white, and if our lives are to be vigorous and unimpaired we must seek now and always to make their backgrounds glistening white, not the blanched whiteness which speaks of disease but the polished brightness of a life rightly lived.\n\nBoys and girls do you understand? Don't let life be an endless search after good things for ourselves, remember how St. George risked all for the safety and happiness of others.\n\nSchools are just the grandest places on earth and St. George may be as grand as any if our motto be LIFE in the purest fullest and bravest sense, remembering always to preserve before the all-seeing eyes of the Almighty and Loving God a background which is spotless white.\n\nThe Noble Nature\n\nIt is not growing like a tree\nIn bulk, doth make man better be;\nOr standing long an oak, three hundred year,\nTo fall a log at last, dry, bald, and bare;\nA lily in a day\nIs fairer far in May\nAlthough it fall and die that night\nIt was the plant and flower of Light,\nIn small proportions we just beauties see;\nAnd in short measures life may perfect be.\n\nR. Jonson.\nTHE CRUSADER\n\nTEN JUNIOR CLASS ROOM.\n\nMiss Bruce.\n\nOne of the most interesting depts. of St George's may truly be said to be the Junior School Room. The children come here to learn and it is in this division that they first come into actual contact with the tools of learning. To many it means the opening and conquering of a new world of knowledge. To the majority, eager for advancement, school is a serious place, where one must work to the best of one's ability. To others school is just a new experience which at first is very amusing, but later becomes just another duty, that follows in the day's round.\n\nThe Junior School Room is made up of 'A' and 'B' sections.\n\n'B' section is the primary class. Here we find serious little anxious to handle the tools and yet rather timid to cut them into use. But with the passing of the first strangeness comes a confidence that remains with them always.\n\n'A' section has gained that confidence. They have explored and gained a fairly good control of the language. School to them is no longer a new experience, neither is it a serious business. The beginning of their school life is a thing of the past, the end a thing in the distant future. Their work is competitive, their school day a competition, permeated with that sense of friendly rivalry, that is present in all class rooms.\n\nHence you see the Junior department is an opening and continuation of the first stages, in the education of the children of St George's School.\n\n#############################\n\nCANADIAN GIRL GUIDES AT ST. GEORGE'S SCHOOL.\n\nMiss Richmond.\n\nThe Girl Guides, although a world wide movement did not reach St George's School until Oct. 1927. From its first mention in the girls playroom until the present it has filled a place in the girls' life which other activities have failed to supplant.\n\nOf course the chief trouble has always been lack of funds, but here the girls have done their work and part nobly, both in contributing their two cents weekly and also in working for their concert, by means of which they were able to buy hats and belts for themselves. The material for their uniforms was given by the school and was made up by the girls under the able direction of Miss Spencer who was then sewing matron. We have to thank the first B.C. Lone Rangers for our paddy green ties which we proudly wear to show that we are members of the 1st Lytton Company of Girl Guides, the first native Company in B.C., and the second in Canada.\n\nAt present there are twenty-eight girls in the company grouped into four patrols, the Red Rose, Primrose, Forget-me-nots and the Laffodils. These patrols carry on a friendly warfare in their endeavor to come first in neatness games etc.\n\nAt the meetings which are held on Wed. evenings, instruction is given in first aid, signalling and all branches of guide work. I think I am safe in saying that Wed. night is the most enjoyable evening of the whole week.\n\nGuiding is intended to instil in the girls comradeship, loyalty, obedience, and above all to guide or show them the way to upright womanhood. We hope that this is being accomplished in the 1st Lytton Company.\nLABOUR DAY PICNIC\n\nOn Labour day the sun was shining brightly so we all thought we would go for a picnic to the Green Meadows. The boys went across the river for their picnic with Mr Henderson to look after them, except the little boys who did not go so far away.\n\nWe had lots of fun playing all day long and we were very happy. There was a ditch in which the water was running and some of the girls took off their shoes and stockings and jumped into the water and running up and down in it until they were tired.\n\nAfter dinner we had more games which we enjoyed very much then we came home for supper.\n\nSt. George's New School\n\nOur new school is built of red brick with a flat roof. The walls inside are plastered and the stairs and the basement floors are made of concrete. There are four dormitories on the girls' side and four on the boys' side. The boys and girls have each a sitting room or study. There are four school rooms, two Junior rooms, one Senior room and a high school room. There is also a manual training room for the boys.\n\nWe have a fine gymnasium in which we do all our drilling and play basketball.\n\nOne boy is in second year high school, two high school girls and one boy in first year high and two boys and two girls in Entrance.\n\nThe children like their new school very much and are content and happy in it.\n\nFIRST IMPRESSIONS OF ST GEORGE'S SCHOOL\n\nMiss Tebbutt\n\nThey are varied and contrasting. Perhaps I should start with my arrival in Dayton. I was met by your beloved Principal who gave me a small but pleasant surprise. How different was this bluff hearty man from the picture I had formed in my mind. Mr Lett introduced himself quite informally, giving me a feeling that in this new country away from all I loved, I was not to be without a friend.\n\nWe started off over the winding road to the school. Soon I beheld before me an old dilapidated building. Surely this was not the building! You see boys and girls I had not heard of your new school. What a difference when we came in view of the building of which you are so proud. What a fine place, an ideal situation\u2014with the grand old hills all around and the river running below.\n\nI entered the building and gradually I came to know each member of the staff. Then I was shown over the school. First we entered the schoolrooms, how nice and airy the place where boys and girls must enjoy their studies. Then I had a peep into the dormitories where each little bed was in place, everything bright and neat. When I entered the Dining-room I saw for the first time the young people who live at St George's, and day by day I have grown to know you by sight and by name and shall go on through the year gradually getting acquainted with you known and loved of B.C.\nONCE upon a time there were two boys in the school, named Peter Ender and Smith Bant. They spent their time in singing and telling stories to the little boys before they went to bed. They were the best of friends and shared with each other, their fruit and candy, and so they were very happy.\n\nOne day Peter grew tired of being good to Smith. \"Smith\" said he to his companion, \"life is very dull with every day the same I am tired of seeing you so cheerful so let us have a quarrel.\"\n\n\"Very Well Peter,\" said Smith looking rather grave, for he did not like the idea. \"But what can we quarrel about?\" he asked.\n\n\"Well\" said Peter doubtfully, \"I can't tell you not to use my bike because you never use it anyway. And I can't steal your fruit or candy for you always want me to share yours. \"I have it\" he cried, after a moment's thought; \"Smith, do you see that sack of good red apples over there, you say its yours, and I'll say its mine so we'll have a squabble.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Smith, \"only you must begin.\" He clenched his hands and tried to look ugly and Peter did the same.\n\nThey were quite changed from the kindly smiling boys they had been a moment before. Peter pointed to the sack of apples and said gruffly, \"I want you to understand that those apples are mine, and if I catch you trying to steal some I'll knock every hair off your head until you are bald.\"\n\nSuch fierceness made Smith jump. \"I beg your pardon, pardner Peter,\" he said in amazement.\n\n\"Don't call me 'pardner',\" was the rough reply. \"Behave respectfully to your betters. Understand that that sack of apples is mine, do you deny it?\"\n\nSmith could hardly get his breath but he managed to stammer out, \"Your apples are they?\"\n\n\"Yes, my apples and mind they belong to me, and I am going to have them.\"\n\n\"Why of course they're yours Peter, and if you'll wait a minute I'll get you some more.\"\n\n\"I suppose we must give up trying to squabble, for it takes two to make a quarrel,\" said Peter.\n\nSo they burst out laughing and went into the basement to share their apples.\n\nFrom that day on they have never quarreled. Instead they have told stories to the little boys and then sent them to bed.\n\nHenry Spinks: Is the Editor the man who puts things in the magazine?\nJohn James: No, the Editor is the man who keeps things out of the magazine.\nTHE CRUSADER\n\nST. GEORGE'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nLYTTON B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6462, File 888-1, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nFIRST AID\n\nMr Henderson was telling us that we must know the various parts of the body especially the bones, so that any time we get hurt or break a leg or an arm, we will know just what to do.\n\nWe also learn about our blood circulating through our body and how our heart is divided into four compartments veins and how it pumps the blood through the arteries to every part of the body, and coming back through the veins to be purified. Mr Henderson showed us one night a picture of a skeleton, and we saw there how our body is kept upright by our spine, without it we would be like a jelly fish without form or strength.\n\nFIRST AID\n\nGeorge Henry\n\nFirst Aid is one of the best things in the world to know, because we don't want ourselves to be hurt or to lose an arm or leg. By knowing about first aid you can often save yourself pain or more injury by knowing what to do or being able to tell somebody what to do. It is very easy to learn the way Mr Henderson teaches us, and it will help us to be useful any time there is an accident.\n\nBASKET BALL.\n\nPeter Ender\n\nWe play Basket ball at night after the smaller boys go to bed, and we all enjoy playing it. There are just certain nights that we play on and these are Tuesday Thursday and Saturday. On the other nights of the week we learn our first aid and other things. When we play basket ball we wear white pants and shirts and running shoes, so we can jump around without getting too hot.\n\nWe sometimes push each other around or hold onto the other boys arms, then the other side gets a free shot, so we try our best to play the game right all the way through. We have a larger place for playing in than we had in the old school.\n\nAfter we have finished playing we undress and go in for a hot shower then a cold one and then to bed.\n\nA Laugh or Two\n\nJohn James\n\nMrs Brown stood in the doorway of her suburban home and eyed the tramp critically. \"Are you willing to work for a meal?\" she asked at last. The tramp extended his hands expansively as though work was the one thing in life he hankered after; and his apparent sincerity overcame her last scruples. She went into the house and came back with a large plate of food and a good sized hoe.

So he went into the woods to find something to eat; as he was going into the woods he saw a village, he went into the first house he found was empty. He went smelling into everything, when he came to a stove he found a kettle, thinking it was something good to eat; he put his nose in the hole and smelt it and it burnt his nose so he began to roar with pain. Thinking it was some new kind of animal, he took hold of it and began squeezing it to his body but it burned him the more, and he began to roar again. The more he squeezed it the angrier he grew. He threw the kettle down and began dancing around the room. Some men near by heard the noise and came to see what was happening. They saw the bear dancing around the room and one of the men shot it.\n\nMONDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHTS.\n\nHazel Phillips\n\nI am going to tell you how we spend Monday and Friday nights before we go to bed. Whose are the two nights we always look forward to? Oh, I mustn't forget Wednesday night when we have fun again at our Girl Guild's meeting.\n\nAfter supper when we have finished our work we put on our gymnasium clothes and hustle into our big Gymnasium.\n\nThe 'Seconds' choose their side and start as soon as they can, for they cannot stay up as long as the seniors.\n\nYou should see the girls playing with all their might, we certainly have an exceptionally good time. My and the shouts from the onlookers when the ball falls into the basket or happens to slip down into someone's eager hands. Off it goes this way and that way and into a basket. And this is what you hear \"That's one for us.\" Oh Yes one more and we're two ahead!\" You had better play up there\".\n\nJust as the seconds are getting tired and perspiring a bit, a whistle blows for them to go and get ready for a good nights rest.\n\nThen the senior team goes on for a while. They are a strong team alright. Most of them being promising good players. We all play with pep in this game and it keeps us feeling fit till the next night.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe acknowledge with grateful thanks the following donations to our Chapel fund:\n\nOffertory from the Clergy Quiet day $6.00\nBishop of Edinburgh $5.00\nRev Professor Maylor, Montreal $5.00\nTHERE IS NOTHING SO KINGLY AS KINDNESS\nTHERE IS NOTHING SO ROYAL AS TRUTH.\n\nI would be true for those who trust me\nI would be pure for those who care\nI would be strong for those who suffer\nI would be brave for those who dare\nI would be friend to all\u2014the friendless\nI would be giving and forget the gift\nI would be humble for I know my weakness\nI would look up\u2014and love and laugh\u2014and live\nThe 1st Lytton Company of Girl Guides wish to acknowledge with thanks the gift of a Union Jack which was presented to them by the Municipal Chapter of the I.O.D.E. of Vancouver.\n\nThe following item of news which has just come to hand should be of great interest to both boys and parents. It also reflects great credit on the school.\n\nThe average increase in weight for the Senior and Intermediate Boys for the month of September is 4.35 lbs.\nACTIVITIES AMONGST THE BOYS.\n\nThe course of training which is given to the boys after school is extensive and varied, covering such subjects as Squad Drill, Physical Training, Signaling, lectures on First Aid, Health and Hygiene; Clean Speech, Clean Sports and Clean Living; and last but not least some of the games\u2014Basketball, Football, Volleyball, and group games all of which go a long way in developing a boy's body, mind and character.\n\nWe have our Squad Drill P.T. and games on Tuesday Thursday and Saturday evenings from 7 to 9 o'clock. The juniors and intermediates have their time in the morning from 10 to 11 o'clock and in the afternoon from 2 to 3 o'clock.\n\nThe boys right from the beginning have shown wonderful aptitude in learning the new movements and exercises. At present we busy practicing and perfecting our physical work for our concert which will be held early in Nov. Look out for the date.\n\nThe boys have also shown a great interest in their first aid and we are also practicing for our first aid demonstration.\n\nWe have greatly enjoyed throughout the summer, our visits to the old swimming hole. The boys certainly have a great time. If they didn't get into the water fast enough 'Sandy' chased them back in, but the boys didn't mind that in fact they rather enjoyed it. Unfortunately it is all over for this year.\n\nSometimes in the evenings we have sing songs round the piano which we all enjoy. I don't know whether those who listen to us enjoy it or not, but anyway whether we 'Sing' or not we make a joyful noise.\n\nOur Labor Day picnic which is dealt with elsewhere was a great success. We went across the river, had our lunch near the stores then went to Earlscourt and got some apples, swam for an hour or so then home.\n\nOur hikes have started, our first one being taken the other evening in the moonlight. We all are looking forward to this being our best year at St George's School.\nSir,\n\nThis is to acknowledge receipt of yours numbering 165-0-1 of the 11th inst.

Principal of the St. George's Indian Residential School wishes to know if the employees at the school come under the Workmen's Compensation Board of the Province. This is a matter that would have to be determined by the Provincial Board, as each province has its own Act in this connection. I may say that this is the first time I have heard of any school coming under a Workmen's Compensation Board. However, if the Rev. Mr. Lett has been paying the fees to the Board, I know of no reason why his employees, if injured, should not benefit. If the Principal does not wish to continue paying into the Board, he should correspond with it in the matter. I may add that the members of the school staff cannot be considered Civil Servants, as they are not directly employed by the Government. They are employees of, and are paid by, the school management.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton,\nB.

Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, relative to the possibility of two or three white children who have passed their high school entrance examinations at the Lytton Public School applying for permission to continue their studies in the high school class at the Lytton Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that unless there are very special reasons why you would like to admit these children as day pupils, the Department wishes you to refuse the request. Our appropriation is for the education of Indian children only.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. A. R. Lett,\nPrincipal,\nSt. George's Indian Res. School,\nLytton, B.C.\nSeptember 11th, 1930.\n\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to ask whether or not your Department would permit white children to attend St. George's Indian Residential School at Lytton. Two pupils, Maureen Dwyer and George Blue passed their examination for High School Entrance. We have no facilities for teaching High School work in our one-room Elementary Public School at Lytton. The parents of these children are not so fixed financially that it is possible for them to send the children away for High School tuition. Maureen Dwyer is anxious to secure two years of High School work that she may enter training for a nurse. The boy wishes to matriculate. Miss Blatchford, of St. George's, teachers the High School subjects and if it would be possible for these two children to attend her classes it would be a great boon for them.\n\nIf it is strictly against the rules of your Department I do not urge that you make a special case for these two. I realize that you have rules and regulations to follow and many difficulties to face just as we have in administering our Public School system. But I have promised the parents of these pupils that I would do all I could to help them solve their problem.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nInspector of Schools.\n\nFCC:F\nOttawa, September 18, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, with reference to the request that two white children attend the high school class at the St. George's Indian Residential School. In reply I have to state that our schools are financed by Federal Appropriation for Indian Education and it is not the usual practice to admit white children to them. If the Reverend Mr. Lett is willing to have these particular white students in his classes and the parents will pay a fee of $40 per child per academic year, their admission could be considered.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I have now to inform you that if you would like to grant the request and the parents will provide a fee of $40 per child per academic year, the Department will give favourable consideration. Of course, the money would have to be forwarded to Ottawa, for deposit to casual revenue.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. A. R.

C. asking that certain white children who wish to continue high school instruction be allowed to attend St. George Indian School for this purpose. The reason given is, there is no high school in or near Lytton, and the parents of four children cannot afford to send their children to town for high school education.\n\nI was requested to ask if the Department would object to these children attending St. George Indian School wish to receive the benefits of a high school education.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJAF: ET\nOttawa, [signature]\n\nMr.\n\nPlease report on attached letter and return it to the office of the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nDo not file.\nSeptember 19, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Fraser:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, with reference to white children attending the high school class at the St. George's Indian Residential School, Lytton, B.C. I find that yesterday, the Department wrote to the Principal of the School and to the interested Provincial Inspector of Schools to the effect that if the Principal was willing to have the particular white children in his classes and the parents would pay a fee of $40 per child per academic year, their admission could be considered. The fees, of course, would be returnable to Ottawa, for deposit to Casual Revenue.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nJohn A.

These pupils have no thought of receiving grant from the Department as Indian children, nor have I in mind to ask for this from the Department. They have proposed to pay a certain fee through the School for tuition.\n\nPersonally, I feel relieved by your letter as I did not want to have them in the School as it would materially increase complications.

Tolmie.\nTHE MISSION,\nLYTTON, B.C.\n\n17th February, 1931.\n\nDr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Dr. Scott:\n\nI am writing a letter to you, the nature of which might at first seem a little puzzling, but of which you will understand the reasonableness. It is written in confidence and is not intended to convey any impressions of illwill felt or expressed towards anyone.\n\nFrom information received I feel that there is a possibility of the Principleship of St. George's School, at Lytton, becoming vacant. This may or may not be likely, but at any rate it is a possibility, and in consideration of this I am writing this letter.\n\nWe have met in Lytton, Dr. Scott as I have been in the Indian work for three years now, and was here during your visit in 1928. Since I arrived in Lytton, through personal contact with the Indians, living in their homes, entering as far as possible into their lives, I have learned to love them, and would say with certainty and humility that I would consider it an honour to devote, and if necessary, to sacrifice all I possess in their service. This is not said idly as I realize that the future prosperity of the Indians, if it is to be more than an ever elusive ideal, will only be purchased by the\nexp diture of still more service and sacrifice on the part of Christian men. If it were not for the love that I have for the Thompson Indians I would not consider myself in any way capable of assisting them in the great effort that they are making and must make to secure for themselves a creditable position among the civilized people of the world today.\n\nAnd this letter is expressly an offer of my services, in the hope that such as they are they will be accepted in the event of a vacancy occurring at St. George's School, whether it occur soon or at some distant date.\n\nIt is necessary to advertise myself, and I hope you will not consider me presumptuous in doing so.\n\nI shall be 27 in April, having been ordained in 1927 at Lambeth Palace, Eng., by the Late Archbishop of Canterbury, for work among the Thompson Indians. I was educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham, and St. Augustine's College, Canterbury, where I spent five years in special missionary training, and obtained my L.Th.of Durham University. I left home on the completion of my college course and have been working in Lytton until now.\n\nI am keenly interested in sport, having had the opportunity of leading my college friends in several departments of this integral part of School life.\n\nI have had a fair amount of contact with the St. George's School as I am chiefly supported in my position here by the New England Company for the purpose of caring for the ex-pupils of the School.\n\nDuring the past year I was successful in obtaining, from Archbishop de Fencier, a cup which was presented to the School for competition upon the lines of the English House\ntem; and under the name of the Divisional system, this competition has been introduced, as it was submitted by me, into every branch of the School life --- work, sport and industry, and in the words of the Principle to me a month ago; \"It has revolutionized the whole School\". I mention this in an endeavour to indicate the deep rooted interest which I feel, and will always try to express in the future prosperity of the Indians.\n\nI have no knowledge of the salary paid to the Principle of St. George's School, and whether it is small or large it does not act as a deterrent or an attraction. The money end does not influence me so long as it is adequate.\n\nMy interest in the Indians, Dr. Scott, is genuine. Since the beginning of the year Dr. Renison, the Dean of Christ Church Cathedral, Vancouver, B.C., offered me the position of curate at the Cathedral, a position holding very great possibilities to a young man, and in almost every respect more congenial than the Missionary work I am doing; not to mention a 50% increase in salary and a greatly reduced overhead. To arrive at a decision was difficult, but in deciding to remain in the Indian Mission work I feel I have done what is right, and I shall be happy to devote many more years' work in the cause of the people, whom, as very dear brothers and sisters, I love.\n\nI returned from Vancouver, Dr. Scott, with the conviction that I had been guided to decline the offer of work at the Cathedral because there was a very special work to be done before I severed my connection with the Thompson Indians; and I feel that if, as a result of the Principleship of St. George's School becoming vacant, and my recommendation being satisfactory, I am enabled to occupy that position, I can best express my real love for my new countrymen through the channels which such a position offers.\nI may be premature in submitting this, but I do it with confidence. Dr. Scott assured me that should such an occasion as I suggest arise you will give this your apt consideration.\n\nI have, what I imagine is not easily obtained, the confidence of the Indians, of this I have been recently assured in an unsolicited recommendation which the Indians sent to the Bishop of Cariboo, asking that my position among them be made a permanent one; they have asked my permission to send a similar letter to you, and under the circumstances I have expressed my willingness for them to do so. Other qualifications, such as I possess, may be better deduced from recommendations from several people, which I can subsequently submit, if you should require them.\n\nFor the present I am pleased at all times to forward the work which the Rev. A.R. Lett is doing at the School.\n\nWith pleasant memories of our meeting in 1928,\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. I am enclosing a copy of a letter of recommendation which I received from Dr. S.F. Tolmie at the beginning of the month.\nFebruary 25, 1931.\n\nDear Mr. Higgs:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, applying for the post of principal of the St. George's Indian Residential School, should it become vacant. At the present time, the Department does not contemplate any change in management at this institution; but I am glad to have your application, which will be given consideration if a new principal is required.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

I hope that if you can possibly arrange it you will make the payment on or about the 14th of that month and in that case you will note that an amount of \u00a3148.00 should be added to the accrued interest to cover the four months from December 14th.\n\nI most earnestly trust that you can arrange for payment in April.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCharter Clerk.\nMarch 18, 1931.\n\nDear Mr. Bush:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to the final payment for the St. George's Indian Residential School. $148.00, being the interest on $8,880.00 for four months, will be added to the amount, making a total of $12,469.60.

Hippo is lawfully appointed and given the authority to preach the word of God, whom has reverently obeyed his ordinary, with faithful diligence in reading of the Holy Scriptures, and in such studies as help to the knowledge of the same. Whom also do expend in pronouncing prayers in Indian, in which we have taken real interest, when the knowledge of God is pronounced in our tongue, and the edifying of His people the same.\n\nWe have long expected a man full of faith given the authority of ministration, to learn, study the Thompson Tribe tongue. For the benefit of the elder people who must understand English language.\n\nWe thank our Heavenly Father for sending this person-in-edifying of His people to the knowledge of the Christian Faith.\n\nOur consideration is the desire of him to have a permanent position, where he is set under the authority\nto preach the Gospel of God.\n\nIt was long ago since (Rev. Small) our Priest of the Indian Mission, likewise preach to us in our own tongue. And the edifying of Gods people and His church. Who passed away, and many of the Thompson Indians mourned with sorrow for him, which laid to rest in Peace.\n\nEver since then a considerable number of Priests have taken the authority to preach the words of God. But we seemed to have failed in coming to hear the Holy Scripture. Until this young Priest whom God has chosen to be His Apostle, and sent from England to preach the Old and New Testament of God to us people here in British Columbia. With the consent of his beloved parents.\n\nThe development he will be making in true religion who will knit our hearts as one to our Almighty God. We desire to confirm him to maintain his position until the independence of his life.\n\nWe wish further to recommend to you, this person whom so present unto us, is apt and meet, for his learning.\nand godly conversation, has exercised his ministry duly\nto the honour of God & the edifying of His church. We\ntrust that he is inwardly moved by the Holy Ghost to\ntake up his ministry of the church, not only that, but in\nour association as development to our country, and\nthem to whom the charge and government over him is\ncommitted. We believe and found him worthy to be\ncalled unto the higher ministries of the church, he is\napt and meet to replenish the truth in Doctrine,\nboth by word and good example, and the edification\nof God's church. Especially to take charge as\nprincipal of the Indian school, he is born of\nreliable people and religion. Therefore he is apt\nand meet for such studies, to associate the children\n& education and to the knowledge of Christian Faith.\nIn conclusion we may remark, we have conducted a full\ndiscussion of all points contained in the statement.\nThese discussions have taken place at various large meet-\nings held in different parts of the district.\nWe would be glad to receive your reply to this acknowledge-\nment.\n\nDictated By: Johnny M. Anderson (Indian)\nCorrespondent By: Wm. Cameron (Indian)\nDear Mr. Strang,\n\nFor the past couple of years I have been thinking of making application to the Department for the extension of our Summer holidays to eight weeks, instead of six. My reasons for coming to this conclusion are twofold; one is, that our children realizing that their white neighbours receive two months vacation and that they themselves should be recognised accordingly. In a great many cases their return to school is tardy and it has been very difficult to get the children back by the 1st. Sept., in fact for the last two years I have not been able to make up my full quota for quite two weeks after the school has opened and have therefore not been able to do much in the class rooms for that length of time. The fact of the children knowing that neighbouring schools receive two months holiday increases our difficulties.\n\nSecondly, some of our teachers wish to attend Summer Schools and their return here in the middle of August interferes with the course as such courses do not finish until about August 25th. It is true that this year there may not be any Provincial Summer Schools, but this will only apply to 1931.\n\nI think on the whole it would be a benefit to the children and to the school if the Department could see fit to allow us a full two months vacation, and trust that this application will be favourably received.\n\nThere has heretofore been strong objection in the Hop Industry where so many of our Indians have been putting in time, but the majority of our children coming from families who depend on their own farms, relieves this objection, and I really think that the children would be better for the added two weeks.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. Strang,\nActing Indian Agent,\nLytton, B. C.\nSir:-\n\nI herewith beg to enclose a letter from the Rev. Principal of St. George's Indian Residential School, which will speak for itself.\n\nIn regard to this matter of holidays, I beg to endorse what Mr. Lett says on the subject, as the Indians complain very much on account of their children having to go back to school more than two weeks before the white children are called back to the Provincial Public Schools, and it makes it difficult to get the children back, when the parents have this feeling about it.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A. Strang)\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nAssist. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nAS/MD\nOttawa, March 24, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of the 8th ultimo, recommending Reverend S. E. Riggs for a position in an Indian school. In reply I beg to state that your representations have been noted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. M. Anderson, Esq.,\nKeefer's, B. C.\nOttawa, March 24, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 9305-06 of the 14th instant, with enclosure, concerning an extra two weeks' holiday for the pupils of the St. George's Indian Residential School. The difficulties concerning which Mr. Lett writes are common throughout Canada, and, after careful consideration, the Department has decided that 43 days' holiday with grant is all that can be allowed. There are a few exceptions, where there are seasonal occupations and where the children accompany the parents, but this does not obtain in central British Columbia. If, in any particular year, it is desired that the 6 weeks be changed, to permit of teachers attending a convention, the Department has no objection, in other words, have the annual holiday commence on July 15th.\n\nConcerning the comparison that is made with the provincial public schools, it is simple enough to explain to the parents that these are day schools and that Indian day schools take two months' holidays. Residential schools, however, are allowed but 43 days with grant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nSecretary\n\nA. Strong, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nLytton, B.

I shall hope to forward you a cheque for the full amount towards the end of next month, but it will certainly ease matters when the Company receive the remittance due for the interest on the purchase money of St. George's School.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nCharter Clerk.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6462, file 888-1, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, April 7, 1931.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Department is today arranging with the local Bank of Montreal to forward a draft to their branch at London, England, crediting the New England Company with the sum of $12,469.60.

The difference, $7.80, is to cover the cost of the draft.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF. H.

If you can see fit to grant my request I would like to again have an Oakland as, after having driven a car of this make for five years, I know something of its mechanism.\n\nI have also had quotations for a truck, our last truck expense to the Department was six years ago and I feel that you will agree with me that we have done well with the old one. This type now being obsolete very little should be done for it and I did not ask the dealer for any price on it.\n\nThese explanations are just by the way so that you can deal with us according to your decision.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\nPRINCIPAL.\n\nDr. D. C. Scott,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nI have been feeling lately that I should have a recess and wondered if you could see your way clear to allow me two and a half months holiday, with salary and fare East, having almost ten years service without break or expense to the Department.\n\nI would very much like to go East to visit my Mother who is getting on in years and is anxious to see me, and also to spend some time with friends. I would like if possible to get away by the 1st June, or shortly afterwards, returning to open school in the middle of August.\n\nI feel the need of a period away from the school as my health has not been good of late, being unable to cast off Bronchial trouble and having also been under the care of the Doctor for an ulcerated stomach. The change in climate and a lessening of responsibility I feel is very necessary.\n\nMy car has covered a mileage of some 40,000 and is therefore due for some expensive repairs, unless it is re-placed and in order that I might be independent when in the East, I wondered whether it could be arranged to allow The New England quarterly grant to go towards a new car and also my fare, turning in my present car locally, which would bring in $200, and picking up a new car at the factory, saving freight by driving back\nContinued:\n\nas I would then visit friends in Manitoba and Alberta.\n\nIn submitting my Financial Report I gave a list of estimated Capital Expenditure, one item of which was a car, the remaining numbers I feel can be taken care of by the school, at any rate the tractor, leaving the car and truck to be covered by The New England grant.\n\nThere is every prospect of a good year for the school this year and we should break even after having put finances in order and taking care of further necessities.\n\nI have driven an Oakland car and would like one of similar make if possible. The light Buick, which is now cheaper than the Oakland I believe, would be good enough. A Ford or light car cannot stand up to the work called for by a car at the school.\n\nPlacing my leave at Mid-summer would not mean added expense in maintaining the school as I have on my staff members who are capable of carrying on for the month of June.\n\nI know that the Department is cutting down where possible, but thought that my request would result in no direct drain.\n\nI do feel the need of a rest and would be deeply grateful if you could grant my request. However, I will try not to be too disappointed if you cannot see your way clear as I realise that the strain of depression is great.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDr. D.C.

I note that you are able to make satisfactory arrangements for the management of the school during your absence. When you are in the East, I should like you to visit Ottawa, and, when you are here, I will arrange to give you a cheque from the New England Company funds, which will be sufficient to pay your fare East and to trade in your Oakland car for a new one. You might let me know without delay who will act as principal during your absence, and the Department will then officially inform our local officers.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nRev.

I have, by the same post, received a cheque for that amount from the Bank of Montreal.\n\nThe final payment of the purchase price of St. George's Indian Residential School at Lytton, B.C., has now been made and I should like to thank the Department for their promptness in meeting the Company's wishes in the matter of expediting this final payment.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCharter Clerk.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have yours No. 165-0-1, for which please accept my very sincere thanks.

C. Scott,\nDeputy Sup. General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nIn accordance with your letter I have elected Mr. H. Batcheler acting Principal of the school for the month of June, and if there is anything the Department would like to take up with him during my absence in that month, I should be glad if they would do so. Mr. Batcheler is going to Summer School during the vacation period, when the school here will be closed, with no children in residence, and it will not be necessary to have a steady man in charge. I have therefore asked Mr. Tims, the farm manager, to be ready to co-operate with the Department during the period in which the school will be closed.\n\nRegarding the car, it is my intention, with your permission, to travel by boat across the great lakes, and disembarking at Toronto and picking up the car at Oshawa about the 14th or 15th of June I shall be reaching Ottawa, when I shall be glad to call at your office.\n\nWe are busy just now getting ready for the big Athletic Meet to be held at Coqualeetza commencing on the 26th of this month.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDr. D.

Lynch, Esq.,\nDirector,\nNational Development Bureau,\nMotor Building,\n238 Sparks St.,\nOttawa.\nI wish to thank you I deeply appreciate your kindness but as you have acted the kindness the friendship we contracted is now abated. The letter that I wrote to Mr. Anderson stating that I never wrote to let him know how I was getting on I wrote to you and thought that was sufficient you being my Brother you are placed in a position of Authority but showed it in a very foolish way I am given to understand that you and the others thought I was going to die. Pray God from whom all Blessings flow. I have not come to the end of my usefulness I have been working these days since my Bank arrived as for the Revenues I would not think of using it knowing the feeling you have towards me. You said to watch Left the way he acts about the Laundry Bill you said to me and to others that you and Left were wrong. Left passed it on to you to do the dirty work. Shame where is the Blessing.\n\nI stand for a cause dear\n\nA. Bennett\nI wish to let you know how things are run at St. George's School Station. While I was there for 19 months, I left in April 1929. My people wished me to let the case off which I did, without prejudice. I feel it is my duty to let you know. You will see by the enclosed copy of letters I sent the Principal and J.C. Davis but they have replied, which proves they are guilty. Apart from my case, I was there when W.B. Reddington wrote the Dept. about matters there was a great deal of trust in the statements he made. Commissioner Dickburn held a meeting but the staff would not speak. Knowing this would be filed, I heard the last Inspector Colvin say that Mr. Lett never acted as a Principal. While there are several cases to my knowledge, they did not give a square deal. Mr. Lett is the Boss or general Manager; they ought to be a change. The Dept. can make a good saving by putting a capable Principal in charge and cutting out the present Superintendent.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nA. Bennett\nA. R. Lett\n\nSir,\n\nI wish to thank you & Mrs. Lett & deeply appreciate your kindness that letter you sent to Mr. Anderson is like a fine novel there are three of a kind. This you & Mrs. Lett you all forget the statements you made. I wrote and told him what the Jno. said. I thought that was sufficient I being under him if he did not tell you he has acted the judge. I am surprised at Jims. I took him for a Gentleman what about your rightful obligations when it shocks you for the Laundry Bill I wished to quit then Jims went to you about it. He told me I would have to watch him. I know quite a few things now as for Mr. Lett. I spoke to her regarding her Bill but she would not if she would have been well paid for her trouble as my People in Scotland wanted to send her a draft but I stated that I saw her sneaking behind the Rose House when I came away. Shame where is they Black Jims told me and others in Vancouver that you were wrong that I should have been given due notice.\n\nI stand for a good deal.\n\nBennett\n23rd June, 1931.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nI am returning the photograph of St. George's Indian Residential School which I have had coloured as suggested.

My reason for asking, I filled the position of assistant dairyman for nineteen months at the Indian School, Lytton, B. C. I was taken ill with kidney trouble. I left April, 1929. I received a very nice recommendation. Without prejudice I say there ought to be a change and a saving can be made. Principal Lett, S. C. Tims, L. Stemp have been there so long they think they own it. I suggest practical people in place of figerheads, also in the case of Dr. Jaggar. Veterinarian, his visits there should be cut down. I have seen and heard enough. The late Inspector Cairns was far too easy. A few of the staff had an interview with him and he told us that Mr. Lett never had acted as a Principal should. It is ridiculous the way things are run. I may state I voted for Mr. H. H. Stevens.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.) A.

GEORGE'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nLYTTON, B.C.\n\nAUDIT REPORT\nPERIOD JANUARY 1ST. TO JULY 15TH., 1941\n\nH.G. CHARLTON\nOCTOBER 9, 1941\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\nST. GEORGE'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nLYTTON, B.C.\n\nAUDIT REPORT\n\nPeriod January 1st. to July 15/41.\nDate of Audit - October 9, 1941.\n\nIn accordance with instructions the financial transactions of the school were thoroughly examined so far as they related to the period, January 1st., to July 15th., and certain transactions which had received criticism in preliminary reports by Departmental officers were carefully investigated.\n\nREVENUE\n\nEither the former principal had received no instruction as to the method of recording financial transactions or he had ignored them. His only book of original entry for Revenue received was a common exercise book, or scribbler. Monies received were entered therein without mention of date or the name of the party from whom received, and the jumble of figures with recapitulations and adjustments, made it extremely difficult to pick out the cash items accurately and impossible to assign a particular item to its source.\n\nThe totals from this record were entered in the cash book each month and allocated to \"Farm\" or \"Miscellaneous.\"\n\nThe entries in the exercise book or Cash Blotter were checked against the entries in the Cash Book, and the Cash Book entries were checked against the deposits of the School account in the Bank of Montreal, Ashcroft, B.C.\n\nSpeaking generally, it was ultimately possible to reconcile most of the entries and the differences are small. There is an apparent double entry of a cash item in the Blotter and Cash Book in July. An account rendered to the Post Store appeared to be outstanding - amount $61.14 for June, although there was an entry in July for $61.85. Enquiry at the store showed that a cheque had been issued for $68.14 covering also an account of $7.00 of which there was no record in the School office. Another item received from another source was for $15.71 and this was recorded, but the next entry was for $65.85, and it is reasonably evident that an error occurred.\n\nAnother item in February was for $1.46, but the only sale for a similar amount at that time is for $11.46.\n\nCertain Revenue for sale of beef - lot 47 - was not put through the Cash Book, but this will be reported fully in a later section.\nEntries in total as adjusted now show as:\n\n| Cash Blotter Total | Cash Book Total | Bank Deposit |\n|--------------------|-----------------|--------------|\n| $2360.22           | $2353.50        | $21945.80    |\n| Add Per Cap. $19593.25 | $19593.25     | Excl. .95    |\n| $21953.47          | $21946.75       | $21946.75    |\n\nGiving a difference between Cash Blotter and Cash Book of $.72. This difference should be disregarded in view of the difficulty of determining just what none of the figures in the Cash Blotter represent.\n\nA statement of Revenue by months and accounts is attached; also a statement of receipts and payments with Bank reconciliation.\n\nFarm Sales\n\nFarm produce, including meat, dairy products, vegetables and fodder, surplus to school requirements, is sold at prevailing wholesale prices, principally local dealers. The Farm Manager recorded these sales in counter sales books and from the duplicates the school principal prepared monthly statements which were rendered quite promptly so far as I could ascertain. Unfortunately, copies of statements as rendered, except for a few current ones, were not available and I was informed that these were destroyed when the account was paid or carried forward. It was not possible, therefore, to check the Farm Manager's record against the statements issued, nor to check the statements against the receipts in the Cash Blotter. This applied particularly to the small cash sales which could not be identified in the blotter except in a few instances.\n\nAn additional complication which affected sales was the transactions in beef from lot 47, and these are described here before attempting the reconciliation between Farm Sales and Farm Revenue.\n\nBeef - Lot 47\n\nOn November 30th., 1940, Mr. Lett borrowed $1,000.00 in his own name on a demand note from the Bank of Montreal, Ashcroft, to cover the purchase of thirty-one head of cattle for which he paid $1105.00. The cattle were placed on Lot 47 and subsequently sold to the School, or local dealers, as beef at prevailing prices. A separate Bank account was opened in the name of A. R. Lett. The loan was increased on January 28th., 1941, by $110.00.\n\nCredits for sales put through this account amounted to $1175.92 between January 1st., and July 15th. Bank charges were $31.09 and a balance of $74.83 was transferred on July 14th., to the School account and credited to Farm Revenue.\n\nTwo additional animals were purchased from an Indian (Spike) from School funds, and one died, making the number for disposal thirty-two. Nine were sold to the School,\ntwenty-two to others and one is still at large.\n\n33 cattle purchased $1153.00 9 sold to School $496.64\nBank charges 35.09 22 \" \" others $1163.31\n1 died -\n\nCash profit $111.86 1 at large $40.00\n33 $1699.95 33 $1699.95\n\nThe Indian Commissioner, Indian Agent and Farm Manager agreed that other costs, including Indian wages, feed, etc., would amount to approximately $500.00 so that there would be actually a net loss on the venture of approximately $500.00.\n\nFarm Sales and Revenue\n\nTo return to this. An attempt to reconcile these items was made. To do so it was advisable to determine the Accounts Receivable at January 1st., as well as July 15th. This could not be done, and this factor in the following statement is an estimate only.\n\nFarm sales to School $4446.44\n\" \" to others $2392.56\nMilk and Cream (estimate) $225.00 $2717.56\nTotal Farm Sales $7164.00\n\nFarm Sales to others, as above $2717.56\n\nFarm Revenue - Cash Book $1735.83\nLot 47 Beef Account Revenue $1178.92\nLess sales to School this A/c $222.66\n$955.26\nLess Beef A/c included $36.83\n$918.43\nLess Revenue not related to sales $75.15 $843.28\nActs. Receivable Jul.15 $444.76\nLess \" \" Jan 1 (Est) $304.31 $140.47\n$2717.56\n\nThe detail of sales by months is attached.\nAccounts Receivable\n\nThese were determined as $560.53 at July 15th, 1941, including $448.78 for farm sales and a list is attached.\n\nThere is a possibility of there being additional accounts receivable in connection with sales of handicraft and this is dealt with later under that section.\n\nRevenue from Entertainments, Sports Day, Sale of Candy\n\nThe School Principal evidently made a practice of handling various transactions and funds outside the main School account, in whole or in part, and there is no complete record of these activities available; further information is desirable particularly with respect to the operation of a booth selling Ice Cream, Soft Drinks and Candy on May 24th, last.\n\nSports Day - May 24th\n\nA member of the staff - Mr. Egleston - was assigned to the refreshment booth and, although he was not available for questioning at the time of the audit, he has made a statement to the Acting Principal and to Inspectors Coleman and Barry, that the receipts turned over by him to Mr. Lett were approximately $152.00. We secured no receipt. There is nothing in the Cash Blotter of any amount having been received from any source in connection with activities on May 24th. The School is responsible for accounts of $34.17 and $22.18 for ice cream and candy, which appear to be related to this day's activities.\n\nThere is the possibility that some accounts were paid from the proceeds by Postal Money Order as was done with other candy transactions and it is quite probable that Mr. Lett can furnish a complete and satisfactory explanation, which he should be requested to do.\n\nSale of Candy\n\nInformation was to the effect that candies were purchased at various times and sold to the School children. There is no other expenditure on this account and only two revenue items recorded, but a file disclosed that Mr. Lett paid invoices for candy by Postal Money Order, as follows:\n\n- Jan. 18 - Ormonds - Vancouver - $1.48\n- Feb. 10 - \" \" \" \" $1.22\n- April 7 - \" \" \" \" $2.48\n- May 7 - \" \" \" \" $2.91\n- May - Robertsons \" \" $28.03\n\n$91.12\n\nThe Revenue in the Cash Blotter, apparently related to candy, is - April $10.00\n\nPicture Show - Canadian Legion\n\nThe Canadian Legion showed pictures at varying times in the winter and spring at the School, at what would appear to be a flat rate per showing of $10.00.\nMembers of the staff contributed and paid admission, although it would appear that these receipts would fall short of the $10.00 charge.\n\nThe amounts paid by the School to the Canadian Legion, and the receipts recorded are:\n\n| Payments | Receipts |\n|----------|----------|\n| Jan. 15th | $10.00   |\n| Feb. 1st  | $10.00   |\n| Feb. 22nd | $10.00   |\n| Mar. 1st  | $10.00   |\n| Apr. 1st  | $10.00   |\n| Apr. 15th | $10.00   |\n| May 1st   | $10.00   |\n\n$70.00\n\nHandicrafts - Manual Training & Wool\n\nArticles made of various woods are produced by the Indian Boys under the direction of Mr. Maclean. They vary from small bric-a-brac to fairly large pieces of furniture. They are sold at the School through local stores and some articles are on consignment to merchants at more distant points. No definite records are kept of these articles and transactions. Any cash received in the office is credited to General Revenue.\n\nMr. Maclean makes some sales and sends out local consignments, and the former principal did the same and established most of the selling prices, but neither apparently kept any record.\n\nIt should be a simple matter for the Instructor to furnish the office with an inventory of finished articles on hand, and to supply a weekly list of additional articles produced. The selling price of each article should be determined so it is placed in stock and not varied without the approval of the Principal.\n\nArticles sent on consignment should be invoiced and an account opened for each consignee. Counter sales slips should record every article to leave Mr. Maclean's stock and every article returned to stock. A separate account should be opened in the General Ledger for this class of handicraft.\n\nThe same procedure should apply to articles of wool, etc., produced under the direction of Miss Joblin.\n\nThe Revenue marked \"Handicraft\" in the Cash Slatter totals $191.84 for the period under review, exclusive of the rent of $50.00 per School month for Manual Training.\n\nThere are no particulars as to source and no distinction between the two classes of Handicraft.\n\nA list of articles produced from September, 1940, to June, 1941, as prepared by Mr. Maclean, is attached.\nHandicraft articles are on consignment at the R. R. Stores and the New Lytton Hotel, Lytton, and Cottage Crafts, Hope, B. C. It is also surmised that articles are on consignment at the Hudson's Bay Co., or Spencers, Ltd., at Vancouver and Victoria, B. C., but apparently there is no record and no present member of the staff knows definitely. The situation should be amended quickly.\n\nLease Rentals\n\nThe former lessee of Lot 47, George Henry, claims to have paid rental in full for the term of the lease which expired prior to the period covered by this audit. Payments are stated to have been in cash or produce. Receipts cannot be produced. The Indian Commissioner is furnishing the Department with a detailed statement.\n\nEXPENDITURE\n\nPayments through the School account totalled $21,324.16 and accounts payable at July 15th, totalled $2,976.26. This latter figure appears to be complete although there is the possibility of other unpaid accounts turning up.\n\nThere is no system of recording commitments. Purchase orders are not used and even the Principal could have had no accurate idea of just what the School's liabilities were at any given time.\n\nSo far as could be ascertained from the vouchers and information available, all the expenditures, paid and unpaid, are a proper charge to the School with one or two possible exceptions. Monthly paylists were not prepared but a check of the salaries and wages, including Mr. Lett's indicates that these charges are correct.\n\nIt has not been possible to determine the unpaid accounts at January 1st., 1943, so that the true expenditure applicable to the audit period cannot be ascertained.\n\nThe account of the Fraser Valley Produce for $34.00 covering Ice Cream supplied to the School for May 24th., has not been paid. It can be paid as the Ice Cream was undoubtedly supplied and Mr. Lett can be asked for an explanation of the operation of the refreshment booth on May 24th., and his apparent failure to account for the estimated receipts of $150.00.\n\nThe account of Mark Drummond (Ashcroft) for $129.22 covering fencing supplied to the School has not been paid. At least the cheque is being held. This could be released as the account is in order.\n\nCheques Nos. 155 of June 24th., for $114.00 and 165 of July 9th., for $105.65, total $223.65, were made payable to George Henry, the Indian employed at Lot 47 to attend to the bear cattle. This Indian was also paid wages by the School at the rate of $50.00 per month.\n\nThe Indian's story is that he was requested by Mr. Lett to endorse these two cheques, but that he did not see or otherwise handle them.\nInvestigation shows that Mr. Lett took this way of securing part payment for beef supplied to the School and deposited this amount to the credit of his special beef account to help retire the Bank loan mentioned previously.\n\nIt is clear, after considerable investigation, that these monies are accounted for and that no loss to the School resulted, but the manner in which this transaction was put through, and indeed all the transactions relating to lot 47, leave Mr. Lett open to most severe censure.\n\nBalances of accounts payable at July 15th., remaining unpaid at time of audit, are Kelly Douglas, $200.00; Leckie Shoe Co., $200.00; Gillespie Grain Co., $100.00, and Vancouver Island Coal Co., $500.00 - a total of $800.00. These will be retired when funds are considered to be available for this purpose.\n\nA list of accounts payable at July 15th., is attached.\n\nA statement of disbursements by accounts is attached.\n\nCompensation - B.C. Workmen's\n\nTo comply with the requirements of the B.C. Act the following employees are subject to deductions for medical aid and the School is required to pay the usual assessment.\n\nLaundry Matron - Miss Augustine\nManual Training Instructor - Mr. Maclean\nEngineer - Mr. Cooper\n\nMr. Jones, the Farm Manager, under an arrangement made by Mr. Lett with the agent of the Mutual Benefit Association, Vancouver, has a personal accident policy with a premium of $2.50 a quarter. This has been in force two years. Mr. Jones pays the premium and is then reimbursed by the School for one-half of the premium.\n\nMr. Jones' explanation is that it is considered cheaper for both employer and employee than ordinary compensation contributions.\n\nThe transaction appears to be quite irregular and the Indian Commissioner, Major Mackay, is being asked to discuss the question of compensation as it relates to the School with officers of the Board in Vancouver.\n\nGENERAL\n\nIt is obvious that there has been no effective Departmental or financial control of the operation of this School. One man, the Principal, has been in the position to spend large sums of money as he saw fit and has not been...\nrequired to maintain even simple records of his transactions. He has engaged in various ventures outside the School accounts, but on behalf of the School, and has used the School credit in doing so. The finances have, accordingly, been quite involved.\n\nHowever, there is nothing in the record to show that the late Principal, Mr. Lett, used School funds for other than School purposes, provided he can furnish a satisfactory explanation concerning the disposition of the cash presumably received from Mr. Eggleston on May 24th. He deserves criticism for the manner in which the funds were handled.\n\nThe true standing of the School's financial position has not been disclosed and if the Department is entirely responsible for the operation, then steps should be taken to instil an effective control.\n\nMonthly estimates of expenditure and revenue could be submitted through the Indian Agent at Lytton, to the Commissioner at Vancouver, for approval. If these were followed by a monthly financial statement the Commissioner could accept some responsibility for the School's operation. Consideration should also be given to having the Indian Agent countersign all cheques drawn on the School account.\n\nReceipts, purchase orders, paylists and timesheets should be introduced and the Principal should engage a suitable clerk to ensure that records will be kept properly.\n\nAn interim financial routine was prepared and left with the Acting Principal, Mr. Stewart, and this could be confirmed or amended by the Department, as considered advisable. A form of financial statement was included and a copy of the instruction is attached.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, Vancouver, was present at the School during the greater part of the audit and afforded valuable assistance, as did the Indian Agent at Lytton, Mr. Strang.\n\nAppreciation is also due to the Acting Principal of the School, Mr. Noel Stewart, and the Farm Manager, Mr. Vaughan-Jones, who produced records and information and afforded every possible assistance.\n\nThe audit was facilitated by the preliminary investigations made by Agencies Inspector Coleman and School Inspector Barry.\n\nI am satisfied that I received all the information available at the time of audit.\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.

Secure a supply of receipts books with suitable stubs or preferably in duplicate and issue a receipt for each item of cash received in the office. Mark the office copy very plainly with the account to be credited.\n\n2. Enter receipts in Cash Book from the receipt stubs or duplicate and make the distribution to accounts at the same time. There is no apparent necessity for a subsidiary or supplementary Cash Book.\n\n3. See that the bank deposit coincides with the total of receipts to the time of the deposit.\n\n4. Request the bank to allow deposit in full and make a debit for any exchange on cheques included in the deposit.\n\n5. Write cheques to cover all disbursements. If necessary to make cash payments, write cheque for total of a list and deposit. Suggest advance for principal and all cash disbursements for expenses to be later paid by cheque, restoring the advance to the original amount.\n\n6. Enter cheque number on each paid voucher and file vouchers in cheque number order by months.\n\n7. Show allocation by accounts on voucher or cheque stub and distribute accordingly in cash book.\n\n8. Endeavour to pay all accounts in months in which they occur to simplify determination of current standing at any month's end.\n\n9. Definite pay list should be prepared at the end of each month, showing gross salary or wages, deductions, net amount, distribution of deductions by classes, such as board, N.D.Tax, Workmen's Compensation, War Savings Certificates, Etc.\n\nCheques can then be written to the staff and employees and also the Department of National Revenue, Workmen's Compensation, War Savings Certificates, etc., from the same voucher; i.e., the paylist.

At the end of each month write a cheque in favour of the school for value of farm produce delivered to school and deposit this. This will bring this transaction within the scope of simple cash book system.\n\n13. To avoid opening ledger accounts for the present, the following procedure could be adopted:\n\n\"After the monthly totals of the cash book have been entered and balanced, post the previous total immediately underneath and add to give totals to date. This three-line total plan will give essential information and facilitate the auditor's check.\"\n\n14. Any further development of accounts to be maintained should be advised by the Department.\n\n15. Centralized control of school finances is essential and this applies particularly to the ordering of goods or services and payment for the same.\n\nAll orders or commitments should be placed or incurred only with the approval of the Principal or his Deputy, and any emergency order placed otherwise should be confirmed immediately. A supply of official purchase order forms would be an advantage, and these should be numbered and copies filed.\n\nWhen an invoice is received, the copy of the purchase order should be attached and filed with the account when paid. If all orders bear an estimated cost, the orders remaining on file will furnish a total at any time of outstanding accounts or commitments.\n\nPayment in cash by employees should be permitted only for necessary travelling expenses, small items for freight, express, etc. These claims for reimbursements should be submitted at least monthly, and these accounts should be paid by cheque.\n\n16. Some endeavour should be made to budget the school and, very particularly, the farm's finances. The farm manager and other heads of departments should furnish the Principal with estimates of revenues and expenditure for the ensuing year. These should be examined carefully and discussed from time to time and then fitted into the budget which the school knows from experience is reasonable. Monthly estimates should then be submitted to the Principal for approval of the next month's programme. Expenditure must be kept within income.\n\n17. The Manual Training section should list the current stock of saleable articles\u2014priced as agreed upon. A list of additions to stock should be furnished monthly. All sales, whether for cash or on consignment, should be recorded by the school's sales book. These should be in triplicate\u2014one with the books, one with the office, and one with Mr. McLean. Returns to stock should be recorded in the same manner and plainly marked \"RETURNED\".\n\nStock taking should be at least annual, and this should be carefully checked and balanced with the book record.\n\nAccounts should be opened for all persons having goods on consignment.\n\n18. All transactions should go through the school books and there should be no separate ventures with separate bank accounts.\n\nPurchases of candy should be paid for by the school and proceeds of sale credited.\n\nOctober 12, 1941.\nOttawa, October 20, 1941.\n\nC.

Apparently it has been the custom to send goods on consignment to various stores and it is extremely doubtful if this was a profitable venture. However, without considering the financial side of the matter, there is another angle with which we have had considerable experience. I refer to the fact that we feel that Indian residential schools should not engage in extensive commercial activities. It is understood, of course, that there may be a surplus of farm products which might have to be sold in the open market but I refer particularly to other commercial\n\nRev. C.F.

F. Hives as principal of the St. George's School, Lytton, British Columbia. Mr. Hives, I may state, has had 25 years' experience in the operation of Indian residential schools. Half of this period was spent by him as principal of the Lac la Ronge Anglican Residential School, Saskatchewan, and half as principal of the Shingwauk Home Residential School, Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. Mr. Hives reported for duty at the St. George's School on October 20.\n\nI am personally of the opinion that we have been fortunate in securing the services of Mr. Hives. Apart from his lengthy experience in Indian educational work, he has always been deeply interested in the welfare of his pupils, not only during their sojourn at school but during the years immediately following their graduation. Mr. Hives has always been recognized by the Department as one of our most successful principals, and I feel confident he will be in a position to make a worthwhile contribution at the St. George's School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDirector.\n\nIsaac Jones, Esq.,\nTreasurer, New England Company,\n26 Bloomsbury Square,\nLondon, W.C., England.\nCONFIRMATION\n\nOCTOBER 30 1941\n\nMAJOR D M MACKAY\nINDIAN COMMISSIONER\nVANCOUVER B C\n\nCONTENTS YOUR RADIOGRAM TWENTY-NINTH INSTANT CAREFULLY\nCONSIDERED AND DEPARTMENT PREPARED TO AUTHORIZE TWELVE\nHUNDRED DOLLARS ONLY FOR FURNISHINGS PRINCIPAL'S RESIDENCE\nST.

We arrived here yesterday, after a very pleasant trip through the States, and a more or less nerve wrecking trip from Hope to Lytton through the mountains. I reckon it is the craziest, wildest, and one of the most enjoyable rides I have had. My wife thinks it is the craziest and wildest, but does not consider it very enjoyable yet. Perhaps, after we have had ten or twelve years here, she will get to enjoy it.\n\nMr Stewart seems to have taken care of things here; for which we should be thankful.

Most of them belong to July - Sept. quarter and previous to that time. I am worried about them, for we have not the money to meet them. While I was in Ottawa, talking matters over, I was given to understand that if I came, the Department would start me off with a \"clean sheet\". Instead of which they have more or less handicapped my efforts to keep the accounts cleared off by using three thousand dollars of the quarterly per capita grant earnings to pay off old debts. This leaving me a little over four thousand dollars to work on. I am trying to pay for things, as we buy them, and I don't think I shall have very much, if any, difficulty in meet our obligations on the per capita grant allowed, but the old accounts are going to be a regular mill-stone and a great worry if they are not cleared off.\n\nIf you could let me know when it would be convenient for me to meet you next week, I will take a run up and see you between trains.

Mr. Strang, who is exceedingly helpful in every way he is able, is unable to give me very much advice regarding the above, excepting that he thinks I should see you.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n\"Chas.

It was necessary to correspond with the school and Mr. Indian Agent Strang on the subject, my files being incomplete.\n\nI enclose herewith a list of these accounts, from which it will be observed that they amounted to $6,388.67, of which $291.71 remains unpaid. They were all contracted by Mr. Lett and prior to July 15th.\n\nThe Reverend Principal, Mr. C.F. Hives, complains, with some reason, that it is impossible for him to assume the payment of this large amount of over six thousand dollars from his per capita earnings and at the same time finance the operation of the school. I would recommend that this amount be made a charge against the New England Company funds if possible.

By this time we should have received the statement for the months ended November 30 and December 31 but neither of them has yet been received. I should appreciate it if you would direct the Principal's attention to this oversight and have it definitely understood with him that the Department expects to receive this statement monthly.

May I express the hope, however, despite the difficulties you may experience, that the year upon which we have now entered may be for you and the institution a year of progress and accomplishment?\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\n\nReverend C. F. Hives,\nPrincipal,\nSt. George's Indian Residential School,\nLytton, B. C.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 17, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer you to my letter of January 15 last with reference to the St. George's Indian Residential School. In the last paragraph of that letter I pointed out to you that the monthly financial statements for the months ended November 30 and December 31 had not been forwarded by the Principal. It is now February 17 and we have not received either the reports just mentioned or the report for the month ended January 31. It is difficult to understand why the Principal has apparently ignored the instructions contained in official letter of October 24. Please take up this matter with him immediately and point out definitely to him that the Department expects these monthly financial statements promptly at the end of each month.\n\nIn a previous communication I intimated to you our desire that you should visit this school occasionally and make certain that the new Principal is handling matters in the way we desire. Have you found it possible to go to St. George's School since Mr. Hives took charge? I think you will agree with me that, although we are confident that Mr. Hives should be able to handle this school, at the same time, in view of past experiences, it is very important that a close check should be kept on it. You can, therefore, understand why I am so anxious to have you visit the school in order that you may let me have a first-hand report regarding its operation under the present management.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nR.A. Hoey\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have received your letter of February 17th, your file 165-0-1 regarding St. George's Indian Residential School, Lytton, B.C.\n\nThe attention of Reverend Mr. Hives was called on three separate occasions to the instructions issued by the Department with respect to the monthly financial statement required and, each time the Principal promised that the return would be submitted without undue delay. Just prior to the receipt of your letter, I wrote to Indian Agent Strang instructing him to visit the school and, if necessary, assist the Principal in compiling the statement required. On February 20th a copy of the financial report covering the period October 1st, 1941 to January 31st, 1942, was received here and, it was assumed that the original copy of the report had been sent direct by Mr. Strang to the Department. Mr. Strang has been requested to advise me just what was done in this connection and, instructed to submit these returns in future to this office for transmission to the Department. I enclose herewith an amended copy of the return in question received from Mr. Strang today. In discussing the matter a few days ago with Mr. Hives he assured me that, in future, these returns would be sent in promptly.\n\nAlthough it was difficult for me to arrange to do so, I have found it possible to visit the school on two occasions since Mr. Hives assumed his duties as Principal. Outside of evidence of dissatisfaction among the teaching staff, and indications of a desire on their part to resign, things appeared to be satisfactory, considering that Mr. Hives was new to St. George's and its problems, and that he was in the process of organizing the school along the lines he felt would produce the best results. Perhaps I should add, however, that I was somewhat disturbed to find a tendency on the part of the qualified teachers to seek employment elsewhere.\nAt the present time, I doubt, if Mr. Hives has a single teacher on his staff holding a Canadian Teaching Certificate. Inspector Barry and I were very sorry to see Mr. Noel Stewart leave St. George's. The reasons for Mr. Stewart's resignation are not entirely clear but, it would appear that it was largely due to very definite differences of opinion with respect to the academic work and control of the children. Mr. Stewart's record with the Department is regarded here as a highly satisfactory one, and it is unfortunate that at a time when so few certificated teachers of his experience and ability are available, that we should lose him from our service. These matters are mentioned at this time not in any way as a criticism of Mr. Hives or his administration of the school, but to advise you of the changes that have occurred in the teaching staff since Mr. Hives took over.\n\nIn addition to my own visits to St. George's, Inspector Barry spent some time at the school on November 17th, and Mr. Indian Agent Strang is a frequent visitor and, according to Mr. Hives, has been most helpful to him.\n\nAt the request of the Reverend Principal, I have arranged for Inspector Barry to visit St. George's on Tuesday next to assist the teachers and lay down a plan of work for the various grades for the balance of the school year. It is also intended to have Captain Barry make a thorough inspection of this school sometime in May at which time it should be possible to make a fairly accurate assessment of the class room work accomplished and the general administration of the school under the Principalship of Mr. Hives.\n\nI shall have Inspector Barry report briefly on conditions as he finds them at the school following his visit on Tuesday next, and will furnish the Department with a copy of same when received. In the meantime I should like to assure you that your instructions with respect to keeping a close check on the administration of the school will not be overlooked.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nR.A.Hoey, Esq.,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nMarch 7, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 5th instant with reference to the St. George's Indian Residential School. I have carefully noted the contents of your letter and feel that you are doing everything possible to carry out our instructions in regard to this school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nNew Lytton Hotel,\nLytton, B.C.\nMarch 11th 1942.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nAt the direct request of the Rev. C. Hives, and acting on your instructions, I have visited the St. George's Indian Residential School, Anglican Church, Lytton Agency. Yesterday I was at the school from about 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., and again from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. To-day I was at the school from about 10 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.\n\nDuring the morning and afternoon sessions yesterday and again this morning I spent the whole of the available time in the classrooms. The various teachers were given detailed instruction and advice with regard to the work to be undertaken in each Grade and Sub Grade. Mr. R.M. Allen, the teacher of the senior boys' observed while I taught in Miss A.M.H. Flower's senior girls' class and Miss Flower observed while I taught in Mr. Allen's class and also while I was in Miss J. Hives's classroom. In this way Miss Flower in particular and Mr. Allen to a lesser extent obtained some knowledge of the work to be done in subjects and Grades not taught in their own classrooms.\n\nAt the close of the class instruction yesterday afternoon I held a teachers' meeting to answer questions and deal with more general professional matters not covered during my actual visits to the various classrooms. In addition to the above teachers Mrs. I. W. Ansell, teacher of the Primary Sub Grades attended this meeting.\n\nIn the evening and at the request of the Reverend Principal I gave a lecture lasting about an hour on Indian Education in B.C. This lecture was similar to that given some time ago to the University Branch of the British Columbia Teachers Federation at the University of British Columbia. After the lecture I answered questions, some dozen or so members of the staff of St. George's School were present at this lecture. Following the lecture refreshments were served in the Principal's residence to all members of my audience who cared to attend.\n\nDuring my stay at the school I visited the children at their meals on two occasions, and also with the Reverend Principal visited the kitchens, boys' basement, Manual Training shop and certain other parts of the school.\n\nThe whole of my visit to St. George's School was for the purpose of rendering any assistance possible to the new teachers and to the Reverend Principal himself. It was in no sense an inspection of the school, and therefore the usual report is not being forwarded. A regular inspection will be carried out at a later date.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6463, file 338-1, part 6)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMy last report on this school is dated September 10th 1941. At that time Mr. N. Stewart was Acting Principal of the school, and was also in charge of the Senior Boys' Class. He was a certificated teacher holding an Alberta First Class Certificate and had ten years experience in Indian schools.\n\nAt the time of my last inspection the remaining classroom teachers were:\n\nMiss Dora P. White  \nFirst Class B.C. Certificate  \nand nine years experience in Indian schools.\n\nMiss W. Fisher  \nSecond Class Manitoba Certificate  \nand fifteen years experience including two years in Indian schools.\n\nMiss E.H. Walkem  \nIndian, on first appointment with only a few weeks teaching experience and holding an Interim First Class B.C. Certificate.\n\nThe whole of the above qualified teachers have left St. George's School since the appointment of the present Principal and are now engaged in war activities. As far as I can discover none of these teachers were satisfied to remain on the staff under the present Principal.\n\nI am particularly sorry to lose the services of Miss Walkem, towards whose education at the Victoria Normal School the Department had made a grant, and who did splendid work here I find by the response to my questions and teaching in the Junior Classroom which she left only a few weeks ago. The various Grades taught by her are well above the average for this time of the year.\n\nIt is of course particularly difficult to obtain qualified certificated teachers at the present time. The teachers listed below none of whom hold Provincial Certificates are at present in charge of the various classrooms.\n\nSenior Boys:\nMr. Richard Edward Allen, age 31, educated Vancouver College and at the Anglican Theological School attached to the University of British Columbia. Mr. Allen has Senior Matriculation standing and has taught for some six years in Private Boys' Schools in Vancouver and West Vancouver.\n\nSenior Girls:\nMiss Alwen Mary Homer Flower, age 35, educated in England and holding the English Board of Education Certificate for Elementary schools following a two years training in Truro, England. This girl has had some ten years teaching experience in English elementary schools.\n\nJunior Grades:\nMiss Jean Leona Hives, age 21, daughter of the Reverend Principal. Miss Hives passed part of the Junior Matriculation test in Ontario and took at least one year's music in Toronto.\n\nPrimary Room:\nMrs Ivy Winnifred Ansell, age 36, Mrs Ansell did not complete her certificate as a teacher in England where she however taught about two years. Coming to B.C. she taught for about four years in various private schools.\nOf the above teachers only Miss Flower can be considered a professional. She appears to me to be a highly capable teacher. Mr. Allen may or may not prove a success. As far as I could learn in Vancouver he is not noted as a successful teacher. With the professional assistance which I have given to him during the present visit to St. George's School he may do better. Though he is qualified to enter the Vancouver Normal School he would not appear to have considered it worth his while to take the course there, and has therefore no B.C. certificate.\n\nMiss Hives is only acting as a substitute teacher in the classroom till such time as the reverend Principal can find a qualified teacher. She was and is also acting as a girls' supervisor at the school, or in some such capacity. Miss Hives is most anxious to teach as well as she can and I do not think she is neglecting the classroom work.\n\nMrs. Ansell does not appear to me to be a very successful teacher, but here again she may do much better now that she has some idea of what is required in the teaching of the Primary Sub Grades in an Indian school. She has a very good background and was at Oxford following her partial training in England.\n\nApart from the fact that none of the teacher at the school hold Provincial certificates recognized in Canada, I must say that the general conditions found to exist in the various classrooms are quite satisfactory at the present time. The whole of the teachers are sincere in their desire to do their best for the children. They all appeared very glad indeed to have my advice, and all took notes throughout my two day visit.\n\nAfter my proposed regular inspection of the school in May next, when various standard tests will be given to the children, it will be possible to judge better the success or failure of the various teachers now employed at St. George's.\n\nThe food being supplied to the children appears to me to be excellent in every way.\n\nFire drills are organized and the Manual Training is being properly carried out.\n\nThe children appear quite happy. They are certainly under much better control than on the occasion of previous visits. I do not know just how much corporal punishment there is at the school. This matter will be gone into in greater detail in my next report.\n\nFrom the various Class lists handed to me by the teachers there would appear to be 79 boys and 84 girls at the moment in the school. I saw all of these children except one boy in Grade 3 who was ill. I am not perfectly certain that these numbers are correct but they may be taken as approximate.\n\nThe whole of the school was much cleaner than on the occasion of any former visit.\n\nI trust that the information contained in this brief report on my visit to St. George's School will be of assistance to you and the officials of the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H.

Lett, and one that did not previously come to light for the reason there was no indication of same in Mr. Lett's records. I have no alternative but to recommend payment of the account, and that if possible it be made from the New England funds.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M.

A.R. Lett, with a view to having him explain why this account was not paid from funds provided by the per capita grant and payments from New England Company funds.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

I do not think they would care for any written thanks as the forgetting of arrears is not strictly in order.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n\"Chas. F. Hives\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nCommissioner of Indians for B.C.,\nVancouver\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nVancouver.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFor some years the School carried blanket benefits through the Workmens Compensation Board at the rate of .50 cts per capita. The Board after an expensive accident to the Engineer, felt it could not continue at the rate above stated and raised the rate to 190 cts which rate was, according to the feeling of the School Principal and Staff, in excess of what could be managed and cancelled the contract.\n\nWhile the Board accepted this cancellation it insisted that three positions in the school were liable to benefits and carried these members stating that even though the School was a Dominion Institution the members came under the regulation, no recognition of this was made by the School and the differences ran along for a lengthy period of time when as you are aware the Board brought the issue to a head and the School was found liable for all this back accumulation of assessments, the payment of which was undertaken over a period of time and part payment made the remainder to be paid as soon as possible. This arrangement was acceptable by the Board and as there was no further approach by the Board the matter was carried over. The School financially was not able to meet this up to July 15th of last year hence the presentation of the present account.\n\nDetails of the dealings with the Compensation Board are on file at the School and the Board itself should be able to produce detailed information.\n\nI am sorry I cannot be more explanatory but the School has not occupied my mind to any great degree since my return to Parish work, and the past has been laid aside.\n\nyours very sincerely,\n\nsigned A. R. Lett\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nVancouver,\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nYou are aware that there was some difference in opinion in the payments to the Compensation Board and an account there accumulated which was undertaken to be paid as soon as the school finance could handle it and part of which was taken care of during my time. There should be letters on file at the school providing information in detail regarding all the dealings correspondence etc. the school had with the Board. The Board itself can give detail regarding the matter. As I have been released now for nine months I cannot by memory make a statement with any degree of correctness.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n\"A.R. Lett\"\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 16th ultimo with reference to an account which the Workmens' Compensation Board, Vancouver, B.C., was claiming as owing by St. George's Indian Residential School, I would advise that this matter was taken up with the Reverend A.R. Lett and I enclose herewith copies of his two undated letters recently received in this connection. Also, copy of letter dated the 4th instant received from Reverend C.F. Hives, Principal of the school, from which it will be observed that he has discussed the matter with the Board and they have agreed unofficially to make no further claim.

I find they are in need of such, and as far as I can make out, they have never had any. There really is not very much to the little book, but I hope you will find it sound, and I would like your comments after you have read it over.\n\nPerhaps Mr Phelan would care for a copy.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr R.A.Hoey,\nSup.

I have been receiving very encouraging reports from the Morley (United Church) School, Morley, Alberta, and the Grouard (R.C.) School. It would appear that at both these institutions they have succeeded in building up very fine pupil organizations. The members of these organizations enjoy a large measure of autonomy and in this way develop initiative and assume responsibility. I am hopeful that after you get definitely settled at Lytton you will explore the possibilities of promoting such organizations amongst the pupils, if such organizations are not already in existence.\n\nYour courtesy in sending forward the book of rules is very much appreciated.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend C. F. Hives,\nPrincipal,\nSt. George's Indian Residential School,\nLytton, B.C.\nRev. C. F. Hives,\nPrincipal\n\nJune 21, 1942\nLytton, B.C.\n\nDear Mr Hoey:\n\nMany thanks for your letter received today. The little present enclosed with this letter will surprise you, won't it? But it a relic of the past administration of St. George's, Lytton. Not during the administration of Mr Lett, I am happy to say, but not so many years ago. I was talking to a man the day before yesterday, who was a pupil of the school, when they were in use. And although he assured me he has never been a victim, yet he had seen them used on boys and girls. He said two girls ran away, and they were chained together and driven home in front of the Principal. They used the shackles to chain runaways to the bed. They also had stocks in the playgrounds. And they were used.\n\nI am telling you this, because I want you to know how very much has to be irradiated from the memories of these people, before they will develop confidence in the administration of this school. And until that confidence is developed, very little will be done in the matter of autonomy and pupil organization. It will come. I know it will come, by God's help. After I came here, I looked into the matter of forming groups and placing captains and their respective assistants at the head of each group of 12 boys. The Sr. Teacher said it could never work. He ridiculed the idea, and gave no support or encouragement to the movement. He has gone, and rightly so. I have kept the idea alive, and the captains have been recognised. Recognised by the payment to them of one dollar a month, and I know it will succeed. During the last six months, I have tried to teach my boys just one thing; A sense of Honour. Toward the end of the term, they were just beginning to realize a little of the glory of it. And next term they will realize more.\n\nAfter years and years of mal-administration, please don't look for definite results too quickly from St.\nGeorges! But it will come, With God's help, and your interest and human sympathy you won't be disappointed.\n\nKindest regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPrincipal.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr R.A. Hoey,\nSupt. Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 29, 1942.\n\nDear Mr. Hives:\n\nPlease accept my most sincere thanks for your letter of the 21st instant. I was indeed surprised - perhaps I should say shocked - at the contents of the parcel, which reached me a few days ago.\n\nI can understand now why there appears to be such a widespread prejudice on the part of Indians against residential schools. Such memories do not fade out of the human consciousness very rapidly. You and I may not be able to do much but we can at least be humane and kindly in our treatment of these underprivileged and unfortunate people.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend C. F. Hives,\nPrincipal,\nSt. George's Indian Residential School,\nL Y T T O N, British Columbia.\nSt. George's School\nLytton, B.C. July 4, 1942\n\nDear Parents & Girls & Boys:\n\nI wonder how you are standing this hot weather? Of course, you are all so used to it, you will not notice it like those who are new to the country. I am very glad you are all away from this hot building. It really is terribly hot, no matter where you go. It is also terribly quiet since you left for your holidays. No laughing is heard, or crying or shouting or singing. Not even the banging of doors or the hurrying of feet up and down the stairs. Sometimes it would be quite nice to hear the boys with their heavy boots running around. It is really no nice place to live in when Indian girls and boys are away. At least, I would not like to live here very long without them. There are too many lonely rooms.\n\nI do hope you are all enjoying your holiday time. I know you girls and boys will enjoy your holidays if you do not think too much about yourselves, and try and help your people all you can. And of course, you parents will enjoy having your children home if you can get their love and respect. You will get the love and respect of your children if you can show them the right way of living. Love and respect does not come by handing out candy to your children, but just by living kindly decent lives. Remember what I tried to tell you girls and boys at our last service in the chapel. It is your duty to love your parents. To be faithful and true to them. You want have them for many years, and when they go, you cannot have a chance to help them; no matter how sorry you may be.\n\nMany of you were at the races last Wednesday. I also went for a short time. But it was so very dusty and hot; and I thought the people all looked tired and hot, as though they would rather have been having a nice quiet time at some lovely green cool place like Botanic Lake.\n\nI felt sorry for the horses. They too, were hot and dusty and tired; and when the men shouted and swore at them, they were confused and frightened. I expect they thought human beings are queer kind of animals. I like horses. They are so clean and decent. They don't get drunk and shout and curse and swear, and use God's name in a bad way. And when I saw two men bucked off, almost as soon as they got into the saddle, I felt like clapping for the horses.\n\nWe are working and making some changes; and I think when I write to you again, I shall have more news for you about the changes we are making, and the new people who are coming.\n\nTake care of yourselves, girls and boys, and try and be a blessing and a help to your people.\n\nGod bless you all,\n\nYour friend\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nSt. George's School,\nLytton, B.C.\nAugust 3, 1942\n\nDear Parents & Girls & Boys:\n\nThere are so many things I would like to say to you, I shall have to be careful and not make my letter too long. And in case it may be too long, I shall start by telling you of the arrangements for meeting you on Thursday August the 20th.\n\nMr Vaughan Jones will take the big truck to Merritt and meet the Merrit pupils at noon, Thursday August 20th, and will also gather up the pupils who leave on the way. Be sure to be there on time, so that he may not have to wait, or return without you.\n\nI shall go to Ashcroft on the same day with the School bus, and will be at the Ashcroft Manor at noon. All pupils from that district please be on hand.\n\nIt would help quite a bit if all pupils living around Lytton, and on the other side of the river toward Lillooet would come to Lytton. We have to be so careful with the gas and tires these days.\n\nI do hope you have all had a good holiday, and that you are all looking forward to the coming term at school. I am looking forward to it with a great deal of pleasure, for I would like it to be the best in the history of St. George's. There will be quite a few changes in the staff, though many of the old staff will be with us. Miss Paladeau, as you all know married the Baker man, and we have a man to take her place as Boys' Supervisor and Vice-principal. His name is Mr Hothom, and he has had a great deal to do with boys. Especially sailor boys. I am sure the boys will like him. Mr Cooper also left, and we have a new man coming in his place. Mr Eggleston has left, and Mr Newton Thomas is now in his place. I know you will like Mr Thomas. He is the son of Bishop Thomas of the Diocese of Brandon, and Mrs Thomas is the daughter of one of our clergy. They have both been in the Indian work for a number of years, and know Indian girls and boys very well. They have a dear little boy of 2\u00bd years of age, and his name is Charlie. There will also be a new lady in the Laundry, and three new teachers.\n\nThis year, I am asking Mr Mclean to take on a class of the older girls in the Manual, so that they may learn how to use a hammer and saw; so that they may be able to make little things for their home when they grow up. I think the girls will enjoy this part of their training.\n\nI wonder what you have all been doing during your holidays. I hope you have all been useful, and I hope you have all been able to get in some swimming. I have not done very much, for there is not very good swimming around here. Next year, I hope we shall have a real swimming pool, made of cement, and clean and safe. I have seen many of you during holidays, and it has always been such a joy to me to meet you, and to get your smile and \"Hallo, Mr Hayes\" I have been so pleased to see how nice and clean you have kept yourselves, and so sadly I have not heard one single bad thing about our girls and boys. I have also visited some of your homes, and it has been such a delight to me to see how clean and comfortable many of them are. I love to see a clean, comfortable home. They seem to speak of love and happiness, which are the best things of life.\n\nWell, what have I been doing? Weeding, painting and making jam. I never saw so many big weeds in my life. They really do grow wonderfully well in this country. If they had their way about it, they would crowd out everything else. And so we have to fight just as our soldiers have to fight the enemy, and let the good stuff grow.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6463, file 388-1, part 6)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThen the painting. We have to do a little each year, and this year we have been painting the two dining rooms. Guess what color? I won't tell you, but just see if your guess is right. I think you will like it very much.\n\nWe have made over two tons of jam. I was almost going to say \"I have made it.\" Well, I have had a lot to do with it, and I know it is good jam, and I think we shall enjoy eating it next winter.\n\nMr. McLean has been making a new classroom. Guess where. It will be very nice, and the one under the chapel, which was always so cold in the winter, will not be used again.\n\nNow I want to say a word to the girls and boys who are old enough to stay away from school, and who will now be taking their place in life, and making a living for themselves. They are Dolia Shute, Susanne Swanson, Mandy Adams, Marjorie Williams, Annie Edmonds, Jimmie Johnson, Jimmy Charlie, John Abbott, Oscar Phillips, Dan Phillips. I wish you all success. Don't forget us. Don't forget the best St. George's has tried to teach you. Even though you are leaving us, I would like you still to feel that you belong to us. And when you can, I want you to come to our Chapel service and Holy Communion. In fact, I would like all who read this letter; If you have children in St. George's, or if you once went to school at St. George's, I would like you to feel that you are part of the family of St. George's. I want to be your friend. I want to feel that you are really trusting us with your little girls and boys. I know you love them. And although we cannot give to them your love, we shall always try and teach them about the love of mother and father, and we shall try and take care of them in every way, so that they may even feel a little of the love of home sweet home.\n\nI expect there will be more little girls and boys coming to us. I mean new brothers and sisters. I hope so. Don't be afraid of sending them to us. We shall take care of them in our home.\n\nGod bless you all.\n\nYour friend and principal.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6463, file 888-1, part 6)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nDear Mr Hoey:\n\nIt is just a year ago today since we arrived at St. George's; and I feel like writing a few lines to you, because you are too far away for me to come to your office to tell you that in spite of the world, flesh and Hitler, things are going along at a fairly normal rate.\n\nIn some ways, and at times the way has been difficult, but not more, and perhaps not as much as I expected, when I came here. And I think I can honestly say the situation is very much better than I expected, and we are confident of the future, so long as we keep our eyes fixed \"Toward the Sunrising.\"\n\nOur progress along academic lines has been rather slow on account of the difficulty of securing teachers. The original teaching staff did not stay long after I came, partly because they had already applied for war work, and partly because they could not stand the change. Not that any of them had either liking or respect for my predecessor, but they developed the foolish idea that they could be a law unto themselves, and such people are difficult to deal with. I was, therefore, relieved when orders came for them to join up. I have since found they were not loyal to the school.\n\nThe other ladies on the staff have continued, and I think they are fairly happy in their work.\n\nI have not been able to fill the teacherships with certificated teachers; though all four classrooms are being taken care of by competent people, who have all had very good educational training, and are doing excellent work in the classrooms. In this connection, I wish to assure you that duly qualified teachers will be engaged when such are available.\n\nOne of our biggest difficulties is the matter\nof salaries. Under the present per-capita grant, we are not able to pay present day wages, and yet I have been forced to raise salaries, in some instances, in order to retain or obtain services of staff workers. This is quite a serious matter, as I am finding it extremely difficult to make ends meet. Prices of pretty well everything have advanced. In fact, it is unnecessary for me to say how difficult it is to operate on the bare per-capita grant. Clothing and footwear is a very large item, but which must be met somehow.\n\nThe matter of obtaining meat is a very serious situation, and yet it should not be, and would not be if I had a thousand dollars to buy twenty head of cattle. Instead of which, I have to sit by and see the Jew come in and buy them from the Indians. If there is a thousand dollars in the coffers of New England Company, I do not know of any better way it could be spent than by buying cattle. We have the feed to fatten them, and there is no more profitable way of disposing of cattle feed than by feeding it. If therefore you can possibly send us a thousand dollars from New England Company fund, will you please write me by Air Mail, so that if possible I may get ahead of the Jew and safe guard our meat supply for the Winter.\n\nOur farming activities have been quite good. We have had good crops, but the enormous amount of money we have had to pay out in extra labour absorbs a great deal of the profits. We can grow almost anything here by irrigation; but it entails a lot of hard work, which must be done by men and not by boys. During the twelve months we have had to pay $3200.00 in extra labour. This has been mostly to Indians, and so it has been well placed; but it is a serious drain on our financial resources.\n\nOur relationship with the Indians is very satisfactory. They come around quite a bit, and I hear some very favourable comment from them regarding the school and the pupils. The pupils came back from holidays in very good spirits, and have settled down very nicely. I do quite a lot of visiting with the old people, and I know from experience, that this pays over and over again.\n\nI feel the relationship between the school and the office in Vancouver is greatly improved. It is almost as much of a pleasure and privilege for me to visit the Commissioner in his office, as it was to visit you in your office. I never failed to bring back with me much encouragement from you, when it was my good fortune to visit you.\n\nThe Indian Agent, also, I think feels happier about the school, and is always very co-operative. I think\nconditions, as they exist here today, are a help to him in his work.\n\nWe have had no serious illness or deaths during the year. This is due, to a large extent, to the jealous care exercised by the school nurse. As a matter of fact, if anything, both she and the doctor err on the side of too much care; which probably is erring in the right way.\n\nThe year has taught me many things. Things I should have learned long ago, and which would have made my former years more of a success. At Shingwauk, I was always looking for results, and tried to instill that idea into my staff. I suppose, to some extent, I should retain that idea. But by far, the most important object in this phase of life is to give and give and give. There are so few definite instances of permanent success and so many instances, glaring instances, of apparent failure in this work, I really don't think they are worthy of much consideration. But if I and my staff get hold of the true idea of life, in that it is a tremendous privilege and joy to give and being able to give of oneself, that, I feel overcomes the feeling of failure, when it seems to hold up its ugly head.\n\nI am sure you must know what I mean. For I feel assure as can be you have come to that same conclusion in your own office. I have always had the idea you came to that office with very bright ideas of results from your labours. And although you have never said a word to me, I know there must have been times and times when you could have thrown it up for a more attractive and profitable work. Instead of which, consciously or unconsciously, you have been satisfied to give. Perhaps you have got hold of the joy and privilege. I hope you have, or life holds little else.\n\nAt present, I dwell on that subject at my staff meetings, and I think they are either seeing the light, or have already seen it and trying to give it to me.\n\nIn regard to the girls and boys, I like to speak of them as girls and boys, rather than pupils. I talk to them a great deal about the time when they shall grow up and live in little homes built by the side of rippling streams of water, with beautiful trees around. But just little homes full of life and happiness. I really don't think there is anything greater than that conception for these very poor and simple minded people. To some, this does not sound very ambitious. But at present, I am living for these children, and what the \"some\" think does not greatly concern me.\nYou'll think I am rambling on at some length; but I'd probably take up more of your time if I were in your office with you. And to me, it is time well spent, because I am more or less opening up my mind to someone, and that in itself is a good thing to do.\n\nWhen we see the end of the war in sight, I am going to send you a long list of articles which you may be able to get for us from dismantled camps etc. There will be a great deal of it available. I should think, like there was in the last war, and a lot of this equipment, we have here, would sure look good on the scrap pile. But we shall try and make out until that blessed time, which we pray may already be peeping over the horizon.\n\nAnd now, at the end of my first year at St. George's I want to thank you for all your encouragement and help.\n\nWith all good wishes to you and yours and myself and mine, and with Tiny Tim I would say. God bless us all.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMr R.A.

I have been absent from the office on a somewhat extended inspection trip in southwestern Ontario - hence the delay.\n\nIt is my understanding that Mr. Phelan, in my absence, has been in communication with Major MacKay, in respect to the purchase of cattle for your school. It is altogether likely that Major MacKay will discuss this matter with you at an early date, if he has not already done so. We naturally hesitate to spend this amount from the funds of the New England Company. It was our hope that the few dollars in this fund might be kept for an emergency. Mr. Phelan learned from the New England Company during his recent visit to London that their contributions to our schools are apt to cease at any time. I am afraid the financing of our schools in the immediate future will present a very serious and a very difficult problem. All the schools that I have recently visited are badly in need of repairs, and there appears to be a steadily growing opposition to the operation of residential schools by the general public.\n\nI was glad to learn that you had settled down at Lytton. Your interest in your pupils and in their general welfare has always been deeply appreciated. I feel confident that you will make a worthwhile contribution at St. George's.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.

Advanced cost of living has greatly effected our expenses, so that I find the burden is too heavy for the school resources to bear without calling on supplementary financial help.\n\nOur school does not stand alone in this financial situation. K.S.C.C. schools, in spite of the fact that they receive considerable help outside of the per capita grant, are finding great difficulty in financing the schools over which they preside.\n\nI do not anticipate further embarrassment of this kind in the future; but just at present I am finding it very difficult, and extremely worrying; and would appreciate your recommendation to the Department that $1500.00 of New England Company funds be released at this critical moment.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nLYTTON, B.C.

Hives, Principal of the above noted school, requesting an advance of $1500.00 from the New England Company funds to assist in financing the operation of the school, which he finds difficult at this time on receipts from the per capita grant, together with a letter from Mr. Indian Agent Strang endorsing the application.\n\nIn discussing this matter with Mr. Hives, he advised that he attributes the need of this assistance mainly to the increase in the cost of clothing and foodstuffs; he also pointed out that it had been necessary for him to increase the salaries in some cases in order to secure sufficient staff to keep the school in operation. I am sure the Department will agree that it is much better that the Principal advise the Department promptly, as he has done in this case, of difficulty in respect to financing, than to permit a situation to develop such as was experienced prior to his going to St. George's. Under the circumstances and in view of the importance of operating the school on a sound financial basis, I would recommend that the application be favourably considered.\n\nD.M.

F. Hives,\nPrincipal.\n\nMay 7, 1942.\n\nGENERAL RULES AND ADVICE FOR THE GUIDANCE OF STAFF MEMBERS\n\n1. All Staff members are expected to be familiar with the duties of their own department.\n\n2. Be sure, at all times, to keep your department clean and tidy. This is an important object lesson for the pupils.\n\n3. Be careful of your actions before children. They are excellent imitators.\n\n4. Do not discuss with the children matters concerning other members of the staff.\n\n5. Try and develop good and safe leadership amongst the girls and boys. You will always find leaders. See that they appreciate the privilege of leadership.\n6. Be careful in your method of punishing offenders. Do not give corporal punishment. If you think such is required, consult the Principal.\n\n7. Be cheerful about your work, and try and show to the children the honour and privilege of being able to overcome a difficulty and to accomplish a task.\n\n8. Take note of children under your care and see if they are enjoying life. Try to take a personal interest in each one. They are each different from the other, and require individual attention and understanding as far as you are able to give it.\n\n9. In all your teaching with Indian children be THOROUGH.\n\n10. Do not be offended if suggestions are made for the improvement of your department. Co-operate one with the other and with your Principal.\n\n11. Consult your Head Matron and Principal if you find your work very difficult. They will appreciate this confidence and will try to help you.\n\n12. Teachers are responsible for pupils during Recess time and for pupils going to and from classroom. They are also responsible for the sweeping and cleaning of their respective classrooms and for the Saturday morning scrub.\n\n13. Children are not allowed in staff rooms without permission of Head Matron.\n\n14. Supervisors must see that children's hair is cut regularly and decently. Also a proper record kept of all clothing and footwear given out to them.\n\n15. It is expected that all staff members will keep reasonable hours at night, and under ordinary circumstances, lights must be out by 11 p.m.\n\n16. Those in charge of machinery must be careful while children are around. They love to touch anything strange or attractive.\n\n17. In good weather, the children must play outside. Teachers should insist on this at Recess time.\n\n18. Staff members intending to be away for a meal, should notify the Kitchen Supervisor.\n\n19. Girls going to the Gymnasium are to go in a body and return in like manner when leaving.\n\n20. Girls and boys who appear to be over-tired in classroom or elsewhere, should be reported to Head Matron.\n\n21. Dormitory supervision should continue after lights are out until all are settled down.\n22. Boys' Supervisor should decide on the amount of clothing boys should take to the dormitory. Hats, jackets and boots are not required.\n\n23. Children should not be in dormitory during the daytime without permission.\n\n24. At all times insist on the dormitory being a dormitory and not a play-room.\n\n25. Dining-room doors and cupboards to be locked when unoccupied, and children are not to handle keys.\n\n26. Children are not allowed to go to the Indian Room without permission. And Indian parents, who come to see their children, must wait in the Indian Room.\n\n27. Read carefully the rules for Fire drill.\n\n28. All staff members should have a flashlight in their bedroom, in case of emergency.\n\n29. One month's notice will be given for the dismissal of a staff member, and should any staff member desire to leave, the same consideration is expected from them.\n\n30. The School is not responsible for medical treatment of staff members. The only two positions covered by Compensation Act are those of Laundry Supervisor and Engineer.\n\n31. At no time is a supply of wood to be kept in the kitchen.\n\n32. Matches are not to be left around where children can have access to them.\n\n33. All children's mail, coming and going, must pass through the office.\n\n34. In general, the Head Matron will supervise all domestic departments.\n\n35. Staff members are expected to attend Daily Prayers as they are able. All are expected to attend at least one service of Divine Worship in the chapel each Sunday.\n\n36. Growing children are all students of some kind and degree. What you teach them, while you are with them, will remain in them in some way or degree. Therefore teach them a love of truth and truthfulness. And the love of beauty, wherever it is found. Help them to know the value of these qualities, which are, perhaps the most important factors in the lives of all children. Teach them to be respectful and clean. Teach them kindness to all. You will find bullies amongst the boys. This is a bad element, but kindness will kill it. Not forgetting kindness and care to\nanimals. Teach them the importance of prayer. Don't let them neglect the bedside Prayer card, which all have received, and of which there is a supply. Teach them resourcefulness, and the importance of preparing to make an honest living with their own hands. Always try and keep before their minds the future with a home: A little home, well kept and full of Christian love.\n\nRemember, above all things, these children have a personality of their very own. It belongs to them. Was inherited by them, and is a definite part of their make-up. The duty of all staff members is to place before them, through the medium of their own lives, the perfect character of the Divine Son of God. His life is simple enough for all to understand. His character, although the most human of all characters, requires diligent perseverance in copying, but is the salvation of human nature.\nRev. C. F. Hives,\nPrincipal\n\nAugust 29th, 1943\nLytton, B.C.\n\nDear Mr Hoey:\n\nI have two children, a boy and a girl, who require advanced education; and under the present condition I am unable to finance them. After very careful consideration, I am writing you to ask if there is any way I could receive the help of four hundred dollars for their education. I sent my boy to school in Vancouver last year, and it cost me over four hundred dollars. I don't want him or his sister to stay here and have their education neglected.\n\nIn the Agreement between the N.E.Co. and the Department, it states: (1) That the Company will pay to the party of the second part, the sum of twelve hundred dollars annually towards the stipend of the Principal of the School and the maintenance of the school! I am not asking for any raise in my salary, but if financial help could honestly be given me, I assure you I shall be very thankful for it.\n\nWe are just about to commence our new term, and I am hopeful of it being the best in the school's history. Not because I have a very wonderful staff; but because there is such a wonderful spirit existing between the school and the parents and pupils.\n\nI would be glad to hear from you as soon as possible, so that, if possible, I may make plans for my youngsters going away.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr R.A.

In this regard may I say that there is no assurance that this payment will continue indefinitely. As a matter of fact the company has already advised us that, owing to present conditions, they are unable to continue the payment that has been made to the Mohawk Institute and I feel that it will not be long before they also discontinue the payment for the St. George's School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Labour to gather them is going to be quite a problem. He was asking me, a few days ago, if we would be able to help him out in gathering the fruit, by taking over some of the older pupils, and letting them work at it for wages.\n\nFor my part, I think it would be a very good thing for the older pupils to do this. It would give them a little pocket money for the Winter; and I feel they would be doing an important job; which, I am afraid will not be done unless they give a hand to do it.\n\nWill you kindly let me know your wishes in this matter. If they should go, I assure you they would be under the supervision of myself or some other school official.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nRev. C. F. Hives\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSuperintendent, Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 23, 1944.\n\nDear Mr. Hives:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 17th instant, in which you seek information with respect to the advisability of allowing a limited number of your senior pupils to gather fruit at an orchard which appears to be situated close to the St. George's School.\n\nIn view of the acute labour shortage existing throughout the Dominion, we can see no serious objection to permitting a number of the boys to take part in this work, under proper supervision. It is noted with satisfaction that this work would be under your own personal supervision or the supervision of a reliable member of the school staff.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend C. F. Hives,\nPrincipal,\nSt. George's Indian Residential School,\nDec. 26th, 1944\n\nDear Mr. Melan:\n\nI have your letter No. 165-0-4 of the 18th inst., relative to the list of books recommended for our use by Public School Inspector McArthur.\n\nYour reply to my letter raises the questions in my mind as to what should be taught in our Indian School, and what are the relative values of each department of the school in respect to each other.\n\nThese questions should rightly be answered by a competent Inspector of Indian Schools in council with his competent assistants. The one who is inspecting our school is, I believe, held in very high esteem by his provincial Department, yet he does not give me the impression that he knows the Indian or what is best for his advancement. A knowledge of their character, personality and their natural tendencies comes only through years of contact with them, and cannot be acquired through the reading of romantic literature. And without that knowledge, one cannot supervise properly educational training, or give judgement on which part of the training should take priority.\n\nDuring the past few months I have had to teach the senior boys. It has been rather a wonderful experience for me; in spite of the fact that it has tied me down, and I have had to work early and late in order to keep with my office work. They are fine boys, and work hard at their studies. I am convinced that they, as well as the senior girls, anticipate very eagerly the time when they will be looked upon as our equals. Therefore, keeping them in touch with the old Indian life, excepting what all Canadian children should learn of it in early Canadian History, cannot be of much value to them or their progress. I am of the opinion that Indian girls and boys are much more interested in knowing what other Canadians are doing in order to fit them for adult life, than they are in knowing what their ancestors used to do. They are wise enough to realize that if they live in the past, or try to copy the exploits of their forbears, they can never hold anything but an inferior position in any walk of life. Moreover, numbers of them, from their physical appearances, would pass for normal Canadians.\nthat number increases year by year. I don't think we could isolate the Indian, even were it wise to do so; and in the course of time they will become absorbed into the white population.\n\nI feel that one of the chief obstacles in the education and training of our pupils comes from the criticisms offered from time to time by well meaning people who occupy prominent positions, and who have taken a sudden interest in Indian welfare. It is to be sincerely hoped that when appointments of School Inspectors are made, the candidates' years of successful experience with the Indians will figure highly in the qualification required. I feel very strongly that Indian welfare, and the proper administration of Indian affairs should and will depend on our educational system.\n\nThere are some who would place academic training or study before all other training. The academic is important, and we give it the lion's share of time and interest in our school. Yet there are other sides of their training which are of equal importance; and without which, academic training stands alone as a menace to the whole structure of the Indian educational system. The nature, character, personality and strong tendencies in the Indian must be studied. In fact, it is that background we should work on.\n\nTake for instance religion. The Indian is naturally very religious. If he is not given a good type of religion, he will make one for himself. I know of this matter. I have seen it, and have heard much about it. And it is practised nearby. It is a kind of witchcraft or devilcraft; and they infuse it with certain of our Christian ceremonials; it hampers the work of the physician, missionary and school. It fosters superstition, degradation and a distrust of the white man. I spoke about religious education to Inspector Moirthur, but he is not interested. I am convinced of its importance in the proper development of these people.\n\nOr take the matter of morality: Since I knew the Indian, I have looked upon him as immoral, not immoral. In this respect, I might say that I have never had occasion to expel a pupil on the charge of immorality during the thirty years of my work with them. Yet nature is very strong in them; and they mature much earlier in life than does the white child; therefore require to guide that part of their emotional make-up along sound and safe channels. If we try to segregate the girls from the boys too much, we do much harm, and defeat our aims of high moral character building. It is extremely important that our girls and boys should be brought together under a good social leader or dancing instructor. For lack of a better, I have taught them many of our best dances. I\neven call off the old square dances; and they love it. If, through pressure of work or epidemic of sickness these social functions are neglected, the girls and boys become shy, sly and sneaky. The boys develop a dishonest streak, which finds them \"on the carpet\" for either being out of bounds or thieving.\n\nThere is the practical side of their training; which is very important. The boys love making and building. At present they are building a pig house; which, when completed, will be second to none in the country. The Manual Training Instructor and his classes of boys are entirely responsible for its construction. Besides such work, they make many wonderful things in the Manual shop. The girls do all the inside domestic work in a very efficient way under supervision.\n\nI would not minimize the importance of the academic side of our work. It is very necessary for the quickening of their thinking powers and reasoning capacities. But if these are developed ahead of the others I have mentioned, one can expect to find \"hot-heads\" who love to organize Native Brotherhood movements and such like. These movements are bound to come; but unless they have proper leadership, and those leaders have something more than academic training, they can only bring disaster and defeat the aims of the Department and Church in their efforts to advance the Indian to the level of Canadian citizenship. I feel sure it would be far better for you and the Department to recognize and demand stability of character in these people, than evidences only of smart academic training.\n\nThis letter is longer than I had intended writing to you. But I have done it partly for my own protection. I feel we have an incompetent School Inspector from the standpoint of over emphasizing academic training. I do want you to know my aims; and to give you the assurance that what I have given to you above is what I feel we should practice with Indian pupils.\n\nI would like to thank you very much for the little books you sent with the school supplies this year. They are useful, interesting and enlightening; and the pupils love them.\n\nMay I wish you a very Bright and Prosperous New Year.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr Philip Mclan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6463, file 888-1, part 6)\nRev. C. F. Hives,\nPrincipal\n\nDear Mr Hoey:\n\nWhile listening to the C.B.C. news broadcast last evening, it was announced that the Department intends increasing and intensifying academic education of Indians. I am enclosing a letter which I recently wrote to Mr Phelan. I feel very strongly about the matter, or danger, of over emphasizing academic education of our Indians. I am of the opinion it can be overdone, so that the Indian becomes somewhat over-balanced with his own importance, and therefore becomes a menace to his own welfare and steady progress, which he should make in order to attain the social standing he desires.\n\nThere is a large percentage of Indians who are shiftless and lazy. Would it not be well to emphasize manual training in their education. We here, at St. George's, have our Manual Shop. The boys take to it; and like it very much better than they do the classroom. I do sincerely hope this matter will be taken into consideration.\n\nIt is too bad we are so widely scattered; for I am of the opinion that you could obtain much valuable help, if you could have a small conference of principals and teachers, representing a cross section of Indian work throughout Canada, and of the various churches, or religious bodies.\n\nI am convinced that religion must have its place in the education scheme. Not altogether as a church matter; but as an integral part of the training plan recognised by the Department. These people are a religious people. Always have been. And if specific time is not allotted to this part of their development, they will, and do actually make a horrible form of religion, which is a menace to every effort we put forth for their welfare. And no amount of academic education will, of itself, eradicate it, or give to them the stability of character they need.\n\nAnother thing:- I feel we should be very\nMuch more careful in our choice of the ones who are to be given advanced education. They should be, not only capable of taking advanced education, but more important still, they should have personal qualities in themselves that will insure their making a fair success of their profession.\n\nThere are some, who are so intensely Indian, I feel it is almost a crime to encourage them to venture forth into professional life. At this moment we have a problem right here in the hospital at Lytton. An Indian nurse, fully qualified, has come to us. She is from Lac la Ronge. She is having an extremely difficult and unhappy time. Last week two nurses, (One of them acting matron) sent in an ultimatum, saying that if we did not get rid of the Indian nurse, they would quit before night. In honor, we felt bound to let them go. The only reason, as far as we could find out, for their action, was the fact that the nurse is Indian and has a higher professional standing than they. Moreover, any nurse or nurses, who would forfeit their positions at a moment's notice are not worthy of consideration. At the same time, the Indian nurse, who is efficient, honest, clean and of a high moral character, has a road before her, which, if she pursues it, will be almost a hell for her.\n\nI am very anxious indeed to see, and if possible to witness to, the success of our work. And because of this; and because of the years I have spent in the work, I would ask for your liberal consideration of what I have written.\n\nWith all good Wishes,\n\nI am, Yours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMr R. A. Hoey,\nActing Director,\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, January 17, 1945.\n\nDear Mr. Hives:\n\nMr. Hoey has referred to me your letter of the 14th instant and, for your information, I may say that I showed Mr. Hoey your recent letter addressed to me. Both of us are in general agreement with the statements that you make, and your suggestions will be kept in mind when considering applications for tuition fees to enable Indian children to take higher education.\n\nI note that you refer to a C.B.C. news broadcast. None of our officials here appear to have any knowledge of this broadcast.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend C. F. Hives,\nPrincipal,\nSt. George's Indian Residential School,\nLytton, B. C.\nWELFARE AND TRAINING\n\nThe three Indian Day Schools and one Residential School in the Agency provide adequate educational facilities. The attendance at the St. George's Residential School is not all that could be desired, due mainly to the fact that no Family Allowance is payable to Indian parents whose children attend a Residential School, will no doubt serve to decrease the attendance as the parents will, in all possible cases, send their children to a Day School in order to receive the Allowance. Results in this respect at the opening of the Fall Term will be most interesting.\n\nA. Strang,\nIndian Agent.\nSchools:\n\nShulus Day School finished the term with a good average attendance and no sickness reported. Kamloops Indian School reported several cases of chicken pox at the close of the term and a few children were unable to return home for a few days. No sickness reported from St. George's School and pupils returned on June 26th.\n\nG.E. Sharpe,\nIndian Agent.\n26. Bloomsbury Square,\nLondon, W.C.\n\n16th July 1945.\n\nPhilip Phelan, Esq.,\nWelfare & Training Service,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa,\nCanada.\n\nDear Mr Phelan,\n\nThank you very much for sending the Conveyance of Sale. I hope our future documents will be kept on a much more businesslike footing than appears to have been done during the past years.\n\nThis war has brought me the same flow of Canadian associations as the last, which I always look back upon with very happy memories.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nNEW ENGLAND COMPANY.\n\n[Signature]\nTreasurer.\nDear Mr Hoey:\n\nI am writing you a personal letter about a matter which has caused me some concern; and about which I would like your consideration and advice.\n\nWould you approve of my asking the W.A. of the Anglican Church to give us some support in the matter of clothing, linen and bedding. (I have by me a list of clothing etc., which I have to buy before Winter, amounting to approximately $1,000.00.) This would all be provided for by the W.A. if this school were supported by the W.A.)\n\nBut that is not my reason for asking the question. Heretofore, as far as I am aware, they have never been approached in this concern; neither has the Anglican Church, as far as I am aware, ever given any support, financial or otherwise, toward the maintenance of St. George's School. I am not making this statement in the spirit of criticism or judgement; but, in some way, the Anglican Church, is strongly of the opinion that St. George's School is part of her heritage and spiritual responsibility.\n\nI do not know just how you feel about the matter, but I am very strongly of the opinion that the Church, whatever be her creed or denomination, should maintain, and encouraged by your Department to maintain, a spiritual administration over the Indians; and particularly over every department of the school life. I mean in seeing that the staff workers are people with definite Christian principles. My belief is that the Indian is naturally religious; and if those religious tendencies are not guided aright, their whole spiritual and moral character becomes warped/degraded.\n\nFrom the way I size up the situation, and from a letter recently received from New England Company, this school of St. George's is not a Church school, yet the Anglican Church, through the principal appointed by you maintains her spiritual administrations and influence in the school. I presume such a condition will continue\nso long as a prudent and efficient administration is maintained. But an ordained man fail to give the required satisfaction, and the school again became a problem, I presume, would appoint whomsoever they saw fit, in or out of the ministry; which would, of course, cause some uneasy feelings in the church.\n\nAs I have said above, I am very strongly of the opinion, that, for the best interests and welfare of the Indians, the school needs the administration and supervision of the Church. And the Indian needs the Church in his upward climb to social equality. But if the Church has not been subscribing in anyway to the maintenance of the school, I don't see how she can expect, or how the Department can give any sympathetic consideration to the Church's claims to nominate an administrator.\n\nIf, on the other hand, the Church, through any of her branches or channels, can show that she has subscribed to the maintenance and support of St. George's, no doubt her position in the eyes of the Department would be strengthened.\n\nI would be very much obliged if you would let me know how you feel about this matter.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nI am Yours faithfully,\n\nChas. F. [Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nActing Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 16, 1945.\n\nDear Mr. Hives:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of August 12th and have noted with the utmost interest the expressions of opinions contained therein.\n\nIt is not an easy thing to define or to express in words the relationship that exists or should exist between the Government, the Church of England in Canada and the New England Company with respect to the operation of the two residential schools to which the Company have been contributing. We have experienced the utmost difficulty in bringing about an adjustment at Brantford. Although the Church of England have at no time contributed to the operation of the Mohawk Institute or to its upkeep, the Archbishop of Huron takes the stand that he should have the right to nominate the principal. The unbending attitude he has taken has led to a great deal of delay and confusion. I heartily agree with you that where the Church demands the right of nominating the administrator they should at least assume a portion of the financial burden. I am convinced that the taxpayers would insist on this if the subject ever becomes a matter of public discussion.\n\nI can see no valid reason why you should not accept the gifts of clothing from time to time from the W.A. These gifts would tend to create a greater interest on the part of the Church people in the school and would prove helpful to you from the standpoint of school finance. In this connection, you might discuss also with Major MacKay the desirability of securing a certain amount of discarded military clothing for instructional purposes. We\n\n......have\nhave discovered that the remodelling of this clothing provides the Indian population, particularly senior girls, with invaluable training - the training that serves a useful purpose after they take up life on the reserves.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDirector.\n\nReverend C. W. Hives,\nPrincipal,\nSt. George's Indian Residential School,\nLYTTON,\nBritish Columbia.\nWELFARE AND TRAINING\n\nEducation.\n\nNumerous visits were made to the St. George's Indian Residential School during the quarter. The school, on the whole, is kept clean and well ventilated. Adequate clothing and bed clothing is provided for the pupils and their meals are quite good.\n\nThe children appear happy in the environment.\n\nThe Principal of the school has experienced some difficulty in maintaining a full staff due to existing conditions. Actual farm cultivation has been reduced somewhat for the same reason, but ample garden and orchard produce will be available for the needs of the school.\n\nA. Strang,\nIndian Agent.\nDear Mr Phelan:\n\nI am writing you regarding the matter of applying to the Selective Service for my staff. So far, I have received very little help from them; and most of those who have come to me through the Selective Service office have been of little or no use. Pretty well, the type of people we are able to engage for this work are not in it for what they can get out of it. I mean, our best and most efficient workers are those who have a heart for the work. Generally speaking, Selective Service do not have that type through their offices.\n\nA little while ago the District Enforcement Officer came here and raised trouble because I was not able to show that all my workers had not been engaged through Selective Service. It seemed to me he was rather unreasonable in the attitude he took. Anyway I tried to call on him yesterday in Kamloops, and he was not in. His second in command was, and I explained the matter to him. He said \"Why not write your Department and get an exemption?\" Hence my reason for writing you.\n\nLast Spring I was greatly in need of a male help on the staff, and had advertised through the Selective Service in Vancouver. A man applied, but because we are in the Kamloops district, his application had to be transferred from the Vancouver office to the Kamloops office, where it was looked over and after a while sent on to me. I determined to work as fast as possible in securing the man, and jumped on the train at three o'clock in the morning. The train arrived in Vancouver, where the man lived, at 8:30. I immediately went to the phone and called up the man. The answer was \"I am not interested, have another job.\"\n\nIf you can get us an exemption from all this fuss and unnecessary bother, I think you would be helping us out, and I could then apply through the church papers where we would be more likely to get the right type of workers.\nOttawa, September 6th, 1945.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose for your information a copy of a letter which has been received from the Principal of St. George's Indian Residential School, Lytton, British Columbia.\n\nThis school is operated for this Department under the auspices of the Church of England and Indian pupils only are in attendance.\n\nThis Principal has experienced considerable difficulty in obtaining the staff required to properly handle the school. If an exception can be made in this case, I feel certain that it will assist him in obtaining the staff which he requires.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. H. Hereford,\nSecretary and Director of Planning,\nAdministration Board of N.S.S.,\n238 Sparks St.,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nEncl:\nNATIONAL SELECTIVE SERVICE\n\nOttawa, September 10, 1945.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of September 6th in which you enclosed a copy of a communication from the Principal of St. George's Indian Residential School in Lytton, British Columbia.\n\nIt is noted he is experiencing some difficulty in obtaining staff required to properly handle the school and requests right to advertise for same through the Church papers. As you are probably aware, since the writing of Mr. Hives' letter, the regulations controlling advertising have been considerably relaxed. As the regulations now stand, employers may advertise for help freely provided they first register vacancy with the local Employment Office and that men responding to the advertisement are directed to apply to the Employment Office, in order that they may be sent to their new employer under permit. This new regulation came into effect on September 3rd, and eliminates a great deal of the restrictions on advertising previously imposed.\n\nI suggest that Mr. Hives communicate his intention to advertise to nearest Employment Office, and I am confident the officials there will co-operate with him fully.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHarry Hereford,\nDirector of Planning.\nOttawa, 12th September, 1945.\n\nDear Mr. Hives:\n\nOwing to absence on holidays I have been delayed in answering your letter of the 7th ultimo.\n\nI now enclose for your information and guidance a letter from the Director of Planning of the National Selective Service.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. C.F. Hives,\nPrincipal,\nSt. George's Indian Residential School,\nLytton, B.C.\nWELFARE AND TRAINING:\n\nEducation:\n\nSt. George's Residential School: The recent epidemic of measles experienced by this school has wrought a hardship in that many pupils had to be refused admission during the month of September. Since the lifting of the quarantine admissions have been most satisfactory. The Reverend Principal deserves much credit for his able management of the school farm which will show very reasonable returns when the harvest is completed.\n\nThe school is clean and tidy and the pupils appear contended and are well behaved.\n\nA. Strang,\nIndian Agent.\nWELFARE AND TRAINING:\n\nThe regulation governing payment of Family Allowances to school age children only when they attend school is going to be of considerable assistance in the matter of attendance of children at the Day Schools. My first report in this matter to the Family Allowances recommends deductions in many cases in order to impress upon the parents necessity of having their children attend if they wish to secure the Allowance. In the case of children attending the Residential school there is some apathy on the part of the parents in view of the fact that they do not receive the Allowance when their children do attend.\n\nMy recent survey of the school situation for the Agency reveals that there are a large number of children not attending schools. In some cases, especially in the southern part of the Agency, accommodation in the Residential school is not sufficient with the result that children of school age cannot attend. My survey strongly recommended the erection of a day school in the Nicklepalm area of the Lytton Reserves as I am sure that good attendance would result. I have made similar recommendations for the Fountain and Bridge River and Katz Reserves in order to relieve the situation for the Residential schools.\n\nA. Strang,\nIndian Agent.\n26.

We received the sum of \u00a3250 in payment of the September Quarter instalment for the St. George's Residential School, Lytton, B.C.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nDoctor Isaac Jones,\nTreasurer,\nNew England Company,\n26 Bloomsbury Square,\nLondon, W.C., England.\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI wish to acknowledge, and also to thank you for your letter of the 5th inst. From what I read in your letter, and in between the lines, it would appear that you are much more in need of sympathy and real help than I am. Although such a thought does not diminish my difficulties or worries, not that I am afraid of either difficulties or worries. What I do fear is the lowering of standards of living.\n\nDuring my administration here, I have tried in every way to raise the standards of living, which I consider were, four and a half years ago, at a pretty low ebb. I am quite confident they have been raised; and to a standard which we should maintain. Our children are better fed, better clothed, more carefully and intelligently supervised, and more systematically and scientifically treated from the health standpoint. Consequently, they are much happier and satisfied. The parents seem to have more confidence in us. From past records on file, it would appear that there was a fair amount of adverse criticism of the administration here. If such exists here at present, I am unaware of it. From records of the past, truancy amongst girls and boys was a common practice. It is now an uncommon thing. Since last September we have had only three. They were very small boys, who went away altogether just before Christmas. They said they wanted to see the city Christmas lights. I have always felt truancy to be a good indication of the quality of supervision maintained in the school, as well as the standard of living.\n\nWe must maintain this standard of living. Our food, our clothing, our supervision, and our instruction and teaching must be equal in quality to that of any other well established boarding. But I cannot see how this can be done unless the present per capita grant is supplemented. I am well aware of the fact that the grant allowance is higher now than ever before; but so is the cost of living. Also the low missionary salaries seem to be a thing of the\npast. Since the end of the war, I have been able to secure better teachers and supervisors. But have had to increase salaries. Last November I was fortunate in being able to secure the services of a young man, who had been Carpenter Instructor in the army. I find him an excellent man with the boys as Manual Instructor. He had just recently been married to a young school teacher. She is now doing excellent work in one of our classrooms.\n\nI am very anxious to keep them; and naturally, the best way of doing this is to provide them with a decent home. At present they are living in one of the rooms in the main building. The cottage, which I hope they will eventually occupy is not fit to live in until it has been reconditioned. This he will do with his class of boys when we can buy the material.\n\nI am writing the local Indian Agent regarding some of the most urgent requirements. I don't expect to receive everything we would like to have, but I would like to maintain, not only our standard of living, but also be able to keep our equipment and buildings in a good state of repair.\n\nIt would be a great privilege to meet a representative of the New England Company; and if I may look forward to that, I would very much like to prepare some interesting views of our work.\n\nI cannot help but wish that I might be nearer to you. Not that I could expect to be of any great value or assistance to you, excepting I would like you to feel my good wishes in your very difficult tasks.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMr R.

By stopping off between trains on the return journey, we spent eight hours at the school. It is truly a very efficient institution and we gained a very favorable impression of the business-like administration of the principal. The state of the farm was a revelation and made us very envious as we recall the difficult conditions under which most of our school farms are operated. In the evening I had the opportunity of addressing the congregation at the evening Service in the beautiful stone church. It was truly reverent and beautiful service and the singing of the children was delightful. Mr. House and I felt that the spirit of the school was in every way admirable and we were very glad to have had the opportunity of visiting it.\n\nH. A. Alderwood,\nSecretary.\nRev. C. F.

I would like to write the New England Company and express my feelings of gratitude.\n\nCan you tell me yet when the representative of the New England Company is expected to be with you. I would like, if possible to meet him. I have no doubt they still have to find an outlet for their money, and believe me, sir, there is in my humble opinion a very wonderful work that should be done, in the matter of giving some further education and training to the worthy of our graduates. It is extremely discouraging to them and to us to find such a large percentage of our graduates become lost to all decency of living.\n\nI would very much like to have the pleasure of seeing you this Summer.\n\nAgain thanking you, and with best wishes,\n\nI remain, Yours faithfully.\n\nChas. F. Stoves\nPrincipal\n\nMr R.A. Hoey,\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 13, 1946.\n\nDear Mr. Hives:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of June 7th, in which you seek information with respect to the time when the representative of the New England Company is likely to arrive in Ottawa.\n\nI regret to state that shipping conditions being what they are at the moment, I find it difficult to even suggest when this representative of the Company is likely to arrive here. We shall, I feel sure, however, experience little difficulty in communicating with you just as soon as the date of his arrival is announced.\n\nI note with interest your reference to the fact that additional funds might be secured for educational work from the New England Company. I am disposed to think, with the information at my disposal, that we are more likely to lose the assistance we are now receiving. The New England Company sustained tremendous losses during the course of the war and losses from which they are not likely to recover in the immediate future, if at all. In any event, I think it would be very unwise to build up hopes based on the thought of additional aid. My personal opinion is that the time has arrived when the Canadian Government should assume full responsibility for the education of the Indian population in this country. It seems to me somewhat inconsistent that Canada should be granting loans to Britain on the one hand and seeking assistance in the operation of our Indian schools from missionary societies in England, on the other. However, this is a matter on which there may be room for argument and discussion.\n\nReverend C. F.

This payment has now been received and deposited to the credit of the School.\n\nI hope you are enjoying good health and I still retain many pleasant memories of our interviews when I was in England in 1942.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nDr. Isaac Jones,\nTreasurer,\nNew England Company,\n26 Bloomsbury Square,\nLONDON, W.C.,\nEngland.\nMERRITT, B.C., sept. 16th 1946\n\nDear Archie and Adam,\n\nHow are you two kids by now? Do you like your school and do the teachers treat you like humans or dogs? We will find that out later.\n\nHow are you Adam are you learning to write or just work. How is Archie? I suppose you are in 5th grade by now so you have been there long enough for that.\n\nYour uncle Jim is home here from the war and is living in Merritt here. Tell Adam to write us now and both of you by return mail we will expect a letter from you both. Wishing you both good health and let us know if you need anything.\n\nFrom your grandmother and Dad Leith\nSt. George's Ind. Res. School\nLytton, B.C.\n\nSept. 21, 1946\n\nF. D. Leith,\nMerritt, B.C.\n\nSir:\n\nI am writing this letter in reference to a foolish letter recently received from you to Archie Blankinship; in which you ask if we treat him like a human or a dog. Why do you not come and see for yourself? You must have some reason for asking such a question. I'd like to meet you, and tell you a few things about St. George's School, and also a few things about the people who send their children here. I know quite a lot about them, for I have been in the work for over thirty years; and during that time I could not find a dozen Indians who have said a thank you for anything that has been done for their children, or given any support for their education or upkeep in any way. Yet they can write foolish letters like the one you have written, and say foolish and indecent things behind one's back.\n\nYou evidently have not received much in the way of an education, or you might know that a little boy like Adam, who has just entered the Kindergarten class could not possibly write a letter a few days after arriving in school. Archie will rise in his class just as he applies himself to his studies. He is given all the opportunity to do so that any child would or should have. He, along with all other boys here of his size, age and standing in the classroom go to school all day. After awhile, when he has reached fourth grade, he will take his turn in the Manual shop, where he will learn how to use tools.\n\nI am sending your letter to the Department, just to let them know the kind of people we have to deal with.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nPrincipal.\nRev. Canon C. F. Hives  \nPrincipal\n\nSept. 21, 1946  \nLytton, B. C.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nThought I would send along to you the enclosed letter which I received recently. Or rather, which came to one of our pupils, and was intercepted by me. It goes to show the kind of a feeling the Indians have regarding our efforts. The writer is probably a little more daring than the average.\n\nI have also enclosed a letter I have just written to him. I don't generally take much notice of such things, but it seemed to me that one who has a business, like the letter head would signify, should not be allowed to use his name letter heads for such a purpose, and entirely get away with it. Such letters, when they get into the hands of pupils only incite them to be dissatisfied and disrespectful.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nColonel Bernard F.

The Shulus Day School also opened with a very low attendance for the same reasons.\n\nG.E. Sharpe,\nIndian Agent.\nLytton, B.C. October 15, 1946.\n\nREPORT OF THE LYTTON INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE QUARTER ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 1946.\n\nTRAINING\n\nSt. George's Indian Residential School: Attendance up to the end of the present quarter was not good although toward the end of the month there was a noticeable increase in the rate at which children were returning. Most late admissions were the result of parents being absent in the United States with their children.\n\nA very successful summer is reported with respect to the school farm and the farm manager is to be commended upon his diligence and able management.\n\nA recent survey of the domestic hot water and domestic water supply reveals that considerable expenditure will have to be made in order to provide the above in ample quantities. This matter is in the hands of the Dominion Water and Power Bureau.\n\nThe Reverend Principal of the school again applied for and received a permit enabling members of the school staff to catch and preserve sockeye salmon for the use of the pupils. A successful catch was made and it is anticipated that the use of these fish will be of great assistance in the diet of the children.\n\nRoutine visits to the school by the writer reveal that the building is maintained in excellent condition.\n\nA.

M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nRev. Canon C. F. Hives  \nPrincipal\n\nOct. 14, 1947  \nLytton, B. C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI have your letter No. 7-II-I of the 9th inst. to acknowledge and reply. I wish to assure you that our dwindling surplus causes me not a little concern, but cannot do much about it, for I suppose every housekeeper will tell you the same reason that I have to give.\n\nFirst of all there is the advanced cost of every commodity of food and clothing that we have to buy. Some advances in price are very much more than the increase in the per capita grant. Likewise the increased cost in fuel. These are the essentials of life, and we cannot cut down on them.\n\nNext is the increase in salaries of the staff workers. I have had to increase all salaries in order to secure enough competent workers. My own salary remains the same as it was when I came, but all others have had to be increased.\n\nThen the demands for a full time education for the pupils is also a tax on our financial resources. Very few boys remain out of the classroom and Manual shop. Which means I have to hire extra labour to do the work on the farm. This means paying out each month two to four hundred dollars.\n\nI mentioned our situation to Mr Hoey, while I was in Ottawa, and his comment was that no doubt prices would go down to normal, and then our circumstances would improve.\n\nI have the feeling that we shall improve our financial position in the near future, for we have a crowded school.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMajor D.

Canon Hives' letter of October 14th in explanation of the steadily decreasing current surplus. The explanation offered by the Rev. Principal appears logical and it is doubtful if, except by the most stringent economy, the financial position of the school can be improved under today's prevailing prices and costs.\n\nD. M.

Box 70, Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nSt. George's Indian Residential School\n\nInspector Davey's reports upon the classrooms at this school have been noted. It would seem that this residential school is one for which we will have to consider the provision of a classroom block at some future date. He will be in a better position to decide this matter by the time our next year's estimates are being prepared.\n\nInspector Davey's comments concerning the manual training have been drawn to the attention of Mr. Doucet and it is likely that you will hear further from him in this regard. It is suggested that a requisition be forwarded for the type of mangle which is recommended for use in the laundry. The purchase of this will depend largely on the amount of money that is required to re-surface the floors in the boys' senior dormitory. Therefore we will be able to definitely decide about the provision of the mangle when an estimate is obtained as to the cost of re-surfacing the floors. However, we would like to know the approximate cost of the mangle, as recommended.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn sending in the Quarterly Returns, I would point out that we have a total attendance of 196 pupils. I have therefore totalled the earnings on that attendance, and would respectfully request that we receive that amount.\n\nI would also ask that our pupilage be brought up to two hundred. I have had to turn several children away since the new year, and many have asked that room be reserved for next Fall term. We cannot take in more than we receive a grant allowance for, and yet these children whose parents are anxious for them to attend school, should not be turned away if we have the accommodation for them.\n\nWill you kindly present this matter to the Department.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. A. Strang,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nA Defense of St. George's\n\nTHE WORK OF ONE INDIAN SCHOOL\n\nBy Rev. Canon C. F. Hives\n\nEditor, The Sun, Sir,\n\nThe following headlines appeared in your newspaper last Friday: \"Church Indian Schools held up by Indians,\" and \"Church schools better as a protest against the headlines, but with an earnest effort to show what the Church has done and is doing for Indian education. Facts which are not generally known may be of interest and should not be lost if these ulterior and sinister criticisms are allowed to go unchallenged.\n\nAfter reading over the account under the heading \"Church schools\" I started to find that the Indian young man who made the statement, comes of fairly good stock, and is far more to Church Indian school education than they can ever hope to repay. He is very grateful to the Church for receiving recognition or even appreciation from them for anything she has done. His attitude shows that hundreds have received an education and training which would otherwise never have come their way had it not been for the Church during the many years she has been engaged in this work. Never at any time has she called on them for any monetary payment; her own aim has been to give them what she could bestow upon them which shall eventually lead them to equality of citizenship with all other people of our country. More frequently than not, her efforts to educate have been met with prejudice from the pupils, and have required, on the part of the teachers much patience, faithfulness and perseverance, in view of the very limited financial resources with which to carry on the work.\n\nA Family's Education\n\nThe young man who made the statement owns a St. George's School for years of his early education, which has, no doubt, been one of the contributing factors to his now enviable status as a student at the UBC. His sister holds a B.C. teacher's certificate, and maintains the same commitment which she owes directly to the education care and attention she received from St. George's School. Four other brothers received more than an average education at St. George's School. Three or four other sisters also received their education at St. George's School. Last Saturday I sat down and conversed with two of these sisters, who had come some distance to see me. While talking with them I felt very proud of the fact that this school had given them the opportunity to acquire knowledge and poise of conduct, has made them more than equal to the average lady of the land. They are able to converse with such intelligence. The father of this family held a very good position in a section of town on the railway. His income was sufficient to house him and his children to the village public school where he lived. He chose to send them to St. George's School. We now have several younger generation children of the family.\n\nWhat It Costs\n\nWe have in residence at St. George's School 25 pupils, 16 boys and nine girls who are treated after as a family and are no cost to their parents. Until last October we received a per capita grant allowance from the Department of Canada which worked out to approximately $1.00 per child per day. Since then the grant has been increased and amounts to approximately $1.10 per child per day. In addition to this we must buy all food, clothing, pay all salaries, 20 in all, heat, light, fuel, and all other expenses connected with the institution. If this were a secular institution such finances resources would not be sufficient. Being a Church institution this grant is supplemented by financial aid from an old mission society in England.\n\nWere we to close our doors many of our pupils would be absolutely deprived of a chance to attend school. To substitute the education they are doing by this school 20 day schools, each with a teacher's residence, would have to be opened (at least a very conservative estimate). Last year we added five new pupils, all between the age of seven and eleven. Without these had never had a chance to attend school. Five of these are there, but who would still be deprived to attend school had we not taken them in. Abolish the Church residential schools and you will find, or the taxpayers of Canada will find, that many millions of dollars will have to be found to supersede the present system. Or, if the matter becomes a political question the Education Department would quite a problem on their hands.\n\nMy teaching staff consists of four fully-qualified B.C. certified teachers, one principal instructor trained by the Canadian Army, and a good shop with some pupils took a gymnastic course with weightless gymnastics. Five of my pupils are attending high school in Victoria and are there every morning by our own bus and brought back in like manner in the afternoon. We have five more to attend high school next year, or rather next term.\n\nI am very much obliged if you would send a reporter to visit our school. Please you will serve a good purpose by doing this and be the means of exploding some of the absurd criticisms which I feel have their origin in some rather small movement that would close Church residential schools and bring about their desired chaos in our social order. Your reporter does not need to earn his living here. He would find us doing the same one thing. Looking after a large and ordered family.\n\nNo Corporal Punishments\n\nWe are not perfect by any means. There are many, many things we would like to do more than we are doing. Many needed improvements we would like to make, but we make as time and means give us the opportunity. With the resources we have, and with the help of God whom we try to serve, we are not lacking in efforts to obtain wonderful results we obtain. During the past eight years we have had students who have graduated. During the past nearly three years we have had no cases of truancy. And during this time there has been no corporal punishments. These are facts which I think should speak louder than these headlines in your newspaper which may, perhaps, be of interest to the public.\n\nCHAS. F. HIVES,\nLytton, B.C.\nPrincipal\nApril 30, 1948.\n\nDear Canon Hives:\n\nWe have your letter of the 9th instant requesting that the pupilage at the St. George's Residential School be increased to two hundred.\n\nPlease let us have the dimensions of the dormitories at your school.

File 888-I (EI).\n\nMiss Howe was a member of my staff from November 1946 to end of May 1948. From the standpoint of loyalty to duty, I could not wish for anyone better, but she caused a great deal of mischief and unhappiness with the other members of the staff, which in the end left me no other choice than to dismiss her at a moment's notice. It was either that or lose a valuable teacher. The administrator of the hospital at Lytton spoke to me not so very long before, telling me that he would have to ask Miss Howe to stay away from the hospital, as she was causing friction amongst the staff there. If you care to write to anyone at Moose Factory school, who was there while she was on the staff there, I think you will have the same story.\n\nThe rule here is that the staff members receive two weeks salary extra when they leave for their holidays, and if they return they receive two weeks salary on their arrival.\n\nI dismissed Miss Howe on May 30th., and paid her in full to the end of May. I do not consider that Miss Howe is entitled to any extra salary after being dismissed, and I am sure that the members of my staff would uphold me in my action. I try to be fair in all my dealings with my staff; but there are times when disciplinary methods have to be used.\n\nIf it is the wish of the Department that I should send to Miss Howe the money she demands, I shall do so; but from a legal standpoint, I understand from the Unemployment office that when a person is dismissed from a position for any serious charge, such as that which caused Miss Howe's dismissal from the staff of our school, no bonus would be given.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nChas.

Hives,\nPrincipal,\nSt. George's Indian Res. School,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Hives:\n\nWe have your letter of the 23rd instant regarding Miss Howe.\n\nI have no doubt that you are fully within your rights in the manner in which you handled this matter but may I suggest that for an amount of $28.75 it seems hardly worth while to have a member of the staff who was employed for two years, disgruntled.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI know I should not be writing direct to you about my worries, but from my experience with you in the past, I feel sure you will realize that I would not bother you over our affairs if matters were running on an even keel. From the standpoint of order and progress, happiness and good health amongst the pupils, and good relationship with the parents, I don't think I could wish for anything better than what we are now enjoying. But it is this gnawing fear of debt, takes away or nullifies the best of one's ability to serve.\n\nSo far, I have been able to keep out of debt, but only by scrimping and making others do likewise. But there seems to be no limit to the high that commodities are soaring, and unless financial help increases, we simply cannot honorably carry on.\n\nI wonder if Indian Residential schools are all rocking in the same boat. If so, I feel sure that the matter is before you as an urgency that must receive attention.\n\nIn the matter of helping ourselves, we have done very well. In fact, had not the land given of her natural help, in the way of fat sheep, pigs and the fruits, we would now be in very poor financial circumstances.\n\nIf this matter is under consideration with you, and those whose responsibility it is to decide on these things, I would also like to add my bit of weight by letting you know that we are going through very difficult financial embarrassments.\n\nWith every good wish to you.\n\nI am yours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\nMajor D.

Clark\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6463, file 382-1, part 6)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nColonel Neary:\n\nLytton Residential School:\nA few comparisons with the Mohawk Institute which is administered similarly may be interesting.\n\nPHYSICAL EDUCATION is, at Lytton, on an organized basis. Exercises and games are a part of the class time-table. In bad weather there is available a gymnasium (unheated) equipped with a good variety of apparatus. More use might be made of the auditorium. Equipment for outdoor games is plentiful and its use is supervised and encouraged.\n\nLIBRARY There is no separate room at either school. Here at Lytton most books are concentrated in the senior grades' room where the high school students do their homework. But Mohawk now has none. For evening study the lighting could stand improvement. Books and equipment for the study of science are a need.\n\nSEWING INSTRUCTION: The space and equipment at Lytton are both on a more nearly adequate scale, although each school presents a more \"cluttered\" appearance than is desirable. An examination of objectives seems necessary as on a brief survey it would seem that the \"chore\" of keeping clothes in repair excludes the study of textiles, values, line and color, care and cleaning, new garment-making, knitting, etc. I notice a number of looms were not in use.\n\nThe provision of mending machines would release a lot of pupil-hours that could be given to progressive work. The farms are mechanized, but household activities lag too near the pace of the usual hom...\nNeither school washes dishes in the modern institutional way. As in a few schools elsewhere arrangements should be made to have a few students in turn do household tasks on a household scale. The range of education will continue to be very narrow and unattractive as long as the big schools of today are geared to the habits of the small schools that set the pattern. A new pattern is necessary in many cases. Elements of it already exist at some schools.\n\nThe heating plant has fuel- and labour-saving devices and a reserve of power which is said to be adequate for a classroom block which is desired so that more pupils may do a full day's work in school. This would entail the use of some of the present classrooms as dormitories. The three excellent classrooms at the Mohawk Institute might well be increased to four while army buildings are available.\n\nCongestion in dormitories is seen at both schools and is too reminiscent of the crowded home conditions that Indians must be taught to improve. At Lytton the personal property of a pupil is more easily available to him, and he gets a better concept of house and town. Behaviour in and maintenance of the washrooms is a subject of instruction to which both schools could profitably give added emphasis.\n\nThis large, well-built and easily-serviced piggery was erected with monetary aid of only $800 from the Department. In animal husbandry teaching our schools might use the pig and calf club organizations more freely. Kamloops Residential school does so successfully.\nThis greenhouse is a vital element in the institution's economy and practical work. I am unable to say how it is integrated with classroom studies. Here are started the school's tomato plants, the end-product of which is a large output of home-canned juice for school use and for sale.

In fact, we owe them money until our per capita allowance comes in. I suppose, in that respect, we are in company with all other Indian Residential schools.\n\nI am very thankful to say, from what I can gather, we are not quite so badly off, and do feed our pupils, and pay our staff, but only because we, as a staff work very hard to make ends meet. Nevertheless we owe money; and until we are clear of our legitimate debts, I don't see how I can honestly pay Miss Howe money to which she has no legitimate right. Miss Howe was dismissed from my staff for disloyalty to myself as principal, and to her co-workers. She was paid in full up to the day she left the school.\n\nJust as soon as I am able, I will send Miss Howe a cheque. Not because I think it is due her, or because I have the slightest feeling of any moral obligation toward her; but because it is the wish of the Department that I should do so.\n\nI sincerely hope this distasteful matter is cleared up to your satisfaction.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nColonel B.F.

Strang,\nSuperintendent,\nLytton Indian Agency.\nST. GEORGE'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nREV. CANON C. F. HIVES Jan. 18, 1949 Lytton, B.C.\nPrincipal\n\nDear Mr. Reid:\n\nI am taking the liberty of writing you in reference to our work. Sometime ago you visited us, and I really enjoyed that short visit, for you appeared to be extremely interested in our work, and you gave me much encouragement in what you had to say about things you saw. Our work has grown, and we now have over two hundred pupils in residence, with many more waiting their turn to come in as we have room for them. Those whom we have we are trying in every way to care for; and during these days of advanced cost of living, I find it extremely difficult.\n\nWe are receiving a per capita grant of $257.00 per annum. If you take off 75 days for Summer and Christmas vacation, you have 260 days that pupils are in residence. We are, therefore, receiving nearly 89 cents per day per pupil. Out of this amount pupils have to be fed and clothed; light and fuel provided; and salaries, accommodation and food for twenty of a staff. You know whether or not this amount is adequate to meet all these obligations. When one considers the cost of keeping a patient in hospital, the amount we are expected to carry on with is out of all proportion.\n\nThis is a Dominion Government institution. It is not a Church institution in the same way as many residential schools are. That is, we receive no support in money or in kind from the Church. We do receive a small amount from the New England Company, the founders of St. George's School, but it amounted to two thousand dollars last year.\n\nGreat things are expected of these schools, and great criticisms are made of them; both by the general public and by the Indian parents; both of whom are quite ignorant of the amount of support we receive. Increasing demands are made continually by the Department and the parents, and often forgetting to supply the extra support that should accompany each demand. I mean, for instance, we try to give full time education in the classroom or in the Manual Training shop. This means employing extra labour in order to carry on the work. Every once in awhile we\nreceive literature relating to food and diet for the pupils. It is all good literature, and I suppose it has cost a small fortune to compile it, but never a word is said about extra financial help to meet the cost of providing these foods.\n\nBelieve me, sir, I am probably more anxious than most people to see the standard of living raised for these native people. I have given a full lifetime to this work, and have received little else in return than worry and hard work. Not that that matters so long as we are receiving a square deal from the Dominion Government; or that we are not getting an unfair deal.\n\nI am writing this to you, partly because, from what I read of your interest in the Joint Committee sessions on the Indian Act; and partly because I think you would want to have some information on conditions that have to do with the native work, and which may at anytime be brought up in the House. I also feel sure that if the opportunity came your way, you would do your part in easing the burden and strain caused by our having insufficient financial help to do and accomplish this unavoidable task.\n\nWith kindest regards and every good wish.\n\nI am, Yours faithfully\n\n(sgd) Chas.

I understand that there is some possibility of another cost of living increase being made in per capita grants to all residential schools.\n\nIn addition to per capita grants we have also forwarded to Canon Hives the following sums from the New England Company of London, England which has always provided sums for payment to the management of this school for current expenses:\n\n| Year    | Amount   |\n|---------|----------|\n| 1944-45 | $3600.00 |\n| 1945-46 | $4950.00 |\n| 1946-47 | $6078.51 |\n| 1947-48 | $4300.00 |\n| 1948-49 | $2000.00 |\n\n$20,928.51\n\nWe also provide a manual training grant of $50.00 per month for this school.

At that time the cost of operation per pupil per year was $251.82.\n\nAs you are probably aware, we also have to give some consideration to rates at nearby residential schools. The two near St. George's are now receiving the following amounts:\n\n1. Kamloops Residential School $255.00\n2. St. Mary's Mission Residential School $256.00\n\nAs you are of course aware, neither of the above schools receives grants from the New England Company.

In view of this, may we receive a copy of the correspondence in this connection for our information and records.\n\nIt obviously is not sound for Canon Hives to deal with such matters direct, without the knowledge of Mr. Davey or this Office and I propose to discuss the matter with Canon Hives at the first convenient opportunity.\n\nW.S.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nSt. George's School,\nLytton, B.C.\n3rd Sunday in Advent.\n\nDear Parents:\n\nThis is my Christmas letter to you, and is written partly for the purpose of making sure that you know our plans for the Christmas holidays; and also to send to you my Christmas message and greetings.\n\nIn a former letter, I told you that Christmas holidays will commence on Friday, Dec. 16th, when you must come for your children, or have some reliable person to see that they get home safely, and return them to school on Jan. 2nd. You must also send or bring warm holiday clothing for them. This clothing should be sent before-hand, so that your children may be ready when you come for them. These are rules which must be kept, if the children are to be allowed home for the Christmas holidays.\n\nI do not know you as well as I would like; for my work here with my large family of 200 does not allow me to go out amongst you very much. But I do know you through your children, for they reveal to us the kind of a home and parents they come from. The wonderful thing about a home is that the child receives its early training and first lessons of life there. Taught to them by Mother and Father. For that reason, the home or family life is the most important part of the child's life. So important is the home or family life in the sight of God, that He allowed us our first glimpse of Jesus, the Divine Son of God, in simple family life. We love the Christmas story, because we understand it so plainly. Even the poorest of us can go to the Stable of Bethlehem, and see and understand the human love that surrounds the new born Baby.\n\nSo Christmas comes to us, chiefly for the purpose of telling us how very important and sacred is the home, because God made it holy by using it to reveal Himself to all mankind. We do exactly the same thing when we make our family life in the home, a sacred and happy unity.\n\nMy message to you, dear parents, is that you will allow nothing into your home and family life that would ruin it of its beauty and holiness. And my wish is that you may all be very happy together this Christmas-time.\n\nGod bless you and keep you.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nPrincipal.\nCHRISTMASIDE PROGRAM.\n\nDec. 14, Christmas Concert. 7:30 p.m.\nDec. 16, Holidays commence.\nChristmas Eve, Candle-light Carol Service 7:00 p.m.\nMidnight Holy Communion.\nChristmas Day, Service 2:30 p.m.\nMonday, Dec. 26th, Christmas tree and Santa Claus\nfor children staying in. 3:00 p.m.\nParty in the evening.\nMovie, \"Western Union\" Friday Dec. 16th.\nJanuary 2, 1950 Classrooms open.

As a result of your splendid efforts, almost no time has been lost by our students. The morale and interest of the students have thus been easily maintained.\n\nIn closing, may I congratulate you for your success in operating an excellent type of Indian school.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.) F. A. McLellan\nInspector of Schools.\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nThe enclosed letter was received today, and I thought perhaps you might be interested in reading it. It is so seldom that we receive anything but adverse criticism from such a source, that it feels rather refreshing to have a change of opinion.\n\nKindest regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nColonel B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nOttawa.\nMajor R.H. McKay  \nDirector of Indian Affairs  \nOttawa.\n\nMy Dear Major McKay:\n\nIt has occurred to me that you might like to have an unofficial report of a visit I paid recently to St. George's I.R. School, Lytton.\n\nEver since I became Bishop of this Diocese nearly seven years ago I have been closely in touch with the school going in to visit them two or three times each year. My first visit this year was just after Easter, when I went along on Saturday afternoon and stayed over until Monday afternoon. During this time I had ample opportunities of looking over the farm and the school and of mixing with the staff and the children. I very much enjoyed this visit and was much impressed by what I saw going on both within and outside the school.\n\nThe farm appeared to be in a flourishing condition. The cows (34 with numerous calves) pigs (5 for 6 good sows with litters of various numbers and sizes) sheep (54 with lots of lambs) turkeys (160 youngsters) hens (400) and the bees all appeared to be doing well. The fields are either planted or in the process of being prepared for the various cereals and vegetables needed. There were wheat, oats, barley, potatoes, carrots, beets, rhubarb etc. Of fruits there are apples, pears, cherries, peaches and apricots; the Principal was somewhat concerned with these and was replacing some which had been killed by the record cold of the past winter. Some new land was being cleared of trees and bush and prepared for future use. To make for more convenient access to the school a stretch of new road was being made, largely by the labour of the school, helped out by a bulldozer which was necessary for the heaviest of the work.\n\nThe School buildings appeared to me to be in very good order. All were very clean and tidy and well kept. When going through the sewing work room I was much impressed by a great pile of 100 new blankets which had been made from the wool shorn from the school's sheep and other material supplied. Another item of\ninterest was the fact that Canon Hives had been able, by judicious re-arrangement of rooms and storage space, to provide for the accommodation for the High School pupils of the neighbouring town of Lytton to continue their studies. Their own school had burned down a few weeks ago. This was much appreciated by the town's school authorities and also allowed the education of those high school pupils of St George's who had been going into Lytton daily to continue their education without interruption.\n\nThat impressed me most of all was the condition of the children. They knew me well enough by now to be quite natural when I am around and I was able to observe them freely in the school, in the chapel and round about the place. Not only are they well clothed and well fed, but they appeared to be to be contented and happy, quite like a large family living happily together. The staff and children were getting along very well.\n\nAltogether, my visit was a very happy one for me. I was much impressed by the quality of the life lived at the school and of the education imparted therein. I was particularly pleased with the behaviour of the children in the Chapel services. By the way they took their parts in the worship they were obviously enjoying the religious exercises in which they were engaged.\n\nMuch of the success of the school must be attributed to the excellent leadership and devotion of the Principal, Rev. Canon C.J. Hives and his inestimable wife. He is indeed the \"key\" man of the school and gives himself without limit to the task of leading the life of the school and of being a great father to the staff and the children. He has my greatest admiration and respect.\n\nI am somewhat concerned about Canon Hives. It seemed to me that he is in danger of breaking down under the strain of the burden he is carrying and I suggested to him that he should try to get a real and extended holiday this year to re-new his strength.\n\nHoping that you may be interested in the above.\n\nWith all good wishes,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Fredric Cariboo.]\nOttawa, May 15, 1950.\n\nRt. Rev. Frederic Stanford, A.K.C., D.D.,\nThe Diocese of Cariboo,\n187 West St. Paul Street,\nKAMLOOPS, British Columbia.\n\nDear Bishop Stanford:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 4th of May, and note with much interest the information you give regarding St. George's Indian Residential School, at Lytton.\n\nIt is, indeed, encouraging to receive such a report on St. George's, and Canon Hives is to be congratulated on the evidence of the highly efficient management you found during your visit. I may say that in my own experience in visiting our residential schools, I discovered that if I found the children and staff happy there was not much wrong with the general supervision and management of the school.\n\nCanon and Mrs. Hives have rendered excellent service at St. George's and I am sure that it must be comforting and encouraging to them to note the evidence of the fruits of their labours in the high esteem and affection in which they are held by the Indian children and their parents, a reward which, indeed, is a priceless one.\n\nI am sure that both Canon and Mrs. Hives are looking forward to the approaching holidays. It is my hope that the rest and change will be beneficial to them and that they will return to their tasks much refreshed and stronger in mind and body.\n\nI trust that you are keeping well, and with kindest personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6463, file 888-1, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMay 19, 1950.\n\nRev. Canon C.F. Hives,\nPrincipal,\nSt. George's Indian Residential School,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nSt. George's Indian Residential School\n\nDear Canon Hives:\n\nI was indeed pleased to note the letter which you had received from Mr. McLellan regarding the cooperation given by you after the recent High School fire. I know Mr. McLellan personally and therefore place a great deal of confidence in his estimation of the work being done at your school.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nBFN/MMoN\nREPORT FROM ST. GEORGE'S SCHOOL, Lytton, B.C.\n\nto Synod, Kamloops, May 31st 1950.\n\nMy Lord and Gentlemen:\n\nThis report will be confined to the activities of St. George's School during the year 1949, when there was an average attendance of 200-25 pupils. The largest attendance in the history of the school. There were no deaths and very little sickness of any kind. No cases of truancy and no corporal punishments. The last two items may not appear of importance, but really they register the moral tone of this school, and to those who are at all intimate with institutional life and routine, realize the importance of a healthy and proper moral standing. Unless such an institution is run at a normal moral level, complications of a very serious nature, both with the pupils as well as the staff, are the inevitable result, and in consequence, progress is slow. I am happy to be able to honestly report good steady progress has been made in all departments of the school; that a fair standard of efficiency has been maintained; and from reports here and there, St. George's School is held in high esteem by the native people and local white people, as well as by the Indian Affairs of the Dominion Government.\n\nHaving more or less blown a trumpet, which would seem like self praise, I would ask your indulgence as I point out to you some of the happenings that have, to some extent, made up the life of the school during the year ending December 31st 1949; the most important of which was the sacred rite of Confirmation, when forty Indian girls and boys were presented to the Lord Bishop of the Diocese. We try, in every possible way to make this event an important one in the life of these children. The service itself is an impressive one; but doubly so when proper preparations have been made in preparing the candidates carefully, and the entire school eagerly taking an active part in the services. The Bishop, as usual, gave a very helpful and inspiring talk to the candidates. While these young communicants are at school, they are very regular in making their communion. I would, however, hope you know that they attend of their own free will. Some set themselves a rule to attend, perhaps every two weeks, or perhaps once a month. They are encouraged in this matter, and are urged to, if at all possible, to hold fast to this rule.\n\nLast fall we had a very delightful visit from the Primate of All Canada, and Mrs. Kingston. I feel sure they enjoyed their visit, and they appeared to be very interested in the life of the institution, and definitely appreciative of the work that is being done for our Indian children.\n\nAt this time, last year, I received word, through the Bishop of the Diocese, from New England Company, asking us to join them in celebrating their three hundredth Anniversary, by giving a break in the routine, and other expenses. I asked that we might invite all the ex-pupils of St. George's School to a lunch, so that we might have a re-union, and an opportunity of reminding them of their old school days, and the obligations they owe to life from the help they received from St. George's. New England Company asked their approval of this plan, and we prepared a luncheon for 350 guests. Four hundred and fifty arrived, and it seemed as though we had a repetition of the feeding of the five thousand; for all sat down and all were well fed.\n\nI cannot pass over this matter without paying a very sincere tribute to New England Company for the financial help they have given to the work at St. George's School, and which they are still giving year by year, as my financial statement will show. Many people have never heard of this venerable mission society, which has its headquarters or court in London, England. It is the oldest missionary society in England, and was founded by Oliver Cromwell, and afterward given its charter by King Charles II. For about one hundred years, the work of this society was carried on by missionaries near Boston, Mass. Afterward, when their arose political differences between England and America, they moved from Boston into Canada, where their work was...\ncarried on amongst the Six Nations Indians in Ontario. Two schools were founded by New England Company; one at Brantford, called the Mohawk Institute, and the other amongst the Thompson Indians at Lytton, called St. George's.\n\nIt is, therefore, with a deep sense of gratitude to this most venerable of all English missionary societies, and to Almighty God, for the wonderful contribution which they have made on behalf of the native children of Canada. Believers, however, will I say that I do not know how we could have carried on without their splendid help during the very difficult and trying years of advanced prices in everything bought with the dollar. Often I have been tempted to appeal for assistance from our own Missionary Society and the W.A., but so far, we have not in any way received a cent or a garment from \"M.S.C.\" or the W.A. Our per capita grant allowance, which we receive from Indian Affairs, amounts to about ninety cents per day. With that we feed and clothe the child, pay all salaries and meet all other maintenance expenses.\n\nDuring the year, twelve of our pupils have attended the High School in Lytton. These are taken every morning by our own vehicle, and brought back after school in the afternoon in like manner. We receive an extra grant of eighty dollars per capita for High School pupils. Last Autumn we sent three girls to the Alberta Provincial School of Nursing (Iides) in Calgary to take a training. I am not only very pleased with the reports I have received from the Superintendent of their progress, but I am hopeful of many more following them year by year.\n\nDuring the Fall of last year we received a very delightful visit from Dr. Perkins, Resident Canon of Westminster Abbey. The lantern slides which he showed, and the address which he gave were very interesting and helpful to all of us at St. George's and to the many visitors who came to hear him.\n\nAbout two months ago, the Lytton High School was completely destroyed by fire. The School Inspector and the Principal came to us seeking help and classroom accommodation for forty-two pupils. This we gave to them, so that practically no school time was lost, or disorganization caused. This following is a letter received from the Public School Inspector, and speaks for itself.\n\nOffice of Inspector of Schools,\n515 Columbia Street,\nKamloops, B.C.\n\nMay 8, 1950.\n\nCanon Hives, Principal,\nSt. George's School,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nDear Canon Hives:\n\nI wish to convey to you and your Department my sincere thanks and appreciation for the splendid co-operation and assistance we have received from you in providing the accommodation for our students when we lost our High School recently by fire. As a result of your splendid effort, almost no time has been lost by our students. The morale and interest of the students have thus been easily maintained.\n\nIn closing, may I congratulate you for your success in operating an excellent type of Indian School.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd) F. A. McLellan\nInspector of Schools.\n\nThere are, no doubt, many other items of interest which might be added to this report, which is becoming a little drawn out, but I would like to say a word about the future of St. George's.\nNext month, the Engineering branch of Indian Affairs are planning to revise our domestic water system, by renewing all the main pipe line and extending it about half a mile further up the mountain to the source of supply. There, at the source, will be made a fifty thousand gallon reservoir. This will serve to give us a more adequate supply of water, and also protect the water from contamination. Also, this year our electric light system will be modernized and be more convenient and safe. These two projects will cost a great deal of money. Next year we have a building program which, if carried out, will give us a six classroom block, thereby taking all the classrooms out of the main building, which space will then be used for dormitories, and so increase our pupilage by, at least, fifty.\n\nSo, my lord, and brethren, I would have you know that St. George's School, which, if not a Diocesan school, is a Church school in your midst, and is a going and a growing concern, of which, I feel sure, should you visit it, you would be justly proud, and find it to be worthy of your prayerful and sympathetic support.\n\nThe following is a general idea of our finances for 1949.\n\n| Receipts                      | Expenditure |\n|------------------------------|-------------|\n| Per capita grant allowance   | 451,926.40  |\n| New England Company          | 2,780.00    |\n| Farm and Garden              | 3,628.32    |\n| High School pupil assistance | 748.50      |\n| Manual Training grant        | 500.00      |\n| **Total**                    | **659,140.55** |\n\n**Expenditure**\n\n| Item                          | Amount     |\n|------------------------------|------------|\n| **Total**                    | **659,593.72** |\n\nPrincipal.\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nPlease find hereunder\nthe Annual Report from the St. George's\nResidential School at Lytton, British Columbia.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nRev. Canon C. F. Hives  \nPrincipal  \nJuly 20, 1950  \nLytton, B.C.\n\nDear Mr Arneil:\n\nI am writing you to ask your permission to take two months holiday commencing Sept. 22nd. This is the first time that I have done such a thing during the thirty four years that I have been Principal of an Indian Residential School. My doctor advises me to do this for the sake of my health, and I really think it would not do the staff any harm for me to be away from them for awhile.\n\nBy the time I would start my holiday the pupils would all be in and settled down. I feel confident that I shall have a good strong staff. My wife would not accompany me on my trip to England. My wife is Canadian, and therefore has no ties of relationship in England. New England Company has very kindly offered to contribute toward my expenses by paying for my ticket returning from England. I appreciate this very much indeed, as I really should not spend so much on a holiday. And yet, I feel assured that the rest and change will be of great benefit to me in many ways.\n\nWhile I am absent, I would like to leave Mr. Ronald Purvis in charge. I feel he is quite capable of looking after things for two months, for he has been with me for sometime, and knows the work pretty well.\n\nOn my way to England, I would like to call at Ottawa, and if there is anything that requires attention in relation to the school, I could give it while there.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,  \nCommissioner of Indians for B.C.  \nVancouver, B.C.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI attach hereto a self-explanatory letter dated July 20th from the Reverend Canon Hives, Principal of St. George's Indian Residential School at Lytton, B.C., from which you will note his application for two months' leave of absence from September 22nd for the purpose of a visit to England. In discussing this matter recently with Canon Hives he stressed that his doctor had strongly advised him to take this period of rest and change for the benefit of his health.\n\nIt is noted that if his request is granted Mr. Ronald Purvis will be left in charge of the school. Mr. Purvis is a young man and is the son-in-law of Canon Hives and has a few years' experience in residential school work. He is reliable.\n\nIn Canon Hives' absence I would propose to have our local Indian Superintendent visit the school often as well as a visit from Mr. Davey and also Mr. McGregor.\n\nI would recommend that this application receive favourable consideration.\n\nW.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, piling it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Joseph's School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1950.\n\nPrincipal Charles E. Edwards\n\nDated Jan. 6, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Lytton this 17 day of Jan. 1950\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1948.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated June 6, 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 17 day of June, 1949.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in which each pupil pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Joseph's School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1950.\n\nPrincipal Chas. T.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Peter's School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1959.\n\nPrincipal: Charles F.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pasting it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. George's School for the Quarter ended Jan. 6, 1950.\n\nPrincipal: Charles F. H.\n\nDated: Jan. 6, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at Lytton this 17th day of January, 1950.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFound No. I.A. 403\nReq.

ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Joseph School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Sept. 30, 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nthis 13 day of Oct., 1949\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nPov No. I.A. 403\nRep.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ST. GEORGE'S IND. RES. SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended January 31, 1950.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: [Signature]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nthis 11th day of April, 1950.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.
