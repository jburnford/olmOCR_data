Her Majesty sent her congratulations to the happy couple. We cannot afford to wire our congratulations and will have to content ourselves with drinking the health of the happy couple in lime juice and water. A little soon, it is said, is not symbolic of their future, we hope.\n\nThe Edmonton Bulletin says that since Mr. Dewdney became Lieut. Governor of the Northwest, the mounted police \"have deteriorated in the eyes of the world to a non-descript institution, neither horse nor good red herring.\" But what has his Honor to do with the police? As well charge him with being responsible for the silly utterances of the Bulletin man.\n\nBy reference to our telegrams it will be seen that the Nova Scotia elections have resulted in the government being sustained by a large majority on a straight-out protectionist platform. In view of the fact, that better terms is not what Nova Scotia wants, but separation pure and simple, there will be some difficulty in arriving at a settlement which will be at once satisfactory to Nova Scotia and the Dominion. It will now be in order for the enemies of confederation to cheer on the Blue Nose secessionists.\n\nThe Lethbridge News, in an article dealing with the representation in the Commons, says: \"Northwest first\" must be the short anchor of any candidate who hopes to weather the storms of an election contest successfully. In a country so vast as ours, it must be remembered that our representatives in the House of Commons will have other interests than those of the Northwest to look after, and that the question of national unity at stake it will be their duty to uphold them even at the sacrifice of territorial interests. For instance, there are certain well defined principles upon which the two great Canadian parties stand apart. One believes in free trade, the other in protection. Must our representatives hold no opinion on these questions? Must they be neither free traders nor protectionists, must they not yield allegiance to principles\u2014must they be idiots? Or holding opinions upon these questions, must they be forced to pocket them, and hold themselves like a man standing in the polling place, silent for the highest bidder? For our part we want to see men of principles sent to the Commons, who will hold above price their personal honor, and stand still, and fight for the national interests. \"Northwest first\" may do very well to catch salmon, but the \"Dominion first\" should be the cry of every true Canadian, be he Liberal or Conservative.\n\nST LOUIS DE LANGEVIN.\n\nAs a single handed twister and distorter of the truth, the Globe is not to be excused. The Edmonton Bulletin man says: \"Secondly, we are well aware, of course, that the Globe's commissioners are not supposed to have any control over the police, but are supposed to let constables work out their own deserts as such. He is charged with the express purpose of lying, even to the extent of denying the truth of the sworn testimony of those who appeared before the Globe and have the public behind them. It is, as for the Bulletin man, we always credited him with having, at least a well grounded conviction that the truth is neither that false hood\u2014when the truth answers his purpose.\n\nThe Globe's commissioner, in obedience to his superiors, visited this part of the country a short time ago, and the excellent man got evidence to disprove the statements of Mr. Pearce with regard to the treatment by the Government and the Prince Albert Colonization Society, the settlers of the parish of St Louis de Langevin. His first report appears in the Globe of the 28th of April last, and a weaker attempt to make out a case against Government and the P.A.C. Society it would be hard to imagine. Even those very halfwits whose cause the commissioner assumes to champion give a flat denial to every statement made by him. They avow that they knew nothing about Mr. Pearce, that they did not know of the existence of the Society until after the rebellion. But whether they did or did not know of the existence of the Society, their fact, namely, untruthfulness and moral inveterate, that not one of those who had settled in the parish previous to the transfer or after, was ever disturbed by the Government or the Society. They may not have been able to enter their claims, but the justice of their claims was never questioned. They had possession, and had only to comply with the settlement during the second quarter when the lands were open for entry. It is true that men after the stamp of the Globe's commissioners and the Bulletin man, who do not stop short of saying anything which will pocket the enemy for every interest at stake, start with what results the public well know, to make the non-confiding halfbreeds believe that their rights were being ignored. We have everything but sympathy for the poor halfbreeds. Well, we are not without sympathy for them, but we trust our sympathy arises from pure motives. We would have them believe that there are true friends and guides whom older they disregarded before; would have them turn a deaf ear to the serpent though the Globe should be his mouth-piece, and the Edmonton Bulletin man his.\n\nBut in the endeavor to prove Mr. Pearce's report as unreliable the Globe's commissioners asks, with Le Meurde of the 16th of January last: Whether the names of the P.A.C. men were deprived of their lands to the Government in favor of the Prince Albert Colonization Society? and answers the question by giving the names of the purchasers of the lands of St Louis de Langevin, who, he alleges, the Government thus treated. But there were forty-five claimants in this parish. What became of the lands of the other twenty-five? Did the Government sell them out? To show, however, how worthless this statement is, we have only to mention the fact that one of the parties named, Michel Caron (Miss Keene), the Globe says, obtained his patent in 1881, four entered for their lands in 1882, two in 1883, and the rest, with few exceptions, have preferred evidence in support of their claims. These men have become convinced that the settlers were deprived of their lands in favor of the P.A.C. Society. True the unoccupied land in the parish was sold to the Society, but the unoccupied land claimed, held, belonged to the Government, and the occupied land, the claims of the settlers, belonged to the latter, at least they were in possession, and could not be dispossessed provided they adhered to the law in regard to settlement during the time the Globe's commissioner and the Bulletin man well know. But it is well also, that the people should understand that the Government are the guardians of the public domain, and would not permit the sale of land. But when a leading public journal makes false statements, and other journals reiterate them, we think nothing but our duty to give what we consider to be a true statement of the case. We say more when the Globe was more scrupulous than it is now. It perhaps had a stronger hold on the public mind then, but we must say to have lost it, and with declining prestige, naturally enough, there may be a corresponding decline in journalistic morality.\n\nJames Wagnon arrived in Edmonton yesterday morning, crossing last night, and returned to-day.\n\nTin Roofing and Eavetroughing\n\nAT LOW RATES.\n\n2,000 lbs.

A. A. H. Wright, assisted by Mr. J. Macleod, to the Bishop at the close of the Divine Service.\n\nAfter the introduction of the confirmation service had been ended by the Bishop, the Rev. Mr. Wright addressed the candidates who, (as well as most of the congregation) were deeply moved when His Lordship referred to the situation in which he was being placed in mourning, which was so on account of the sudden death of his wife. The Bishop said that he was the afternoon to be buried in the spotless white dress it had been intended she should have been wearing.\n\nHe then asked the candidates \"Do you here, in the presence of God, and this congregation, renounce all sin, and make a fresh beginning in your name at your baptism; renouncing and confessing the same in your own persons, and promising diligence henceforth to believe, to believe, and do all those things which your godfathers and godmothers have undertaken and promised?\"\n\nIf they answered, \"I do,\" then the Bishop laid his hands upon each of them, saying, \"Be thou sealed.\"\n\nAfter laying on of hands, during which time the hymn stanzas filled the church, the Bishop closed the service with the usual prayers and blessing.\n\nBy request, Mr. E. J. Cann of this town, president of the Saskatchewan Mission chapel choir assisted that of St. Mary's church choir, and the choirs were joined by the organist.\n\nCRICKET MATCH\n\nA return match between the Argyle and Mission clubs took place on the grounds of the former, at the east end, on Saturday afternoon, ending in a draw. Though the weather was changeable and wet in the forenoon, and fears were entertained that the game would be impossible to finish, the afternoon weather changed and the match was proceeded with. At the occasion of the former match the Mission club had enlisted three new recruits, and we noticed that the Argyles contained amongst their number several who had not appeared in the last match. The Argyles were the first to get the bat, and retired after making a score of 45. The Mission team then came out, and made a good start, like number of runs. After lunch, which was provided by the Argyles, the latter got the better of the game the second time and retired with a score of 80. The Mission club then took their second innings, and made a score of 29, but the game had to be discontinued after a score of 34 being made with no one out, drawn, Mission 80, Argyle 29 of the 34.\n\nThe following is the score:\n\n| Team       | Runs | Wickets |\n|------------|------|---------|\n| Mission    | 80   |         |\n| Argyle     | 29   |         |\n\nADVERTISERS\n\nCan learn the exact cost of any proposed line of Advertising in American Papers by addressing Geo.

Mr. Macdonald took the chair, and the shareholders were present in large numbers. The report of the directors follows:\n\nThe bank has been doing business for several months, and we have the pleasure of announcing that our assets now stand at $143,269, less than the $150,000 which had been anticipated at the beginning of the year. This decrease is due to the fact that the bank has not been able to attract sufficient deposits to meet its liabilities. We are confident, however, that with the aid of our depositors and the good management of the bank, we shall be able to increase our assets in the near future.\n\nThe bank has also been engaged in purchasing land for future expansion, and we are pleased to announce that we have purchased a large tract of land near Winnipeg, which we believe will be an excellent site for our future operations.\n\nWe would like to express our appreciation to all our depositors and shareholders for their continued support, and we are confident that with their help we shall be able to maintain our position as the leading bank in the province.\n\nROYAL BAKING POWDER\n\nAbsolutely Pure.\n\nBuffalo Hall!
