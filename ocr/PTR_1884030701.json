However, I am concerned that the telegraphist's role will remain purely administrative and not extend into the fieldwork required for mine exploration. Despite the initial enthusiasm shown by Mr. Knowles' appointment, the lack of tangible progress in mining activities thus far has raised doubts among shareholders regarding the feasibility of such a project.\n\n dello-glacial deposits were found at various points along the river valley. These finds provide evidence supporting theories about prehistoric animal life cycles.\n\nW. B.

Extracts from a Lecture by Arthur Nelson.\n\nStarting from Winnipeg and going northward along the route explored by Nelson to the Grand Rapids, the region traversed through is such that the expense of building a railway would be very high. It is a very level country with plains, swamps, lakes, and streams. There is no rock in this country on the surface, but there are many hills and mountains, and forests abound. These scenes are so vast and beautiful that they will be remembered by all who visit them.\n\nThe \"Dog House\" is a valuable stopping place on the railway. Beyond this point the country becomes more mountainous, and there is a range of mountains to the west. There is also a river of any size to cross, and this can be easily done by boat or by horse. The route goes through the forest, and there are many trees to cut down. The trees are very tall and strong, and the wood is very hard and heavy. The climate is very cold, and the snow falls heavily. The people who live here are very hardworking and industrious.\n\nBuffalo Hall!\n\nGreat Clearing Sale of FURS, MITTS AND MOCASSINS\n\nOwing to the above choice stock of goods reaching here so late, we have decided to offer\n\nLadies' Astrachan Sacsques, Ladies' and Men's S.S.
