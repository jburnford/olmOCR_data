We believe that it is only to child ren that the present can be called a Christmas, and to them the expectation is often filled with hopes that are never realized.\n\nIf we stand for a moment and look back over the past year we will surely see the saddest in our history, but one mixed with many pleasant memories, with many expectations realized, and a year during which great strides have been made forward by our town. No one can visit Prince Albert at this time, and see what we have passed through, but what will say that the future is full of hope, and the coming year will be unsurpassed in its many pleasant anticipations. During the past year we have lost some of our most familiar faces, and although their places have been taken by others in the business of the town, they will never be missed in the hearts of their friends. It is this feeling that makes this Christmas, which otherwise would have been the happiest in our history, a very sorrowful one to many amongst us. To those of our readers who have the misfortune to be bachelor s, the Christmas season is not likely to bring much good cheer, especially to families who have the wife and mother at their head, and we doubt not but that many a lone man will vow that next Christmas he will find a home. If our paper should allow it we would like to review the improvements and additions which have been made to our town during the past year, but we will not do so except for a future number, and we sincerely trust that the difficulties under which THE P. A. Club has labored will be overcome during the coming year, and that with the help of our patrons, we may meet the winter of all our patrons.\n\nThe Methodist says that his members have been gathering together, and the expected presence of the ex-militia leader will no longer be a source of embarrassment. It is satisfactory to know that the entertainments, which were entirely of a religious character, were not attended by any of the military leader, to further widen public feeling.\n\nLieut.-Gen. Dowling has given a written guarantee to Mr. O. E. Hughes, Esq., that he, Lieut.-Gen. Dowling, will hold himself, who has threatened to prosecute him, will not be prosecuted or interfered with by the Government. They will, however, be open to prosecution for any stolen property in their possession.\n\nMr. O. E. Hughes, M.N.W.C., has been faithful and trustworthy throughout the administration of the District of Prince Albert and western district, and has taken a deep interest in all matters pertaining to the rights of the people. The substance of a long report, moved to Mr. Hughes, and seconded by Mr. Prin ce, of Wabasso, relates to the advisability of settling the legitimate claims of settlers rendered destitute by the late settlement, has been moved by Lieut.-Gen. Dowling to the Government in allowing the law to be carried out in regard to the claims paid as soon as possible.\n\nThe North West Council, the members of which must be given power to thoroughly comprehend the situation, to provide for the ensuing result, and to bring to a strong term, the action of the Dominion Government in allowing the law to be carried out in regard to the claims paid as soon as possible.\n\nWhen the question of the claims have been held in certain of the towns of the Dominion, at which it was sought to condemn the Dominion Govern ment for allowing the settlement of the Council to carry out effect in the case of Lord Kitchener, who had stirred up rebellion among the half-breeds and Indians in these Terr itories, and who, after a fair and impartial trial by a competent tribunal, whereas the peace and tranquility and prosperity of these Territories would have been jeopardized and a feeling of insecurity would have existed among the settlers had the same two cases been heard, who had not shrunk from the terrible responsibility of uniting the half-breeds and Indians to armed insurrection had permitted to proceed, would have been far more disastrous. And whereas a fair, just and impartial administration of the law must be had, if the laws of our country are to be respected by all classes irrespective of nationality; therefore this Council desires to urge the said council to pass an act in the nature of the Dominion Govern ment in allowing the sentence of the Court to be carried into effect.\n\nOUR PUBLIC SCHOOL HONOR ROLL\n\nFOR QUARTER ENDING DECEMBER 30.\n\nGirls\u2014Alice Stewart, Virginia Mc Kay, Jane McIlwain, Ethel Gordon, Agnes Thompson, Clara Edwards, Emma Wilson, Anna Dilworth, Jessie Dilworth, Annie McCaggart, Lizzie Dilworth, Anna Sower.\n\nBoys\u2014Roy McIlwain, Tom MacKay, Willie MacKay, Alex MacKenzie, Willie MacKenzie, Fred McLeod, John McLeod, Willie Gordon, Robert Ross, John Gordon, Jack Burdett, Frank Robertson, Robert Robertson, William Gordon, Robert McCaggart, William McTaggart, Richard Gordon, James Sower, John Dilworth.\n\nPROTESTS\n\nSamuel Hill\u2014At O.

D. MAVEETY, PUBLISHER AND PROPRIETOR\n\n3RD ST., PRINCE ALBERT, SASK\nComplimentary Supper\n\nTo H. Pearce, Esq., D.L.C.\n\nEvery pleasant and enjoyable time was spent Thursday evening at the Complimentary Supper given by Mr. Pearce, Esq., to Messrs. Stewart, Brown and Betts.\n\nAbout thirty sat down in the saloon, among whom were\u2014Colonel Spratt, Brown and Betts, J. Stewart, W. V. Maclean, D. Maclean, Capt. S. Baker, Capt. J. M. Clark, Capt. Henry, Capt. G. S. Davison, T. N. Campbell, G. D. Northgate, Geo. McLeod, D. J. Waggner, Capt. J. S. Clark, J. J. Montgomery, J. G. Parker, A. McNab, W. J. Barker, S. McNab, Capt. J. M. Clark, L. B. R. Gordon, J. C. Maclean, O. Davis, J. F. Stall and others.\n\nThe chair was occupied by Mr. Miller, President of the Local Agricultural Society, and to his right sat Mr. Pearce, the guest of the evening.\n\nThe vice-chair was occupied by Col. Spratt.\n\nAfter all had partaken of the above, a good deal of the evening was spent in letters of apology from Messrs. Belanger, Kennedy, Agnew and Spencer, regretting their inability to be present.\n\nThe Chairman then proposed\u2014\"The Queen and Royal Family,\" which was duly honoured.\n\nThe next toast proposed was the \"Governor General and Lieutenant Governor,\" which was loudly cheered.\n\nMr. J. M. Johnson sang a song, which was most appreciated.\n\nThe Army, Navy and Volunteers were then proposed, and was ably responded to by Mr. J. Stewart.\n\nThe Chairman then proposed\u2014\"Our Land,\" and in doing so spoke in very flattering terms of the present efficient and worthy officials. These sentiments were concurred in by Col. Spratt and Capt. Henry.\n\nMr. Pearce, on rising, was loudly cheered. He thanked them for their very kind attention, saying they had been most kind and that on several occasions he wished he was an orator. When he accepted the toast he would be present under one condition that he could do no speaking.\n\nHe thanked the Agricultural Society for the very kind reception they had given him, and said he always took a great interest in agricultural matters, being the son of a farmer, and would ever be interested in anything that spoke of meeting the Agricultural Society again in future, and said he hoped they would then be more successful than they had been before.\n\nIn regard to the Prince Albert Volunteers, he said he would carry his vote for them to the last. He was the Hon. Mr. Watts, and how happily pleased he was with the reception he had received from the citizens of Prince Albert. He thought Mr. White was the right man in the right place. In speaking of Mr. White's position, Mr. David Maclean said he was a hard worker and a well wisher of the Dominion, especially the North West and had given up his health for the benefit of all health. He considered himself an outsider in this country, having spent eight winters in the North West, and the last four years he was connected with the Land Board. He then alluded to his own position, saying he was in pleasing circumstances under which he first met the worthy chairman. He referred to Mr. Maclean and the late chairman of the North West Land Com- mission, and said that the delay in the settlement of the land question was owing to the ill health of this gentleman.\n\nAfter a very neat and pleasing speech, which he thought was longer than it ought to have been, he took his leave, amidst a round of cheers.\n\nCol. Spratt, vice-chairman, proposed the prosperity of the Town of Prince Albert, coupled with the names of Commissaries Betts, Brown and Beaudette.\n\nMr. T. Parker sang \"Home of Oak\" in his usual song style.\n\nMr. J. Stewart proposed the \"Bay,\" which was very neatly responded to by Mr. Maclean.\n\n\"Agriculture and Commerce\" was proposed by Spratt, coupled with the names of Messrs. Waggner, Craig, Stewart and Betts.\n\nMr. W. J. Barker then sang \"The Old Man's Prayer,\" which was very well received.\n\nMr. J. L. Johnson, being called upon, made a short but real speech, which was followed by a song from Mr. D. J. Waggner.\n\n\"The Ladies\" was next proposed, coupled with the names of Messrs. Wilson, Campbell and Clark.\n\nThe next toast proposed was \"The President of the Local Agricultural Society,\" to whom Mr. Miller ably replied.\n\n\"The Volunteer Corps,\" which was next proposed, coupled with the names of Messrs. Rao, Dock, Schmidt and Montgomerie.\n\nThe last toast proposed was our \"Absent Friends,\" coupled with the names of Hon. L. Clark, Capt. Moore and Capt. Henry.\n\nAfter singing \"Auld Lang Syne,\" all bid Mr. Pearce farewell, who then took his departure.\n\nDRAMATIC ENTERTAINMENT.\n\nThe Dramatic Club entertainment by the North West Mounted Police took place in the saloon, and was very amusing, lasting on Friday evening, and was largely attended, there being about 150 present.\n\nThe stage was very simply fitted out and appropriately decorated with flags and evergreens. The stage was divided into two parts, the first part consisting of the part of the Prince Albert Concert Band, and was well received.\n\nThe second part of the programme consisted of a force proposed by \"Raising the Wires.\" This part of the entertainment was very separately very interesting, and was well received.\n\nAll the characters were well known, particularly Peggy (father), Mrs. Peggy (mother), Jerry (son), Peggy's lover, by Capt. Niven, Savas, a Yorkshireman, by Com. W. James, and the rest by Messrs. Craig, Maclean, Com. T. G. O'Brien.\n\nThe entertainment was most agreeable, and as it is the custom of the Dramatic Club to give a series of entertainments during the winter months, we have no doubt they will continue to give such entertainments, but we are glad to know that Capt. Perry has moved out the law to the contrary.\n\nWe are assured that in the future proper precaution will be taken so that such occurrences will not again take place.\n\nTOWN COUNCIL.\n\nThe Council met at Mr. Newland's office on Monday evening.\n\nPresent Comms. Brown, Betts and Beaudette.\n\nConn. Brown in the chair.\n\nThe minutes of last meeting were read.\n\nThe by-laws to regulate proceedings in the Council and the committee thereof were read a second time.\n\nThe Council then resolved itself into the Committee of the whole to consider the by-laws.\n\nConn.
