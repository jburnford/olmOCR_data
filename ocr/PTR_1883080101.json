Another object of incorporation is to give the citizens a chance to be heard and to encourage others to follow their example, and make this a success.\n\nTo do this will be able to satisfy everyone that the town of Prince Albert is permanently bound; that the future prosperity of the town is undoubtedly based; that safety to life and property will be guaranteed; that there shall be a regular market for the produce and that purpose to make this the grain market and distributing point for the surrounding counties, the town being already built and to encourage others to follow their example, and make this a success.\n\nThe above with a small annual expenditure for improving, the roads within the town limits and the town hall, would be necessary to give a character of permanency to this town, which it does not possess now.\n\nIn conclusion, I am convinced that the incorporation of the town of Prince Albert is essential to its prosperity and welfare.\n\nSo far I have shown that the advantages are on the side of incorporation, but it is not my intention to argue the question, nor to state that the advantages are overwhelming.\n\nWe require capital, but capital is not lacking among the incorporated bodies, nor do we want to change with them or be left behind.\n\nWe are ready and anxious to co-operate with the Provincial Government in establishing laws, that incorporate the various units and progress, and working out the details in accordance with the principles and consequently in future assured.\n\n**COMIC HISTORY**\n\nTo the Editor of The Times,\n\nSir,\n\nIn your last week's issue you published an article on \"Incorporation,\" and if you will permit me to say so, I am not only a member of the incorporated bodies, but also of all who are interested in our future and well-being.\n\nWhile there may have been some misunderstanding regarding the advantages of local government and therefore hesitate, I cannot imagine any person who really understood the matter, would offer to view any obstacles in the way of its accomplishment.\n\nI have always understood that the people are not acquainted with the working of municipal forms of government, I will, therefore, take this opportunity to discuss it in a more natural manner.\n\nWe desire incorporation because it will place the destinies of this town in the hands of those who have the best interests at heart, who will make it what it should be.\n\nIt is not thought that large corporations are necessary, we desire that the people should be represented in the councils, and that landowners who should control it.\n\nWithout the buildings that have been erected on this ground, Prince Albert would not exist; without the vast areas of good farming land in the North West Territories.

His term of banishment expired two years ago. In an interview with a Scot settler he stated that the insurrection in 1870 was perfectly justifiable. This statement was explained as including all the acts of the insurgents, but the statement of Scott still defended, but let us not forget where the body was buried. He admits having received what he calls \"dirty\" money to the extent of one thousand dollars from Archbishop Tache.\n\nTHE MOST UNKINDEST CUT OF ALL.\n\nIn the case of the entire press of the North West was a unit of the notorious Louis Riel Government, but by the North West Council it is to be called together shortly the attacks ceased. But the Toronto Mail, which seems to think its mission on earth is to play the jester familiar to old England, thought that perhaps he should be allowed to escape, endeavors to defend him and so conceives once more the press of Manitoba and the North West. Mr. Dewdney certainly knew little of this. He was appointed to his present position by the Government, who knew or should have known that he was not possessed of any of the qualities necessary to make him a suitable man for the responsibilities which he has been called upon to perform. Even this would have been quite passed over if he had been fit to stand a considerable part of the time and some of the period which he held sway. But when the press learned that in addition to his being an absentee, he was using his official position to benefit his private end, and that the Council would not be called together again until at least another year on the policy grounds that there was nothing for them to do if called together, without taking into consideration the fact that this would mean property has been subject for the Council itself to consider. Mr. Dewdney has not done so much for the North West as the North West has done for him. No effort made by any party can place the matter in a better light than that in which it has already been placed. Nearly all the papers of the Territories are Conservative in tone, but they are not likely to be the biding of any leader of leaders and cannot consciously feel that Mr. Dewdney has been true to the trust reposed in him. Regarding the article in the Mail, however, he may well exclaim \"Save me from my friends,\" for it is certainly the \"most unkindest cut of all.\"\n\nEDITORIAL NOTES.\n\nIt is rumored that Sir A. T. Galt will shortly succeed Mr. Dewdney as Lieutenant Governor of the North West.\n\nThe recent Jean Baptiste celebration, and the strong French national speeches made by the orators on that occasion, bring out into the fact that the French population of Canada is characterized by a startling amount of solidarity which shocks no less for the total absence of religious division. The chain of generations completely cut in two by the French element, which obstinately refuses to intermingle with the English speaking race, and is driving it out. The problem presented in this fact is worthy of the study of statesmen.\n\nIt is proposed in 1884 to mark Sir John's forty years in public life by a public testimonial of some kind. It is said that Sir John has never been away from a party, Sir John does. He is the head, middle and tail of it and but for his acute control it would many times otherwise have been done disorganizedly.\n\nThere is a vacant seat in the Senate for the Kingston district. The name of Dr. Sullivan, of that city, is mentioned as a possible candidate in connection with it. The doctor is a man of intelligence and ability, and has strong claims upon the party. An appointment to the Senate like the Assizes of justice goes by favor, and a Conservative would be sure to get it. Dr. Sullivan would be a great deal more useful in the House of Commons, but the Senate would be none the worse of an injection of brains and ability.\n\nEvery assistance is being rendered to the unfortunate people whose homes were carried away by the floods in London. It is not often that Canada has to record an accident from such a cause, nor yet one of the kind which turns out to be so disastrous. Floods caused by the melting of the snow after a long winter, are not uncommon, but a flood from a persistent fall of rain is something unusual. More lives are lost and more damage is done through floods than through all other causes put together.\n\nThe trade dollar is soundly abused in the State, because instead of being a dollar, it is only eighty-five cents. It has fallen into great disrepute, notwithstanding that while it contains 420 grains of silver, the legitimate standard of only one grain less. It is being used as a strong argument for the flat money principle that the Government, by making the standard coin a legal tender, is doing more to destroy the trade dollar than the extra fifteen or twenty cents, while the trade dollar, which passes on its intrinsic value, is at a discount. Efforts are being made by the Government to redeem the trade dollar, but they are not likely to succeed. The most that the Government is apt to do is to call the trade dollar in at its current value for most purposes, and then to allow it to depreciate further due to the Asiatic trade, and was not officially signed for circulating in the State, but the American eagle, like the less pretentious barnyard fowl, has come to roost.\n\nMr. James Miller, the distinguished newspaper writer and poet at Quebec, the body of young Elmoire, who was drowned near Stone Mills, Belleville, has been recovered.\n\nWinnipeg and Western\n\nNEW GOODS ARRIVED THIS WEEK CONSISTING OF GROCERIES, Fancy and Staple.\n\nA LARGE AMOUNT OF CONFECTIONERY ETC., ETC.\n\nDry Goods Groceries Provisions Crockery Hardware Boots and Shoes Wooden Ware Fancy Goods Clothing\n\n20 lbs Mess Pork Bacon and Ham Canned Fruits Maple Sugar Biscuits Cigars and Fancy Pipes Baskets etc., etc\n\nSTEWART & WOOTTON\nTEA TABLE CHITCHAT.\n\nA baby in her mother's arms,\nA little girl with various charms;\nA tender mother young and fair,\nA lover with his heart sincere,\nA woman contented with much care,\nA mother with a darling child,\nA widow with tender looks and mild,\nAn old lady in a wrinkled brow,\nA dying bed and a dying vow.\n\nAwake! diggers in the frosted ground,\nSighing, weep, with a murmuring sound\u2014\nThis is life.\n\nWhat may be said to be a favorite piece of sculpture with every man?

Ask any married woman how to catch a husband, and she'll tell you.\nChas. looking at the bonnet, etc.\u2014\n\"Don't you think they are very handsome when they are worn by the ladies opposite the store?\"\u2014\"Yes, very, especially the one with the black moss taffeta.\"\nThe independent demands at Atherton's, formed a \"railway club,\" which as soon as formed was suffered to attend. Then a meeting was held to consider the question of a branch line, and the members were holding joint sessions.\n\nA BADNASTORY.\n\n\"We had captured a fish about while after the head was split open it was started to pick out the entrails. It's just like going into a big bath tub, and a man should be able to do it. I thought the fish was ending about in the monster's head, when I was suddenly startled by some one saying, 'That's a good fish,' and turned, and I afterwards learned, by one of the crew accidentally dropping a box, that the fish was not killed by me, but by the fisherman who had killed it with my smooth knife on my teeth. I returned to the boat after the fish was landed and made a desperate effort to get the fish out with the knife. I managed to get a hold by a enough to thrust my knife through the mouth and out the gills, and the fish jumped into the sea. It was a pretty tight squeeze, I must tell you, and I thought I was going to be killed by the water all around me. The captain of the vessel thought I had been killed instantly, and ordered me to be thrown overboard. As I was so frightened that he told me there was only one thing that prevented him from killing me on the spot.\"\n\nWhat was that called the Captain?\nHe was half-dead, said the mate.\n\nNOTICE.\n\nThe Winnipeg and Western Transportation Co. have purchased two Western and Eastern passenger cars and baggage cars, and will be running these cars on the line between Winnipeg and Edmonton.
