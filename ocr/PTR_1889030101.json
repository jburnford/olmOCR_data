Laurier and Cartwright. It is not an apologist for Mr. Dewdney, but in his defence we say that we consider the attack of the Opposition leaders was entirely uncalled for and altogether unjustifiable. But we suppose that some allowance must be made for Laurier and company, who are in a very bad way, and hoped their visit to Sir John Macdonald and the other old members of the Government had always been sat on, and now when they noticed a young Minister on the Treasury Bench, they thought he was a fitting object to come to vent their spleen and that they could easily make short work of him. A great deal of stress was laid by Mr. Laurier on the fact that when Mr. Dewdney visited this district in 1884, he made a speech which was not liked by the people. We do not deny that he was coldly treated by a portion of the community. But it was not on account of his intention to the wants of the half-breeds or Indians. It will be remembered that just at that time the citizens of this place had petitioned Mr. Dewdney for the incorporation of the Town of Prince Albert, and he for sufficient reasons at that time saw fit not to grant the petition. The citizens consequently were very hostile over it, and had not got over their fit of indignation when his Honor visited the place, and for that reason alone his Honor did not receive that spontaneous and hearty reception which he otherwise would. The citizens have long since admitted that Mr. Dewdney deserved and should have received better treatment, and are all willing to acknowledge the wisdom of his actions. Mr. Dewdney is today the most popular man in the Territories, and we venture to say that should he be elected, as we trust he shortly will, visit this same district, he will be given a reception by a class of voters, civic, political and otherwise, such as no other public man in Canada could receive. He every day gives fresh evidence of his knowledge of the country and its requirements, and has during the short time he has occupied his present position done great deal more for the welfare of these Territories. We have only to instance the recent treaty with the northern Indians and issue of scrip to half-breeds to show that he fully alive to the requirements of the native population.\n\nThe most recent information from Ontario is that the Regina and Long Lake Railway is progressing. There is at present reason to believe that it will cross the South Branch before the end of the year. It will, however, be perfectly in order to receive contradictory news in the near future.\n\nNot all the United States newspapers are anti-British. For instance the Washington Post remarks on the conduct of the American press, which has got along something that somebody remember that in the last few months we have rejected the fisheries treaty, the extradition treaty, ordered the British Minister to go home, and brought home the Canadian Minister. American Ministers in England are there yet. Yet England is not paying dirt and howling. If she did one of those things to us there would be a shriek for gore.\"\n\nSASKATCHEWAN INSTITUTE.\nThe second regular meeting of the Saskatchewan Institute was held on Friday evening last in the rooms of the Royal Canadian Legion. Although the night was extremely cold quite a number of prominent citizens were present.\n\nAfter the business had been discussed the following new members were initiated and accepted: T. McKay, J. Knowles, Mrs. Knowles, R. S. Cook, A. H. Cook, J. G. Smith, Mrs. Smith, M.L.A., and Wm. Plaxton, M.L.A.\n\nThe Rev. Dr. Jardine then read a very interesting paper on the study of science, after which the interesting discussion took place on topics referred to in the paper by which the president, Rev. Mr. Gurn, Dr. Cook, Mr. Farter and others took part.\n\nThe next meeting will be held on Friday evening next and a paper will be read by the Rev. Mr. Howden.\n\nOUR LITTLE SON\nOur little son was afflicted with a painful skin complaint which seemed to fail, fail, fail, and worse and worse. We tried everything, but nothing seemed to help. Our little son will be fourteen years old on the 25th inst. In May, 1888, he suffered from a severe attack of the complaint, and we were obliged to keep him away from school for about four weeks. The child recovered, but the complaint returned, and the doctor said it was getting worse. We tried various remedies, but nothing seemed to help. Finally, we consulted a physician who prescribed a remedy which seemed to help. We continued to use it, and our little son gradually improved. We are now convinced that this remedy is the best for our little son.\n\nThat Old, Delicious Killer of Pain, Whether Internal or External.\nEvery Drop of Pain Killer should come from the purest source, and be prepared in every way to give satisfaction.

The city was covered with snow on Monday night, and the streets were slippery and difficult to travel on. The weather has been very cold, and many people have been forced to remain indoors due to the harsh conditions.\n\nVICTORIA\n\nLivery and Boarding Stables,\n\nBetween Johnson's and Campbell's Stores.\n\nHaving enlarged our premises to double their present size, we would respectfully request the public to patronize us at our new location.\n\nWell and water river almost at the door.\n\nWe have a large stable for horses, and a well-known list of prizes for sale.\n\nOur rates are reasonable prices.\n\nOur signs are new, and not liable to breakage.\n\nNEILSON & M'BEATH\n\nG.

The committee of management had issued over 150 tickets, and they were so well attended that nearly every one was accepted, which brought together about 300 people. The large hall was beautifully decorated for the occasion. The ceiling was hung with festoons of flowers, and with wreaths of haystacks, cornucopias, and other military accoutrements, together with drapery, ships and armorial bearings, all arranged in a most tasteful manner. Over the main entrance, leading to the ballroom, was the device of the police force, consisting of ships' wheeling, on the arm of which was seen the emblem of the millennium and the words \"Welcome,\" denoting the feeling which exists between the people of our town and its forces. Dinner was served at 8 o'clock and was kept up without ceasing until 4 a.m., on Thursday. The dinner was of the best class and was supplied by Mr. Lewis' orchestra, conducted by Mr. Cook and Mr. McKinnon. The arrangements were perfect in every respect, and the evening passed off in a most agreeable manner, and a better supper was never before served before the people here; it is said that many thought they had never eaten before when the supper was given to them. All the troops were indefatigable in their endeavours to make their guests enjoy themselves, and they did so admirably, sporting no pains or trouble in doing so. The ladies were very attentive and very obliging, and the men were equally polite and they all spoke highly of the arrangements made for their comfort and the pleasantness of the evening. The guests did not begin to leave until after 2:30 and it was 4:30 a.m. before the last left the hall. The band was conducted by Mr. Murray, Staff Sergeant, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and the band was very good. The officers and constables present were very attentive and very obliging, and they all spoke highly of the arrangements made for their comfort and the pleasantness of the evening.\n\nSTANGLER.\n\nThe committee appointed by the citizens last December has collected statistics as to the trade products, etc., of Prince Albert and its environs, and has ascertained the following facts: In 1886 there were over 2,000 tons of merchandise imported into the town, valued at $10,000. In 1887 and 1888, in 1886, in 1887 and 1888, there were large quantities of oats and flour imported into the town, but the failure of the crops in those years, and the grain imported is not included in the above. The quantities of grain raised in this district are very large, and the amount of grain imported into Canada is as follows: Wheat, 20,000 bushels; oats, 85,973 bushels; rye, 1,000 bushels; total, 97,973 bushels, or a total of 101,286 bushels of all kinds of grain. In 1886 there were imported 200,000 bushels of wheat, which raised the price of the wheat, and the figures above for last year are as nearly correct as it is possible to get them, as they were compiled from the returns of several different farmers working in the District. Besides the above a considerable quantity of grain was imported into the town by grain dealers. Supplies bought in the N.W.M.P. are not included in the above figures, as they are bought by the police and used for their own purposes. We have a list of all the farmers and grain dealers who have been selling grain to us, and we shall be glad to hear from any of them who may be interested in selling their grain to us.\n\nFOR SALE OR EXCHANGE\n\nThe Well-known Store of W.
