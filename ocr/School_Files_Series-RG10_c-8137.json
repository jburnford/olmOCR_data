Marleau,\nIndian Agent,\nSturgeon Falls, Ont.\nFebruary 6, 1942.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDEPUTY DIRECTOR\n\nEach residential school forwards to this Branch a return at the end of each quarter. This return shows the number of pupils enrolled and the number of days during which the pupil was present in the quarter covered by the report. The per capita allowance is paid on the basis of attendance, provided this is not in excess of 92.35% of the authorized pupilage at the school.\n\nThere has been considerable illness among the pupils enrolled at Indian residential schools during the current year. For instance, pupil roll records show that there were breaks in the Prairie provinces about the latter part of August, 1941, and as a result, the Indians returned home instead of going back to school. Pupils should not return to Indian residential schools on September 1, as we have found that in many cases too many of the children did not get back to school until October or even November.\n\nThe above has resulted in a decrease in the average enrollment of our residential schools and therefore, the schools have not earned the per capita allowance which they are claiming here. It is estimated that at the present time there is approximately $80,000.00 left in the annual allotment for per capita allowances. The total allotment for per capita allowances to all Indian residential schools in 1941-42 was $175,000.00, so the maximum amount for which grant is paid would be $92.50.\nDue to increased cost of many commodities and higher wages for staff members, the Churches engaged in Indian work have urged us to make a special grant this year. In view of the amount that remains in the per capita allowance allotment, I recommend that a special payment of $10.00 per capita be made on the average attendance at each school as shown by the quarterly returns. The maximum amount required in order to carry out this recommendation would be $79,450.00.\n\nIn making the above recommendation I suggest that the Churches concerned be informed that this payment must not be considered a precedent for future years.\n\nDirector.\nFebruary 27, 1948.\n\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY\n\nTHE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to report:\n\nTHAT there are 77 Indian residential schools in the Dominion of Canada;\n\nTHAT the Churches co-operating with the Department in the operation of these schools have directed our attention to the increased cost of many commodities and the higher wages now being paid to staff members;\n\nTHAT, as a result, the Indian residential schools have been obliged to incur extraordinary expenditures and consequently the Churches have appealed to the Department of Mines and Resources for a special grant in order to assist them to meet their obligations;\n\nTHAT, due to various causes, funds to an amount of $78,676.93 are available in the appropriation for the current fiscal year and that this amount would be sufficient to make a payment of $10.00 per pupil based on the average attendance as shown by the quarterly returns for the calendar year 1941.\n\nThe undersigned, therefore, recommends that approval be given for the expenditure of a sum not in excess of $78,676.93 as a special grant at the rate of $10.00 a head on the pupilage at the Indian residential schools in the Dominion of Canada, same to be chargeable to Vote 165, Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nMinister of Mines and Resources.\nFebruary 27, 1943.\n\nPR\u00c9CIS FOR THE CLERK OF THE PRIVY COUNCIL:\n\nApproval for the expenditure of the sum of $72,578.50 as a special grant, at the rate of $10.00 a head on the average attendance in 1941, to Indian residential schools in the Dominion of Canada.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 27, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nWith reference to my memorandum of February 9, recommending a special payment of $10.00 per capita, based on the average attendance for the year 1941, to Indian residential schools, I attach Memorandum to Council which I trust you will find it possible to approve.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP\nCertified to be a true copy of a Minute of a Meeting of the Treasury Board, approved by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the\n\nMINES AND RESOURCES.\n\nThe Board had under consideration a recommendation from the Honourable the Minister of Mines and Resources reporting:\n\n\"THAT there are 77 Indian residential schools in the Dominion of Canada;\n\nTHAT the Churches co-operating with the Department in the operation of these schools have directed our attention to the increased cost of many commodities and the higher wages now being paid to staff members;\n\nTHAT, as a result, the Indian residential schools have been obliged to incur extraordinary expenditures and consequently the Churches have appealed to the Department of Mines and Resources for a special grant in order to assist them to meet their obligations;\n\nTHAT, due to various causes, funds to an amount of $72,876.90 are available in the appropriation for the current fiscal year and that this amount would be sufficient to make a payment of $10.00 per pupil based on the average attendance as shown by the quarterly returns for the calendar year 1941.\n\nThe undersigned, therefore, recommends that approval be given for the expenditure of a sum not in excess of $72,876.90 as a special grant at the rate of $10.00 a head on the pupilage at the Indian residential schools in the Dominion of Canada, same to be chargeable to Vote 166, Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources.\"\n\nThe Board concur in the above report and recommendation, and submit the same for favourable consideration.\n\nClerk of the Privy Council.\n\nThe Honourable\nThe Minister of Mines and Resources.\nMemorandum to:\n\nDr. H.W. McGill\n\nThe Governor in Council has now approved of the special payment of $10.00 per capita to the Indian Residential Schools, based on the recommendation enclosed with your memorandum of the 27th ultimo.\n\nIn submitting this recommendation to Council the Minister asked me to prepare a letter for the Secretary of Treasury Board. This was done and I am enclosing a copy. Your attention is specially drawn to the last paragraph. In sending out the cheques to the church authorities for the increased grant, you should advise them along similar lines.\n\nChief Executive Assistant.\n\nOttawa, March 19, 1942.\nOttawa, March 5, 1942\n\nW.G. Ronson, Esq.,\nSecretary, Treasury Board,\nDepartment of Finance,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Ronson,\n\nThe attached Recommendation to Council, which has been signed by the Minister, refers to the matter which I discussed with you a few days ago, and that is, the request made by a committee of all the churches operating residential schools that some additional allowance should be made to the churches in order to assist them in meeting their increased expenditures arising from the higher cost of food, supplies and wages. You will recall that the matter was discussed by Treasury Board when our estimates were up for consideration and it was suggested then that an item might be included to provide for this additional assistance. However, no action was taken at that time.\n\nIn the current year's estimates, Vote 168, $1,398,944.00 was provided for grants to residential schools. It would now appear that all of this sum will not be used owing to the fact that the attendance at the schools was materially reduced during the summer and fall by reason of the epidemics that were prevalent at that time, particularly in western Canada. It is expected that there will be approximately $90,000 remaining in this vote at the end of the year. It is therefore recommended that a special payment to the churches be made of $10.00 per capita, based on the average attendance at each school, as shown by the quarterly returns. The amount required to provide this grant would be $75,876.90.\n\nIn support of the request, the committee representing the churches has pointed out that the cost of maintaining the residential schools has increased very\nmaterially since the beginning of the war and similar conditions existed in respect to the cost of food, household equipment, fuel and clothing.\n\nIn considering the request the Minister pointed out to the committee that if any additional assistance should be granted this year it would not in any way be considered a precedent and that there would be no obligation to grant similar assistance in other years. It was also made clear that if additional assistance were granted now it would only be because there were funds available in the estimates and that the Government could not, during the war, provide for additional funds for residential school training over and above the sums which have been provided during the past few years.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nChief Executive Assistant.\nOttawa,\nMarch 25, 1942.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nOn the recommendation of the Minister, an Order-in-Council was passed on March 16 authorizing payment of a special grant to all Indian residential schools at the rate of $10.00 per capita for the year 1941.

This is being made on the same pupilage as per capita grant was allowed during the year 1941 and is at the rate of $10.00 per pupil.\n\nThe special grant being made for 1941 must not be considered as a precedent for future years, and the Department does not obligate itself to give similar consideration in other years. I therefore, urge the Principals of our residential schools to effect every reasonable economy in the operation of their schools in order that the financial resources may be conserved to the advantage of all parties concerned.\n\nYou are no doubt aware that at this date there is an acute shortage of certain commodities. We have in mind gasoline, rubber, steel, tin, etc., and we have no assurance that the list will not be greatly extended in the immediate future. In view of these shortages we are requesting Principals to do everything humanly possible to conserve these and other commodities essential to our war effort.\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\nApril 2, 1942.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI acknowledge with thanks receipt of your statement showing the amount being paid, as a special grant for the calendar year 1941 to each Indian residential school located in the R.C.

I have not yet had an opportunity of presenting your letter to our Commission, but I am confident the members would desire me to express their high appreciation of this financial help, coming as it does at a time when it is very greatly needed.\n\nAs I have learned from our General Secretary that he also received a copy of your circular letter to the Principals, I am assuming that he will write to you direct in the matter, and convey to you an expression of our Society's hearty thanks for your kind consideration of our needs. On behalf of our Commission, on whom rests the responsibility for the administration of the Church of England Schools, I can assure you that every possible effort is being made to keep them in operation at a minimum cost.

Of this, $485.00 was in cash & the balance was made up of meat, vegetables, etc., supplied free of charge from the Oblate farm.\n\nI mention that to indicate that we sincerely appreciate the extra grant just received.\n\nI hope to remain\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nG.

Surely it will be of great help for the welfare\nof this School.\n\nI believe to do my very best to conduct\nthis school, and to give to the Indian children the\nappropriate education, as possible, for their future life.\n\nBe assured, Honourable Sir, of my most\nsincere thankfulness.\n\nYours Very Truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nApril 7th/42\n\nKootenay Indian School\nCranbrook, B.C.\n\nHarold McGill, Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. McGill,\n\nI wish to thank you personally for your successful efforts to get us a special grant of $15 per pupil for the fiscal year just ended. While all schools will appreciate this grant, I believe that the smaller schools, being the hardest hit, should appreciate it more than others.\n\nThe Kootenay School appears to be in a particularly difficult position: a few years ago, the Oblate Fathers had to pay off debts amounting to over $1000. When I came here, a year ago, I found about $375 in the Bank and bills amounting to about $500. The Oblate Fathers have, since March 1941, contributed about $700 to the school, - $4850 in cash and the balance in beef, pork, vegetables, etc., furnished free of charge from the Oblate farm.\n\nI mention this to indicate that the extra grant is really appreciated.\n\nI remain Yours Truly,\n\nG. Forbes J.M.I.\nFort Alexander Indian Residential School,\nPine Falls P.O., Man.\n\nApril 7th, 1962.\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nSome time ago I had written to Mr. Hogg in order to obtain an advance of $1,000.00, so that I would be able to pay the current accounts; when I received a special grant of $985.50. It came in good time and I am very thankful for it.\n\nAlthough I try to run the school economically, as well as efficiently, the task becomes harder to put both ends together, owing to the inevitable rise in the cost of living and in salary.\n\nI know that the financial question is not an easy one at the present time. That is why I fully appreciate this special grant.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nsgd) J. Brackett, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\n\nHon. T.A.

Hoey,\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nMay 14th, 1942.\n\nMy dear Mr. Hoey:\n\nThank you very much for your letter of May 10th, in which you report that the Department sees no serious objection to the Church distributing these special cost-of-living grants to the Indian Residential Schools in those that will help the financially embarrassed schools in their greatest need. The schools that are in a position to carry on for the time being at least without such assistance should be encouraged to adjust this financial matter more equitably and we appreciate very much if you can tell the help you have given us in this connection.\n\nWith warmest personal regards,\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Dictated but signed in writer's absence]\n\n---\n\nOttawa, May 13, 1942.\n\nRe: Special Cost-of-living grant to Indian Residential Schools.\n\nDear Doctor Cochrane:\n\nMay I refer to departmental letter dated March 25, 1942, relating to the marginally noted subject.\n\nWhen the desirability of paying this grant was under consideration, the opinion was expressed by one or two of the officials here that the grant should be limited to certain schools that had been unable to meet their obligations out of the ordinary per capita grant. After further study of the problem, however, we discovered that we had not at our disposal sufficient documentary evidence to justify the limitation of the grant. It seemed likely to incur deficits as the result of the year's operations.\n\nIt was finally decided, therefore, that a grant above the normal per pupil should be made to the Churches responsible for the operation of our schools.\n\nThe suggestion has not been made that the churches should be permitted to distribute the special grants in a way that will help the financially embarrassed schools to a greater extent than the schools that are in a position to carry on for the time being at least without special aid. The Department can see no serious objection to this suggestion. In times of normal as well as abnormal conditions, however, it would seem to us rather unwise to pass on special grants to schools that are not urgently in need of such funds. No objection will be raised -\n\nReverend R. B. Cochrane, D.D.,\nSecretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n209 Queen Street West,\nToronto 8, Ont.\nraised by the Department, therefore, should you decide to confine this assistance to the schools most urgently in need of help. This is a matter that, I feel sure, can be equitably adjusted between the Home Mission Board and the principals of the residential schools operated by the United Church.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nInspectors of white schools may find in Indian Schools the system they are used to well carried out by teachers trained and certificated in that system; may find the scholars bright, competent and praiseworthy but unless the home part of the education of those scholars is attended to in the school since it cannot be in the home, the results will be lost effort or effort almost lost. Experience has demonstrated that such less, in fact, occurs.\n\nIt seems to me imperative that from the moment of entering to the moment of leaving school our Indian children should be first and foremost taught the lesson I have indicated, viz\u2014what the qualities and privileges of citizenship are and how much they are to be desired and that teachers, inspectors, agents &c., should be instructed to see that they are taught this lesson.\n\nThe impetus if it is to be given must emanate from headquarters where the need is discerned and understood. Insistence upon that need being supplied must also emanate from central authority and from that authority compulsion should be applied.\n\nIt is not to be expected that isolated teachers should discern a truth that it has taken years of the accumulated experience and thought of many to bring to light, nor that inspectors of many white schools with perhaps one or two Indian schools to inspect should discover a fundamental fact in respect to Indian education, and differentiate between what is necessary for the white child and what is necessary for the Indian child.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies and Re\nClosed\n\nSee 1-1-1B for further correspondence since\n\nMar 1929\n\nBlue covered small book\n\nCorrespondence and Agreement relating to the MAINTENANCE AND MANAGEMENT OF INDIAN BOARDING SCHOOLS removed from this file and placed on new 150 series JAN 8/47.\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\nRG 10, Volume 6006\n\nFile 1-1-3, part 1\nHeadquarters - Payments of Day School Teachers Salaries. 1923 - 1942\n\nFile 1-1-3, part 2\nHeadquarters - Payments of Day School Teachers Salaries. 1942 - 1950\nOttawa,\nDecember 2, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nIndian day schools will close for the Christmas holidays on December 22 and re-open on January 4, 1943. As you are aware, a teacher of an Indian day school resides on an Indian reserve and it is the usual custom to go home for the Christmas holidays.\n\nWe have always issued the salary cheque for the month of December in time for it to reach the school before the commencement of the Christmas holidays. However, I am advised by our Representative of the Treasury that the recent regulation regarding suspension of December salaries of temporary employees previous to Christmas this year also affects teachers of Indian day schools and, if no exception is made, these teachers will not receive their December salary until December 31.\n\nI believe that in many cases this would cause a special hardship, as it would, in all probability, prevent many teachers from enjoying their Christmas holidays at home.\n\nTaking everything into consideration, I believe that an exception should be made in their case and I appreciate it if you could arrange to have the salary cheques of the teachers of Indian day schools issued previous years. The number of cheques to be issued slightly under 300.\n\nPP\nMarch 13, 1943.\n\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY\n\nTHE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to report:\n\nTHAT there are 76 Indian residential schools in the Dominion of Canada;\n\nTHAT the Churches co-operating with the Department in the operation of these schools have directed our attention to the increased cost of many commodities and the higher wages now being paid to staff members;\n\nTHAT, as a result, the Indian residential schools have been obliged to incur extraordinary expenditures and consequently the Churches have appealed to the Department of Mines and Resources for a special grant in order to assist them to meet their obligations;\n\nTHAT, due to various causes, funds to an amount of $75,000.00 are available in the appropriation for the current fiscal year and that this amount would be sufficient to make a payment of $10.00 per pupil based on the average attendance as shown by the quarterly returns for the calendar year 1942.\n\nThe undersigned, therefore, recommends that approval be given for the expenditure of a sum not in excess of $75,000.00 as a special grant at the rate of $10.00 a head on the pupilage at the Indian residential schools in the Dominion of Canada, same to be chargeable to Vote 186, Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nMinister of Mines and Resources.\nMarch 13, 1943.\n\nPRECIS FOR THE CLERK OF THE PRIVY COUNCIL:\n\nApproval for the expenditure of the sum of $72,000.00 as a special grant, at the rate of $10.00 a head on the average attendance in 1942, to Indian residential schools in the Dominion of Canada.\nOttawa,\nMarch 13, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nYou will recall that among other requests contained in the representations made by the Church delegation who interviewed the Minister on January 12, 1943, there was a request for payment of a special grant at the rate of $10.00 per capita based on the average attendance to each of the Indian residential schools in Canada.\n\nA similar payment was made last year (see P.C. 20/2087, March 16, 1942).\n\nAt the present time there is an amount of approximately $92,000.00 unexpended in our appropriation for per capita grants to Indian residential schools.\n\nThe reason for making this special payment last year was outlined in my memorandum of February 9, 1942, and I feel that the same conditions prevail this year.\n\nWith the above in mind, I recommend that a similar payment be made and I, therefore, attach Memorandum to Council which I trust the Minister will find it possible to approve.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP\nOttawa,\nMarch 19, 1943.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nOn the recommendation of the Minister an Order-in-Council was passed on March 27, 1943, authorizing payment of a special grant to the Indian residential schools for the calendar year 1942. This is being made on the same pupilage as per capita grant was allowed during the year 1942 and is at the rate of $10.00 per pupil.\n\nThe special grant being made for 1942 must not be considered as a precedent for future years, and the Department does not oblige itself to give similar consideration in other years.

We are very glad indeed to receive this in view of the increased costs of administering the schools under war conditions.\n\nYours truly,\n\nLAD K.\n\n[Signature]\n\nL. A. Dixon\nMr. R.A. Hoey  \nSupt. of Welfare & Training  \nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 5th inst., I am pleased to hear that the Minister has authorized payment of a special grant to the Indian Residential Schools for the calendar year 1942.\n\nThis decision, by making up somewhat for the higher cost of living and wages, will permit the management to give more efficient service in our schools.\n\nThe Canadian Bank of Commerce advises us that it has credited the Diocese of Grouard with the amounts you mentioned.\n\nSince the general administration of our schools is centralized at McLennan, I do prefer that amounts granted by the Department be not sent directly to individual schools. You were well inspired when you adopted that procedure.\n\nWith every good wish and kind personal regards, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nL.

The increased cost for operation here was just over $1,300.00 for the year closing March 31st, due to increased cost of living and salaries, so that the special grant given was more than acceptable.\n\nYour obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPOOR COPY\nMission Saint-Isidore\nFort Smith, N.W.T.\n\n15th April, 1943\n\nM. R. A.

Notice was given to the\nPrincipal who was waiting for the regular forms which she\nhad requested from the Indian Agent at Fort Simpson.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop of Adramyte,\nVicar Apostolic of Mackenzie.\nAttention of Mr. R. A. Hoey\n\nApril 21st,\n1943.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nWe are very grateful to you and to the officials of the Department, generally, for the help which the special grants are likely to prove to our Indian Residential School work. Your letter came whilst the Board was in progress and I had the pleasure of announcing to the members that the Government was making some additional grant to enable us to meet the cost of these schools.\n\nWe are also glad that the Department offers no objection to our making use of the money as we see fit - that is, there is no requirement for us to pay the amount to any particular school. However, most of our schools are in dire need, with the possible exception of Edmonton.\n\nMay I ask if further consideration is being given to the question of paying the schools the full amount of their just earnings? I think we are quite warranted in taking the position that the Department should pay one hundred cents on the dollar for the work which we do. I wish the Income Tax Department would allow me to get away with paying 92.24% of my income tax, but they require 100%. Further, they require this in advance - or at least when I get my pay cheques! I hope you can make some headway in connection with this vexatious matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG.D.M.T.\nST. MARY'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nUnder the Direction of the Oblate Fathers\n\nMISSION, B.C.\nNovember 16th,\n1943.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief Training Division,\nIndian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nFirst of all I would like to express my gratitude for your kind assistance in expediting the cheque for the September quarter. I would not have troubled you, had it not been a matter of extreme importance. Now, I wish to lay the following situation before you, for your consideration and with the intention of asking for your good offices in helping solve the matter.\n\nIt is getting more and more difficult each month to finance this school. This is due to three things: the reduction in the grant; the increased cost of living; and above all to the extraordinary number of children that we are forced to maintain above the paid quota. You are well aware of the first two, as they have been discussed quite a bit between schools and the Department. However, it is about the third, that I wish to treat in this letter. We are carrying, at this time, 35 children above the quota, for whom we do not receive one cent from the Department. In dollars and cents, this means an added expense of about $5440.00 each year. One might say, why carry so many over; or why not get rid of some. The answer is that it is impossible to reduce the number. Far from soliciting enrolment, we have been, for the past years, discouraging and putting off the entrance of children into the school, and furthermore, trying to get the parents to try other schools more distant. This, in itself is a really miserable business; especially when it has been the aim of the Department and the priests to encourage among Indians, the desire to send their children to school for education. Here we are destroying a principle that we have worked so long to establish. Yet, apparently it has to be done, and I mention it, not with any satisfaction, but merely to show that we have taken extraordinary measures to keep down our pupilage. I have taken abuse and plenty of it from Indians, whose children I could not admit into school, and God only knows that they needed it. It is, of course, the responsibility of the Department of Indian Affairs to provide educational facilities for the Indians; but the Indians take it out on the principal when they cannot get their children into school. I guess we can \"take it\" all right; it is part of our job; but it is well to note and note well, that, while in the past, there were only a few such scenes, they are now more frequent and the particular dissatisfaction of individual parents is working together into a general movement of unrest and consequent bitterness. I dare say that this is not a common condition among other schools; they may even have difficulty in getting enough children in to fill\ntheir minimum quota. Their difficulty is in getting the children in to school; ours, in keeping them out. The whole thing goes back to a problem that has been present in our area for years. There have never been adequate school facilities for the number of children in our district. And this is not some outlying district, remote and isolated, but the Fraser Valley, the most thickly populated portion of British Columbia. It is growing rapidly and war industry has given it added impetus; consequently, our Indians are in daily contact with white people. They discuss problems with them, see what they have and want the same for themselves. Education is important for everybody, but it is doubly important where it is needed not only for its aesthetic qualities, but for survival. Our young Indian boys and girls have to compete with others for jobs; what chance will they have if they have no education, and I am not referring to higher education, but merely grade school. The days are past when one could make a living panning gold, or trapping, along the Fraser.\n\nIt is not my intention to bring any religious issue into this discussion, but, since this is relative to the matter, here is a very pertinent point. Children apply to come into school -- we cannot take them in for maybe three years -- they are now ten and eleven years of age, instead of seven and eight -- the result: they leave school at sixteen with a five or six grade education instead of eight or nine. Therefore many of the Catholic children in our district are more poorly educated than others, because they have not had equal opportunities.\n\nThis crowded condition of our school continues, in spite of the fact that day schools have been erected by the Department, in our area, wherever possible. During the past years, I have not taken in a child from a day school district, unless for very special reasons, such as: 1. Very poor conditions at home and with recommendation of agent. 2. No responsible guardianship. 3. Parents living at considerable distance from day school. 4. Ill health and with recommendation of doctor. In other words, our residential school with its present limitations together with all the day schools possible are by no means adequate for the number of children.\n\nAnother point to be considered is, that we are so constantly filled up with pupils, we can never co-operate with the agents, should they have a special case arising during the year, where some child should be admitted to school. I imagine that the agents think that I am \"stalling\" sometimes, when I tell them I have no room for their emergency cases; however, they realize my great difficulty and are very understanding.\n\nI have gone to great lengths here, merely to show how impossible it is to reduce the pupilage, because I can understand that this will be the Department's obvious answer to my problem. And I also maintain that this is a very definite and particular problem of our school. Hence, to solve it, I am not asking for an increase in the pupilage grant, but rather for a supernumerary grant for the children that we are maintaining over and above the paid quota.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs have willingly taken on the responsibility of providing education and care for Indian children at the rate of $175.00 per year. In spite of this fact the same\nDepartment allows us to provide for about thirty-two children, without it costing them one cent. Thus, we are burdened, at a time when expenses are so hard to meet, with an amount of $5440, which, in all justice, should be the burden of the Department. Or, look at it this way. If I should turn out these children, quite apart from the loss of education, there would be the matter of maintaining them in dollars and cents. Many of them are orphans and some one would have to be paid for keeping them.\n\nI am sorry that this letter is becoming so lengthy; but, it is necessary that you be aware of every angle so that my case will be well understood. I always felt that it was unfair for us to be placed in such a position, but I was willing to be patient as long as I could maintain the school even with its extra burden. Now, the situation has become critical. I had to appeal to you to try and have our last quarterly cheque rushed, because all my money was gone. It was found to happen sooner or later, and the crisis was held off mainly by two things, 1. We provided from our Oblate farm to the utmost. 2. We cut down expenses to the absolute minimum. It took very little to upset the balance. A complete fruit failure and the present increase in prices did the job nicely.\n\nI wish therefore, to obtain a supernumerary grant, extending back to the first of September, for twenty-five of the pupils, who are at present not maintained by the Department. I will have their names prepared and the agents' recommendations attached, with whatever other data, that the Department would require. This is, I believe, a very just request. But, because it so just and so minimal, I am exceedingly serious about its fulfilment. I would ask you, therefore, to take this matter up with the proper officials, so that our present acute situation may be speedily remedied.\n\nPlease remember the following points:\n\n1. It is impossible to reduce the present pupilage.\n2. It is not altogether merely a problem of education of children, but one of welfare and maintenance.\n3. The situation has been present for some time.\n4. The financial situation is serious.\n5. The loss of staple produce and the very high cost of living.\n6. It is a simple question of allocating responsibility for the children.\n\nI sincerely hope that the Department will give full and just consideration to my request. I have tried very hard to build up a good school. It is held in high respect in the locality. It is the oldest Indian residential school in British Columbia. Your inspectors, agents and doctors have given us good reports. The care and affection of the fathers, sisters and brothers is something that cannot be reckoned in dollars and cents. Yet all this good redounds to the credit of the Department of Indian Affairs. Surely, where so much is given freely, it is not much to ask for simple justice. It is good to remember that the money asked for, is not for ourselves, but, for the Indian children, that they may be trained, clothed and fed.\n\nVery sincerely,\n\n(Sgd.) A.H. Fleury, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nNovember 25, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nAn unusually large number of requests for an increased enrolment at Indian residential schools has reached the Department during the last two-year period. These requests can be attributed, in part, to the difficulty experienced by principals in financing the operation of their schools. Recent audit reports indicate that few of our schools have escaped deficits. These requests can also be attributed to the tendency, or, one might state, the insistence of the Department, that accommodation be provided at residential schools for orphans and neglected children. I am sending forward herewith a letter dated November 16, 1943, received by the Chief of the Training Division from the Principal of the St. Mary's Indian Residential School, Mission, British Columbia. This letter is typical of a number recently received.\n\nI am sending forward also a statement showing the authorized pupilage at this date, the actual number of pupils in attendance at June 30, 1943, or at the close of the last academic year, and the actual number in attendance on the last of September, 1943, the opening date of the present academic year. These figures indicate that we have enrolled at residential schools at the present time 578 pupils for whom no grant is being paid. The average per capita grant amounts to $171.00. This being the case, it would appear that the churches are providing food, clothing and instruction to pupils at an annual cost of approximately $99,000.00. The representatives of the churches feel that they should not and cannot continue to assume this obligation. These representatives point out that the cost of living has increased at least 17% during the last two-year period and that this, coupled with the 8% reduction in the amount paid annually by\nthe Government in the form of per capita grants, means that they are operating with a 25% reduction in their regular revenues. They remind us also that during the period 1914-16 they received cost-of-living bonus amounting in all to $20.00 per pupil per annum.\n\nThe officials of the Welfare & Training Division find it difficult to convince themselves that an increased enrolment at any particular school, or group of schools, would prove adequate in the solution of this problem. They rather feel that the grants should be restored and paid on the 100% basis. In addition to this it is just possible that an adjustment in the enrolments now authorized may be necessary. It will be noted that Indian parents in the southern sections of the Dominion, who are gainfully employed, appear to be increasingly reluctant to send their children to these institutions. Enrolments at the Mount Elgin and Mohawk Institutes are far below the authorized figure. May I suggest, therefore, that consideration be given to:\n\n1. The payment of per capita grants on the full authorized enrolment rather than on a basis of 95.84%. To do this will require an additional appropriation of approximately $70,000.00.\n\n2. That representatives of the churches be called into conference to discuss certain adjustments that might be made in the authorized pupilage at a number of residential schools, particularly schools established on northern reserves.\n\n3. That consideration be given to the desirability of having a thorough survey undertaken at our residential schools with the object of determining the number of pupils for which per capita grants should be paid and the number of day school pupils that might attend such schools, on the understanding that only a noonday lunch would be provided.\nThe officials here feel that these are matters of extreme urgency. It is scarcely necessary to remind you again that our school population is increasing at the rate of 300 pupils per annum, while our school building programme has been practically suspended in recent years. In addition to this a large number of schools have been destroyed by fire during the war period. With the exception of two or three schools built to replace schools destroyed by fire, the last residential school (Shubenacadie) was built in the year 1940. It would appear, therefore, that unless provision is made for the accommodation of Indian pupils in either Indian day schools or residential schools, the conditions to which I have referred are apt to become increasingly acute during the period immediately ahead of us.\n\nDirector.\n\nRAH\n| Province       | Authorized Pupilage | Actual No. in Attendance June, 1943 | Actual No. in Attendance Sept.,

These requests can be attributed, in part, to the difficulty experienced by principals in financing the operation of their schools. Recent audit reports indicate that few of our schools have escaped deficits. These requests can also be attributed to the tendency, or, one might state, the insistence of the Department, that accommodation be provided at residential schools for orphans and neglected children. I am sending forward herewith a letter dated November 16, 1943, received by the Chief of the Training Division from the Principal of the St. Mary's Indian Residential School, Mission, British Columbia. This letter is typical of a number recently received.\n\nI am sending forward also a statement showing the authorized pupilage at this date, the actual number of pupils in attendance at June 30, 1943, or at the close of the last academic year, and the actual number in attendance on the 1st of September, 1943, the opening date of the present academic year. These figures indicate that we have enrolled at residential schools at the present time 578 pupils for whom no grant is being paid. The average per capita grant amounts to $171.00. This being the case, it would appear that the churches are providing food, clothing and instruction to pupils at an annual cost of approximately $99,000.00. The representatives of the churches feel that they should not and cannot continue to assume this obligation. These representatives point out that the cost of living has increased at least 17% during the last two-year period and that this, coupled with the 8% reduction in the amount paid annually by\nthe Government in the form of per capita grants, means that they are operating with a 25% reduction in their regular revenues. They remind us also that during the period 1914-16 they received cost-of-living bonus amounting in all to $20.00 per pupil per annum.\n\nThe officials of the Welfare and Training Division find it difficult to convince themselves that an increased enrolment at any particular school, or group of schools, would prove adequate in the solution of this problem. They rather feel that the grants should be restored and paid on the 100% basis. In addition to this it is just possible that an adjustment in the enrolments now authorized may be necessary. It will be noted that Indian parents in the southern sections of the Dominion, who are gainfully employed, appear to be increasingly reluctant to send their children to these institutions. Enrolments at the Mount Elgin and Mohawk Institutes are far below the authorized figure. May I suggest, therefore, that consideration be given to:\n\n1. The payment of per capita grants on the full authorized enrolment, rather than on a basis of 92.24%. To do this will require an additional appropriation of approximately $70,000.00.\n\n2. That representatives of the churches be called into conference to discuss certain adjustments that might be made in the authorized pupilage at a number of residential schools, particularly schools established on northern reserves.\n\n3. That consideration be given to the desirability of having a thorough survey undertaken at our residential schools with the object of determining the number of pupils for which per capita grants should be paid and the number of day school pupils that might attend such schools, on the understanding that only a noonday lunch would be provided.\nThe officials here feel that these are matters of extreme urgency. It is scarcely necessary to remind you again that our school population is increasing at the rate of 300 pupils per annum, while our school building programme has been practically suspended in recent years. In addition to this a large number of schools have been destroyed by fire during the war period. With the exception of two or three schools built to replace schools destroyed by fire, the last residential school (Shubenacadie) was built in the year 1930. It would appear, therefore, that unless provision is made for the accommodation of Indian pupils in either Indian day schools or residential schools, the conditions to which I have referred are apt to become increasingly acute during the period immediately ahead of us.\n\nDirector,\n\nRAH\nOttawa, December 2, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER,\n\nIn response to the suggestion made by the Minister, immediately following his interview with representatives of the Churches on December 1, I am submitting herewith, for your consideration, certain proposals relating to the payment of per capita grants and a cost-of-living bonus to Indian residential schools.\n\nIn this connection may I refer to my memorandum to you dated November 25, 1942?\n\nYou are probably aware that, in addition to the regular per capita grant payments, made in recent years on a 92.24% basis, we have during the last two years made an additional grant amounting to $10.00 per pupil of the authorized enrolment at all residential schools. We recommend that a similar amount be paid for the fiscal year 1943-44 and that this payment be made at an early date. This extra disbursement would enable a number of the principals to purchase coal at this season of the year and other supplies in bulk and thus effect certain economies. There are sufficient funds in this year's appropriation to make this payment.\n\nIn addition, we recommend that provision be made in the 1944-45 estimates for the payment of a cost-of-living bonus to residential schools at the rate of $15.00 per pupil. This payment, if approved, will amount to approximately $125,000.00 and it will be necessary to make provision for this amount in the estimates now under consideration.\n\nWe have already intimated that in recent years per capita grants have been paid at the rate of 92.24%.\n\nDec 3/43\nWe recommend that for the year 1944-45 these grants be paid at the rate of 100%. No provision has been made in the 1943-44 estimates for this payment, which will amount to $70,000.00.\n\nThe officials of the Welfare and Training Division are constantly confronted with the spectacle of Indian pupils, many of them illegitimate children and others from disrupted homes, for whom it is necessary to provide accommodation and institutional care at residential schools. A number of such cases are invariably brought to the attention of the officials after the residential schools have recruited their full enrollment. For a time these children were accommodated by the discharge of senior pupils, but during the last two years there have been few senior pupils sufficiently advanced to be discharged from the schools, with the result that principals have been asked to provide, without remuneration, for an additional number of pupils. We recommend that provision be made in next year's estimates for the sum of $25,000.00. This sum would enable the officials, with ministerial approval, to pay supernumerary grants to certain residential schools that are at the present time, without cost to the Department, providing care and instruction for a number of Indian pupils.\n\nIt will be noted that the additional amount for which provision should be made in the 1944-45 estimates, should these recommendations be approved, would be $20,000.\n\nYou may remember that the Churches, in presenting their case to the Minister, expressed the opinion that a cost-of-living bonus, in certain cases at least, should be voted to the Churches, as such, and not to individual schools. The representative of the United Church emphasized in his remarks that this procedure enabled him to extend a greater measure of assistance to certain schools where the need was most urgent, and that a distribution made in this way was on the whole the most equitable. We can see no serious objection to the payment of this cost-of-living bonus in the manner suggested. Cheques could be issued to the Home Mission Board of the United Church and to the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada.\nIn the case of the Catholic Church it may be somewhat difficult to follow strictly this procedure. Where schools are grouped, however, under a particular Bishop, as in the case of Grouard, this method can be followed and it might be possible to work out this method with the Oblate Provincials in the case of the Prairie Provinces and British Columbia.\n\nDirector.\n$128.00\n\nFt.

A similar payment was made last year (see P.C. 31/2360 or March 24, 1943). In my memorandum of December 8, 1943, I recommended a similar payment for the fiscal year 1943-44.\n\nAt the present time there is an amount of approximately $120,000 unexpended in our appropriation for per capita grants to Indian residential schools. I trust that the Minister will find it possible to approve this payment and I, therefore, attach Memorandum to Council.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, February 17, 1944.\n\nRe: Adjustment of Per Capita Grant Payments to Residential Schools.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nThe estimates for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1945, have been tabled in Parliament. I note that the appropriation under the heading \"Grants to Residential Schools\" has been increased from $1,247,866.00, the amount voted last year, to $1,522,774.00. This additional amount will enable us to pay our regular grants to residential schools at the rate of 100% rather than at the rate of 92.24%. It will enable us also to pay a cost-of-living bonus at the rate of $15.00 per pupil for the calendar year 1944, based on the average attendance.\n\nIn addition to these payments, a cost-of-living bonus, amounting to $10.00 per pupil and based on the average attendance, will be paid to residential schools for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1944.\n\nI am naturally anxious to discuss the details of these payments and the effect they are likely to have on attendance at our residential schools, at the time of your next visit to Ottawa.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRe - Payment of Per Capita Grants\n\nThe other day when I was in Ottawa, in the course of conversation, the matter of the time of payment of per capita grants came up. Quite frankly, I do not see why the Church should finance the Schools. The United Church receives from the Department approximately $120,000 a year\u2014which is $30,000 every quarter. We have to wait until the end of the quarter\u2014and a couple of weeks beyond, before we get the payments. In the meantime, we have advanced to our Principals $30,000, which we have had to borrow from the Bank. I think that the Department should pay us one-tenth of the per capita grants each month, making an adjustment at the end of every three months when the returns come in; or, as an alternative, pay one quarter in advance, with the understanding that there should be adjustments.\n\nSo far as we are concerned, we do not think it is fair for the Church, not only to have to provide grants in connection with some of our Schools and provide for the retirement of the Principals, including, in the case of ordained ministers, payment of $100.00 to our Pension Fund, and at the same time to finance the Government to this extent. In view of the fact that taxation, including income tax, is collected on a pay-as-you-go basis, we expect the Department to put the Indian Schools on the same basis.\n\nI should be very glad if you would take this matter up with the Treasury Department.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGD.MIT\nOttawa, March 1, 1944.\n\nRe: Payment of Per Capita Grants to Indian Residential Schools.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter of February 25, in which you discuss the desirability of certain adjustments in the payment of per capita grants to residential schools.\n\nI have already discussed the subject matter of your letter with the Chief Treasury Officer and it is my intention to send forward your communication to the Director, for submission to the Minister. The present payments, I may state, are made in conformity with the provisions of an agreement entered into by the Churches responsible for the operation of our residential schools and the Government, early in the year 1911. Article 2 (Section 1) of this agreement reads:\n\n\"To pay the management at the rate of ....... per annum for each pupil, but the number of pupils so to be paid for shall not exceed ......... in accordance with the restrictions hereinbefore set out; the payments shall be made quarterly and each quarterly payment shall be computed on the average attendance of each pupil; provided, however, that the said grant shall be allowed and paid during the vacation; but no payments will be made until return have been received by the Superintendent General duly certified by the Indian Agent for ......... that the said school has been maintained and managed according to the true intent and meaning of this contract.\"\n\nIt is true that this contract or agreement\nwas entered into for a period of five years, but it is also true that the agreement, as such, has never been formally rescinded or abrogated by either the Government or the Churches. I am disposed to think, therefore, that the passage already quoted is looked upon by the Treasury officials and the Auditor General as their authority and direction for the quarterly per capita grant payments.\n\nIt is just possible, of course, that the time has come when the payment of these per capita grants and more particularly the method of payment should be carefully reviewed and perhaps an agreement worked out, somewhat similar to the agreement in 1911. This is a matter that might be taken up by the representatives of the Churches with the Minister, at the time of their next visit to Ottawa.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nReverend George Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nThe United Church of Canada,\n289 Queen Street West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nOttawa, March 1, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nI am sending forward herewith, for your information, copy of a letter received by this Branch from the Reverend Dr. Dorey, Associate Secretary of the Board of Home Missions, United Church of Canada.

Provision is being made for paying per capita allowance for the authorized pupilage at each school, provided the quarterly returns show that this number is in attendance. As you know, for some years past we have only been allowing 92.54% of the authorized pupilage at each residential school.\n\nThe cost-of-living bonus of $15 per pupil will be for the calendar year 1944.\n\nThe bonus of $10 per pupil for the year 1943 has been computed and paid to your General Treasurer in Toronto for all Indian residential schools conducted under the auspices of the M.S.C.C. whose returns have reached this office.

Hoey\n\nMay 16th,\n1944.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey: Re - Per Capita Grant Payments to Residential Schools (File 1-1-3)\n\nMay I refer you to your letter of February 17th, in which you state: \"It will enable us also to pay a cost-of-living bonus at the rate of $15.00 per pupil for the calendar year 1944, based on the average attendance.\" We have received cheques covering per capita payments for Mount Elgin, Edmonton and Norway House. We note that these have been paid at the old rates of $160, $170 and $175, respectively. I should be glad to know what has happened to the $15.00 cost-of-living bonus promised in your letter, as the Principals were advised of this and they will want to know.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. George Dorey\nOttawa,\nMay 18, 1944.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, with reference to payment of cost-of-living bonus to residential schools.\n\nWhile my letter of February 17 did not state definitely when, or in what manner, this bonus would be paid, I intended you to infer from the last sentence in the first paragraph of my letter that payment of the bonus would be made at the end of 1944. However officials here have recently considered the matter and it has been decided to pay the bonus for the March and June quarters as soon as the June quarter returns are received and the bonus for the September and December quarters as soon as the December quarter returns are received.\n\nI presume you are aware that our estimates have not yet been approved by Parliament and only one sixth of the appropriation has been voted. This amount has already been totally expended in paying the regular per capita allowance for the March quarter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. Geo.

We are well aware that throughout the Dominion there is an upward trend in teachers' salaries in the white schools and consequently we will have to give serious consideration to increasing the salaries at Indian day schools.\n\nIt is sometimes overlooked by our teachers that we are paying 17% bonus to unmarried teachers and a flat rate of $18.48 a month to those with dependents. On several occasions the fact has been brought to my attention that many teachers compare their basic salary with the salary paid at white schools and do not allow for the bonus just mentioned. However, I simply mention this in passing, because I feel it is a point which should be kept in mind by all of us.\n\nI enclose a list showing the day schools in British Columbia and the amount that we have provided for salaries for the academic year 1944-45. It would be appreciated if you would review this list and suggest any changes which you think should be made in order to bring all salaries in line with your ideas. When this is received your recommendations will have very careful and sympathetic consideration. Although it may not be possible to adjust all salaries during the coming year, changes could be made at those schools where new teachers are being appointed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D.M.

I regret the delay in furnishing this information but it was difficult to supply it sooner owing to heavy demands on my time and the need of enquiring into the set-up at each school.\n\nIt is realized that the Department may not be in a position to allow all the increases recommended. It will be appreciated, however, if consideration could be given to the following which are listed in order of priority:\n\n| School          | Present Salary | Proposed Salary |\n|-----------------|----------------|----------------|\n| 1. Penticton    | $900 plus bonus| $1000 plus bonus|\n| Teacher - Miss McDonald. No quarters at this school | | |\n| 2.

Port Simpson (Junior Room) | $900 plus bonus | $950 plus bonus\nUnderstand Miss Keyser is being nominated for this vacancy. She holds a Sask. First Class Permanent Certificate.\n\n8.

Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, August 11, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. HOEY,\n\nOn this file you will find Commissioner MacKay's letter of August 9. You will remember that we wrote to him on June 9, suggesting that he submit a revision of the salaries of the day school teachers in British Columbia.\n\nThe amount involved to cover all the increases recommended on the attached list by Commissioner MacKay is $3,750.00 for basic salary. In addition, of course, there would be the bonus.\n\nTo handle only the increases mentioned on the two pages of Commissioner MacKay's letter would involve an amount of $650.00.\n\nBoth amounts - $3,750 and $650 - are annual amounts. For the balance of the current fiscal year we would only require to spend seven tenths of these amounts, which would mean 7/10 of $2,750 and 7/10 of $650.\n\nI have today reviewed our expenditures under the headings of Salaries and Bonus for the three months of April, May and June and I feel certain that the appropriation provided in the current year's estimates is sufficiently large to handle all the increases suggested by Commissioner MacKay. I have not replied to his letter as I thought it advisable to have your opinion before doing so. If you wish to let the matter stand until I return on Friday or Saturday, I will discuss it further with you.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, August 11, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nOn this file you will find Commissioner MacKay's letter of August 9.

Scannell,\n17 Graham Street,\nOttawa East, Ont.\nManner in which per capita allowances have been paid since 1932\n\nCalendar year 1932\n10% deduction from regular per capita rate\n\nCalendar years 1933 and 1934\n15% deduction from regular per capita rate\n\nCalendar years 1935, 1936, 1937 and 1938\n5% deduction from regular per capita rate\n\nCalendar years 1939 and 1940\nNo deductions\n\nCalendar years 1941, 1942 and 1943\nPaid at 98.24% of authorized pupilage,\nplus special grant at the rate of $10\nper capita, based on average attendance.\n\nCalendar year 1944\nPaid for total authorized pupilage at\nregular per capita rate, plus special\npayment at rate of $15 per capita,\nbased on average attendance.\nOttawa, March 16, 1945.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER,\n\nThis Branch is in receipt of a letter from Reverend George Dorey, D.D., Associate Secretary, Board of Home Missions, United Church of Canada, requesting that the per capita rate at the Alberni Residential School be increased from $170.00 to $180.00 per annum. I understand that Dr. Dorey also spoke to Mr. Jackson regarding this matter.\n\nThere has been no radical change in the basic per capita rate at Indian residential schools since 1931. At that time certain basic rates were established at all residential schools and the rate at the Alberni School was set at $170.00 per capita, while the rate at the Christie School, which is also on Vancouver Island but is more inaccessible, was placed at $180.00. Dr. Dorey has pointed out to me that while, geographically, Christie appears more inaccessible, as a matter of fact it costs the United Church practically the same rate to ship their supplies to Alberni. Taking everything into consideration, I would appreciate receiving the Minister's approval to increase the per capita rate at Alberni from $170.00 to $180.00 per annum, effective January 1, 1945.\n\nAt this time it might be interesting for you to have a review of the per capita structure at Indian residential schools. An Order-in-Council, passed on October 22, 1932, authorized the per capita grant method of financing what is now known as \"Indian Residential Schools\". At that time per capita grants\nvaried from $60.00 to $145.00 and the average grant for the succeeding twenty years was $84.00.\n\nIn response to a request from the Churches for larger grants for residential schools, the Department in 1911 prepared a schedule by geographic divisions and types of buildings and a formal agreement was made between the Department and the management of the residential schools. This agreement was in effect from April 1, 1911, to April 1, 1916. The average grant during that period was $115.00.\n\nIn 1919 a bonus or flat increase of $10.00 on the basic rate was allowed all residential schools and in 1921 an additional $10.00, or a total bonus of $20.00, made the average rate for all residential schools in Canada $135.00. In 1924 this bonus was incorporated in the regular scale of grants. In January, 1926, there was another upward revision and an effort was made to deal more fairly with the small school, also the school remote from markets and the school where farming and other facilities were inadequate. This particular revision was continued for five years, and by 1931 the average per capita grant paid to Indian residential schools in Canada amounted to $175.00. Owing to economic conditions existing following the year 1930, the per capita rate was reduced by 10%, or, in other words, the average per capita grant in Canada for 1932-33 was approximately $155.00. A further 5% deduction was made during the years 1933-34 and 1934-35, bringing the average to $147.00.\n\nIn 1935-36 and subsequent years the 15% deduction was restored, bringing the average per capita rate back to the same as existed in 1931-32, namely approximately $175.00. As a result of representations made by the Churches co-operating with the Department in the operation of residential schools, a special payment of $10.00 per capita, over and above the regular per capita rate, was made for the calendar year 1942 and a similar amount for 1943. For the year 1944, this special allowance was increased to $15.00.\n\nActing Director.\nOttawa, March 23, 1945.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nThe following advances are being made on the March quarter earnings of the schools mentioned:\n\n- Alberni: $5,000.00\n- Brandon: $2,000.00\n- Edmonton: $2,500.00\n- Morley: $2,000.00\n- Mount Elgin: $2,000.00\n- Norway House: $2,000.00\n- Round Lake: $1,500.00\n- File Hills: $2,500.00\n- Portage la Prairie: $2,000.00\n- Port Simpson: $700.00\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend George Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2B, Ont.\nOttawa, March 23, 1945.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe following advances are being made on the March quarter per capita earnings of the residential schools mentioned:\n\n- Aklavik: $1,000.00\n- Alert Bay: $3,000.00\n- Carcross: $1,800.00\n- Chapleau: $1,800.00\n- Elkhorn: $3,000.00\n- Lac la Ronge: $3,500.00\n- Moose Fort: $900.00\n- Old Sun's: $2,000.00\n- Onion Lake: $2,000.00\n- St. Cyprian: $900.00\n- St. Paul's: $2,000.00\n- Shingwauk Home: $2,000.00\n- Sioux Lookout: $2,000.00\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nThe General Treasurer,\nMissionary Society,\nChurch of England in Canada,\n604 Jarvis Street,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nCOPY SENT TO DR.

We are very glad to have these advances, the cheques for which reached us today.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nYour File No. 1-1-3\n\nApril 2nd,\n1945\nOttawa, April 25, 1945.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nFor your information I wish to advise you that provision has been made in the current year's appropriation for payment to the Indian residential schools of a bonus of $15.00 per capita. This amount is over and above the regular per capita rate and is computed on the same basis as the per capita, namely, the average attendance as shown by the returns received from the residential schools at the end of the March, June, September and December quarters.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nWALKERTON, May 31st, 1945.\n\nTo the Rural School Secretaries:\n\nFor the coming school year there will still be a very definite shortage of teachers. If advertising in a widely circulated paper like The Globe and Mail brings no results consult your local inspector, who, if necessary, will recommend that Temporary Permits be granted to suitable persons.\n\nSchool Boards would be well advised not to dispense with the services of teachers who are giving satisfactory service as they are not easily replaced. Teachers must notify boards by June 1st if they wish to terminate their services at the end of June. This also applies to boards wishing to dispense with the services of teachers. When engaging experienced teachers it is always advisable to obtain confidential statements from their former inspectors.\n\nIt might be of some assistance when considering the salary of your teacher for 1945-46 to know the present trend of salaries. Below is a list of the average salaries paid to rural teachers in this Inspectorate at the beginning of each school year since 1931.\n\n| Year   | Salary |\n|--------|--------|\n| 1931   | $315   |\n| 1932   | $14    |\n| 1933   | $64    |\n| 1934   | $25    |\n| 1935   | $601   |\n| 1936   | $625   |\n| 1937   | $654   |\n| 1938   | $704   |\n| 1939   | $759   |\n| 1940   | $768   |\n| 1941   | $837   |\n| 1942   | $955   |\n| 1943   | $1,058 |\n| 1944   | $1,153 |\n| 1945   | $1,271 |\n\nSalaries are continuing on the up-grade. The average for the coming year will probably be $1,300. Three School Boards have already engaged teachers for next year at $1500. If a new teacher is required, the earlier the Board advertises the less likelihood there is of difficulty in obtaining the services of one.\n\nA questionnaire concerning your teacher for next year is inclosed. Contract forms have been mailed to each secretary this month.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.M. Game, I.R.S.\nA.A. Gilroy, I.R.S.\n\nN.B.: School Boards considering the wiring of their schools may have plans and specifications prepared, at no cost, by the Provincial Hydro Commission by writing to the school inspectors' office. These plans are approved for grant purposes by the Department of Education. Other plans may not meet the required standards.\n\nJ.M.G.\nDecember 3rd, 1945.\n\nW. S. Arnell, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Arnell:\n\nFor some time I have been intending to write you concerning the salaries being paid to the teachers in the Indian schools. At the present time it is extremely difficult and often impossible to obtain the services of teachers in the white schools even when salaries of $1500.00 and $1600.00 are offered. I am inclosing a circular showing the average salaries paid in my rural schools during the past years. I wish to recommend that your Department seriously consider raising the stipend of the Indian school teachers in the very near future. Unless something is done shortly it will be impossible to continue staffing these schools with teachers having the necessary qualifications. It is actually a fact even now that teachers with the lowest qualifications are not being attracted to the Indian schools.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. M. Game\n\nIncl.\nJMG/B.\nOttawa, January 9, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR.

Continuing employees will come under the flat rate (or partial bonus) or the percentage bonus according to what they were paid previously.\n\nThe consolidated salary rates appropriate to the present basic salary rates are taken from the schedule, but converted to a monthly rate, as per attached schedule.\n\nJ.M. McCutcheon\nChief Treasury Officer.\n| BASIC SALARY RATE AT AUGUST 31, 1946 | CONSOLIDATED SALARY RATE AT SEPTEMBER 1, 1946 |\n|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| $420 - $35 per month               | $744 - $68 per mo., $528 - $44 per month      |\n| 450 - 37.50                        | 768 - 64                                      |\n| 480 - 40                          | 804 - 67                                      |\n| 540 - 45                          | 864 - 72                                      |\n| 600 - 50                          | 924 - 77                                      |\n| 660 - 55                          | 984 - 82                                      |\n| 720 - 60                          | 1044 - 87                                     |\n| 780 - 65                          | 1104 - 92                                     |\n| 840 - 70                          | 1164 - 97                                     |\n| 900 - 75                          | 1224 - 102                                    |\n| 960 - 80                          | 1284 - 107                                    |\n| 1020 - 85                         | 1344 - 112                                    |\n| 1080 - 90                         | 1404 - 117                                    |\n| 1140 - 95                         | 1464 - 122                                    |\n| 1200 - 100                        | 1524 - 127                                    |\n| 1260 - 105                        | 1584 - 132                                    |\n| 1320 - 110                        | 1644 - 137                                    |\n| 1380 - 115                        | 1704 - 142                                    |\n| 1440 - 120                        | 1764 - 147                                    |\n| 1500 - 125                        | 1824 - 152                                    |\n| 1560 - 130                        | 1884 - 157                                    |\n| 1620 - 135                        | 1944 - 162                                    |\nOttawa, 14 November 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nAs you are aware, the teachers in the Indian Day Schools for the past few years have been affected by the general order which did not permit the payment of salaries to temporary Civil servants previous to Christmas.\n\nIt is a regular practice in white schools and was the practice in this Department for a great many years to issue the December salary cheques of the teachers in Indian Schools so that they would be received by the teachers on or about December 21st.\n\nIn view of the scarcity of teachers at the present time, we have had great difficulty in securing teachers for many of our Indian schools. All of the teachers are aware of the fact that in white schools their salary is paid previous to Christmas and if we continue to follow the same practice as in recent years, it will cause us additional difficulty in securing qualified teachers.\n\nIn view of the above, I would appreciate it if arrangements can be made to pay the salaries of all teachers in our Indian Day Schools on or about December 21st, 1946.\n\nDirector\nOttawa, 20 November 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nACTING DEPUTY MINISTER\n\nTeachers in the Indian Day Schools for the past few years have been affected by the general order which did not permit the payment of salaries to temporary Civil servants previous to Christmas.\n\nIt is a regular practice in white schools and was the practice in this Branch for a great many years, to issue the December salary cheques of the teachers in Indian Schools so that they would be received by the teachers on or about December 21st.\n\nIn view of the scarcity of teachers at the present time, we have had great difficulty in securing teachers for many of our Indian schools. All of the teachers are aware of the fact that in white schools their salary is paid previous to Christmas and if we continue to follow the same practice as in recent years, it will cause us additional difficulty in securing qualified teachers.\n\nIn view of the above, I would appreciate it if arrangements could be made to pay the salaries of all teachers in our Indian Day Schools on or about December 21st, 1946. I am advised by Mr. McCutcheon that representations will have to be made to the Treasury Board.\n\nDIRECTOR\nOttawa, November 27, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. HOEY\n\nThe per capita allowance to Residential Schools was reduced by 10% during the fiscal year 1932-33. This reduction was increased to 15% in the fiscal years 1933-34 and 1934-35.\n\nA restoration of 10% took place in the fiscal year 1935-36 and the remaining 5% was returned in the fiscal year 1939-40.\n\nAn extra allowance of $10.00 over and above the regular per capita grant, based on the average attendance, was paid for the calendar years 1941, 1942 and 1943 and an extra amount of $15.00 for the calendar years 1944, 1945 and 1946.\n\nManual Training Instructor's Grants\n\nProvision was made in the Main and Supplementary Estimates for the fiscal years 1945-46 and 1946-47 for the payment of allowances towards the salaries of manual training instructors whose qualifications meet the requirements of the Department. In the appropriation for the fiscal year 1947-48 provision is being made for the payment of practically the whole salaries.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, November 29th, 1946.\n\nMr. Hoey,\n\nIn your memorandum of the 20th instant it is suggested that perhaps representations should be made to Treasury Board on behalf of teachers in Indian Day Schools to permit their being paid December salary before Christmas.\n\nSchool teachers appear to be in exactly the same position as other temporary employees of the Dominion Government and there would seem to be a matter of general policy involved in that apparently pre-Christmas spending is not to be encouraged. It is realized that provincial public school teachers usually receive the December salary cheques at the completion of the term which occurs before Christmas but an early payment in their case is made to facilitate closing the books for audit prior to the end of the calendar year. In any event it would not appear that receiving the salary cheque on the 21st or 31st of December will make much difference in the actual securing of qualified teachers.\n\nChief Executive

Where recent auditors' reports have not been available, we have settled the amount by placing the school in the same category as other schools in the same geographic locality. For example, in the Far North, we have recommended an increased grant of $50.00 for Fort George C.H., Fort George R.C., Moose Fort, Aklavik C.H., Aklavik R.C., Fort Resolution and Providence Mission. This brings the total grant for these schools to $265.00 per pupil. The only school exceeding this amount is the Carcross School in the Yukon, for which we have recommended a grant of $315.00.\n\nIn accordance with your recommendations, we have endeavored to keep this emergency grant to a reasonable figure. As it now stands the increased sum required in the Estimates would be $248,350.00.\n\nEmil.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\n- The Acting Deputy Minister -\n\nRe: Increased Per Capita Grants for Indian Residential Schools\n\nI am sending forward herewith a statement relating to the marginally noted subject received by me from the Superintendent of Welfare and Training.\n\nThe utmost care has been exercised by the officials of the Welfare and Training Division in the preparation of this statement. A thorough review of the audit reports received from residential schools in recent years has been undertaken. I am personally disposed to think that the recommendations submitted by Colonel Neary are on the whole as fair, as equitable and as liberal as can be made at this time. It is a matter, however, that you will no doubt be anxious to discuss with the Minister. The officials of the Welfare and Training Division and myself would be glad to discuss the matter more fully with you personally at any time at your convenience.\n\nDirector\nPupillage at Rio

They presented to me a long brief detailing the rising\nexpenditures with which the managements of these schools are faced.\nTheir operating costs are largely concerned with the purchase of\nfood and the hiring of teachers, cooks, farming instructors and\nother staffs for these schools. The recent prices in food alone\nhave resulted in much heavier expenditures at these institutions.\nFor example, a recent Treasury Auditor's report on one of these\nschools reveals the following increases in food costs:\n\n| Average Cost per Mo. for previous audited period | Average Cost per Mo. for current audited period | Increase |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Mar. 1/43 - Apr 30/45                            | May 1/45 - Dec.31/46                             | $168.37  |\n\nRising labour costs have also made it very difficult\nfor these schools to operate. This is especially the case in the\npayment of salaries for teachers.\n\nThe picture they painted was indeed a very black one,\nespecially in the instance of the Church of England. In spite of\nevery effort to cut expenditures as low as possible, the Indian\nSchool Administration of this Church finds itself faced with an\noperating deficit of $143,226.00 in the 1947-48 year. Our\nauditors' reports show that during the fiscal year ending on\n31 December, 1945, this denomination lost $73,890.81 in the oper-\nation of its Indian residential schools. This is indeed a serious\nsituation for this Missionary Society and they are greatly worried\nas to whether or not they will have to withdraw entirely from the operation of these schools and let the Dominion Government carry on this educational duty.\n\nThe Chairman of the delegation was the Reverend Doctor George Dorey, Secretary of the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada. He has recently written to the Indian Affairs Branch as follows:\n\n\"I should also like to say that we are anxious to hear from the proper authorities as to what has happened to our request for increased per capita grants. This is the time of the year when we are dealing with our church budgets; and I may say that we do not contemplate, with any sort of happy feeling, having to put in church money to do the Government's work; and further, that any request for an increased grant of church funds for the operation of Indian Schools is going to create quite a feeling in our Board that the Government is not discharging its obligation for the educational needs of the Indian people\".\n\nOther delegates represented the Roman Catholic Church and the Presbyterian Church in Canada. The information which they presented is very much the same as that of the other two denominations.\n\nI have attached herewith for your information recommendations for increased grants to Indian residential schools. These figures have, where at all possible, been based upon our own auditors' reports. Where recent auditors' reports were not available, the amount was decided by placing the school in the same category as other schools in the same geographic locality. For example, in the Northwest Territories, we have recommended an increased grant of $85.00 for the four schools in this area. This will bring the total grant for these schools to $300.00 per\npupil, an amount exceeded only by the Carcross School in the Yukon, for which a grant of $315.00 is recommended. The reason for this large increase is partially based upon a recent ordinance of the Northwest Territories Council whereby a restriction has been placed upon the number of moose which can now be shot annually in the Territories. This will mean the importing of large quantities of meat from Alberta and a resultant sharp increase in operating expenses.\n\nEvery effort has been made to keep this emergency grant to a reasonable figure. It is felt that this need is temporary and you will note in the attached scale that it is entitled \"Emergency Grant\". It is hoped that this grant can be eliminated when living costs are reduced.\n\nI would emphasize the need for immediate decision in this matter. The Churches are now preparing their annual budgets and they are frankly in a quandary as to how to plan their expenses for the coming year. It is recommended therefore that the Treasury Board approve now a sum of $256,575.00 for inclusion in the Supplementary Estimates for this expenditure, as detailed herewith.\n\n(Yours sincerely)\n\n(For The Minister's signature)\nOttawa, March 7, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR.

HOEY,\n\nI have been anticipating arguments which will be presented by the various denominations when they present their briefs to the Parliamentary Committee. I feel certain that they will not be satisfied with the amount of the increase, especially after they had requested as high as a flat $90 increase. In other words, they will not be too happy about $256,000 when they asked for $720,000.\n\nAs you know, one of their strongest demands was for the provision of labour saving devices. It is my feeling that if the Minister is further approached by the denominations for additional per capita grant increases, we should consider advising him that such an increase should come in the form of a mechanical equipment grant.\n\nIf, for example, it was decided to bring the amount of the increase in per capita grants from $256,000 to approximately $300,000, then I would suggest that we allot a sum of $5.00 for each student for whom a school is entitled to receive grant.\n\nFor example, Kamloops School is entitled to 300 students. Then the Reverend Father O'Grady would be entitled to request that we purchase through the Departmental Purchasing Agent mechanical devices to the extent of $1,500. (300 x 5). These labour saving devices permitted would only be those listed by the Nutritionists of the Department of National Health and Welfare as previously submitted by this branch to the Minister's office.\n\nBernard F.

Payments are effective January 1st, 1947.\n\nBernard P. Keary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nThe Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAttention: Col. B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training.\n\nDear Colonel Neary: Per Capita Allowances\n\nI have to thank you for your letter of April 21st, giving information about the increases which are to go into effect from January 1st, 1947. I need scarcely say that this information is most gratifying and the total addition to our income will represent a very considerable relief. The amount will not of course enable us to advance very much and we regret that we cannot pay the increased salaries which seem to be necessary to secure qualified workers. We are, however, grateful for the assistance which the Branch is now making in connection with the salaries of Manual Training and Handicraft instructors and this is proving most helpful.\n\nMay I point out a slight error in the statement appended to your letter. In connection with the Sioux Lockout School, I estimate the total grant as $210.00 instead of $205.00 as shown. I shall be glad if you will kindly verify this; but for the present we are assuming that the figure of $210.00 is correct.\n\nThanking you, I remain\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH. A. Alderwood\nSuperintendent.\nOttawa, May 15th, 1947.\n\nDear Doctor Alderwood:-\n\nWith reference to your letter of May 7th, the total grant to the Sioux Lookout Residential School should have read $210.00.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. Canon H.A. Alderwood, D.D.,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian School Administration,\nM.S.C.C.,\n102 Bank St., Ottawa.\n\nPP/\"GD\nOttawa, April 21st, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nCHIEF TREASURY OFFICER\n\nAttached is a schedule of new rates for per capita allowance to Indian Residential Schools.

We were unable to obtain any information concerning teachers' salaries in 1946, and we took as the closest approximation an index of salaries paid in financial institutions. Similarly, domestic help is based on an index of salaries paid to waitresses in hotels and restaurants. The latest dollar figure obtainable for these two groups is October 1. In the case of farm labour, the figures are quite representative, and the latest available are for August 15. The resultant figure showed a salary increase of 10.9 per cent.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nL. E. Rowsbottom,\nStatistician,\nPRICES BRANCH.\n\nLER/C\nOttawa, December 19, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. HOEX.\n\nIncreased Per Capita Grants for Residential Schools.\n\nYou will recall that it was decided to work out an overall cost increase for the various items included in the normal budget of an Indian Residential School. This was done as follows:\n\n(a) Working with the Auditor's reports our Treasury and Schools officials worked out the items listed as to how the Residential School dollar is spent. These figures are based on a sampling of twenty Residential Schools selected across Canada and representatives of all the various denominations.\n\n| Item                        | Cost   |\n|-----------------------------|--------|\n| Food                        | 36 cents |\n| Light, Fuel and Water       | 9 cents  |\n| Clothing                    | 8 cents  |\n| Salaries                    | 30 cents |\n| Houses Expenses and Sundries| 17 cents |\n\nTotal: $1.00\n\n(b) I then went to the Dominion Bureau of Statistics with the above figures and requested that they calculate an index on the basis of a breakdown on the Residential School dollar. I requested them to work out this index showing the increase in costs of the above items since January 1, 1947. Their index figure is seventeen percent. You will find attached hereunder a letter from Mr. Rowebottom, Statistician, Prices Branch of the Dominion Bureau of Statistics.\nYou will recall that this figure is exactly the same as that upon which we had previously based the increased grants. Therefore, the following will be required to provide such an increase in the grants to residential schools:\n\n(a) If the grant is to be dated from October 1, 1947 the sum of $400,000.00 would be required.\n\n(b) $70,000.00 of the above amount would be required to provide an increase from October 1 to January 1 and $330,000.00 from January 1 onwards.\n\nI would appreciate an indication from you as to whether I should prepare a memorandum to the Minister's office based on the above figures.\n\nBernard F.

The figures below are based on a sampling of twenty (20) residential schools selected across Canada and representing the four denominations concerned.\n\n| Item                        | Percentage |\n|-----------------------------|------------|\n| Food                        | 36 cents   |\n| Light, Fuel and Water       | 9 cents    |\n| Clothing                    | 8 cents    |\n| Salaries                    | 30 cents   |\n| House Expenses and Sundries | 17 cents   |\n\nTotal: $1.00\n\n(b) The Dominion Bureau of Statistics was then requested to calculate the cost increase index on the basis of the above breakdown of the residential school.\nThey were asked to work out this index as showing the increase in costs of the above items since January 1, 1947. We have now received this figure from them, namely a 17% increase.

A 17% increase in these per capita grants would require an additional sum per fiscal year of $330,000.00.\n\nTherefore, if it is desired to recommend to the Minister that increased grants based on this figure be provided, it will be necessary to consider provision of the following supplementary amounts:\n\n(a) If the grant is to be dated from October 1, 1947, an amount of $330,000.00 will have to be included in the 1948-49 Supplementary Estimates. You will note that two quarterly payments (namely December 31, 1947, and March 31, 1948) at the increased amounts, can be met from our present funds because of the following facts:\n\n1. Our present Vote is in a sound position and we are far enough ahead in funds to pay out an extra $80,000.00 for the quarter ending December 31, 1947.\n\n2. As payments to residential schools are made at the end of each quarter, based on quarterly returns, we will make payments for the March 1948 quarter out of funds provided in the Main 1948-49 Estimates.\n\n(b) If the grant is to be dated from January 1, 1948, an amount of $250,000.00 will have to be included in the 1948-49 Supplementary Estimates.\n\nIt is recommended that consideration be given to\nstarting these grants from October 1, 1947, as requested by\nthe denominations. This will then adjust per capita to\nthe present cost of living and enable them to prepare their\n1948 Budgets with the knowledge that all back accounts have\nbeen settled.\n\nTherefore, I would appreciate being advised as\nto whether this increase has been approved and also as to\nthe effective date.\n\nDirector.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nIncreased Per Capita Grants\nFOR Indian Residential schools\n\nAfter considering the requests of the recent delegation of the Chiefs to the Minister, it was decided to work out an index upon which the rate of per capita grants included in the normal budget of an Indian Residential School.\n\nIn order to arrive at this index, the following steps were taken:\n\n(a) Our treasury and schools officials carefully considered a sampling of outdoor reports in order to derive the various items upon which the residential school dollar is spent. The figures below are based on a sample of approximately 20 residential schools selected across Canada and representing the four denominations concerned.\n\n| Item                  | Cost (cents) |\n|-----------------------|--------------|\n| Food                  | 36           |\n| Light, Fuel and Water | 8            |\n| Clothing              | 8            |\n| Salaries              | 30           |\n| House Expenses and Supplies | 17          |\n| **Total:**            | **81**       |\n\n(b) The Dominion Bureau of Statistics was then requested to calculate the cost increase factor on the basis of the above breakdown of the residential school dollar. They were asked to work out this index as showing the increase in costs of the above items since 1945-46. They have calculated this figure from them, namely a 17% increase. You will find attached herewith a letter from Mr. Horebottow, statistician, Prizes Branch, Dominion Bureau of Statistics.\n\nThe total sum included in our Main and Supplementary Estimates for 1947-48 for the payment of per capita grants to residential schools is $3,935,200.00. A 17% increase in these per capita grants would require an additional sum per fiscal year of $530,000.00.\n\nTherefore, if it is desired to recommend to the minister that increased grants based on this figure be provided, it will be necessary to consider provision of the following supplementary amounts:\n\n(a) If the grant is to be dated from October 1, 1947, an amount of $230,000.00 will have to be included in the 1946-47 Supplementary Estimates. You will note that the present Estimates (namely, November 2, 1947, and March 31, 1948) at the increased amounts, can be met from our present funds because of the following facts:\n\n1. Our present Vote is in a sound position and we are far enough ahead in funds to pay out an extra $80,000.00 for the quarter ending December 31, 1947.\n2. As payments to residential schools are made at the end of each quarter, based on quarter's revenue, we will make payments for the first quarter out of funds provided in the Main 1946-47 Estimates.\n\n(b) If the grant is to be dated from January 1, 1948, an amount of $230,000.00 will have to be included in the 1946-47 Supplementary Estimates.\n\nIt is recommended that consideration be given to\nstarting these grants from October 1, 1947, as requested by\nthe denominations. This will then adjust per capita to\nthe present cost of living and enable them to prepare their\n1948 Budgets with the knowledge that all back accounts have\nbeen settled.\n\nTherefore, I would appreciate being advised as\nto whether this increase has been approved and also as to\nthe effective date.\n\nDirector\n\nMr. Hoey:\n\nThe Minister is prepared to recommend\nto Treasury Board the suggested increase in the per capita\ngrants. Perhaps the best way of bringing the matter to\nthe attention of the Board would be to prepare a submission\nfully setting out all the facts. I think you should\nincorporate in it the contents of the letter from Mr.\nRowebottom, Statistician of the Prices Branch, Dominion\nBureau of Statistics.\n\nDirector, Administration and Personnel.\nOTTAWA, January 5, 1948.\n\nMEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY BOARD\n\nTo provide for an additional sum of $330,000.00 in the 1948-49 Supplementary Estimates for increased per capita grant payments to Indian Residential Schools.\nJanuary 5, 1948.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Treasury Board,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to report:\n\nTHAT there have been requests and delegations to me from the various denominations operating Indian Residential Schools that an increase be made in the per capita grants made to them for the conduct of such schools;\n\nTHAT their requests were that this increase should be based upon the increased costs of operating such schools in view of the rise in prices;\n\nTHAT Treasury and Education officials of the Indian Affairs Branch considered a sampling of the auditors' reports upon these residential schools in order to derive the various items upon which the average residential school dollar is spent;\n\nTHAT the figures below are based on a sampling of twenty (20) residential schools across Canada and representing all four denominations:\n\n| Item                        | Cost |\n|-----------------------------|------|\n| Food                        | 36 cents |\n| Light, Fuel and Water       | 9 cents |\n| Clothing                    | 8 cents |\n| Salaries                    | 30 cents |\n| House Expenses and Supplies | 17 cents |\n\nTHAT the Dominion Bureau of Statistics was then requested to calculate the cost increase index since January 5, 1947, based on the above breakdown of the residential school dollar;\n\nTHAT the Prices Branch, Dominion Bureau of Statistics, reported as follows:\n\n\"Further to our conversation and in reply to your letter of December 15, we have calculated an index on the basis of the breakdown of the Residential School dollar over January 5, 1947, and this shows a cost increase of 17 per cent.\"\n\nTHAT the total sum included in our Main and Supplementary Estimates for 1947-48 for the payment of per capita grants to Residential Schools was $2,793,228.00;\nTHAT an increase in these per capita grants would require an additional sum per fiscal year of $330,000.00.\n\nIt is, therefore, recommended that approval be given for the inclusion in the 1948-49 Supplementary Estimates of $330,000.00 for an increase in per capita grants to Indian Residential Schools.\n\nIt is further recommended that the undersigned be authorized to pay, in addition to the already approved grants, this increased grant effective from 1 October, 1947, out of the monies at present on hand in Vote 182 because of the following facts:\n\n(a) This Vote is at present in a sound position and funds are available for the payment of an extra $330,000.00 for the quarter ending December 31, 1947.\n\n(b) As payments to Residential Schools are made at the end of each quarter, based on quarterly returns, payments can be made for the March 1948 quarter out of funds still available for 1947-48 and the balance from funds provided in the main 1948-49 Estimates.\n\nMinister of Mines and Resources.\n\nBFN/EM\nOttawa, January 5, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nIncreased Per Capita Grants for Indian Residential Schools -\n\nPlease find attached a submission to Treasury Board for the increased per capita grants previously approved by the Minister.\n\nWe have set out all the facts in the submission and have attached the following documents:\n\n(a) Letter from Statistician of Prices Branch, Dominion Bureau of Statistics,\n\n(b) Memorandum of presentation made by representatives of the Churches to the Minister on November 28, 1947,\n\n(c) Letter from Canon L.

Glen,\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Glen:\n\nI am writing you today, enclosing a copy of a letter which I have just received from the Principal of the Alberni Residential School, and a copy of the accompanying letter from the Bank of Montreal.\n\nYou will remember that on November 25th, a delegation from the Churches waited on you to put before you the need of substantial increases in the per capita grants, if the Schools are to continue to function.\n\nYou will see that there is an accumulated deficit at Alberni of over $7,000.00. I hope it will be possible for the Government to make some grant that will be retroactive, as well as to increase the grant substantially; because I can assure you that, although it will be with the greatest regret, it will be impossible for The United Church of Canada to continue to operate the Alberni Residential School, if it means the putting in of substantial amounts of our missionary funds. I am quite sure that the condition in a number of the other Schools is similar, and I hope that the Government will be able to do something without delay.\n\nI regret having to add to your troubles at the present time, but you can understand that when a man has the Bank of Montreal pushing him like this, he is in a bad way.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(sgd) Geo. Dorey\n\nGD.MLT\n\nEnclos.\n(COPY)\n\nALBERNI RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nUnited Church of Canada\n\nAlberni, B.C.\nFeb. 5th, 1948.\n\nRev. George Dorey, D.D.\nTORONTO, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. Dorey,\n\nI am enclosing a letter I have received from the Manager of the Bank of Montreal which carries our account. Mr. Wylie spoke to me about the increasing overdraft. He is not, of course, worried about the account, but only about the irregularity of permitting a $7000.00 plus overdraft where the authorization is only for $4000.00. You will remember that this matter came up before when I first took over. The prospects then, however, were that the overdraft could be reduced. This was done, down to the approximate amount of $3000.00 at one time. The situation now has changed, however, and I see no prospect of anything but ever increasing expenditure if the present price and wage trend continues.\n\nThe overdraft for January is $6221.00, with a total adverse Cash Book balance of $7425.00. January accounts and salaries are still to be paid (on February 15th, when the remittance advance of $4000.00 is received). This will approximate $6000.00. The arrears of revenue due to the school amount to $1500.00, leaving an overall deficit of some $11,000.00, bringing us back to where we were three and one-half years ago.\n\nFirst, there is the absolute necessity of increased Government revenue. Procrastination should no longer be tolerated. Also, the Government should either assume definite responsibility for the deficit to date, either by payment of the deficit or satisfying the carrying banks that it is a Government responsibility. In the meantime it is necessary that the Principal should have authorization to incur an overdraft to the amount of his expenditure under the present and prospective operating cost.....to what amount I cannot estimate, but I would say the authorization should be for $10,000.00. I still suggest that the expenditure over revenue should be carried as a deficit and Bank overdraft. Subsidization by the Church in the reduction of deficit or the augmentation of current revenue would simply encourage the Government to continue its policy of evading its Indian education responsibilities.\n\nFurther, may I suggest that the deferring of proper action on the part of the Government and the Church in dealing promptly and decisively with the matter of school finance tends to debase the functional value of the school.\nI have already lost one of the best Boys' Supervisors in the educational system, a man who has made this work a vocation, because of lack of opportunity and security afforded in employment by the school. There is no inducement given to the teachers to continue employment in a residential school. They are sacrificing salary, experience scale increases and superannuation by teaching in a residential school. It might be noted here that teachers in all the Alberni Public Schools have this week been awarded an \"across the board\" increase of $200.00 (retroactive) by an Arbitration Board. I have been fortunate in obtaining a very good slate of teachers this term, but I cannot hope to engage them for another year. We must be able to offer teachers inducements at least the equal of the Public Schools, otherwise we must put up with the left-overs (if there are any) to the detriment of our standard of teaching.\n\nAlso there is the functional value of the Principal to consider. No Principal could be expected to continue to give efficient attention to all the many duties that make for the efficient operation of an institution such as Alberni School, and carry, at the same time, the constant burden of ever increasing debt, about which one can do nothing and of which there is no end in sight.\n\nSurely the Churches ought to be able to impress the urgency of the emergency on the Government, so that immediate action can be taken. It is absolutely useless for the Government or the Church to counsel retrenchment or economy. This has been practised to the limit beyond which we cannot go. It is false economy, and functional suicide, to attempt further economy in food. The late Principal of the Alert Bay School foolishly tried this experiment at the beginning of this term, resulting in his resignation, and a loss in prestige of that school with the Indian people from which it will take them a long time to recover. Salaries must be held down, at the cost of operating with a mediocre staff. The present supply situation in clothing, boots and shoes, soaps, and in practically every necessary line, is such that we cannot bargain or question either price or quality.\n\nI will note some comparative costs as of January 1947 and January 1948:\n\n| Item          | Jan. 1947 | Jan. 1948 |\n|---------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Meats and butter | 634.02    | 861.86    |\n| Groceries     | 505.63    | 952.40    |\n| Coal          | 306.60    | 542.30    |\n\nDry Goods cannot be compared, as we are now replenishing supplies not obtainable a year ago. However, the Dry Goods account for January of this year is $1106.56, and the Boots and Shoes account $575.16. It can also be noted that stoker coal, which cost us $12.20 per ton a year ago ($9.45 per ton two years ago) is now $19.50 per ton. May I say also that in the matter of food and fuel our consumption quantity has not been increased.\nWill you please attend to the matter of the Bank letter as soon as possible? Further than that, I would at least like to be assured that the condition of the finances of this school, and the deficit, is approved by the United Church as far as the efforts of the Principal is concerned... or, of course, should a contrary viewpoint be taken, I would like to be advised.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Signed) A. E. Caldwell\nPrincipal.\n\nI enclose Financial Statements for the Dec. quarter and the month of January. All accounts are paid with the exception of Fuel and Clothing. I am holding a carry-over in the fuel account of $1092.30 as at the end of January, and in the Drygoods account $82.36. These accounts continue in good standing.\nBANK OF MONTREAL,\nPort Alberni, B.

A. Glen,\nMinister, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nHonourable Sir:\n\nAt the recent meeting of our Executive Committee a report was made of our deputation to you on the 7th November, and of the letter to you from Canon Alderwood of the 8th November confirming the requests which the deputation had made.\n\nThe Executive was very appreciative of the sympathetic hearing which had been given to the deputation and of the acknowledgment of Canon Alderwood's letter received from the Acting Minister under date of 17th November addressed to General Turner.\n\nAs the financial situation which had alarmed our Board of Management in September has continued to get steadily worse, due to the continuing rise in the cost of maintaining the schools, and as it becomes increasingly evident that our Church cannot continue the present partnership with the Government without some additional relief, I was directed to write to you and point out again how necessary are the two requests which the deputation laid before you. They are:\n\n1. That to meet the alarming deficit for 1947 which is impending, the emergency grant now being provided for 1947 be increased in accordance with the advance in the cost of living revealed in official statistics.\n\nAnd\n\n2. That for 1948 the per capita grants be paid in accordance with the actual cost of living so that we may be able\nto continue our administration of the schools with the assurance that it will not be necessary to place further burdens upon the missionary funds of our Church.\n\nOn behalf of our Society I would express the hope that Government may see fit to grant these requests and that it may thus be made possible for us to continue our partnership with Government in the service of the Indian children;\n\nI am, Honourable Sir,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nL. A. Dixon,\nGeneral Secretary.\nMEMORANDUM of a PRESENTATION regarding the need for increased Grants to Indian Residential Schools, made by the Representatives of the Churches co-operating with the Government, to the Minister, the Honourable James A. Glen, Friday, November 29th, 1947.\n\nThe Committee representing the Churches which co-operate with the Government desires, first of all, to express thanks for the increase made during the year by the Department in the per capita Grant. We trust that we shall not be misunderstood if we describe this increase as in the nature of 'small mercies' for which we should be thankful. To-day, however, we desire to put before you certain facts which make it necessary for us to ask for further increases in the per capita grant. The reason for the request for these increases is based on the following:\n\nI. SALARIES\n\nThe Schools have been paying a very low salary to the teachers and other personnel employed. As an example, The Church of England in Canada pays an average of $600.00 in cash to its teachers. In addition, they receive board, etc., which is conservatively estimated to cost another $400.00 a year, making a total salary for the teacher of $1,000 as an average.\n\nMay we point out that we cannot expect to continue to engage teachers that are even modestly qualified unless salaries are raised very considerably, and we should point out to you that one reason why we cannot do this is because we have such competition from another section of the Department, namely, the Training Division, which employs day school teachers, and according to whose schedule a second-class teacher, with two years' experience -- which, after all, is just a modest professional qualification -- is to be paid $1250 a year. If you deduct $400 for board, that would mean that the Department is paying $850 to a teacher as against the average of $600 which is being paid currently by The Church of England.\n\nThe Department is continually pressing -- and we think rightly so -- for teachers with better professional qualifications; for more supervision; for more specialized activities; and this will add to the salary budget.\n\nThe Schools are also faced with the fact that they are paying salaries to other personnel, such as cooks, engineers and supervisors, etc., which are ridiculously low. Here, again, they come into competition with the Department of National Health in some cases. There has been brought to our notice an instance where the Church was paying a cook $60.00 a month and she was offered and accepted a salary of $125.00, which was paid by the Department of National Health.\n\nMay we point out with all due respect that if the Government of Canada can find money in the Estimates to pay teachers $1250, and cooks\nat the rate at which they are being paid by the Department of National Health, there would seem to be, on the face of it, no reason why it could not find money to enable the Church to pay at least the same salaries to the same quality of personnel.\n\nThe Churches are also faced with the fact that in certain of the Provinces, Labour Relations Boards are insisting on minimum wages, beyond those which we are paying, and on hours of work which are very considerably less than our staffs are giving, and also on such general conditions as will make it necessary, not only to pay higher salaries, but to increase the personnel very greatly.\n\nII. OTHER ITEMS OF EXPENDITURE: Food - Fuel - Clothing and Home Furnishings:\n\nWe are setting before you a Schedule extracted from a Dominion Bureau of Statistics Bulletin, which shows the increase in the cost of various items: first, in relation to 1939, and, secondly, the increase in the calendar year 1947.\n\nFrom this table it will be seen that food costs have increased 71 per cent. over 1939, and also that there has been a further increase of 21.3 per cent. in this calendar year.\n\nThe figures for fuel, clothing and house furnishings show a similar sharp increase in 1947.\n\nSpecial emphasis is now being placed on better diet in the schools, and the rations which are furnished by the schools have been examined by the Department of National Health and recommendations made that the ration of fish and meat should be increased by 25 per cent.; fats, by 40 per cent.; and that the consumption of milk should also be increased. This would, of course, mean a reduction in the amount of bread and certain other items, such as potatoes, which would be consumed.\n\nNevertheless, the Principal of a Residential School, with an enrolment of one hundred, operated by one of the Churches, has calculated that the change in the diet for his School would cost $3,200 a year.\n\nThe Churches are honestly trying to raise the standard of operation of the schools, but up to the present the increase in the per capita grant has hardly met the increase in the cost of living, and has not made possible the higher standard of maintenance which is desired by everybody.\n\nClothing is an item which should be improved. The Principal of a School operated by one of the Churches estimates that it would cost, on the basis of the prices in a mail order catalogue, an average of $35 to clothe a girl for a year, and $70 to clothe a boy. This would mean that in a school of 125 pupils, the clothing budget would be $7,868.00.\n\nThe Indians themselves are demanding that the children be sent from the School to their homes, at holiday time, with a complete new outfit, but they send them back after the holidays with very little clothing,\nand the School has to start all over again with a clothing issue.\n\nThe members of the deputation are quite well aware that the standard of clothing in the schools is not that mentioned above, nor can it be, because the policy of keeping per capita grants down to the minimum has simply meant that, in order to make ends meet, the Churches have had to find large sums of money from their missionary budgets and at the same time to keep the maintenance of the schools at a lower standard than is desired.\n\nWith regard to the estimated cost of higher standards, - we beg to place before you the estimates prepared for the Committee by the officials of the Indian School Administration of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada, which show that if salaries of teachers were to be raised $200.00; if an average increase of $10.00 were to be given to engineers, cooks, etc.; if 10 cents per day were to be added to the cost of diet; and if an increased staff of twelve were added to the whole of the Schools operated by that Church -- it would mean a total of $93,000, which is 27 per cent. on the present per capita grant.\n\nThe figures submitted by the representatives of The Woman's Missionary Society of The Presbyterian Church in Canada show that, for the period January 1st, 1946, to November 30th, 1947, for the maintenance of the work at two residential schools and at the Mistawasis day school, the Society has contributed $56,500.\n\nThe Church of England in Canada has already submitted to the Department figures showing how much it has contributed, in addition to the per capita grants, for the maintenance of its Indian Residential Schools.\n\nThe United Church of Canada in 1946 and 1947 spent, in addition to the per capita grants, an amount of $32,000 from its Missionary Funds. The figure is considerably lower than it normally would be because the Norway House Residential School was destroyed by fire in the middle of 1946 and has not yet been rebuilt.\n\nWe therefore request the Minister to consider some way of tying up grants which are being paid for the maintenance of these Schools to the increased cost of living, and that these grants be adjusted half-yearly. Specifically, we request that there be a special grant for 1947 so that the actual costs of operating the Schools may be met.\n\nFrom the figures which we have submitted, there is no question that the increase in the cost of operation is far more than was estimated when the figures were being prepared for submission to Parliament. With a jump of 21.3 per cent. in the cost of food in the period - January 1st, 1947, to October 1st, and in the prices of other commodities accordingly, it is quite obvious that, if the Government does not come to the help of the Schools by making grants to cover this increased cost, it will have to be met out of the Missionary funds of the Churches, or else by making\nfurther drastic cuts in the operation of the Schools, which simply cannot be faced.\n\nThe Committee further requests that, as a general policy, consideration be given to adjusting the per capita grant every half year so as to meet any increase in the cost of living. This might be done by making an examination of the expenditures of the Schools at the end of the first six months' period and a supplementary grant being paid, and the same thing being done at the end of the next six months. We feel that in a day of rapidly increasing cost of living, it is impossible for the Churches to bear the burden.\n\nIII. There are certain other matters which may be minor but which affect our operation of Schools, which we present for the attention of the Minister:\n\n(a) Transportation of Pupils: The Act says that the Department \"may\" pay the cost of transportation of pupils to and from their homes, but we find that it is very difficult to get this item met. It is really thought that the Indians themselves should pay the amount necessary for the transportation of their children to their homes and back again to school \u2014 and many of them are able to meet this, \u2014 but, unfortunately, it is left to the Principal to collect this money and he has very little success. We think that this ought to be the responsibility of the Agent.\n\n(b) Recruiting: We also believe that the onus for recruiting should be on the Agent and not on the Churches. We are quite prepared to cooperate to the fullest possible extent with the Department; but the law says that the children must go to school; it also lays on the Government, through the Indian Agent, the responsibility for enforcing attendance.\n\n(c) Enforced Closing of Schools: There are cases in which Schools are closed, or attendance is seriously depleted, because of epidemics. The children are kept at home and not allowed to go to school, but the expenses of the school, apart from the actual expenditure on food, have to go on.\n\nThe same thing is true when a school is closed for a considerable time because of the need for major repairs, in which case the Church again has to bear the full brunt of the cost.\n\nWe would point out that, whilst it is an excellent principle that the Department should not be asked to pay for the education of children that are not actually in school, yet there are cases where the Churches have to keep the schools open even though the children may not be in attendance, and that works a hardship on the Church.\n\nWe believe that the Minister should have a wider latitude of authority so that he could authorize the payment of the grant where it is clearly proven that the lack of attendance is due to circumstances that are beyond the control of the Churches.\n\nThe representatives of the Churches would like again to thank the Minister, and everybody concerned, for the opportunity of presenting their case.\n42 teachers now receive average of $600 per year plus board estimated at 200 and actually worth at least 400\n\nSay - $600 plus $400 = $1,000 average salary.\n\nThis should be at least $1,200 - calling for increase of $200 per teacher - which equals total of - - $8,400\n\nOther salaries are far below what is generally paid, especially for Engineers, Cooks and Farmers.\n\nAn average increase of $10 would be helpful but still below par\n\nThis would require 180 x 120 = - - 21,600\n\nImproved diets are demanded and with rising prices we can count on higher food costs.\n\nSay - 10 cents more per person daily = - - 55,000\n\nIncreased staffs are demanded.\n\nMore classrooms are to operate and more supervisors and assistants are required.\n\nSay - twelve more at average $44.00 = - - 8,000\n\nTOTAL - - $93,000\n\nPrepared by Indian Schools Administration of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada.\n| Year | Food Index | Fuel & Lighting Index | Clothing Index | Home Furnishings & Services Index |\n|------|------------|-----------------------|---------------|----------------------------------|\n| 1939 | 100.6      | 101.2                 | 100.7         | 101.4                            |\n| 1940 | 105.6      | 107.1                 | 109.2         | 107.2                            |\n| 1941 | 116.1      | 110.3                 | 116.1         | 113.8                            |\n| 1942 | 127.2      | 112.8                 | 120.0         | 117.9                            |\n| 1943 | 130.7      | 112.9                 | 120.5         | 118.0                            |\n| 1944 | 131.3      | 110.6                 | 121.5         | 118.4                            |\n| 1945 | 135.0      | 107.0                 | 122.1         | 119.0                            |\n| 1946 | 140.4      | 107.4                 | 126.3         | 124.5                            |\n| 1947 Jan. 2 | 145.5 | 109.0 | 131.5 | 129.8 |\n| Feb. 1 | 147.0 | 109.1 | 131.9 | 130.9 |\n| Mar. 1 | 148.7 | 109.1 | 133.1 | 133.6 |\n| Apr. 1 | 151.6 | 109.1 | 136.9 | 137.2 |\n| May 1 | 154.9 | 116.2 | 140.0 | 138.6 |\n| June 2 | 157.7 | 116.7 | 142.4 | 139.8 |\n| July 2 | 159.8 | 117.3 | 143.2 | 142.5 |\n| Aug. 2 | 160.6 | 118.6 | 145.5 | 143.7 |\n| Sept. 2 | 165.3 | 121.1 | 152.0 | 147.4 |\n\n**** Oct. 1 | 171.3 | 121.9 | 154.2 | 149.9 |\n\nPercentage of increase from Dec. 1946 to Sept. 1947 | 17.7% | 12.8% | 20.3% | 18.4%\n\nPercentage Increase from Dec. 1946 to Oct. 1/47 | 21.3% | 13.5% | 22.1% | 20.4%\n\n**** Revised information received by telephone today from Bureau of Statistics 28/11/47\nDOMINION BUREAU OF STATISTICS\n\nOttawa\n\nDecember 18, 1947.\n\nMr. Bernard Neary,\nSuperintendent, Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nBooth Building, Sparks Street,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFurther to our conversation and in reply to your letter of December 15, we have calculated an index on the basis of the breakdown of the Residential School dollar over January, 1947, and this shows a cost increase of 17 per cent.\n\nThe indexes we have used to determine this figure are quite accurate, with the exception of salaries. We were unable to obtain any information concerning teachers' salaries in 1946, and we took as the closest approximation an index of salaries paid in financial institutions. Similarly, domestic help is based on an index of salaries paid to waitresses in hotels and restaurants. The latest dollar figure obtainable for these two groups is October 1. In the case of farm labour, the figures are quite representative, and the latest available are for August 15. The resultant figure showed a salary increase of 10.9 per cent.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nL. E.

Dixon, General Secretary, Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nDirector\nMINES AND RESOURCES\n\nThe Board had under consideration a memorandum from the Honourable the Minister of Mines and Resources reporting:\n\n\"That there have been requests and delegations to me from the various denominations operating Indian Residential Schools that an increase be made in the per capita grants made to them for the conduct of such schools;\n\nThat their requests were that this increase should be based upon the increased costs of operating such schools in view of the rise in prices;\n\nThat Treasury and Education officials of the Indian Affairs Branch considered a sampling of the auditors' report upon these residential schools in order to derive the various items upon which the average residential school dollar is spent;\n\nThat the figures below are based on a sampling of twenty (20) residential schools across Canada and representing all four denominations:\n\nFood ........................................... 36 cents\nLight, Fuel and Water ......................... 9 cents\nClothing ....................................... 8 cents\nSalaries ....................................... 50 cents\nHouse Expenses and Sundries ................. 17 cents\n\nThat the Dominion Bureau of Statistics was then requested to calculate the cost increase index since January 1, 1947; based on the above breakdown of the residential school dollar;\n\nThat the Prices Branch, Dominion Bureau of Statistics, reported as follows:\n\n\"Further to our conversation and in reply to letter of December 15, we have calculated an index on the basis of the breakdown of the Residential School dollar over January, 1947, and this shows a cost increase of 17 per cent.\"\n\nThat the total sum included in our Main and Supplementary Estimates for 1947-48 for the payment of per capita grants to Residential Schools was $1,935,220.00;\n\nThat a 17% increase in these per capita grants would require an additional sum per fiscal year of $330,000.00.\n\nIt is, therefore, recommended that approval be given for the inclusion in the 1948-49 Supplementary Estimates of $330,000.00 for an increase in per capita grants to Indian Residential Schools.\n\nThe Honourable\nThe Minister of Mines and Resources\nIt is further recommended that the undersigned be authorized to pay, in addition to the already approved grants, this increased grant effective from 1 October, 1947, out of the monies at present on hand in Vote 182 because of the following facts:\n\n(a) This Vote is at present in a sound position and funds are available for the payment of an extra $80,000.00 for the quarter ending December 31, 1947.\n\n(b) As payments to Residential Schools are made at the end of each quarter, based on quarterly returns, payments can be made for the March 1948 quarter out of funds still available for 1947-48 and the balance from funds provided in the Main 1948-49 Estimates.\"\n\nThe Board concur in the above report and recommendation, and submit the same for favourable consideration.\n\nClerk of the Privy Council\nFebruary 27, 1948.\n\nDear Miss Matthews:\n\nWe are pleased to be able to advise you that the Per Capita Allowance for Indian Residential Schools has been increased by 17%, effective from October 1st, 1947.\n\nOn the above basis, the extra amount due the Cecilia Jeffrey and Birtle Indian Residential Schools for the quarter ended December 31st, 1947 will reach you in the near future.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMiss Frieda Matthews,\nNational Executive Secretary,\n(Presbyterian Church),\nRoom 600,\n100 Adelaide St., W.,\nToronto 1, Ontario.\n\nPP/MGD\nOttawa, February 25, 1948.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of February 11th and also copy of a letter received by you from the Principal of the Alberni Residential School sent forward therewith.\n\nI have hesitated to reply to this communication until now in the hope that I would be in a position to state definitely the amount of additional assistance to residential schools authorized by the Government.\n\nI am glad to be able to state that an increase in the present per capita grant to residential schools amounting to seventeen per cent was authorized by Order-in-Council, dated February 20, 1948, this addition to be retroactive to October 1, 1947. I am sure it will be gratifying to you to know that the additional financial assistance granted to the Churches this year is in conformity with the request made by the delegation which interviewed me on November 26th. It is the opinion of the officials of the Indian Affairs Branch that the grants now authorized should enable the Principals of residential schools to escape financial embarrassment at any time during the present fiscal year.\n\nWith kind personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nReverend George Dorey, D.D.,\nSecretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nThe United Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street, West,\nToronto 2B, Ontario.\nOttawa, February 25, 1948.\n\nRev.

Cheques in that respect will be going out shortly.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, March 4th, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. Mills,\n\nIt is understood that Major Stevens of the Royal Canadian Engineers discussed at some length with Mr. R.A. Gibson, Director of our Lands and Development Services Branch, and other officials, the feasibility or having our 1948-49 school building program in the North carried out under supervision of your department.\n\nAlthough our 1948-49 estimates have not as yet been finalized, we have included therein amounts for the construction of the following two-room schools and attached teachers' residences in the Mackenzie District of the Northwest Territories. These are listed in order of priority:\n\n1. Fort Norman\n2. Roche River\n3. Fort Franklin\n4. Fort Good Hope\n5. Arctic Red River\n\nWe have included an amount of $40,000 for each of these buildings, which will be of standard type construction.\n\nWe are also contemplating the construction of a similar school at Coppermine, Northwest Territories, but it is not likely that much progress can be made with this particular project this year.\n\nUnder separate cover, I have already requested the supervision of army engineers for the construction of the Indian Residential School at Teslin, Y.T. What I would like to know is whether your department could assume responsibility for the construction of these schools provided we\n\nW. G. Mills, Esq.,\nDeputy Minister of National Defence,\nOttawa.\ntransferred the funds. Possibly you would prefer that we arrange to have the work done on a contract basis, which, of course under present conditions, would be a cost-plus-fixed fee arrangement requiring careful supervision. If you could not undertake construction possibly you could undertake to supervise construction by contract.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH.L. KEENLEYSIDE\nH.L. Keenleyside,\nDeputy Minister.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nTo: Superintendents, Indian Agents, Inspectors of Indian Agencies, Regional Supervisors of Indian Agencies and the Indian Commissioner for British Columbia.\n\nAccountable Advances.\n\nThe Consolidated Revenue and Audit Act, Section 32 (2), directs that accountable advances (such being standing advances and those made for a specific purpose) outstanding at the end of the fiscal year shall be either repaid or accounted for within fifteen days thereafter.\n\nThe fiscal year 1947-48 ends on March 31st, and consideration should now be given by you to accounting for all advances whether made from Trust Fund or Vote.\n\nCredit vouchers covering expenditures already made, and remittances covering the unexpended balance, should be forwarded to Ottawa as soon as possible, but in no case later than indicated in paragraph 1 above.\n\nFrom this date forward, all vouchers representing payments made from standing advances will be applied to the advance upon arrival at Headquarters. To facilitate this work it is requested that you mark such vouchers as \"Credit Voucher\", the usual term used when reimbursement is not indicated.\n\nYour prompt attention and co-operation will be appreciated.\n\nDirector.\nMissionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate\nPROVINCIAL ADMINISTRATION\n340 PROVENCHER AVENUE\n\nSaint Boniface, Man., March 2nd 1948.\n\nMr. R.A. HOEY, Director of\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI just heard that you give an increase of seventeen per cent on the grant given to the Indian Residential Schools.\n\nI thank you very sincerely in my name and in the name of our fathers who have the direction of those schools under the care of your Department. This increase of the grant in a time when the cost of life is so high will help us to solve many a problem specially for those schools who have no farm as a source of certain food items. It will also help us greatly to realize your wishes in favor of the Indian children.\n\nWith my sincere gratitude, accept Dear Mr. HOEY my most respectful regards.\n\nYours thankfully,\n\n[Signature]\nProvincial.\nDear Mr Hoey:\n\nMay I join with my colleagues and our School Principals in offering you congratulations for your success in obtaining an increase of 17% for the school grants and in thanking you for the advantages accruing from same.\n\nYou are well aware of our good intentions and desires to cooperate with the Department. Upon the next meeting of our Commission in Winnipeg, April 6th, 7th and 8th, all matters to be discussed are along those lines.\n\nWith best wishes for the continued success of your activities, I remain\n\nYours most cordially\n\n[Signature]\n\nPresident and Sec.Treasurer.\nMarch 18, 1948\n\nR. A. Hey, Esq.,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Grant for Maintenance of Children in Residential Schools.\n\nYou will recall that the Northwest Territories Council - Special Meeting May 23, 1947 - agreed that the Northwest Territories Administration should pay the same grant for the maintenance of children in the residential schools as your Branch pays for Treaty Indians.\n\nIt has recently been ascertained that you increased the rates by 17% with effect from October 1, 1947 and in keeping with the policy of uniform pay for equal service we have adopted the same rates. However, it would be appreciated if you would keep me posted of any further adjustments as it is sometimes difficult to finance these retroactive payments particularly when we are nearing the close of the fiscal year.\n\nR. A. Gibson,\nDeputy Commissioner.\nDRAFT\n\nOttawa, April 28, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nIncreased per capita grants to certain residential schools operated by the M.S.C.C.\n\nYou will recall that one of the agreements reached at a meeting with M.S.C.C. officials on March 25, was that adjustments be made in the per capita grants made to certain northern residential schools.\n\nWe have now received from our Auditor the attached report with regard to the operating expenses of the schools conducted by the Indian School Administration of the M.S.C.C. The following table will illustrate the difference between the per capita grants paid and the operating expenses at the residential schools particularly mentioned by M.S.C.C. officials.\n\n| Dollar cost per pupil, 1947 | New per Capita |\n|-----------------------------|----------------|\n| Aklavik                     | $344.19        | $351.00       |\n| Wabasca                     | 380.61         | 280.80        |\n| Moose Factory               | 447.77         | 310.05        |\n| Whitefish Lake              | 449.68         | 280.80        |\n| Fort George                 | 548.56         | 310.05        |\n| Carcross                    | 590.26         | 368.55        |\n\nI would like to point out that the above per capita amounts only came into effect on October 1 and that therefore the M.S.C.C. did lose considerably on the operation of these schools during 1947. Please remember that the M.S.C.C. operates on a calendar fiscal year.\n\nDirector\n### Anglican School Administration\n\n#### An Analysis of Per Capita Grant Earnings\n\n| Per Capita Grant Earnings | Sioux Lookout | Shingwauk | Old Sun | Alert Bay | Baard | Prince Albert | St. Cyprian | Elkhorn | Chaplen | Akakuk | Wabigoon |\n|---------------------------|---------------|-----------|---------|-----------|------|--------------|-------------|--------|---------|-------|--------|\n|                           | $270,282.46   | $295,052.61 | $214,963.5 | $415,121.3 | $270,652.80 | $262,745.97 | $114,057.6 | $253,377.1 | $171,021.4 | $309,385.6 | $80,949.1 |\n\n#### Expenditures (2)\n\n- **Salaries**\n  - Fund: $96,180.00\n  - Fuel, Light, Water: $137,000.00\n  - Repairs: $56,800.00\n  - Household Equipment: $20,700.00\n  - Farm Supplies: $12,400.00\n  - Travel: $3,400.00\n  - Clothing: $6,400.00\n  - Office Supplies: $3,100.00\n  - Miscellaneous: $5,400.00\n\n**Total Expenditures (3)**: $273,210.00\n\n**Surplus**: $16,772.46\n\n**Deficit**: $19,372.46\n\n#### Value of Goods Purchased\u2014W.A.

G. Cameron\nOttawa, April 20, 1948.\n\nMr. W. Lauchlan,\nChief Treasury Officer,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: Anglican Indian School Administration\n102 Bank St.,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAn audit of the books and records of the above-noted organization for the fiscal (calendar) year ended December 31, 1947 reveals the following information:\n\n(1) The Anglican Indian School Administration, 102 Bank St., Ottawa handles the accounting and administration of the following Anglican Indian Residential Schools: Carcross, Alert Bay, Aklavit, Whitefish Lake, Wabasca, Old Sun, Blood, St. Cyprian, Prince Albert, Elkhorn, Sioux Lookout, Shingwauk, Chapleau, Moose Factory, Fort George, Lac La Ronge and Gordon's. The Administration also handles the affairs of three Anglican Hospitals and two Missions.\n\n(2) The firm of Welch, Anderson & Co., Chartered Accountants of Toronto have been employed as auditors. Audits were conducted regularly (quarterly) and one was made at the end of the fiscal (calendar) year. Annual financial statements were prepared by the audit firm and will be presented to the Administration in the near future.\n\n(3) In the year ended December 31, 1947 the total expenditures for the 17 Indian Residential Schools and Head Office amounted to $440,135.00 (1). The per capita grant earnings for the same period was $337,344.63. The net difference (deficit) was $102,788.37 (1).\n\n(1) The Administration also handles the accounts and administration of 3 Hospitals and 2 Missions. The total Head Office expense of $20,297.00 is included in the amount $440,135.00.\n(4) The Residential school at Lac La Ronge was burned in February, 1947. Gordon's Residential School has been temporarily closed (July 1947) so that major repairs to the plumbing and heating equipment could be made.\n\n(5) Statements prepared are as follows:\n\n(a) Statement #1 - An analysis of per capita grant earnings and relative expenditures for the year ended December 31, 1947.\n\n(b) Statement #2 - A comparative analysis of the Dollar cost per pupil and related information for the year ended December 31/47.\n\n(c) Statement #3 - A budget picture of per capita grant earnings and relative expenditures for the year 1946.\n\n(6) The cost analysis is concerned only with the per capita grant earnings and the relative expenditures. The Branch provided other assistance such as manual training grants, night watchman salaries, preventorium allowances, repairs etc. The cost of maintaining an Indian pupil would be influenced accordingly.\n\n(7) In paragraph (3) a footnote qualifies the total expenditures in so far as it pertains to Head Office expense. There appears to be no satisfactory method to allocate the $20,297.00 expense. It is felt that the part of this expense relative to the Hospitals and Missions was negligible.\n\n(8) The W.A. Dorcas Society provided clothing, bales, bedding etc. to the various Residential schools which was valued at $9,243.00. Information in this respect is shown in statements #1 and #2. The information is supplementary and not a part of the cost analysis.\n\n(9) Freight rates in 1947 to some of the distant schools are shown below:\n\n| To          | From         | Rate per 100 lbs. |\n|-------------|--------------|-------------------|\n| Ft.

An examination of paid December vouchers indicated prices as shown below:\n\n- Stew beef .35\u00a2 a lb.\n- Lamb leg .60\u00a2 \"\n- Sausage .50\u00a2 \"\n- Beef kidney .45\u00a2 \"\n- Eggs .75\u00a2 \"\n- Lard .55\u00a2 \"\n- Turkeys .55\u00a2 \"\n- Gasoline .40\u00a2 \"\nThe vouchers did not detail the freight expense, therefore, the freight costs must have been included in the prices indicated above. With the exception of eggs the prices compare favourably with those in Ottawa.\n\n(11) For fifteen of the 17 schools (those in operation for the entire year) the dollar cost per pupil per year is shown below:\n\n| Item                  | Dollar Cost per Pupil | Percentage Cost of Total Cost |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Salaries              | $87.00                | 29.6%                         |\n| Food                  | 93.25                 | 32. -                          |\n| Fuel, Light & Water   | 40.55                 | 14. -                          |\n| Repairs               | 8.16                  | 3. -                           |\n| Household Equipment   | 19.31                 | 6. +                           |\n| Farm & Garden         | 15.60                 | 5. +                           |\n| Travel                | 11.02                 | 4. -                           |\n| Clothing              | 11.14                 | 4. -                           |\n| Office & Special      | 6.45                  | 2.2                           |\n| Miscellaneous         | .50                   | .2 -                           |\n| **Total**             | **$292.96**           | **100%**                       |\n\nIt will be noted that salaries and food represents approximately 61.6% of the total expenditures.\n\n(12) A budget picture of per capita grant earnings and relative expenditures for the year 1948 is shown in statement #5. It will be appreciated that this estimate is based upon figures obtained in 1947.\n\n(13) While the examination of the books and records was confined to a test-audit, it was sufficiently extensive to indicate the accounts were properly and accurately kept.\n\n(14) The staff and General Turner afforded every assistance during the course of the audit.\n\nK.

HOEY\n\nRe: Per Capita Allowances.\n\nThe increased per capita allowances from October 1st, 1947, were based on information obtained from the Dominion Bureau of Statistics and in setting the new rates effective from the date mentioned, per capita grant at each residential school was increased by 17%. For instance, in the case of the Chapleau Residential School, per capita allowance paid to this school as of October 1st, 1947 was $205.00. Owing to the 17% increase, the per capita rate at this school from October 1st, 1947 has been paid at the rate of $239.85.\n\nIn a letter dated May 5th, 1948 from the Dominion Bureau of Statistics it is stated that there has been an additional increase of 7% since October 1st, 1947. If the schools were allowed this rate it would mean 24% increase over the amount allowed them previous to October 1st, 1947. In the case of the Chapleau school this would mean they would be paid at the rate of $254.20 (24% additional to the rate of $205.00 which they were receiving previous to October 1st, 1947).\n\nThe provision of the 17% increase involved an additional expenditure of approximately $330,000.00 which will be included in the supplementary estimates for 1948-49 as authorized by P.C. 36/666 dated February 20th, 1948. To allow all residential schools 24% effective from April 1st, 1948 would involve an additional expenditure of $127,737.00.\nIn a telephone conversation on Friday, May 7th, Mr. Jackson mentioned the Church of England Schools and I prepared a statement showing what amount they would draw if they kept the enrolment at each school up to the authorized amount.\n\nThe expenditure for the calendar year 1947 as shown on the attached statement, was prepared from the reports of our own auditors.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nPP/MGD\nMay 4, 1948.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFurther to our telephone conversation, it would be sincerely appreciated if you would calculate an index on the basis of the breakdown of the residential school dollar, based on increasing costs between 1 October, 1947, and 1 April, 1948. It is understood that the indexes which you will use to determine this figure will be the same as you used in calculating the former index as advised me in your letter of December 16. The itemized list below shows how the residential school dollar is spent:\n\n- Food ......................... 36%\n- Fuel, light and water ........... 09\n- Clothing ....................... 08\n- Salaries ...................... 30\n- House expenses and sundries .... 17\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F.

Neary, Esquire,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of May 4th, we have calculated a cost index for maintaining residential schools as between October 1947 and April 1948. This index shows an increase of 7%.\n\nThe increase was calculated on the basis of the following changes:\n\n| Groups               | Percentage Change Between October 1947 and April 1948 |\n|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| Food                 | 9.0                                                   |\n| Fuel & Light         | .5                                                    |\n| Clothing             | 12.1                                                  |\n| Salaries             | 4.1                                                   |\n| Household Expenses   | 8.1                                                   |\n\nAs mentioned in my letter of December 18th our information on salaries is not very satisfactory for this purpose. For teacher's salaries we have used as most closely comparable those paid in financial institutions. For cooks we have used salaries and wages paid in hotels and restaurants. The wages paid in agriculture are only available for August 15, 1947 and January 15, 1948. They show the usual seasonal decline between these two periods.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd) L.E.

HOEY\n\nRe: Per Capita Allowances.\n\nThe increased per capita allowances from October 1st, 1947, were based on information obtained from the Dominion Bureau of Statistics and in setting the new rates effective from the date mentioned, per capita grant at each residential school was increased by 17%. For instance, in the case of the Chapleau Residential School, per capita allowance paid to this school as of October 1st, 1947 was $205.00. Owing to the 17% increase, the per capita rate at this school from October 1st, 1947 has been paid at the rate of $239.85.\n\nIn a letter dated May 5th, 1948 from the Dominion Bureau of Statistics it is stated that there has been an additional increase of 7% since October 1st, 1947. If the schools were allowed this rate it would mean 24% increase over the amount allowed them previous to October 1st, 1947. In the case of the Chapleau School this would mean they would be paid at the rate of $254.20 (24% additional to the rate of $205.00 which they were receiving previous to October 1st, 1947).\n\nThe provision of the 17% increase involved an additional expenditure of approximately $330,000.00 which will be included in the supplementary estimates for 1948-49 as authorized by P.C. 86/666 dated February 20th, 1948. To allow all residential schools 24% effective from April 1st, 1948 would involve an additional expenditure of $127,737.00.\nIn a telephone conversation on Friday, May 7th, Mr. Jackson mentioned the Church of England Schools and I prepared a statement showing what amount they would draw if they kept the enrolment at each school up to the authorized number.\n\nThe expenditure for the calendar year 1947 as shown on the attached statement, was prepared from the reports of our own auditors.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nPP/MGD\n| School                  | Present Per Capita | Total Possible Revenue | Expenditures Calendar Year 1947 |\n|------------------------|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Fort George, Que.      | $310.05            | $328.60                | $316,430.00                     |\n| Chapleau, Ontario      | 239.85             | 254.20                 | 25,420.00                       |\n| Moose Factory, Ontario | 310.05             | 328.60                 | 32,660.00                       |\n| Shingwauk             | 239.85             | 254.20                 | 24,317.00                       |\n| Sioux Lookout          | 245.70             | 260.40                 | 35,154.00                       |\n| Attawapiski, Manitoba  | 257.40             | 272.80                 | 35,464.00                       |\n| St. Albert's, Sask.    | 251.55             | 265.60                 | 33,329.00                       |\n| Old Sims, Alberta      | 245.70             | 260.40                 | 28,644.00                       |\n| St. Ignatius           | 245.70             | 260.40                 | 15,624.00                       |\n| St. Paul's             | 245.70             | 260.40                 | 36,456.00                       |\n| Ilnuk                | 280.60             | 297.60                 | 10,416.00                       |\n| Naskawish Lake Algonquin Bay, B.C. | 280.60 | 297.60 | 8,928.00 |\n| Athabasca, N.W.T.      | 299.85             | 294.20                 | 50,860.00                       |\n| Gannawa, Tobin        | 351.00             | 372.00                 | 18,600.00                       |\n| Geraldton             | 368.55             | 390.60                 | 23,436.00                       |\n| Geraldton             | 257.40             | 272.80                 | 405,924.00                      |\n| Geraldton             | 257.40             | 272.80                 | 351,464.00                      |\n\nTotal: 376,360.00\nStatement of Financial Operations at Schools\nConducted under the Auspices of the M.

He was referred by them to the Dominion Bureau of Statistics, from whom we obtained information last fall as to the increased cost of maintenance at our Schools.\n\nWe have now received a reply from the Statistician of the Prices Branch at the Dominion Bureau of Statistics indicating the increase in operating expenditures of seven percent between October 1, 1947 and April 1, 1948. Please find attached a copy of the letter received from the Dominion Bureau of Statistics.\n\nBFN/HM.\n\nEnclosure\nDominion Bureau of Statistics\nOttawa\nCanada\n\nMay 5, 1948.\n\nBernard F. Neary, Esquire,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nDepartment of\nMines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of May 4th, we have calculated a cost index for maintaining residential schools as between October 1947 and April 1948. This index shows an increase of 7%.\n\nThe increase was calculated on the basis of the following changes:\n\n| Groups               | Percentage Change Between October 1947 and April 1948 |\n|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| Food                 | + 9.0                                                 |\n| Fuel & Light         | - .5                                                  |\n| Clothing             | + 12.1                                                |\n| Salaries             | + 4.1                                                 |\n| Household Expenses   | + 8.1                                                 |\n\nAs mentioned in my letter of December 18th our information on salaries is not very satisfactory for this purpose. For teacher's salaries we have used as most closely comparable those paid in financial institutions. For cooks we have used salaries and wages paid in hotels and restaurants. The wages paid in agriculture are only available for August 15, 1947 and January 15, 1948. They show the usual seasonal decline between these two periods.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nL.E. Rowebottom,\nStatistician,\nPRICES BRANCH.\nMay 13, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. HOEY\n\nAttached is detailed information regarding each residential school. This was obtained from the Auditors' reports on the schools that are regularly visited by the auditors.\n\nIn conversation with Father Plourde he advised me that the Oblate schools under his jurisdiction have expended an amount of approximately $40,000.00 in purchasing shoes, clothing, etc., from War Assets Corporation. Father Plourde states that if the same amount of goods had been purchased in the ordinary way, the expenditure would have been approximately $200,000.00.\n\nFrom the attached statement you will note that many of the schools have been financially assisted by the church under whose auspices they are operating, either by means of grants or loans. If this assistance had not been received, the deficits would have been much greater.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nPP/MGD\n| Authorized Enrolment | Present P.C. Rate | Proposed P.C.

We hope to be able to advise you further concerning these grants in the near future.\n\nYou will note that considerable increases have been recommended for several of the schools and that the northern schools in particular have been selected for large adjustments.\n\nBased on fourteen schools (excluding Chapleau, Lac La Ronge and Gordon's) our Auditor's statement indicates that your total 1947 expenditures amounted to $399,627.00. We have omitted Lac La Ronge and Gordon's from these figures because they were closed during the 1947 calendar year. Under the new rate you should have an income from these fourteen schools (at authorized enrollment) of $407,702.90. Last year (1947 calendar) the per capita grants paid the M.S.C.C. for these fourteen schools totalled $302,406.00.\n\nIt is realized that one of your problems is the operation of schools with enrolled pupilages less than those authorized. It is our intention to send a circular letter to all our field officials, impressing upon them the importance of assisting actively in the recruiting for residential schools. It is felt that this matter is one for the utmost co-operation between the Departmental and Church officials. We will again remind our field officials of this fact.\n\nYou will note that no reference has been made to the Chapleau Residential School in the above calculations. It is our feeling that this school should be closed at the end of June. We understand that the dollar cost per pupil at this school...\nduring the 1947 year amounted to $339.35.

Cook\nSuperintendent\nAugust 9, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nCHIEF TREASURY OFFICER\n\nAudit Reports - Indian Residential Schools.\n\nIt is noted from your memorandum of July 23 that arrangements have now been completed for future audit reports at the residential schools in the Lesser Slave and Fort Vermilion Agencies.\n\nOur records show that as of May 1948 16 residential schools had apparently never had their accounts audited. Five of these will be subject to audit in future as they are in the Lesser Slave and Fort Vermilion Agencies.\n\nThis leaves the following eleven schools for which we understand audit reports have never been received:\n\nNorthwest Territories:\n- Aklavit R. C.\n- Fort Resolution\n- Providence Mission.\n\nQuebec:\n- Fort George R. C.\n\nOntario:\n- Albany\n- Fort William.\n\nManitoba:\n- Gross Lake.\nSaskatchewan:\n\nBeauval\nGuy\n\nAlberta:\n\nHoly Angels\nYouville.\n\nAll these are Roman Catholic operated institutions and most of them are in isolated locations.\n\nI am writing to Reverend Father Plourde, O.M.I., Oblate Superintendent of Indian Missions, concerning ten of these schools and hope to arrange a meeting with him when he returns to Ottawa.\n\nThe eleventh school (Youville) is one to which we will not be sending Indian children when our Indian day school building programme in that vicinity is completed.\n\nI will advise you as to the outcome of this meeting and will let you know the names of the Bishops who should be contacted concerning these audits.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nAugust 9, 1948.\n\nAudit Reports - Indian Residential Schools.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nOur records show that the following residential schools have never been the subject of an audit report from one of our auditors:\n\nNorthwest Territories:\n- Aklavik R.C.\n- Fort Resolution\n- Providence Mission\n\nQuebec:\n- Fort George R.C.\n\nOntario:\n- Albany\n- Fort William\n\nManitoba:\n- Cross Lake\n\nSaskatchewan:\n- Beauval\n- Guy\n\nAlberta:\n- Holy Angels\n- Youville\n\nIn view of rising living and freight expenses, we are anxious to have such audit reports available.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you could discuss this situation with me when you return to town. I realize that\nthe Fort William and Youville Schools do not fall within your jurisdiction but would like to review conditions at the other nine.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nReverend J. O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\nOttawa University,\nLaurier Avenue East,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n| Province | School Name | Auditor's Report | Period | To Date | Church Grant | Church Loan

The amounts listed under \"Church Grant\" and \"Church Loan\" represent the respective grants and loans provided during those periods.\nOttawa, August 9, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nACTING DEPUTY MINISTER\n\nIncreased Per Capita Grants.\n\nOn May 25, 1948, I sent to Dr. Keenleyside a submission to Treasury Board requesting $128,000.00 in additional funds for the increase of residential school per capita grants. This submission was approved and this sum was included in our Supplementary Estimates for 1948-49.\n\nYou will recall that this amount of $128,000 was arrived at by making adjustments in individual school grants. These adjustments were recommended by the officials of the Education Division and were based on\n\n(a) latest auditors' reports,\n(b) location of school and anticipated effect of increased freight rates,\n(c) availability of farming land at school site,\n(d) personal knowledge of local conditions at various schools.\n\nPlease find attached a statement (Appendix A) on these schools showing the rate of operation as revealed by the latest auditor's reports. You will recall that when we discussed this matter you felt that efforts should be made to get auditor's reports for every school. At that time 16 schools, due to their isolation, had not had auditor's reports.\n\nSince then our Chief Treasury Officer reports that arrangements have been made to carry out audits in future in the\nRoman Catholic Indian Residential Schools in the Lesser Slave and Fort Vermilion Agencies. As soon as Reverend Father Flourde, O.M.I returns to town, a meeting will be held with him to determine the best way of including the eleven other schools (all of which are R.C.) in future audits.\n\nIn the meantime it would be appreciated if we could have your direction as to whether the Minister would consider advising the denominations concerned as to the increases in per capita grants for which funds are now available. You will find attached as Appendix B a statement showing the new per capita grants recommended for each school.\n\nMEMORANDUM TO MR. HOEY:\n\nReferring to our telephone conversation of this afternoon, I am returning the statement marked Appendix \"A\" showing the operation of the Residential Schools as revealed by the latest auditors' reports. Also a statement marked Appendix \"B\" setting out the proposed new per capita grants recommended for each school.\n\nYou will recall that when this matter was last discussed by Colonel Neary and yourself with the Deputy Minister it was agreed that this additional grant was provided for the purpose of assisting only those schools which needed higher grants to cover the cost of operation. It should not be given to schools which were able to meet their expenses from the present grants.\n\nThe proposed new grants as set out in Appendix \"B\" would seem to include a number of schools where there is no evidence to indicate that such additional assistance is needed.\n\nC.W. Jackson,\nDirector, Administration and Personnel.\nOttawa, August 16, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. DOUCET\n\nWould you please have Mr. Track and Mr. Balderston work out the following information required by the Director:\n\n(a) Average cost per pupil in Indian Residential Schools at the present rate of payment.\n\n(b) Average cost per pupil in Indian Residential Schools if new per capitae recommended hereunder are given.\n\n(c) Number of Indian Residential Schools in operation in 1936.\n\n(d) Number of Indian Residential Schools in operation in 1948.\n\n(e) Cost of educating a pupil in the schools of Canada. (Check with Dominion Bureau of Statistics\u2014Dr. Wentworth at 5933).\n\nMr. Hoey requires this information by four o'clock this afternoon.\n\nBernard F.

This submission was approved and this sum was included in our Supplementary Estimates for 1948-49.\n\nYou will recall that this amount of $125,000 was arrived at by making adjustments in individual school grants. These adjustments were recommended by the officials of the Education Division and were based on:\n\n(a) latest auditors' reports,\n(b) location of school and anticipated effect of increased freight rates,\n(c) availability of farming land at school site,\n(d) personal knowledge of local conditions at various schools.\n\nPlease find attached a statement (Appendix A) on these schools showing the rate of operation as revealed by the latest auditor's reports. You will recall that when we discussed this matter you felt that efforts should be made to get auditor's reports for every school, at that time 16 schools, due to their isolation, had not had auditor's reports.\n\nSince then our Chief Treasury Officer reports that arrangements have been made to carry out audits in future in the\nRoman Catholic Indian Residential Schools in the Lesser Slave and Fort Vermilion Agencies. As soon as Reverend Father Plourde, C.M.I., returns to town, a meeting will be held with him to determine the best way of including the eleven other schools (all of which are R.C.) in future audits.\n\nIn the meantime it would be appreciated if we could have your direction as to whether the minister would consider advising the denominations concerned as to the increases in per capita grants for which funds are now available.

This interruption came after a series of 21 consecutive increases dating from January, 1947. The food index fell from 205.4 on October 1 to 204.7 on November 1 as declines in meats and vegetables overbalanced further increases in egg prices; other food groups showed no appreciable changes. The decline in foods exactly balanced small advances in four other budget groups. Home furnishings and services moved up from 165.1 to 166.0, clothing from 181.0 to 181.5, fuel and light from 128.8 to 129.0, and miscellaneous items from 124.4 to 124.6. The rent series is computed at approximately quarterly intervals and the next reckoning of the rent index will be for December 1; the latest figure is 121.6.\n\nFrom August, 1939 to November 1, 1948, the increase in the cost-of-living index was 58.3 per cent.\n\n| Dominion Cost-of-Living Indexes (1935-39=100) |\n|---------------------------------------------|\n| Combined Index | Food | Rent | Fuel and Light | Clothing | Home Furnishings and Services | Miscellaneous |\n| November 1, 1948 | 159.6 | 204.7 | 121.0 | 129.0 | 181.5 | 166.0 | 124.6 |\n| October 1, 1948 | 159.6 | 205.4 | 121.0 | 128.0 | 181.0 | 165.1 | 124.4 |\n| November 1, 1947 | 143.6 | 173.6 | 119.9 | 122.6 | 157.0 | 151.4 | 118.2 |\n\nWHOLESALE PRICES (WEEKLY): The index of Industrial Material Prices advanced from 161.6 (1926=100) for the week ending October 29 to 162.0 for the week ending November 26. Price movements were mixed, with cats, resin, steel sheets, raw cotton and lead showing increases, while steers, hogs, raw rubber and linseed oil declined. The index for Canadian Farm Products fell from 143.2 to 142.6 in the same period. Tobacco, wool, hides and skins moved up, but lower quotations ruled for potatoes, onions, hay, livestock and eggs. Comparable indexes for the third week of August, 1939 were 64.0 and 58.2 respectively.\n\n| Weekly Wholesale Price Indexes, 1926=100 |\n|-----------------------------------------|\n| Week ended - | Monthly Average |\n| Oct. 29th | Nov. 5th | Nov. 12th | Nov. 19th | Nov. 26th | Nov. 1948 | Oct. 1948 | Nov. 1947 |\n| Industrial Materials | 161.6 | 161.9 | 161.9 | 162.4 | 162.0 | 162.1 | 162.0 | 143.2 |\n| Canadian Farm Products | 143.2 | 143.1 | 142.4 | 143.2 | 142.6 | 142.0 | 143.2 | 132.6 |\nSECURITIES: The October rally in common stock prices continued into the first week of November but thereafter prices generally registered a declining tendency. The Investors' index for 100 common stocks, which rose from 117.5 for the week of October 28 to 120.5 for the week of November 4, receded to 116.2 for the week of November 25. Weakness was evident in both industrials and utilities, an index for the former series declining 1.5 points to 111.5 and for the latter 2.1 points to 120.5. Bank shares, on the other hand, were slightly firmer during November, an index for this group registering an increase of 2.6 points to 132.0 between the weeks of October 28 and November 25. Mining stock price movements paralleled industrials and utilities and the composite index for 30 issues, after touching 86.7 in the first week of November, dropped back to 80.7 by the 25th for a net loss of 2.3 points. The gold shares index weakened 3.7 points to 58.2, while the base metals index stiffened 0.8 points to 126.5.\n\n| Weekly Security Price Indexes, 1935-39=100 |\n|-------------------------------------------|\n|                                           | Week ended - | Monthly Average |\n|                                           | Oct. 28th    | Nov. 4th      | Nov. 10th     | Nov. 18th     | Nov. 25th     | Nov. 1948 | Oct. 1948 | Nov. 1947 |\n| INVESTORS' PRICE INDEX                    |              |               |               |               |               |           |           |           |\n| (100 Common Stocks)                      | 117.5        | 120.5         | 116.8         | 117.8         | 116.2         | 117.8      | 116.4     | 107.3     |\n| 76 Industrials                           | 113.0        | 116.4         | 112.5         | 113.6         | 111.5         | 113.5      | 111.6     | 101.0     |\n| 16 Utilities                             | 122.6        | 124.2         | 120.1         | 120.5         | 120.5         | 121.3      | 123.2     | 114.7     |\n| 8 Banks                                  | 130.3        | 132.7         | 132.0         | 132.6         | 132.9         | 132.6      | 128.4     | 135.0     |\n| MINING STOCK PRICE INDEX                 |              |               |               |               |               |           |           |           |\n| (50 Stocks)                              | 83.0         | 86.7          | 82.1          | 81.4          | 80.7          | 82.7       | 82.5      | 89.9      |\n| 25 Golds                                 | 61.9         | 63.7          | 60.8          | 59.2          | 58.2          | 60.5       | 62.2      | 79.5      |\n| 5 Base Metals                            | 125.7        | 133.2         | 125.2         | 126.7         | 126.5         | 127.9      | 123.4     | 108.4     |\n| DOMINION OF CANADA LONG-TERM BONDS - YIELD INDEX | 96.0 | 96.0 | 95.7 | 95.4 | 95.7 | 95.7 | 96.3 | 84.4 |\n\nIndian Affairs.

We have now received his reply which reads as follows:\n\n\"In reply to your request of October 22 we have calculated an index on the cost of maintaining residential schools as between April 1 and October 1, 1946, on the basis of calculation similar to the type used in determining the increase between October, 1947 and April, 1948.

Based on the latest auditors' reports available, the following list shows how the average residential school dollar is spent:\n\n| Item                          | 1947 | 1948 |\n|-------------------------------|------|------|\n| Food, Farm and Garden Expenses| 34\u00a2  | (36\u00a2)|\n| Fuel, Light and Water         | 10   | (09 )|\n| Clothing                      | 08   | (08 )|\n| Salaries                      | 30   | (30 )|\n| House Expenses, Freight and Sundries | 18 | (17 )|\n\n$1.00 $1.00\n\nThe figures in brackets indicate those used in your former calculations.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you could calculate a similar index on the cost of maintaining residential schools as between April 1 and October 1, 1948.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of November 29 giving us a new expenditure breakdown of the Indian residential school dollar.\n\nBased on this revised information we have prepared an index on the cost of maintaining residential schools between April 1 and October 1, 1948. The increase in costs has been established as 5.9%. The breakdown of this total index is as follows:\n\n| Groups                  | Percentage Change Between April and October, 1948 |\n|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| Foods                   | +10.0                                             |\n| Fuel and Light          | +6.2                                              |\n| Clothing                | +4.7                                              |\n| Salaries                | +3.8                                              |\n| Household Expenses      | +2.0                                              |\n\nI wish to draw to your attention a typographical error in our letter of November 1.

Rowebottom,\nStatistician,\nPRICES BRANCH.\nOttawa, January 5, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nAdjustments in Individual Residential School Per Capita Grants.\n\nAs decided in a recent conference in your office on per capita grants, we are carefully reviewing all residential school audit reports received here. I would recommend the following cases for increases for consideration by the Minister:\n\nKaskoose Residential School (R.C.)\n\nThis is our largest school with a pupilage of 306. Unfortunately, the last audit available until recently was made in October, 1946. The new audit report has been received and shows the following:\n\nPresent Per Capita (effective 1 January, 1948) ..... $239.85\nAuditor's Report Cost per pupil per year\n(1 October, 1946, to 30 September, 1948) ...... 220.52\nDeficit ........................................... $2,263.19\n\nUnfortunately, the auditor's statement of cost per pupil per year covers a 24 month period and does not reveal the present cost of feeding and clothing the children.\n\nIn a letter of December 13, the Principal of the School states as follows:\n\n\"With reference to the recent audited statement of this School, I wish to advise that in computing the deficit the outstanding account of $1,968.85 for rental and grading fees for the year 1947-48 only was taken into consideration.\"\nA further outstanding account of $2000.00 for the current year, which is due and payable, was overlooked by mistake. The deficit should be computed as follows:\n\n| Description               | Amount   |\n|---------------------------|----------|\n| Current                   | $2263.19 |\n| Borrowed Loan             | 3000.00  |\n| Rental & Grazing fees     |          |\n| 1947-48                   | 1968.85  |\n| Rental & Grazing fees     |          |\n| 1948-1949                 | 2000.00  |\n\n$9232.04\n\n\"In arriving at a new per capita grant for this School I would appreciate having the above figures taken into consideration.\"\n\nIn view of the above I would recommend that the present rate of $239.85 be increased by an amount of $15.15 per pupil to total $255.00 effective 1 January, 1948. The nearest school to Kamloops is St. George's (C.E.) at Lytton, B.C., now receiving $257.00 per pupil.\n\nShubenacadie Residential School (R.C.)\n\nThis school has an authorized pupilage of 160. The latest audit report shows the cost per pupil for the period 1 August, 1947, to 31 July, 1948, was $239.85. The present per capita rate effective 1 January, 1948, is $210.00.\n\nAs you are personally aware, this school is operated directly by the branch and does not come under the Oblate Marist or Jesuit Orders as is the case with our other R.C. schools. It has therefore no financial backing other than the per capita grant of the Department. Therefore I would recommend an increase in grant to $265.00 effective 1 January, 1948.\n\nFort George (R.C.) Residential School.\n\nThe first audit report on this school has just been received and covers the period 1 September, 1947, to 31 August, 1948. As you are probably aware, this is a church-owned school with 8 Indian, 9 Eskimo and 6 white pupils in attendance. The cost per pupil per year is shown by the auditor to be $824.85. However, in making his\nreport the auditor states that some of the factors for this very high cost per pupil are:\n\n(a) The very low average attendance (16.85 pupils).\n\n(b) Materials purchased for building and repairs amounted to $323.28 per pupil per year. Building supplies to the amount of $1519.57 were on hand as inventory. A large stock of food was also on hand.\n\n(c) Construction during the period under review included a laundry house, a baking house, foundation for the school and some work on the chapel.\n\nTherefore it is recommended that the per capita rate at this school be set at the same as that allowed the Fort George C.E. Residential School, namely $511.00 per pupil, effective 1 January, 1948. The present rate is $310.05.\n\nAlbany Residential School (H.C.)\n\nThe first audit report on this school has also been received and covers the period September 1, 1947, to August 31, 1948. It shows 75 pupils in attendance with an average of 62.2. The cost per pupil per year is $430.17. The present per capita rate is $310.05.\n\nI would recommend that the new rate for this school be set at $411.00 which is the same amount allowed the Moose Factory C.E. Residential School. Unfortunately, the auditor was unable to isolate all costs in connection with this school as a small hospital is also operated in the same building by some of the same staff. I feel that the recommended rate of $411.00 would therefore be fair and reasonable.\n\nAlert Bay Residential School (C.E.)\n\nWe have received strong representations with regard to increasing the per capita rate at this school. We are now paying a grant of $251.55 and the last audit report dated December 31, 1947, indicated an operating cost per pupil of $230.35. However, this was under the former Principal, who has now been replaced and our inspector's reports indicate that a much higher standard of clothing and food is now being provided. This inadequate food and clothing was the cause of much dissension under the former principal and it has undoubtedly\ncaused the M.S.C.C. a considerable expenditure to have conditions remedied. I would therefore recommend that the new rate for this school be set at $255.00, effective 1 January, 1948.\n\nAs other auditors' reports are received, similar recommendations will be passed for your consideration. To summarize therefore, I would recommend that you authorize payment of the following per capita grants effective 1 January, 1948:\n\n| School            | Present Rate | Recommended Rate |\n|-------------------|--------------|------------------|\n| Kamloops (B.C.)   | $239.85      | $255.00          |\n| Shubenacadie (N.S.) | $240.00     | $265.00          |\n| Fort George R.C.

Another letter was sent to the Dominion Bureau of Statistics and a reply was received from them on December 14, 1948 (flag 2).\n\nAnother memorandum was sent to the Deputy Minister on February 12, 1949 (flag 3). No decision was made and we again wrote to the Dominion Bureau of Statistics bringing the revised figure up to March 8, 1949.\n\nOn March 19, a further memorandum was sent to Dr. Keenleyside (flag 4) and finally a decision was reached to include a sum in the 1949/50 Supplementary Estimates.\n\nYou will recall that we then prepared a new statement of proposed grants and that this matter was discussed with Mr. Jackson in May.\n\nApproval was given by the Minister for the new rates and the Churches were informed in August, 1949.\n\nWhat I believe Canon Cook to be requesting is an increase covering the change in the cost-of-living index between January 1949 and February 1950.\n\nBernard F. Heary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nAugust 8, 1950.\n\nColonel B.F. Neary  \nSupt. Indian Education  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDept. Citizenship & Immigration  \nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nCost of Living Index and Per Capita Grants\n\nDuring the past few months we have drawn attention several times to the increasing cost-of-living indexes as published in the OFFICIAL DOMINION GOVERNMENT publications - the releases of the Dominion Bureau of Statistics in their monthly Price Movements Circulars - and have pointed out the difficulty of operating residential schools on Per Capita grants established with effect from 1st April, 1948.\n\nThe latest of the above-mentioned circulars, released on 4th August, 1950, indicates clearly the enormous difficulty of even trying to operate these schools to a reasonable standard of feeding, clothing and general care of the children, as will be seen from the following figures:\n\n| Cost of Living Indexes | Combined | Food | Fuel & Light | Clothing | House |\n|------------------------|----------|------|--------------|----------|-------|\n| 1st April, 1948        | 151.6    | 186.8| 121.3        | 172.9    | 161.9 |\n| 3rd July, 1950         | 167.5    | 214.3| 137.7        | 180.7    | 166.9 |\n| Point increase         | 15.9     | 27.5 | 16.4         | 7.8      | 5.0   |\n| Percentage increase    | 10.5     | 14.7 | 13.5         | 4.5      | 3.1   |\n\np.t.o.\nScotia School\n\n(1) Rate from January 1, 1943 - $165\n(2) Special Grant allowed Jan. 1, 1943 - $15\n    (Cash Loan No. 101377 Feb. 18, 1944)\n    (Emergency Grant - Jan. 1944)\n    (Total Amount $165)\n    (Date 2/1/44)\n    (35.70)\n(3) Increase authorized by R.O. 86/666 Oct. 20, 1948\n    (Date 10/20/48)\n    (5.30)\n(4) Adjustment Letter - Jan. 1, 1948\n    (Amount $165)\n    (Date 1/1/48)\n    (5.30)\n(5) Further Adjustment April 1, 1948\n    (Amount $165)\n    (Date 4/1/48)\n    (Present Rate)\n    (267.00)\n\n$13.35\n#280.36\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nCLOSED FILE\n\nFILE NUMBER 1-1-3 VOLUME 2\n\nSUBJECT GENERAL\n\nPAYMENT OF SALARIES AND GRANTS\n\nCORRESPONDENCE FROM\n\nTO\n\nNO FURTHER CORRESPONDENCE\nTO BE PLACED ON THIS FILE\n\nNOTE: For subsequent correspondence relevant to the subject matter of this closed file see\n\nFILE ........................................

We asked for your valued opinion of this book as an educational medium. May we have your reply? Your criticisms and suggestions will be of value to us in planning future editions.\n\nYou will be interested to know that the Department of Lands and Mines, New Brunswick, have ordered 4,000 copies of this book, to be placed in the school classrooms of that Province. The Department of Lands and Forests, Nova Scotia, purchased 3,500 copies for the same purpose. Hundreds of schools, inspectors, and others interested in the preservation and wise use of our natural resources, have also purchased copies of CONSERVATION ILLUSTRATED. Of the 10,000 copies of this edition printed a few months ago, only 1,300 copies remain in stock!\n\nIf your Branch is in a position to purchase copies of this important book for the schools under your jurisdiction, we feel sure that the influence it exerts will be of the greatest benefit. Remember, 25 or more copies cost only 75\u00a2 each! Surely a very modest price for such an informative and authoritative publication!\n\nWhether or not copies can at present be purchased, we should be pleased to hear from you. Your opinion of CONSERVATION ILLUSTRATED is important to us.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nA.R. Whittemore\n\nA. R. Whittemore.\nOTTAWA, January 6, 1947.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nHerewith I am returning to you your copy of \"Conservation Illustrated\". I have looked it over carefully and have discussed it with other members of this Division. It deals with a subject of very great importance, it is written in lucid style by competent and well-known authorities, and it is attractively and effectively illustrated. I think that it is both suitable and desirable for use in Canadian schools for either Indians or whites. It will be most useful in the hands of teachers who already have a good grounding in its subject-matter.\n\nEncl. Sincerely yours,\n\nHarrison F. Lewis\nSuperintendent of Wildlife Protection.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n7/11/46\n\nCol. Neary,\n\nWould this be useful in Indian Schools?\n\nAndrew Moore\nSeptember 23rd, 1946.\n\nDr. A. Moore\nSecondary School Inspector\n187 Queenston St.\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Dr. Moore:\n\nWe are proud to submit for your examination a copy of CONSERVATION ILLUSTRATED, second edition.\n\nEducational authorities have long realized the pressing need for a more enlightened public attitude toward Canadian soil, water, forests, Grasslands and wildlife. As publishers of CANADIAN NATURE, with a deep feeling of responsibility toward nature education in the Dominion, we also have a strong desire for greater popular interest in the restoration and intelligent use of our natural resources.\n\nCONSERVATION ILLUSTRATED is our answer to this need.\n\nPrepared with the collaboration of government officials, educators and conservationists, it is so comprehensive and authoritative that it may be used with complete confidence in the elementary and secondary schools of Canada. As well as a clear, vigorous and direct treatment of conservation in its many phases, it contains teaching suggestions, review questions and pupil activities. The subject matter has been organized with a particular view toward classroom use, and the many excellent pictures are designed to convey the basic principles of conservation in concrete visual form. We have tried to make CONSERVATION ILLUSTRATED so comprehensive that it will be unnecessary to look elsewhere for source material.\n\nWhat is your opinion of CONSERVATION ILLUSTRATED as a teaching aid? We are anxious to know your reaction to this handbook and to receive your suggestions for improvement of future editions. Will you be so kind as to fill in and return to us the section provided for your comments at the end of this letter?\n\nIf, after reading it through, you consider CONSERVATION ILLUSTRATED to be an important source book, we urge that you bring it to the attention of your teachers in your next bulletin, and encourage them to order it for their school or classroom libraries. Such an investment can only have the highest returns. Conservation is nature study carried through to its logical end. It is sound, practical and economically beneficial. It begins with an attitude of mind which should be acquired by every child before leaving school.\nOn the back page of the enclosed folder you will find a thumbnail sketch of CONSERVATION ILLUSTRATED which may be helpful to you in describing the book in your bulletin to teachers. Should you wish additional copies of this folder to distribute to your teachers, kindly let us know the quantity required and we shall be pleased to supply them immediately.\n\nWe look forward to hearing your valued comments on CONSERVATION ILLUSTRATED, second edition.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nA.

These four workbooks are, as you know, adaptations of the corresponding ones in the JOLLY NUMBER Series. It may be that the CARIBOUS will prove even more suitable in the Indian schools.\n\nI am also mailing to you the pupil's texts for LIVING ARITHMETIC. These, you will note, have been revised and bear the 1947 copyright date. Accompanying pupil's workbooks and teacher's manuals are in preparation, and these will be available in a short while. You will be interested to know that the Grade Three text is now being adapted to include Canadian usage. The rest of the books will be similarly adapted within the next year or two, and I think you will agree that this will provide the most up-to-date Canadian arithmetic series available.\n\nYou will be particularly interested, I think, in the sample copy I am sending you of HERE COME DAVID AND ANN. This is the Wall Chart or Big Book which accompanies HERE WE COME, which, in turn, is the introductory pre-primer to the Faith and Freedom Basic Readers.

Lynde, Professor of Physics and Household Engineering, Teachers College, Columbia University. Formerly of McGill University, Montreal.\n\nThis book, the first of a series, illustrates, describes and carefully explains two hundred experiments that can be performed with equipment available in the home - such as chairs and tables, milk bottles, hairpins, coffee cans, paper bags, marbles, rubber sink stoppers, etc. All of the experiments are excellently conceived. They are simple, to the point and sufficiently explained by directions and illustrations.\n\nCONTENTS: 1. Atmospheric Pressure. 2. Flying. 3. Air Streams. 4. Water Wheels and Turbines. 5. Buoyance of Liquids. 6. Water Pressure and Air Pressure. 7. Compressed and Expanding Air. 8. Compressed Gas. 9. Liquid Surfaces. 10. Other Properties of Water. 11. Balance. 12. Experiences with Your Body. 13. Inertia. 14. Marbles. 15. Scientific Toys. 16. Heat. Explanations. Index.\n\nPRICE, $1.75\nSCIENCE EXPERIENCES WITH INEXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT\n\nBy Carleton J. Lynde\n\nThis is the second book of the series by Professor Lynde, which describes and explains two hundred new Science Experiences, and leads the pupil many steps farther along the way of elementary experimentation. The first eighty-five of these experiences require only home equipment, while for the remaining one hundred and fifteen, simple and inexpensive equipment is needed.\n\nCONTENTS: 1. Baseball Curves and the Like. 2. Centrifugal Force. 3. Other Mechanical Principles. 4. Gases. 5. Liquids. 6. Heat 7. Water Pressure. 8. Atmospheric Pressure. 9. Siphons. 10.

Scott, Provincial Normal School, Calgary, Alta.\n\nWith Maps and Line Drawings by Lloyd Scott and Kathleen Mair.\n\nIn the pages of this new book, History, Geography, and Science meet to unfold the romantic story of the Canadian prairie lands for pupils of Grades V and VI.\n\nIt will be found equally useful whether the enterprise is the adopted technique or the traditional approach is still in use.\n\nThe following are among its outstanding features-\n\n1. All material used was carefully tested with Grade V classes for interest, language difficulty and general suitability before it assumed final form. The word count is well within the bounds set by standard authorities for the grades in question.\n\n2. The integration of history, geography and science broadens the basis of the content and leads the pupil to a more complete appreciation of life in our prairie lands both past and present.\n\n3. Varied and stimulating activities are suggested at the end of each chapter.\n\n4. Black and white sketch maps enable the pupil to fix the location of all features of the area as the story proceeds. Simplicity is the keynote of these maps which are specially drawn for use by children of 10 or 11 years of age.\n\n5. Every illustration has definite value as a teaching device. The line drawings are the outcome of careful research on the part of the artist. They are authentic. In addition over eighty half-tone reproductions are used.\n\nPrice $1.75\n\n(Note: New Price, July 1, 1945- $1.35)\nTsartlip Indian Day School  \nFebruary 14, 1947\n\nDear Mr Neary,\n\nI regret the inconvenience which my mistake must have caused you.

It is being replaced in Grades One, Two and Three by the Basic Readers of the Curriculum Foundation Series (Publishers: W. J. Gage & Company, Toronto).\n\nRealizing the above, we have been, this year, replacing the Highroads Readers in Grades One and Two with the Basic Readers. It is our intention, next year, to replace the Grade Three Highroads Reader with the Grade Three Basic Reader, which is entitled \"Streets and Roads\".\n\nIt is understood that your stock of Grade Three Highroads Readers is now depleted, and rather than re-stock with Treasury Readers, which is also outmoded, it has been decided to start issuing the Basic Readers for Grade Three.\n\nTherefore, would you kindly arrange to stock the following quantities of Grade three texts in the Basic Readers:\n\n- 200 copies - Streets and Roads (Book Three),\n- 200 Think-and-Do Book for Streets and Roads (Book Three) (Workbook),\n- 50 Guide-Book to Third Grade Programme.\n\nThe Provincial Departments of Education have not, as yet, decided on the Series which will replace the Highroads Series in Grades Four to Six. Therefore, we will have to continue to substitute the Treasury Readers in these Grades.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nMr. J. W.

This mailing list is the only existing copy and it is requested that it be returned to Mr. Neary or to this office where we will ensure that Mr. Neary receives the list again.\n\nYour ready co-operation in the distribution of the books is sincerely appreciated by Mr. Neary and the undersigned.\n\nH.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nFebruary 20th, 1947.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nI am in receipt of a communication from the United Church authorities in the Montreal Conference, drawing my attention to a book, \"Think-and-Do to accompany: Our New Friends,\" which is one of the Cathedral Basic Readers, and which I am advised has been sent for use in Indian Schools conducted under Protestant auspices - that is The United Church of Canada - in the Province of Quebec.\n\nI want to say, first of all, that this is a very fine book but that it has in it certain passages which seem to me to be out of place, in their present form, in a school conducted under Protestant auspices to which children of that faith are sent. I should particularly draw your attention to p. 9. You will, I know, not misunderstand me when I say that such instruction should not be given to children in our schools -- not that we have any objection to children of the Roman Catholic faith going to mass; but simply that we feel that, if instruction is to be given to children concerning the forms in which the religious faith of their fathers finds expression, it should be given in that form and not in the form of another Church.\n\nI feel that the circulation of these books in schools conducted under Protestant auspices is an error which needs only to be mentioned to be corrected by the withdrawal of the books from these schools.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nOttawa, February 25th, 1947.\n\nDear Dr. Dorey:\n\nWe have your letter of the 20th inst., with reference to certain books supplied to one of the schools conducted under the auspices of the United Church of Canada.\n\nPrevious to receipt of your letter we had a similar complaint from another school and upon investigating the matter it was found that the mistake was made by the shipper in the Department of Public Printing and Stationery.\n\nThere are two series of books, \"Our New Friends\" with a blue cover is intended for non-Catholic schools. \"Our New Friends - Cathedral Basic Series\" with a green cover is intended for Catholic schools. The shipper apparently did not understand the difference.\n\nWe regret very much that this mistake occurred which was unintentional on our part. While you do not mention the school conducted under your auspices to which the wrong series of books was sent, we are under the impression that it was the Oka Country School and we are writing to the teacher to return the books which she has received and arranging to supply the proper series.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBernard F.

We have recently received samples of a crayon manufactured by the Canada Crayon Company, Limited, Lindsay, Ont.\n\nAs the children in the lower grades of our schools do not appreciate the value of a more expensive crayon, it is felt inadvisable to supply them with Reeves' crayons in future. Therefore, would you please arrange to stock ten (10) cases No. 28-5 Peacock crayons. We have received the following quotation from the Canada Crayon Company for this particular brand:\n\nNo. 28-5 Peacock crayons $20.00 per 5 gross case.\n\nIt is understood that this price is F.O.B. Lindsay, tax extra.\n\nThe blackboard chalks which you have been providing for our schools from this particular Company have proven very satisfactory and it is felt that these crayons will prove just as satisfactory.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard P.

This has been more seriously aggravated since the Department has been providing the Basic Reader Series for use in Protestant schools. As you are probably aware, this latter Series contains many teaching aids that are valuable for use with Indian children.\n\nWe have decided, therefore, to select a few Indian day and residential schools, as hereunder, to test two series of Catholic texts:\n\nQu'Appelle Indian Residential School, Lebret, Sask.,\nSt. Mary's Mission Residential School, Mission, B.C.,\nSandy Bay Residential School, Marius, Man.,\nKamloops Residential School, Kamloops, B.C.,\nSt. Catherine's Indian Day School, Duncan, B.C.,\n\nIt is our intention to provide each of the above five schools with ten copies of each of the texts in Grades One and Two of the following Series:\n\nNo. 1 - Faith and Freedom (Published by Ginn & Company),\nNo. 2 - Cathedral Basic Readers (Published by Gage & Company).\n\nWe would like to point out the following features in these two Series for your consideration:\n\nMost Reverend A. Jordan, D.D.,\nBishop of Prince Rupert,\nPrince Rupert, British Columbia.\nSent to the following:\n\nQu'Appelle Rec.\nSt. Mary's Mission\nSandy Bay\nKamloops\nSt. Catherine's\n\nArchbishop W.M. Duke\nBishop Jordan\nFather Plourde\nMr. J.W. McKinnon (NWT & Y.)\nMr. Davey (Inspector of Schools)\nThis Series has been especially designed for use in Catholic schools by the Commission on American Citizenship of The Catholic University of America. The material of all the books centers around the social-religious life of the child in the home, neighbourhood, local community and nation. It provides him not only with interesting experiences similar to those which he himself has had but also with the types of conduct most in harmony with the teaching of faith and the ideals of the Christian life.\n\nCATHEDRAL BASIC READERS.\n\nThis Series is an adaptation for use in Catholic schools of the Basic Readers, as already being provided to our Protestant Schools. This adaptation has been carried out, with ecclesiastical approval, by the Reverend Father J.A. O'Brien, of the University of Notre Dame.\n\nAs you are aware from Volume I of Indian School Bulletin the Basic Reader Series has been widely accepted throughout provincial schools as being most satisfactory.\n\nThe Department, therefore, wishes to have an expression of opinion from the Principals and Teachers of the above five schools as to which of these two Series should be supplied throughout our schools in Canada.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would select two groups of students within your school and use these texts with them in a controlled experiment; then report your findings and recommendations to the Department as soon as possible after June 30th, 1947.\n\nIt is not our intention at present to replace the Corona Series in Grades Three and upwards.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Public Printing & Stationery,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMr. Bernard F. Neary:\n\nP.S.\n\n(Pardon us for putting our Post Script first, but we think it perhaps more important than anything else we have said.)\n\nPresumably you are a busy man.\nWe suggest that you submit to us a statement of your requirements and permit us to make recommendations with some knowledge of what your needs actually are.\nWe have the necessary experience to advise you intelligently, and the necessary integrity to do so honestly.\nGiven the necessary information to work on, we will be pleased to advise you to the best of our ability. No obligation, of course.\nAfter all, we are trying to be of service, not merely trying to sell you something which may or may not meet your needs.\n\nTo do this properly we would require to know in some detail:\nNumber & Classification of schools for which you wish to provide;\nNo. of Ungraded Schools; Approximate Average of Pupils in each;\nGraded Schools; Grades in each;\nAmount of money you wish to spend, per pupil, or per grade or per school as the case may be.\nApproximate percentage of inexperienced teachers. (We have some items which only experienced teachers could handle properly, some unsuited to ungraded schools, etc.)\nAny other information you might think pertinent\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nW.E.L.\nMarch 31, 1947.\n\nMr. Bernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThank you kindly for your enquiry of March 28. Under separate cover we are sending you samples as requested. The following pages will give you some details concerning the lines we handle.\n\nThe prices quoted to you are those quoted to Departments of Education, and are considerably lower than our regular prices to the individual teacher.\n\nPermit us to add that we have a profound interest in education (as well as over twenty years experience), and we are attempting to provide a service which we feel will benefit both the over-worked teacher and the pupils in her care. In these times when so many teachers lack experience, there is a particular need for the type of material which we have available. Please note that many of the items listed not only provide work for the advancement of the pupil, but also tell the teacher how to make the best use of it.\n\nSince we have such a large number of items, we do not as yet carry a large stock of any one, and orders of any size should allow us approximately 30 days for delivery.\n\nPrices quoted are F.B.H. Toronto.\n\nRe Terms: Please advise what you consider reasonable. (We are presuming goods would be shipped to Ottawa for distribution by your office under frank. We could handle distribution, of course, at the prices quoted plus postage & handling.)\n\nWe will cheerfully provide any further information which you may require, and will send additional samples on request.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nWEL/ho\n\nPresident.\nHECTOGRAPH WORK BOOKS:\n\nThe Duplicopy folder attached is self-explanatory. Prices on these items, to your Department, are as in the folder. (Our regular prices to the individual teacher add 25\u00a2 to each price.)\n\nMorgan-Dillon folders are temporarily out, but we have written for a further supply and will send you one as soon as we receive them. The mimeographed list (also attached) lists Morgan-Dillon books only. Prices to your Department are 25\u00a2 less than those listed.\n\nThis line numbers 40 books in all and includes, in addition to those listed:\n\n- Pioneer Days........................................... $1.00\n- Over Land & Sea (Beginning Geography)............. $1.00\n- England-Scotland-Wales............................... $1.00\n  (Geography-History--Literature-combination)\n- Sweden-Norway-Denmark............................... $1.00\n- x My Health Book (Intermediate Grades)............ $1.25\n- x My Eskimo Book (Intermediate Grades)............ $1.25\n- My Flower Book...................................... 40 pages $1.25\n- Reading Work Book for Grade 3...................... $1.25\n- Elementary Steps in Multiplication & Div........... $1.25\n- Third Grade Arithmetic.............................. $1.25\n- Fourth Grade Reading............................... $1.25\n- Water Life Miracles................................. $1.00\n- Language Drill (Various grades) each book........ $1.25\n- First Lessons in Written Language.................. $1.25\n- Birds & Flowers..................................... $1.00\n- Common Birds & Garden Flowers...................... $1.25\n  (and others)\n\nx.

Samples have been sent.\n\nThis is a very recent acquisition with us, and while we have the entire line available less one title, we have not yet been advised which title is not available. At a rough guess, it is most likely to be one of the Primary Reading items.\n\nPrices on STECK items: the retail price as listed on the attached folder, plus 25\u00a2.

Personally, we do not think that this type of material would serve your purposes because of the amount of handling that it would entail; but the teachers who have used it, from Nova Scotia to British Columbia, keep coming back for more.

Resignation of Dr. Camsell as Commissioner of the Northwest Territories -\n\nCouncil unanimously adopted the following resolution:\n\nResolved,\n\nThat the Northwest Territories Council records its profound regret that Dr. Charles Camsell has resigned as Commissioner of the Northwest Territories.\n\nIn the twenty-six years that Dr. Camsell has served on the Council and particularly during his more than ten years as Commissioner, he has made an outstanding contribution not only to public knowledge of the resources of the Northwest Territories but to their development as well. It was indeed fitting that he should play such a prominent part in the affairs of the land of his birth.\n\nHis Majesty the King and learned societies in Canada and other lands have honoured his distinguished efforts and ability.\n\nThe members of this Council join in paying tribute to their retiring colleague with the heartfelt wish that he may long enjoy\nwith health and contentment the fruits of his years of high achievement in the service of his country.\n\n4. Roads -\n\n(i) Giant-Yellowknife Road\n\nThe Chairman explained that a certain sum was provided by the Northwest Territories Administration for the construction of this road and the Giant Yellowknife Gold Mines Limited did the work. The Minister and he saw the road and found it far superior to anything that had been expected. There is a balance of $14,011.24 to be paid and the company have requested that the Administration pay half - $7,005.62. The company makes no charge for that part of the road (about one mile) between its shafts. A motion was passed to the effect that $7,005.62 be paid from the Liquor Fund.\n\n5. Radio -\n\n(i) Canadian Pacific Air Lines Ltd.\n\n(a) 50-watt radio station at campsite of Discovery Gold Mines, Gingue Lake, N.W.T.\n\nApproved.\n\n6.

Travelling expenses of Rev. Maurice Flint\n\nre preparation of Eskimo Grammar -\n\nThe Secretary explained that it had been decided to translate and publish a certain amount of literature in Eskimo syllabics. In addition to that Dr. Pack's Eskimo Grammar was revised and put in more modern form by Rev. Maurice Flint of Toronto who is an expert on the Eskimo language. It has been agreed to publish this in mimeographed form. This would be largely for white people to learn Eskimo. There is also an Eskimo lesson book prepared largely from data from Greenland to enable Eskimo children to learn English. Twenty-two pamphlets for the education of Eskimo will be completed in the syllabic. Mr. Flint is translating these for the Administration. He came to Ottawa about the grammar and about the other work and has submitted travelling expense accounts. It was agreed that they should be paid.\n\nConsideration is also being given to paying Mr. Flint for the time he devotes to this translation work. It was explained that Mr. Flint is doing this work because he offered to do it and is very able. The Roman Catholic authorities who have a slightly different type of syllabics, have been told that if they want to go ahead with similar work they will receive the same consideration and treatment as Mr. Flint. A discussion followed regarding the honorarium to be paid Mr. Flint for his work on all these publications. It was agreed that a fair honorarium should be paid but the amount was not fixed. Stand.\n\n8. Legislation -\n\n(i) Amendment to the Ordinance to Prevent the Pollution of Running Streams\n\nThe Chairman explained that when Dr. Hayward was Medical Health\nOfficer at Aklovik he reported on the 14th January, 1946, that the police were having difficulty in enforcing his order to the owners of the local hotel in regard to dumping garbage and night soil into the river. It was doubtful whether they had the authority to enforce this order.\n\nOn the 19th February, 1946, the departmental solicitor advised that the Ordinance to Prevent the Pollution of Running Streams should be amended to give the medical health officer the necessary authority. The final draft of the proposed amendment gives the Medical Health Officer authority to issue such orders as he considers necessary. The amendment was approved in principle.\n\n9. Education (Mackenzie District) -\n\n(i) Verbal report of Mr. McKimmon,\nSchool Inspector\n\nThe Chairman explained that it had been decided to do something about the matter of improving educational facilities in the Northwest Territories and the Administration succeeded in recruiting as School Inspector on its staff a man who has all the qualifications necessary for the job. The settlement of Yellowknife has been offered $150,000 to put in a school of opportunity and that will be one of Mr. McKimmon's first charges. He has an individual problem in each settlement, no two exactly alike, and in every case he will work with the Indian Affairs Branch to bring into existence whatever improvement is possible within the limits of the budget for that locality. It was thought that after his first trip to the Mackenzie District and the limited opportunities which he has had to observe conditions, it would be well to hear Mr. McKimmon's impressions on what he found there and his suggestions in a broad way as to what steps might be taken. In due course he will present a report which will be studied by Council but in the meantime the budget must be prepared as, in order to accomplish anything in the Northwest Territories, everything has to be started well in advance.\n\nMr. McKimmon said he appreciated very much the opportunity of meeting the members of Council. On August 10 he reached the Northwest Territories and spent two months investigating educational conditions in the north. He visited the tents of the natives along the Mackenzie River as far as Aklovik and one of the questions he asked was, \"Did your wife attend a school?\" He noticed that in every case where the mother had attended a school, conditions were much superior to those in settlements where the people had received no education. Mr. McKimmon was firmly convinced of the good effect of education in the life of the natives. He noticed that in many of the schools there was very little equipment and practically no library facilities; that the certification of teachers ranged from Grade VII standing to First Class. In other words, one of the things that impressed him was the lack of uniformity. He noticed that some of the schools used Canadian Readers which were in use thirty years ago; the Alberta curriculum is used in some schools and none at all in others.\n\nMr. McKimmon recommended that an Office of Education be set up where education would be co-ordinated and unified; that a grant of $7 per pupil be paid; that a salary of $1,500 per teacher be provided as this is the salary paid by Indian Affairs Branch throughout Canada; that $50 per class room be provided as a library grant; that a radio be provided for each class room; that a film library be set up, and that a qualified educationist be appointed as his assistant. The estimated pupilage of the Mackenzie District would be 2,000 children of school age and it is absolutely impossible for one man to attempt to give the services which are required at the present time.\n\nConsiderable progress has been made at Fort Norman, Fort Rae, and Hay River on an agreement made between the Northwest Territories Administration and Indian Affairs Branch. Plans have been made to open three temporary schools until the situation is clarified and it is known just what will be needed in various areas. The arrangement is that Indian Affairs will pay the\nteachers' salaries and pay for textbooks, desks, and equipment; the cost will be taken on a pro rata basis between Indian Affairs Branch and the Northwest Territories Administration. There were some 70 children of school age at Fort Norman and the residents were very anxious for some type of education. The older boys and girls mentioned the idea of adult education and asked if classes could be given in the evenings. At Fort Rae the residents submitted a petition requesting a school. They plan to have a temporary school but the School Inspector would advocate this only as a temporary measure. A residential school will be needed ultimately.\n\nHe was convinced the schools at Fort Norman and Rae must be residential schools in the future because the Indians and Eskimos are both nomadic and that is the only way educational facilities could be provided for them. These views are endorsed by Bishop Trocillier, Bishop Fleming, and the residents in these various areas. There is also some talk of Fort Rae becoming a port when the mining development takes place in that area and that may be another factor in support of setting up an appropriate residential school there.\n\nMr. Gibson explained that the chief reason why there has not been more done in the past at this point is that it is generally believed that Rae is situated on a very poor site where there is poor water and everything has been against it. Even with the amount of business going up to the Slave River through Rae, it is found to be a very difficult place. Mr. McKinnon and Mr. Meikle looked for a site and there was only one where a residential school could possibly be built. It was planned to have temporary schools at Rae, Fort Norman, and Hay River, sometime in the near future. The one at Hay River would be in the old residential school. The residents there are in need of education and are very concerned about it; they have presented a petition.\n\nMr. McKinnon inspected educational facilities at Fort Smith. He had a talk with Mr. Capell the Secretary of the Public School, and there was a deficit of $687.20 owing to the Hudson's Bay Company from the previous year and the teacher's salary coming due. Fort Smith emphasizes the fact that the Administration's financial policy towards the Northwest Territories has to be revised within certain limits and Mr. McKinnon has tried to make arrangements in the 1947-48 Estimates whereby that will be done. In the meantime the Fort Smith Public School is in vital need of financial assistance and he recommended the grant be increased from $700 to $1,000 to take care of this special emergency and that the residents carry on as in the past until such time as the Administration's policy goes into effect. Council approved of increasing the grant to the Fort Smith Public School effective January 1, 1946.\n\nThe School Inspector noticed that the classes are too large. At Akavik the teacher had 76 children and 30 of them were non-English. One teacher was teaching as many pupils as the four teachers were at Yellowknife last year. Allowance will have to be made in the future for smaller classes in order to obtain greater efficiency.\n\nIn his 1947-48 Estimates Mr. McKinnon has made allowances for $1,600 for a teacher's average salary based on qualifications and experience; for an Office of Education\u2014office rent, $50 a month; supplies $600; equipment $750, total $1,950\u2014an educational library containing books and periodicals, $200; film projecting outfit to screen pictures before sending them to schools, $1,000; the salary of a supervisor of training, $3,000-$3,600; a stenographer $1,200. In his estimates he tried to make a very modest and small beginning in certain special projects\u2014$50 per class room for a library, $1,400; 24 radios at $50 each, $1,200; $500 as a beginning in adult education; $250 for correspondence courses; $250 for handicrafts; home economics $500 in certain selected areas; manual training $500 in certain areas; and $2,500 for beginning teachers' institutes. The total for special projects is $7,100, half of which should be paid by the Northwest Territories Administration and the remainder by Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nIf possible, allowance should be made in the estimates for educational facilities at Good Hope where there are about 60 children of school age and also at Arctic Red River as the residents are alarmed about\nthe lack of educational facilities. Council decided that in addition to those two points the matter of opening a school at Fort Franklin be investigated and action taken to meet the needs.\n\nIn order to bring about the reorganization of education and extend existing facilities, the sum of $45,000 has been included in the 1947-48 Estimates for the Government of the Northwest Territories under the following consolidated headings:\n\nGrants......................................................... $34,150\nPrinting and Stationery........................................... 500\nSupplies and Materials.......................................... 3,555\nTravelling Expenses.............................................. 3,000\nFreight, Express, Telegrams, Postage, etc.................... 350\nEquipment, Maintenance and Repairs............................. 2,625\nSundries.................................................................. 820\n\nTotal............................................................... $45,000\n\nOwing to conditions existing in the Territories it may not be possible to confine expenditures as indicated above. Council, therefore, agreed that whatever reallocation is needed to meet requirements should be carried out.\n\nAt this point in the proceedings Mr. MacKinnon was asked if he was of the opinion that the Administration should pay the salaries of all teachers in the Territories. He replied that this should be the policy with the exception of those within organized school districts. Council concurred.\n\nIt was reported that the Indian Affairs Branch have a proposal before Cabinet Council to make all teachers of Indian day schools permanent Civil Servants. A new salary schedule has been worked out and the teachers will contribute to the superannuation fund. Grants to Indian schools are also being substantially increased this year. The Northwest Territories Council expressed the opinion that the teachers appointed to the main settlements of the Territories should be full-time Civil Servants and responsible to the school inspectors. The matter of setting up appropriate positions is to be dealt with as soon as possible.\n\nIt was agreed that the Administration should buy equipment, modern textbooks, etc., as needed and be reimbursed on a pro rata basis by the Indian Affairs Branch. Alberta school books will be used and the Alberta curriculum followed. Requisitions for such equipment, etc., will be prepared by the Northwest Territories Administration after consultation with the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nIt was also agreed by Council that wherever children of a school or a community desire to purchase a motion picture projector for educational purposes, the Northwest Territories Administration will contribute 50% of the cost either from the Territorial Liquor Fund or the Administration Vote.\n\n(ii) Arrangements for school at Fort Radium - 16635\n\nEldorado Mining and Refining Ltd. wish to have a school at Fort Radium and are preparing a room to be used for this purpose. They will also employ temporarily at $75 per month, the wife of one of their employees who is a qualified teacher. Later the company intend to provide a new school building and employ a qualified teacher on a full-time basis. The school will be operated in accordance with the regulations.\n\nCouncil agreed that the Northwest Territories Administration should pay half the cost of opening and maintaining the temporary school and also half the cost of all expenses connected with the permanent school.\n10. Eastern Arctic Matters -\n\n(i) Appeal to Privy Council from the ruling of the Supreme Court that Eskimos in Quebec are Indians\n\nStand.\n\n(ii) Use of poison on wolves by trapper at Eskimo Point\n\nThe Secretary explained that D.C. Turner, a trapper at Eskimo Point who is an ex-R.C.M.P. Policeman and well versed in the law, found that wolves were taking about one-half his fur catch. He set out poison around his traps in an attempt to reduce the number of wolves. He was arrested and tried last summer before a Justice of the Peace. He was fined $3 but immediately wrote out an appeal, his object being to force to the attention of the Administration the necessity of doing something to control the wolves. He wants the law modified to permit responsible trappers to poison wolves or, failing that, he wants the government to employ paid wolf exterminators.\n\nThe wild life authorities were consulted and said nothing could economically be done to reduce the wolf population in such an extensive area as the cost would probably exceed the value of the fox catch. Poison cannot be permitted owing to danger to other wild life. He has appealed but has paid no deposit in this connection.\n\nIt was suggested that the trapper in question be informed of the views of the wild life authorities in regard to wolf control and that any further use of poison by him may result in the cancellation of his trapping licence. He might be advised that since no deposit accompanied his appeal it is doubtful if it would be entertained by a stipendiary magistrate. He may wish to withdraw his appeal.\n\n(iii) Education -\n\n(a) Mr. J.G. Wright's report,\n\nThe Secretary read a memorandum on education in the Eastern Arctic dated November 19, 1946 (copy attached).\n\nRegarding literature, the Secretary said there would be an Eskimo Grammar, a lesson book to teach Eskimo children English based on books used in Greenland (this book was distributed last year and the local dialects are being put in so the book will be of use in any part of the north); a phrase book which will be useful to people going in to the north for a short time, and a book which may be called a Book of Wisdom and will cover:\n\n1. Family Allowances\n2. Care of Rifles\n3. Care of Boats\n4. Conservation of Game\n5. Where Sickness Comes From\n6. How Sickness Spreads\n7. The Clean Camp\n8. The Clean Igloo\n9. Clean Air\n10. Clean Water\n11. Clean Pots and Dishes\n12. Food\n13. A Clean Body\n14. Taking Care of Sick People\n15. Before Baby Comes\n16. Care of New Baby\n17. Feeding a New Baby\n18. Crying in New Baby\n19. Sick Baby\n20. Care of Sick Baby\n21. Lung Sickness (T.B.)\n22. What to do When Frozen\n\nThe Chairman was of the opinion that since the Eskimo live so much of a family life, the older people will have to be included in any scheme of education. Teachers will have to be sent among them and it might be a good idea to employ teacher-welfare workers. It was also suggested that Eskimo might be trained as teachers in the north as they would not require to be brought out every two or three years.\n11. Fort Smith Day School (R.C.) - purchase of desks and chairs\n\nIt was agreed that these should be purchased by the Administration.\n\n12. Audit report of Public Administrator, Mackenzie District\n\nCol. Craig reported that he had audited the accounts of the Public Administrator and found them in order. Noted.\n\n13. Position of Typist (part time), Sub-Mining Recorder's Office, Edmonton, Alta.\n\nApproval was given to the appointment of Mrs. H. R. Stutchbury to replace Mrs. I. J. Gilker, as Typist, part time, at a salary of $200 per annum with effect from October 1, 1946. Payment of salary to be made on a quarterly basis from the appropriations provided for the Government of the Northwest Territories.\n\nCouncil then adjourned.\n\nR. A. Gibson,\nDeputy Commissioner.\n\nJ. G. Wright,\nSecretary.\nMr. Gibson\n\nRe: Education in the Eastern Arctic.\n\nThe problem of education in the Eastern Arctic is very complex. The thinly scattered population, the transportation difficulties over great distances, the nomadic habits of the natives, the necessity for Eskimo children to learn the native way of life, the frequent changes in the personnel of the white population and, to some extent, the language and religious question, all have a bearing on the subject.\n\nWhite Education\n\nThe white population numbers about 150 comprised of doctors, nurses, weather and radio station attendants, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, missionaries, traders and trappers. The majority of these people seldom remain longer than three years in the country without a furlough. Some missionaries remain longer and a few white trappers may remain indefinitely. The distribution of white children or those of mixed blood desiring education in English is approximately as follows:\n\n- Lake Harbour: 5\n- Chesterfield: 5\n- Pangnirtung: 3\n- Port Harrison: 5\n- Pond Inlet: 1\n- Southampton Island: 1\n- Moffet Inlet: 2\n- Eskimo Point: 2\n- Fort Ross: 4\n- Term Point vicinity: 10\n\nA Total of 38\n\nOf the above, 10 are infants under school age and the parents may move out before the children reach school age. There are, therefore, roughly 25 white or mixed blood children of school age widely scattered in the Eastern Arctic. Most of these children follow the correspondence courses supplied by one or other of the provinces and where the parents devote sufficient attention to teaching them, many of these children are said to be unusually well advanced for their age. Last summer I received requests for Ontario Department of Education correspondence courses from the following families:\n\n- Mr. (Foxey) Brown, Rankin Inlet -\n  Sons aged 7 and 1\n  Daughters aged 16, 14, 10, 5, 3.\n\n- Mr. Ernie Lyle, Fort Ross -\n  Children aged 9, 6, 4, 3.\n\nArrangements will be made to have the courses supplied by the Department.\n\nWhen the Patrol was at Chesterfield Cpl. Corey informed me that there are several white trappers and independent traders along the west coast of Hudson Bay centering at Term Point who intend to live permanently in the country and want a school for their children. There are also some well-to-do natives in this region who would be prepared to pay to send their children to school. Cpl. Corey thinks there should be a government residential school near Term Point where at least 15 children would attend.\n\nI had a discussion with Father Fafard at Chesterfield in regard to education of both white and native children on the west coast. He said that in the Chesterfield region 95% of the population were Roman Catholic and that as far south as Eskimo Point over 50% of the population were Roman Catholic. He did not favour anything but separate schools or religious schools on the west coast. Father Fafard is, I think, more or less satisfied with the day school education they are giving the Eskimo and does not seem to be enthusiastic about starting a residential school. They would have to erect a building. I have no\ninformation as to the religion of the group of whites and those of mixed blood who want a residential school at Term Point but it should be noted they request a government school.\n\nOwing to transportation difficulties I can see no way of educating the scattered white children in the Eastern Arctic except by correspondence which has, so far, worked satisfactorily. The one exception might be the group on the west coast of Hudson Bay but it seems doubtful if the school could be run for 15 children only.\n\nEskimo education\n\nThere are only two residential schools for Eskimo in the Eastern Arctic both operated by missions at Fort George. The Roman Catholic mission has an average attendance of 8 Eskimo and the Church of England has 6. We pay these schools an annual grant of $200 per pupil.\n\nThe missions operate day schools at the following points which are attended by Eskimo children when they are in the vicinity:\n\n| Location       | Religion | Average Attendance | Annual Government Grant |\n|----------------|----------|--------------------|-------------------------|\n| Eskimo Point   | R.C.     | 7                  | $250                    |\n| Eskimo Point   | C. of E. | 33                 | $250                    |\n| Chesterfield   | R.C.     | 21                 | $250                    |\n| Baker Lake     | R.C.     | 14                 | $250                    |\n| Baker Lake     | C. of E. | 6                  | $250                    |\n| Igloolik       | R.C.     | 22                 | $250                    |\n| Mistake Bay    | R.C.     | 6                  | $250                    |\n| Total          |          | 108                |                         |\n\nFunds have been provided in the Estimates for grants to day schools at a number of other points but hitherto there has not been sufficient attendance of children for a long enough period to warrant the schools being operated except at brief intervals.\n\nThere is considerable difference of opinion amongst the white residents in the north as to how much education should be given the Eskimo and how it should be provided. Some of the missionaries, of course, insist on religious schools. Those laymen who recommend education for the Eskimo want government schools. Some do not think the Eskimo should be given much education or he will become dissatisfied with his lot. There is little but the fur trade to support him in the north and he would have a hard time competing with whites outside. Practically all agree that any education given should be provided in the north and that it would be a grave mistake to transport native children any distance from their homes for education since they rapidly become unfitted for the native way of life. This has been amply demonstrated in the case of children brought outside for hospitalisation.\n\nI have discussed this subject with many people in the north and the following seems to be the consensus of opinion of those best informed:\n\n1. Education of the Eskimo should be designed to equip him to meet changing conditions in the north but should not make him discontented.\n\n2. He should be taught English, as opportunity offers, so that he can read published matter.\n\n3. He should learn simple arithmetic, hygiene, animal conservation, and the use and care of such white man's equipment as he needs.\n\n4. His morale must be sustained and the development of any race inferiority complex avoided. The pride of race which he still has should be fostered.\nand instruction in suitable folk lore should be encouraged. This is rapidly disappearing under missionary instruction.\n\n5. Pending instruction in schools, much can be done to educate the Eskimo by supplying him with suitable pamphlets in syllabic. Nearly all Eskimo are literate in their syllabic script. Such pamphlets are now in the course of preparation.\n\n6. When the Eskimo has been grounded in hygiene and sanitation, it may be possible to allow him to live in portable fabricated houses. There are already requests by well-to-do natives to purchase such houses but they would introduce a danger to health at present.\n\n7. Medical health centers, operated by the government, should be the basis of all improvement in native welfare. Such a health center could be staffed by a man and his wife skilled in first-aid, who would prescribe for patients under radio advice. Some young natives would be employed and taught hygiene, infant feeding, and care of the sick. These would be charged from time to time and new ones taken on to learn while the older ones carried their knowledge back to the native camps. Under-nourished and ailing children would be nursed back to health at the centers. Reading, writing and arithmetic, and other useful subjects could also be taught at these centers and the Eskimo Grammar and book of Eskimo Lessons which we are preparing would prove valuable here.\n\n8. Any children who showed marked promise at these centers could be taken outside for higher education and fitted to carry on work at the medical centers, hospitals, weather and radio stations, etc. No child should be taken out until he is at least 14 years old and he should be returned to his people for a month or two each year so he would not forget the native language and way of life.\n\nFrankly, I can see no other suitable way than the above whereby we can begin the education of the Eskimo. It is, of course, closely linked up with the medical health programme but, as in most efforts in the north, the cooperation of all interested parties is essential. I think we should urge the Department of National Health and Welfare to proceed along the line of providing health centers and offer our cooperation in the matter of education. I doubt if a policy could be laid down in time to do much in the coming year and for this reason I have not recommended anything extra in our Estimates.\n\n(sgd.) J. G.

STORY APPEAL\n\nAre the stories well-built, with beginning, middle and end?\nDo they contain some action, humour, suspense?\nDo they stand on their own feet as reading, or do they tend to rely too much upon the pictures?\nIn short, which stories would you prefer to teach to Indian children who are beginning to read?\n\nOrder of Preference for Story Appeal:\n\n1. \n2. \n\nII. INTEREST CENTRES\n\nWhich series has chosen topics of most interest to young Indian children?\nWhich series has chosen topics which best fit in with your course of studies in Religious Instruction, Health, Science and Social Studies?\n\nOrder of Preference for Interest Centres:\n\n1. \n2. \n\nIII. ILLUSTRATIONS\n\nConsider the following:\n(a) Artistic appeal, quality of drawing and colour, is colour saturation too high, taking eye away from the reading or properly subdued to reading?\nIs art on children's or adult appreciation level?\n\n(b) Teaching value: Is there enough relevant detail to provide good conversation material? Do the illustrations reinforce the story or steal the story away from the printed words?\n\nOrder of Preference for Illustrations:\n\n1. \n2. \n\nIV. MAKE-UP OR FORMAT\n\nConsider this from the point of utility in the classroom:\nBinding, quality of paper, cover-stock, size and quality of type and printing, balance of illustrations and printing on pages.\n\nOrder of Preference for Make-up:\n\n1. \n2.\nV - VOCABULARY\n\nConsult word lists at back of each page of Pre-Primer, Primer, etc., for list of new words.\nWork out the ratio of total number of words used to number of new words. This will mean the counting of the total number of words in each series and dividing into it the number of new words. The higher this ratio, the better will be the amount of practice per word.\nDo this only for the Pre-Primer, Primer and Grade One Reader.\n\nOrder of Preference for Vocabulary Practice:\n1. \n2. \n\nVI - SPECIAL FEATURES\n\nAre there any special features about these Series not covered by any of the topics listed above?\nDo these features seem desirable in a primary reading series?\n\nOrder of Preference for Special Features:\n1. \n2. \n\nSUMMARY\n\nAward Five points where you consider the series to be Excellent, Four for Very Good, Three for Good, Two for Fair and One for Poor.\n\n| FAITH & FREEDOM | CATHEDRAL BASIC |\n|------------------|-----------------|\n| 1.

The Physical Fitness Division of the Department of National Health and Welfare is keenly interested in the use of this Grid in public schools throughout Canada, and has asked that we try it out in our schools. Your school has been selected because of the fact that your school doctor - Dr. H. I. Palmer - is a qualified pediatrician.\n\nTherefore, you can anticipate receiving 100 copies of this Grid and an instruction manual in the near future. Dr. Palmer will be receiving a separate letter concerning this from the Medical Division.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nRev. W. J. Zimmerman,\nPrincipal,\nMohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\nOttawa, Ontario\nMay 10, 1947\n\nDear Doctor Palmer:\n\nRe: Wetzel Grid\n\nIn a co-operative effort, the Indian Affairs Branch Training Division and Indian Health Services are going to introduce the Wetzel Grid method of recording growth and development into Residential Schools.\n\nThe initial trial will be made at the Mohawk Institute, a very important factor being your special interest in children.\n\nNo doubt you are familiar with the Wetzel technique but we are enclosing samples and literature from which you will easily see the method. Supplies of cards are being sent to Rev. Mr. Zimmerman.\n\nWhile much of the recording can be done by the Institute staff it has been the general experience that it is very difficult for lay persons to do this work without professional supervision and it is our hope that you will assist Mr. Zimmerman in keeping this record.\n\nWe would be most interested in having your comments on the progress of this experiment and your recommendation about expanding the system into other schools.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDr. H.

After visiting many of the fascinating islands in those parts she will visit other countries, including parts of South America, the United States, and Canada.\n\nThese first-hand accounts of life in other countries will go far to arouse a healthy interest in people and places beyond our shores.\n\nYouth groups, schools, clubs, etc., can benefit by Group Subscriptions. Rates and Order Form are printed overleaf.\nOn board the S.S. \"Ariguani\".\n\nDear Reader,\n\nI am writing this letter on board the 6,746 ton ship \"Ariguani\" which is now more than half way on her 13-day voyage from Avonmouth, the port of Bristol in England, to the West Indies. The reason I am on the ship is because I am going to travel round the West Indies seeing everything possible by land, sea and air, and then I shall write personal letters to you, like this one, describing how people in these parts live. I expect you know that men and women who go abroad and write for newspapers or magazines are called foreign or special correspondents. Well, that is what I am - a special correspondent for young people in clubs, in school, or at home - in short your own foreign correspondent. I hope to describe the things about other countries that you really want to know - about the people, their homes and children, their games and food, their songs and flowers, their animals and birds and their way of getting around - in fact I hope to show you that they are people similar to those you know, but with all those little differences which make travel exciting and worth while.\n\nI am very pleased at the opportunity of doing this trip for you. It is so thrilling to be setting off in the direction which so many explorers and travellers have taken, and if I come across traces of Drake or Magellan, Columbus or Cortes, I shall be sure to let you know.\n\nIn the lounge of this ship there is a chart which shows the Atlantic Ocean, on which there is pencilled a line marking the route the ship is taking. If you want to follow it, draw a pencil line from Bristol to the Azores in the middle of the ocean, then from the Azores to Barbados and from Barbados to Trinidad.\n\nThe first night of the voyage, after we had been about three hours at sea, I was sitting in the lounge when suddenly I saw a large red light floating past the porthole. I ran on deck, and looking\nclimbed down a ladder from our ship into the pilot ship, and all our officers leaned down and called out goodbye messages, and then the pilot ship turned and steamed away very quickly. As she turned I saw her name painted on the stern \"Queen Mary\".\n\nOur ship, the \"Ariguan\" (the name of a river in South America) is a small, but very comfortable cargo vessel, having only one funnel which is painted banana yellow and black. I share a cabin with three other people. The cabin has four bunks, two on either side, two portholes, four wardrobes for our clothes, a wash-hand-stand-cum-dressing table, a chair and a long mirror.\n\nEach of the bunks has a reading lamp at its head, and we have a thermos jug of iced water and an electric fan for use in the hot weather. The ship has a pleasant dining saloon and three sitting rooms, but most people prefer to sit on deck. At the beginning of the voyage we wrapped ourselves in coats and rugs and used the long, comfortable chairs, but now we have reached warmer waters, we are wearing shorts, cotton frocks and sun-glasses.\n\nThere are four games which people can play on deck, shuffleboard, deck tennis, deck golf and quoits. Shuffleboard is played by pushing circular wooden disks into numbered spaces with a long pole which has a kind of wooden hoe at the end of it. The game is rather like shove-halfpenny, but on a larger scale. Deck tennis is similar in rules and scoring to lawn tennis, but is played on a smaller scale by throwing a rope twist instead of hitting a ball with a racquet. Deck golf is played by pushing a numbered disc round the deck with a pole like that used for shuffleboard, but in the place of the holes on a golf course, chalk circles are drawn on the deck. For quoits a board, similar to an archery target is marked on the deck, and the idea is to try to throw rope rings into the numbered spaces. Many different games are arranged\n\nGuide to pronunciation: s\u00e1le, b\u00e1re, \u00e1m, arm, \u00e9ve, \u00e9nd, ice, bill, own, orb, odd, \u00fcse, \u00fap, good, food.\nfor the evenings, and there is also a library on board.\n\nAmong the 128 passengers there are 40 children, as well as 5 babies under one year old who do not count at all. The older children join in all the ship's sports, but the smaller ones rush, stagger and crawl everywhere.\n\nBefore dinner every evening, I have a bath. It is rather an unusual sort of bath, too, as it is full of clean, hot salt water, and balanced across it there is a plank on which rests a basin full of fresh water. You soap yourself with the fresh water, because salt water will not produce a lather, and then rinse off with the salt. It is rather odd lying in the bath, because as the ship rolls gently from side to side, the water stays straight, and the bath does not.\n\nThe food is very good, and well cooked. Tea is served to everybody together in the lounge, but all the other meals are served in two shifts, the people with children having to go to the first sitting. We have ice-cream for dinner every day, and there is usually some kind of dessert in the form of a banana, apple or orange. The first two look quite normal, but the oranges, although quite ripe, are bright green, and I am told people often eat them like this in the West Indies.\n\nUnfortunately we passed the Azores at night, and at first we could only see the distant flash of a lighthouse, but soon the little twinkly lights of a small town appeared. While I was admiring these, I noticed that the whole sea was also full of little twinkling lights, only these did not stay alight, but just flashed as the sea moved. They were formed by phosphorus, which is only found when the sea gets warmer.\n\nNine days out of Avonmouth the sky cleared, the temperature rose and the sea became a very dark blue, with here and there floating pieces of ginger-coloured weed. This is called Sargassum weed or Gulf weed, and is found in the sea is usually called the Sargasso Sea, but which is really not a sea at all, but a sort of backwash of the Gulf Stream, where all the weed collects. We also saw flying fish which are very much smaller than I had imagined - in fact they are rather like martins or swallows as they have white or silvery bellies, and they skim or dart over the water. They come out in the cool of\n\nARIGUANI... AZORES BARBADOS SARGASSO TRINIDAD\nA-rig-u-a-ne A-zors' Bar-ba-doz Sar-gas-so Trin-i-dad\nthe morning and evening.\n\nThe Chief Engineer, a Belfast man, thinking you might be interested, invited me to see the engine room. It is a very high room, and, as we entered, we were met by a blast of hot air, which of course, always rises to the top, but we had three ladders to go down, and, using dusters to protect our hands from the heat of the rails of the ladders, we found when we reached the floor it was much cooler - only 105 degrees. There was also a cool air shaft under which we could have a shower bath of cool air! In the engine room are the Glasgow-made triple expansion engines which drive the twin screws. I met the three trimmers and five firemen who keep the boilers going. I saw the machines which work the water system, and the extra machine which is used for making clear water out of salt, if supplies of clear water run short. Here too, was the refrigeration plant which keeps the provisions fresh for the voyage, and will preserve the bananas which the ship will take home on her return journey from the West Indies.\n\nIt will not be long now before we pass Barbados, where we shall not stop, and so my next letter will be written from Trinidad.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBridget Moss\nApril 18, 1947.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn answer to your letters of April 9th, to the School Book Branch and the Deputy Minister of Education, we are mailing under separate cover, today, a complete selection of our current School Book Catalogues.

W. Driscoll\nSUPERINTENDENT OF STATIONERY\nOttawa, March 26, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. McLean,\nMr. Douglas,\nMajor Clark-Care,\nMiss Davis.\n\nInspector D. G. Smith, in reporting upon the No. 2 Oneida Indian Day School, comments as follows:\n\n\"I think it would be advisable to discontinue printing the multiplication tables on back of exercise books. Both in this school and in Number 1 Oneida, pupils carried out multiplication work at seats correctly but were completely lost in trying to do the same work on the blackboard. Both teachers attribute this to slavishly using the tables on the back of the exercise books.\"\n\nThis has long been my own opinion regarding the printing of multiplication tables upon the back of exercise books. I would like to substitute something more practical and less likely to cause \"gribbing\". It has been suggested that we use Canada's food rules and I like the small brown folder entitled \"if you eat\" attached hereto. It is possible that the National Film Board would design a similar one using an Indian boy in place of the man.\n\nThe front cover might also be dressed up with assorted pictures. Present cover is unattractive.\n\nCare.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. pf Welfare & Training.\n\nEnc.\nIF YOU EAT\n\n-For the children of Residential and Day Schools.

It would be suitable for distribution to children and parents.\nCANADA'S FOOD RULES\n\n-For children of Residential and Day Schools. This is a list of the foods for health to eat every day. Following Nutrition education in the classroom based on Canada's Food Rules, it could be distributed to the children and to the parents.\nCANADA'S FOOD RULES\nApproved by the Canadian Council on Nutrition,\n1944.\n\nThese are the foods for health.\nEat them every day.\nDrink plenty of water.\n\n1. MILK \u2014 Adults, \u00bd to 1 pint. Children, 1\u00bd pints to 1 quart.\n\n2. FRUIT \u2014 One serving of citrus fruit or tomatoes or their juices; and one serving of other fruit.\n\n3. VEGETABLES \u2014 At least one serving of potatoes; at least two servings of other vegetables, preferably leafy, green or yellow, and frequently raw.\n\n4. CEREALS AND BREAD \u2014 One serving of a whole-grain cereal and at least four slices of Canada Approved Vitamin B bread (whole wheat, brown or white), with butter.\n\n5. MEAT AND FISH \u2014 One serving of meat, fish, poultry or meat alternates such as beans, peas, nuts, eggs or cheese. Also use eggs and cheese at least three times a week each, and liver frequently.\n\nA fish liver oil, as a source of vitamin D, should be given to children and expectant mothers, and may be advisable for other adults.\n\nIodized salt is recommended.\n\nDivision of Nutrition,\nDepartment of National Health and Welfare,\nOttawa.\nHOW WELL FED ARE YOU?\n\nFor teachers of Residential and Day Schools. This pamphlet asks if parents feed their children as well as their farm animals. It mentions noticeable symptoms which may be a result of foods you eat or don't eat. Nutrition surveys, carried out by the Nutrition Division, are described. It offers suggestions on making one food do for another. It could be used by teachers for nutrition discussion amongst the children and the parents.\nHow Well-Fed Are You?\n\nHas Your Child a Hog's Chance?\n\nCareful attention to the feeding of poultry, hogs or calves makes money for farmers everywhere in Canada.\n\nBut their families may be losing health for lack of the same care and study.\n\nHow Do You Know When You Are Well-Fed?\nDeformed bones, anaemia, skin affections, goitre, sore eyes, loss of weight, digestive disturbances and even milder unnoticed conditions may occur in humans as a result of the food they eat\u2014or don't eat.\n\nIs this true in your case?\n\nHow To Find Out If You Need To Eat Better\n\nThis is not easy, nor is there any single procedure that will give the answer, but here are some things you can try:\n\n1. A medical nutrition study of your community by specialists from the Dominion Department of National Health and Welfare can be arranged by your health officer through the Provincial Health Department. This is a search for evidence of poor nutrition, designed to assist the work of your family doctor and local health officer. In the meantime try the next suggestion.\n\n2. An individual can get useful information by scoring meals for one or two weeks on the \"Score Sheet for Each Day's Meals\", available from every Provincial Health Department.\n\nTo find an average for a community or group, follow the \"Directions for using the Score Sheet in a Survey\", obtainable from the Division of Nutrition, Department of National Health and Welfare, Ottawa.\n\nWhat Can You Do About It?\n\nTHE BEST ASSURANCE OF ADEQUATE NUTRITION IS OBTAINED BY EATING A VARIETY OF FOODS. If this variety follows the pattern suggested in Canada's Food Rules, which is also used in the \"Score Sheet\", then you are on the safe side. Grow these foods if you can, but be sure to get them\u2014for your health's sake.\n\n1. Follow Canada's Food Rules\n\nApproved by the Canadian Council on Nutrition, 1944.\n\nThese are the foods for health. Eat them every day. Drink plenty of water.\n\n1. Milk\u2014Adults, \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) to 1 pint. Children, \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) pints to 1 quart.\n\n2. Fruit\u2014One serving of citrus fruit or tomatoes or their juices; and one serving of other fruit.\n\n3. Vegetables\u2014At least one serving of potatoes; at least two servings of other vegetables, preferably leafy, green or yellow, and frequently raw.\n\n4. Cereals and Bread\u2014One serving of a whole-grain cereal and at least four slices of Canada Approved Vitamin B bread (whole wheat, brown or white) with butter.\n\n5. Meat and Fish\u2014One serving of meat, fish, poultry or meat alternates, such as beans, peas, nuts, eggs or cheese. Also use eggs and cheese at least three times a week each, and liver frequently.\n\nA fish liver oil, as a source of vitamin D, should be given to children and expectant women, and may be advisable for other adults.\n\nIodized salt is recommended.\n\n2. Start A School Lunch\n\nThis makes it easier for all the children in the neighborhood to eat the above foods regularly.\nMaking One Food Do For Another\n\nMILK\u2014Nothing can conveniently replace milk and milk products in our Canadian diet.\n\nFRUITS AND VEGETABLES\u2014The important nutritional value in fruits is vitamin C, and this is richest the year round in citrus fruits. Money to purchase these for children is available from family allowances. Tomatoes are also those season. Berries in season are good. When fruits are difficult to obtain, your vitamin C may partially come from using vegetables, either raw or carefully cooked, especially potatoes, cabbage, kale, string beans, broccoli, turnips, peas, spinach.\n\nCEREALS\u2014If you eat more than half your cereals as refined ready-to-eat breakfast foods and white bread (except Canada Bread) rather than whole grains you will have difficulty making up the vitamin and mineral lost in milling.\n\nMEAT OR ALTERNATE\u2014A small amount will provide your absolute needs even if it does not satisfy you. See Canada's Food Rule No. 5. Cereals also provide protein and make the meat go farther.\n\nFATS, SUGARS, AND EXTRAS like pickles, add palatability to meals, but not much food value except energy.\n\nFood values are easily lost in storage and preparation, such as cutting, shredding and peeling. Overcooking or high temperatures, standing, and whipping, also reduce the food value. So serve fresh and raw with no delay, where possible.\n\nMany good sources of information are available, such as the booklet \"Healthful Eating\", free from your Provincial Health Department.\n\nIssued under the authority of the HON.

These are: Gadd\u2014WHITE BANK; LA BONTE; X BAR Y RANCH. These books, as the titles suggest, deal with life on a cattle ranch, and in the unspoiled forest lands. I think there is no disagreement that these books have a strong appeal for boys, especially those who are not interested in the traditional school programme. If you will take the trouble to look at these books, you will note that the author has made them exceedingly easy to read, not only by using graded vocabulary, but more important, by expressing his ideas in short sentences. This last seems to me a notable feature of these very readable books.\n\nI have been wondering how you have been getting along with your examination of the FAITH AND FREEDOM Basic Readers for Catholic Schools. Some time ago I sent you the Wall Chart for this series entitled HERE COME DAVID AND ANN. I should be glad to send you also the WORD PHRASE AND PICTURE CARDS which accompany the Grade One and Two pupils' books. I should be grateful if you would let me know your wishes in this matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRichard M.

Neary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nBooth Building,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Col. Neary:\n\nI am sorry that I missed seeing you and Mr. Doucett when you were in Toronto attending the O. E. A. Since you were here, I have had an opportunity of looking at the manuscript on woodwork. Mr. Ingram and I are much interested in this material, and he will be writing you shortly concerning it.\n\nThere are a number of new books that I would like to put before you now that are particularly suitable for school libraries and supplementary reading. Consequently, I am mailing you today the following books:\n\nHorn: Progress in Reading\n(eight pupils' books)\nStovall: You and Your Reading\nUnderwood: Wilderness Adventures\nBuswell-B: Jolly Number Tales Bk. One\n\" Jolly Number Tales Bk. Two\nCraig: Our World of Science\n(eight pupils' Books)\n\nThe Horn Series, as well as Stovall: YOU AND YOUR READING, is particularly suitable for remedial and corrective reading. The reading difficulty of these books is somewhat lower than the interest level, and there is gradual progression of difficulty throughout.\n\nJOLLY NUMBER TALES for Grades One and Two are books that you will want to use since they correlate closely, from a vocabulary standpoint, with the Jolly Number Workbooks.\n\nCraig: OUR WORLD OF SCIENCE is the latest of a long series of successful science readers by Dr. Gerald Craig. The Craig books are authorized in British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba, and, just this year, in Quebec Province. Not only will you find the science ideas carefully graduated in difficulty, but the vocabulary, too, has been given the same attention in the preparation of each book.\nOttawa, April 21, 1947.\n\nMr. R.M. Litch,\nGinn and Company,\n863 Bay Street,\nToronto 5, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Litch:\n\nI wish to thank you for the text-books for elementary grades which you forwarded me recently. At the present time we have placed fifty sets of the Faith and Freedom Readers for grades one and two and fifty sets of the New Cathedral Basic Readers in some five of our better schools. We have asked the principals and teachers to report upon their wishes concerning these two series. These reports are due in about the middle of July and we will then decide which series we will use.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Neary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Interior,\nBooth Building,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Col. Neary:\n\nSince my return from Ottawa, I have checked our records and discover that you have ordered all the manuals connected with the FAITH AND FREEDOM books for the first two grades. These, I believe, you must have sent to the schools which were making an examination of the FAITH AND FREEDOM Readers for you.\n\nThis morning we received an order from the Department of Public Printing and Stationery, No. 29449, which was to be rushed to Mr. R. F. Davey, Inspector of Schools, Vancouver, B.C. This included one item, \"Guide Book to Grade One Programme\". We are a little bit at a loss to understand what is meant by this, since you have included in the same order, \"Teaching First Grade Reading One\", \"Teaching First Grade Reading Two\", \"Teaching First Grade Reading Three\", which are the guide books for the first grade FAITH AND FREEDOM. A note has been put upon the invoice to the Department of Public Printing and Stationery explaining this.\n\nMr. Litch has brought back the information from Saskatchewan that just last week these four books of the FAITH AND FREEDOM Series, This is Our Home, This is Our Family, These are Our Friends, These are Our Neighbours, were adopted by the Department of Education of the Province of Saskatchewan for use in the separate schools. I know this information will be of interest to you because of your desire to direct your school's programmes so that the pupils will not be at any disadvantage should they enter the Provincial high schools.\n\nI regret that I cannot give you, at this time, any definite dates for the production of the workbooks for the Norton-Boyce: LIVING LANGUAGE Series. We should be able to send you sample material of the first book within the next couple of weeks since it is at present on the press. The other workbooks have been promised by August, and we hope that we may be able to supply examination copies for you before that time.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJBR/sf\nGINN AND COMPANY: PUBLISHERS\nFOUNDED IN 1897 BY EDWIN GINN\n\nJune 9th, 1947.\n\n863 Bay Street, Toronto 5\n\nCol. B. F. Neary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Interior,\nBooth Building,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Col. Neary:\n\nA circular on the FAITH AND FREEDOM Readers, which might be of great interest to you, is being enclosed. The statements which I made about these Readers to you when I was in your office are amplified to quite an extent in this circular, and you might appreciate having this information at hand when reaching your decision about the usefulness of FAITH AND FREEDOM.\n\nThe statistical material about vocabulary control appearing on pages 3, 4, and 5 shows how carefully the material in these books has been prepared for beginning reading. The following pages show how and where the skills of auditory and visual discrimination are developed in Grades One and Two. Pages 13, 14, 15 and 16 describe the additional material, Reading Readiness book, Word Phrase and Picture Charts, David and Ann Book, which is available for intensifying the reading programme.\n\nThis morning I discovered that two additional books in the basic series are being prepared in order to supplement the programme in the second and third grade\u2014THIS IS OUR PARISH and THIS IS OUR VALLEY. When these become available, I will see that examination copies are sent to you.\n\nIf there is any further information which you think we might provide for you, we would be pleased to undertake it. Do not hesitate to ask.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJER/sf\nEncl.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nJune 13th, 1947\n\nTo the Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa, (File: 1-1-4)\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF:\n\nVOTE 516 ALLOTMENT 12-415 ALLOCATION SYMBOLS\n\nSHIP TO Indian Affairs Warehouse, 187 Slater St., Ottawa, Ont.\n\nPurpose for which required: Indian Education\n\n| QUANTITY | UNIT PRICE | TOTAL   |\n|----------|------------|---------|\n| 13       | 10.00      | $130.00 |\n\nThese globes are available through the War Assets Corporation, No. 4 Temporary Building, Ottawa, Ontario, attention of Mr. Taylor.\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and for Departmental purposes only.

In view of the fact that Elementary Science is now being taught in these grades, the Inspectors are insisting that pupils use a proper note book. This can only be done with loose leaf books because of the drawings or science equipment which have to be included.\n\nCould you please advise me of the cost per dozen of the present loose leaf note books which you are stocking so that we can determine whether or not we should supply these in any great quantities to our schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nMr. J. W. Driscoll,\nSupt. of Stationery,\nDept. Public Printing & Stationery,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 16th, 1947.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRequisitions Nos. 27474 - 27454 - 27457.\n\nOur records show that Requisition No. 27474 was dated April 25th, 1947. It was clearly marked for delivery to \"Redwood Dock, Winnipeg, Man., by May 24th, 1947\". We have now received your Delivery Records which indicate that shipment was made on May 23rd. Therefore, it is most unlikely that it would reach its destination on time.\n\nAnother instance is of Requisition No. 27454 for the Jack River C. E. Day School. This Requisition was dated April 23rd, 1947, and your Delivery Records indicate that it was only sent out by O. N. Freight on the 23rd of May; yet we specially requested that it should arrive at the Selkirk Navigation Company's docks in Winnipeg about May 24th.\n\nStill another instance is of Requisition No. 27457 for the Little Grand Rapids United Church Day School. This requisition is dated April 24th and was clearly marked to reach Winnipeg by May 24th. Your Delivery Record shows that it left Ottawa on May 28th.\n\nThis year we have had many complaints from our teachers in the North about the non-arrival of supplies. This is especially serious in the case of day schools where there will be no teacher to accept delivery of school material during the summer. These parcels lie around while the school is closed and are often broken into, with a resulting loss of many items.\n\nIt would be appreciated if every effort could be made to have requisitions which have a delivery date marked on them given a priority. We are making every effort here to speed up delivery of supplies for these northern schools and hope that you will be able to do the same.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard F.

Neary\nSuperintendent,\nWelfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nCatechism Survey.\n\nThe problem of catechism manuals has been studied by the whole staff. We are of the opinion that the teaching of religion in classrooms depends on the organisation and modernization of our methods. Religion should benefit of the modern pedagogy as applied to secular matters viz:\n\n- Induction: the manual of catechism is no more the starting point but a reference book.\n- Activities: according to modern methods and tests.\n- Unit system: divided in the 40 weeks. Quantity and importance taking the place of quality of tests to memorize.\n- Gradation: age and grade being considered throughout the whole curriculum.\n- Cycles: to cover progressively and under new angles the same matter according to the evolution of the mind and the needs of each age.\n- Attractive texts and methods.\n\nThis called for an elaborated program set for the whole school as well as for each grade. A program which gives to the teacher the weekly details, the references to Bible, History, Liturgy etc. Of course such teaching requires more than a manual to be memorized and explained as it was done in the past.\n\nIn our school, we gave away the use of the old little manual of catechism furnished by the Department. We replaced it by \"Catholic Faith\" by Kirsch in three graded books. This book has a good wording, presentation, activities and tests. But it can be used only for references or for memorization. It cannot be the base of whole course of religion for nine years.\n\nWe must admit that \"Father McGuire's New Baltimore Catechism No I and Dr. Horan Baltimore Catechism No I present a real improvement on the old manuals and can be of good use in many school especially day schools. We still use here the catechism by Kirsch for reference book and use the textbook for the reduced memorization required.\"\nIndian Residential School\n\nLebret, Saskatchewan\n\nWe have adopted, for the time being, the course of the Diocese of Chicago by Schorsch, for the Grade II, III, IV, V. It gives us the framework of our organization in unites. Furthermore each teacher is given, for every weekly unit, a number of references in suitable books in order to make good use of the Bible, Liturgy and History as a base of induction.\n\nFor the higher grades (VI, VII, VIII), we give the teacher the three books of Bailerl, supplemented for activities, induction etc., with other reference books.\n\nWe are still receiving from the Department a very old fashioned manual for Bible study, I mean Gilmour's. Its vocabulary and presentation are not in accordance with modern pedagogy. In the past years we tried in vain to get, from the Department, the more up-to-date manuals of Johnson-Hannon or Newton's.\n\nAs for the Grade I, we have abandoned the idea of giving the children a textbook. It is only after many months that they can read it. The nice little manual \"My First Communion Catechism\" can be used only at the end of the year. These young children who are preparing themselves for first communion, learn by hearing their teacher telling them the Bible story, and the whole process is based on induction: story-telling, pictures discussions, projections, projects, drawing etc. No textbook is used for the memorization required from them. Full initiative is left to the Primary grade Teacher. This is more or less the attitude we have with Grade II also.\n\nIn brief, this is our standing:\n\n1. Schorsch\u2014a course in religion\u2014gives us the framework for Grade II, III, IV, V. We do not say that it is the best author but it has a good value. We did not have the opportunity of comparing it with Fitzpatrick's \"Highway to Heaven\" and to \"The Kingdom of God\" by Newton-Harran.\n\n2. In Grade I, the children do not use books but the teacher finds the proper didactic material for inductive teaching.\n\n3. Bailerl's books are used by the senior boys and girls with Johnson's Bible history books which are far superior to the old and inadequate Gilmour's Bible.\n\n4. All the other adaptations of Baltimore can be good but we find that they will always prove to be inadequate for a whole program of religious teaching during a period of 7 or 9 years. They are poor and feeble remedies to a great mistake in religious pedagogy which should not be different of profane pedagogy.\n\nWe do not expect that the Department will consider giving all the books mentioned; Schorsch-Fitzpatrick-Harran...but the teacher at least, should be supplied with them. And the pupils should have Johnson's Bible instead of Gilmour's.\nMcGuire's and Horen's improved text, is a progress and many teachers will consider it to be superior to McGuire's.\n\nHoping that your Catechism Survey will be a success,\n\nI am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nP. Piche O.M.I.\nSt. Catherine's Indian Day School,\nDuncan, B.C.,\nJune 18, 1947.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Neary,\n\nRe: CATECHISM SURVEY\n\n1) For the past three years we have been using \"Father McGuire's New Baltimore Catechism #1.\"\n\nFor the first year we had a rather difficult time as the children found the wording quite difficult and it took much patience and time to get them to understand how the study sections were worked. Last year they did well, but this year they have handled them almost as well as any white child. I am now speaking of Grades 5 to 8. The Study sections (answer these questions in your notebook or on a sheet of paper as your teacher may direct) have proven very developing in English for Grades 6, 7, and 8. Grade 5 have a hard time to couch the answer into good English.\n\n2) Baltimore Catechism #1 (Dr. Horan)\n\nSince the word content of the questions and answers are the same as in Father McGuire's Catechism the children had no difficulty. They found the Study Exercises most simple. I found that the illustrations had more appeal for them and were more readily understood than those in the McGuire's Catechism.\n\nPersonally I like the lay-out of the Horan's Study Exercises. They are less congested. This along with the fact that the children had already worked on the McGuire's for three years was the reason they found the Horan Catechism so simple. They rarely made a mistake on any exercise assigned.\n3) My First Communion Catechism.\n\nThis is a splendid little book. We find that many of the words are far beyond the Indian child's comprehension e.g., serve (God), quarrel, allowed, offered, satisfy for sin, gain (heaven), but the illustrations are so appealing that they do the greater part of the explaining to the child mind. The majority of our Indian children in this district have a very, very meagre comprehension of the English language. Many can read like parrots, but lack the reading comprehension.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nSister Mary Sheila\n\nPrincipal.\nTHE COPP CLARK CO. LIMITED\n495-517 WELLINGTON ST.

Here again we find that the publishers have produced very up-to-date set of workbooks. At the present time, we contemplate the publishing of same here in Canada.\n\nWe are sending a copy of the GARDEN OF STORIES WORKBOOK.

However, I have given an equal score to both series in the summary at the end of the form. The word count which I performed on these two sets indicates that the Cathedral Basic readers are somewhat superior in the matter of word practice. This is very important in teaching Indian children.\n\nUnder \"Special Features\" I have ranked the Faith and Freedom series ahead of the Cathedral Basic because of the greater amount of direction given to teachers in the former series in the matter of pre-school activities, particularly ear and speech training. The Faith and Freedom series give considerable attention to these factors which are very important in the training of Indian children. This direction is included in the manuals.\n\nOn the whole, my preference is for the Cathedral Basic series.\n\nR. F. Davey,\nDist.

This book will be published in August in time for school opening.\n\nCANADA AND HER NEIGHBOURS approaches the regional study of Canada from the standpoint of the occupations of the people who inhabit the regions. This text tells how the daily life of people in a given region is influenced by geography, and how the people, in turn, have modified the geographical aspect of their communities.\n\nCANADA AND HER NEIGHBOURS will be an outstanding book. The text is being printed by offset process which will enhance the illustrations, sixteen of which will be printed in four colours. Eight pictures representative of Canadian life have been painted especially for this book. Copious use is made of photographs that teach. Many of these photographs have been taken expressly for use in CANADA AND HER NEIGHBOURS.\n\nNew physical maps of Canada in full colour, drawn by Richard Edes Harrison, will be a feature of CANADA AND HER NEIGHBOURS. In addition, there will be six double-page regional maps, and more than seventy single-purpose black-and-white maps. Some are drawn by Erwin Raizs.\n\nThe manuscript has been used experimentally and revised in the light of classroom experience. As a result, CANADA AND HER NEIGHBOURS meets the needs and interest of pupils in the elementary grades.\n\nProfessor Griffith Taylor is head of the Department of Geography, University of Toronto. Miss Dorothy Seiveright, Macdonald College, McGill University, has had long and successful experience both as an author and as teacher of geography and methods. Dr. Trevor Lloyd, formerly of the Winnipeg Public Schools, is an outstanding Canadian geographer, and one who has had wide teaching experience.\n\nCANADA AND HER NEIGHBOURS is a book that will broaden rather than limit the Social Studies programme. It is so written that it provokes pupil-participation through questions, varied things to do, and informal stories. We are sure your pupils will profit immeasurably through its use. An order form has been enclosed for your convenience.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGINN AND COMPANY.\nOttawa, July 1st, 1947.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nLanguage Series for Indian Schools.\n\nIt has been decided to adopt for use in our Indian schools \"Living Language Series\" published by Ginn and Company, Toronto. This series is just now being printed and has already been adopted by two Canadian Provinces. Would you please, therefore, place in stock the following quantities:\n\n| Grade | Title            | Quantity |\n|-------|------------------|----------|\n| 3     | Word Ways        | 2000     |\n| 4     | Words at Work    | 2000     |\n| 5     | More Progress    | 1500     |\n| 6     | Carry On         | 1000     |\n|       | Teacher's Manuals| 500      |\n\nWe will not use Opportunity Workbooks in English or Workbooks in English Usage and Composition, Grades Three to Six any further. Therefore, will you please cancel back orders for these text-books in those grades. We will endeavour to use up the present stock so that you can clear your shelves of these workbooks.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard F.

The series runs from Grades I to VI, and we are adopting it for Grades III to VI for this year. Next year, if funds are available, we will take it down to Grade I.\n\nI know you will be interested, especially in the Teachers' Manual. It will give you something to check your teachers against, as it is quite detailed, and especially written for teachers of one-room schools.\n\nYou will note that Miss Morton works on the basis that there should be two main groups - Primary (Grades I to III) and Junior (Grades IV to VI). These books have been worked out accordingly and on a level basis.\n\nThe other sample is the Grade II Book, and I will forward those for the other Grades when they become available.\n\nWe do not intend to upset present texts that are in use, if they are found satisfactory, but we will no longer continue to supply the \"Workbook in English Usage and Composition\".\n\nAfter you have had an opportunity of looking over these books, I would appreciate hearing from you as to how suitable you think they will be for our needs.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard R.

Robinson,\n\nPlease let me know if you can supply us with four hundred (400) copies of the Faith and Freedom pamphlet (607-11, 44) which you enclosed with your letter of June 9th.\n\nThe information contained in this pamphlet would, no doubt, prove useful to our teachers when we are introducing into our schools the Faith and Freedom Series for Grades One and Two.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nBernard F.

As a result of experiments which have been conducted in five of our Indian schools, it has been decided that the Faith and Freedom Series is more adaptable for use with young Indian children, and we have decided, therefore, to adopt this Series. The results of these experiments are as listed below:\n\n| School          | Faith & Freedom | Cathedral Basis |\n|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|\n| St. Mary's Mission | 30              | 20             |\n| Kamloops        | 28              | 26             |\n| Qu'Appelle      | 22              | 24             |\n| St. Catherines  | 22              | 17             |\n| Sandy Bay       | 24              | 26             |\n\nPoints ... 135 114\n\nThe Corona Readers will continue, at present, to be the authorized texts in Grades Three to Six.\n\nIn line with our gradual replacement of the Coronas by Faith and Freedom, we hope to be in a position to replace the Grade Two Corona Reader with the Faith and Freedom Reader by January 1, 1948. Would you please, therefore, order from the publishers - Ginn and Company, 563 Bay Street, Toronto 5, Ont. - the following quantities of Faith and Freedom Readers.\n\nMr. J. W.

F. Neary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nBooth Building,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nSince returning to Toronto, I have mailed you two copies of HERE WE GO. This is the Level II text-workbook in the LIVING LANGUAGE Series by Norton and Boyce. The other two books in this series will go to you at about two-week intervals. This means that the first four will be ready by the end of August. It is difficult to be exact about the dates for the books for grades five and six, but these will not be later than the middle of September. Following are the net prices of the LIVING LANGUAGE Series:\n\n- Teaching Living Language $0.60\n- Let's Begin I $0.24\n- Here We Go II $0.28\n- Word Ways III $0.32\n- Words at Work IV $0.36\n- More Progress V $0.36\n- Carry On VI $0.36\n\nIn the same parcel with the Language books, you will receive a copy of the Workbook to accompany THIS IS OUR TOWN. THIS IS OUR TOWN is the third reader in the Faith and Freedom Series which, as you know, is being revised for Canada. I have sent you the workbook, however, so that you may be acquainted with the excellent supplementary material available for the books in the Faith and Freedom Series. I think I mentioned to you also, the literary readers which are in preparation as a companion series to Faith and Freedom. There is, of course, a teachers' manual available, etc., to accompany THIS IS OUR TOWN and the Workbook.\n\nWe are looking into the matter of combining the Grade Three and Four volumes of the Andress health Series, and I shall write to you further about this a little later.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRML/sf\nMr. Bernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nYesterday afternoon, just as we were closing, I got the copy of the letter you sent to Mr. Driscoll regarding our \"Living Language\" series, and this morning I have a copy of your second letter regarding the \"Faith and Freedom\" readers.\n\nIt is, of course, tremendously pleasing to me that you have decided to use these books of ours. I honestly think you are making no mistake. \"Living Language\" has been prepared with a special eye to situations such as you have in the majority of Indian schools.\n\nIt is also most encouraging that you will use the \"Faith and Freedom\" readers which we are, as Mr. Litch and Mr. Robinson explained, engaged in Canadianizing. For many years I have had a rather detailed knowledge of conditions in the Indian schools, both from personal observation in the schools and from my contacts with the members of your Department. Long, long ago I realized that many books contained statements which, from the point-of-view of the Indian schools, are unfortunate and it has been our constant aim in the production of Canadian books to make sure that they would contain nothing offensive to Indians and, indeed, that they should be especially suitable for use in the Indian schools. It is therefore doubly pleasing to me to have your seal of approval put upon our work.\n\nWe have only a handful of the circulars to which you refer here in Toronto, but we can probably get the 400 you require from our Boston office. I am enquiring about this and will write you as soon as I hear further about it.\n\nI want to thank you for the courtesy you showed to Mr. Litch and Mr. Robinson the other day. I am hopeful that before long I may make a trip to Ottawa and meet you. If, of course, you are in Toronto at any time, I hope you will give me a call and perhaps we may have lunch together.\n\nCordially yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJuly 16, 1947.\nW. J. Gage & Co.

Faith & Freedom Series\n2.

Faith & Freedom Series\n2. Cathedral Tales\n\nIII - ILLUSTRATIONS\n\nConsider the following:\n(a) Artistic appeal, quality of drawing and colour, is colour saturation too high, taking eye away from the reading or properly subdued to reading?\nIs art on children's or adult appreciation level?\n\n(b) Teaching value: Is there enough relevant detail to provide good conversation material? Do the illustrations reinforce the story or steal the story away from the printed words?\n\nOrder of Preference for Illustrations:\n1. Faith & Freedom Series\n2.

This will mean the counting of the total number of words in each series and dividing into it the number of new words.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nOn my return to Toronto this morning I find on my desk your letter of September 11 regarding the Jolly Numbers books. This is one of the matters you discussed with me in Quebec and, as Mr. Robinson was able to explain, Book One was due here on September 11. Actually the books arrived on September 12 and shipment has already been made to the Stationery Office. We expect Book Two, First Half, around the end of this week and it will go out to you immediately.\n\nThe \"Living Language\" series, as I explained to you, is in press. We are sending you today 500 copies of the Level-Three book, \"Word Ways,\" and the balance of your order for this book will go out to you within the next two or three days. The books for the higher levels will follow on in quick succession.\n\nWe also have an order from you for the workbook for \"These Are Our Friends.\" We expect to ship this around the first week in October.\n\nApart from the books mentioned above, we have no outstanding orders from the Stationery Office. Therefore, if any other books are short, you should request them to order immediately and we will do our best to get them to you promptly.\n\nI am sorry that we are late with some of these books, for I realize just what an annoying situation this means in the schools. However, as you know, manufacturing conditions are quite chaotic and the delays are beyond our control.\n\nIt was a great pleasure to meet you in Quebec and I shall look forward to seeing you again soon when both of us have more time to sit down and chat. If you are in Toronto any time, I hope you will give me a call and perhaps we can have a bite of lunch together.\n\nCordially yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nNGSI/MMS\nOttawa, September 24th, 1947.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSilent Readers for Social Studies.\n\nWe find that we will require an additional 200 copies of each book in the above Series.

If the artist wishes to use, as an outline motif, illustrations of the basic points in these Food Rules it will be entirely satisfactory.\n\n(C) That the back page of Scribbler B be amended by placing thereon \"O Canada\" in place of \"Canada's Food Rules\". In other words, these last two suggested changes involve a switch in scribbler back pages between A and B.\n\n(D) Scribbler C is entirely satisfactory in its present form except that we would suggest that the capital city of the province and also Prince Rupert be marked in.\n\nMr. N. Chamberlin,\nLiaison Officer,\nNational Film Board,\nSovereign Building,\n71 Bank Street,\nOttawa, Ont.\nWe will forward to you, in the near future, a print of Joseph Brant which we would like used for the cover of Scribbler B. We are also looking for a suitable cut of Crowfoot as the second portrait cover in this series.\n\nIn Scribbler C, I would suggest that we do Ontario and British Columbia as a beginning. These two provinces contain the largest number of Indians and we have the largest number of schools situated therein.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

We have drawn up the following list of suggested titles, and sample copies have already gone forward to you:\n\n| Title                                      | Price |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Cadd: La Bonte                             | $1.00 |\n| White Hawk                                 | $1.00 |\n| X Bar Y Ranch                              | $1.00 |\n| Fiske: Bo, The Cave Boy                    | $1.60 |\n| Mason: Smiling Hill Farm                   | $2.20 |\n| Seeley: Chinook and His Family             | $1.40 |\n| Fitzgerald: Never Surrender                | $1.25 |\n| Murphy: Peter's Wonderful Adventure        | $1.30 |\n| Andrews: Stories Mother Nature Told Her Children | $0.90 |\n| B-B-J: Jolly Number Tales Book One         | $1.00 |\n| Cherubini: Pinocchio in Africa             | $0.90 |\n| Collodi: Pinocchio, Adventures of a Marionette | $1.00 |\n| Patri: Pinocchio's Visit to America        | $1.10 |\n\nThere are one or two items on the above list on which I would like to make special comment. First of all, the three titles LA BONTE, WHITE HAWK, and X BAR Y RANCH are particularly suitable for slow or indifferent readers. You will find, on examining these books, that the reading structure is simple and the sentences short, while the interest level is high.\nand especially appealing to boys due to the outdoor setting of the stories. These three books are being extensively used here in Ontario as remedial readers in the upper elementary grades.\n\nJOLLY NUMBER TALES Book One and Book Two have a special place in your libraries since they are closely correlated with the JOLLY NUMBER workbooks which you are supplying for arithmetic in Grades One and Two. These two readers present informal arithmetic at its best, and, at the same time give added use of vocabulary introduced in the workbooks.\n\nAn important social studies text that we have sent you is GIFTS OF OTHER LANDS AND OTHER TIMES. This is cast at about the Grade Four level, and deals with early civilization down to the discovery of America presented from the Catholic point of view. Other library materials particularly suitable for the Catholic schools are, of course, the upper books of the FAITH AND FREEDOM Series. I would recommend to you particularly the sixth grade book, THIS IS OUR HERITAGE.\n\nIf there is any other information you would like, please do not hesitate to write us.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary to Mr. J.B. Robinson.\nOttawa, October 31, 1947.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt is noted that in a Circular Letter of October 15th, the Comptroller of the Treasury has informed all Chief Treasury Officers of the necessity for Departments to secure written permission of the King's Printer in order to purchase certain articles, or things, on local purchase orders.\n\nDuring recent inspections of Indian schools, both the schools officials of the Indian Affairs Branch and the inspectors of provincial Departments of Education have commented on the long delays which our teachers are experiencing before receiving their school supplies.\n\nThese requisitions call for supplies which fall mainly into two broad groups:\n\n(a) **STANDARD SUPPLIES** such as Readers, Arithmetics, scribblers, pencils, etc., which are more or less common to the various courses of study of the provinces in which our Indian schools are located.\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch informs the Stationery Branch of its requirements in these supplies, and a stock is held to be sent out when requisitions are received.\n\n(b) **SPECIAL SUPPLIES** consisting mainly of text-books which are specifically authorized by a provincial Department of Education for that province.\n\nAs we have Indian schools located in each of the nine provinces and as each province has an entirely\ndifferent course of study, the Stationery Branch cannot be expected to stock these widely different text-books. This is particularly evident in the Senior Grades from Seven upwards. In the past, this has not presented too great a problem, but now Indian pupils in increasing numbers are passing into these grades and the situation has now become very difficult due to the non-arrival of the necessary text-books. Last year we were criticised by provincial inspectors for not providing required text-books for entrance pupils until November; yet these requisitions had been passed to the Stationery Branch during the summer holidays.\n\nIt is felt that the Stationery Branch is required to spend so much time in filling orders for these special text-books that it is not able to cope with our requisitions for standard supplies. At the present time, it has been estimated that a requisition goes through the following steps before the supplies actually arrive in the hands of the teacher concerned:\n\n1. Teacher fills out requisition form.\n2. Agent countersigns requisition form.\n3. Requisition reaches Indian Affairs Branch where it is checked and typed on a special form required by the Stationery Branch.\n4. This special requisition form is signed by the Superintendent of Welfare and Training.\n5. It is signed by a Treasury Official.\n6. It is sent to the Stationery Branch, where apparently two separate actions may take place.\n\n(a) If an item is listed as in stock, it is copied on a Delivery Record.\n\n(b) If it is an item of a special text-book not in stock, an order is prepared for the Text-book Bureau of the province concerned or publishing company or school supply company.\n7. The order is filled or if an outside order is to be placed.\n\n8. This order is sent to the firm or bureau concerned. The order is filled by the firm or bureau.\n\n9. This firm or bureau sends bill to the Stationery Branch.\n\n10. A monthly account is sent by the Stationery Branch to the Indian Affairs Branch for payment.\n\nThe schools officials of the Indian Affairs Branch have carefully studied the foregoing procedure with a view to eliminating as much of the delay as possible. At the present time it takes four to five months for supplies to reach our schools. Therefore, it is felt that you will agree with the following recommendations:\n\nA. For standard items which are common to all schools or to most schools, such as readers, Arithmetics, pencils, chalk, etc., the following procedure is suggested:\n\n(1) The teacher completes a standardized requisition form, such as attached hereto.\n\n(2) The Agent countersigns this and sends it to the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\n(3) The Branch attaches eight or ten of these special requisition forms to the form required by the Stationery Branch; the covering form is signed by a Training Division official and a Treasury Official and sent to the Stationery Branch.\n\n(4) The Stationery Branch carries out its normal procedure with a requisition.\n\nB. For special items which are peculiar to the province concerned and more especially for text-\nbooks required for the senior grades, the following procedure is suggested:\n\n(1) The teacher completes a special supplies requisition form.\n\n(2) The Agent countersigns this and sends it to the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\n(3) After checking to ensure that the text-books are as authorized by the provincial Department of Education concerned, that the Indian Affairs Branch be permitted to order these text-books directly from the provincial Text-Book Bureau concerned or the publishing company.\n\nIf it is decided to place a limit on these purchase orders, it is suggested that this be $100.00.\n\n(4) That the Text-Book Bureau, or the publishing company, bill the Indian Affairs branch for these items.\n\nPractically all provincial Departments of Education now maintain efficient Text-Book bureaus. These bureaus have a large supply of text-books - particularly those required in the province concerned. These have been established by the provinces in order to provide text-books at the lowest cost possible. Attached please find an order form from the Manitoba Text-Book Bureau, which should illustrate the scope of these bureaus.\n\nIt is felt that by the above two procedures we can eliminate these long delays at present being experienced, and thus greatly increase the efficiency of our Indian schools. At the present time a teacher will send in a requisition for school books and also a requisition for janitor\nsupplies. The janitor supplies, which we authorize the Agent concerned to buy by local purchase, reach her in ten days or two weeks, while the school books - so urgently required - often take four to five months to reach her. It is felt that action is definitely required to remedy this situation.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH. L.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Col. Neary:\n\nI have your letter of October 24th, file 1-1-4 (WT), with the sketch on Chief Crowfoot. I think it is very good and would be suitable for the back of the scribbler.\n\nRegret this was not answered sooner, as I have been away a great deal of the time.\n\nSincerely,\n\nH. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nGHG:RM\n\nPlaced in Chamberlin & gave OK\nOFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE TREASURY\n\nCircular Letter No. 1947-65\nOttawa, October 18th, 1947\n\nTO THE CHIEF TREASURY OFFICERS:\n\nAttached is a copy of Cabinet Directive No.1 of September 19, 1947, prescribing a procedure to govern departmental requisitions for printing and stationery and the distribution and sale of official publications by departments and agencies of Government.\n\nThe concern of the Treasury in this Directive is twofold, namely:\n\n(1) The effect of the Directive on the requisitioning of printing and stationery for Treasury use.\n\n(2) The policing action required of the Treasury to ensure that departments comply with the prescribed procedure.\n\nWith regard to No.1, Treasury Officers are instructed that under no circumstances should an agent of any printing or stationery firm be permitted to proceed with the work of drafting Treasury forms or furnishing specifications and prices for printing and stationery requirements on an understanding given by a Treasury Officer, verbally or otherwise, that the agent's firm will get the business. Should it become necessary to enlist the aid of agents of printing and stationery firms in determining the specifications of printing jobs or the drafting of forms to do the job in question, Treasury Officers will request the approval of Central Office before discussing the project with agents. Central Office will in turn seek the approval of the King's Printer.\n\nWith respect to the policing action required of the Treasury over the actions of departments, Treasury Officers are instructed that no suppliers' accounts for printing and stationery should, at any time, or under any circumstances, be paid directly from departmental appropriations, either by Receiver General cheques issued by Treasury Officers, or by payments made (usually) from Imprest Accounts; provided that if a department secures the written permission of the King's Printer to purchase certain articles or things on local purchase order, Treasury Officers may pay accounts which conform to such written agreement or may honour the relevant items in an Imprest Account, as the case may be.\n\nIf a claim for reimbursement of an Imprest Account contains an item of printing and stationery of a type which the department was not permitted, by the King's Printer, to purchase on its own authority, Treasury Officers will delete the item from the claim and advise the department to forward a covering requisition to the King's Printer for approval. When submitting such requisition the department must clearly endorse on the face thereof a statement that the account of the supplier has been paid in order to protect against a duplicate payment being made.\n\nComptroller of the Treasury.\n(b) Any department, board, commission or other government agency with which such an agreement has been entered shall be required to comply with any regulations which may be issued from time to time by the Department of Public Printing and Stationery with respect to the stocking and distribution of such publications, and in the case of publications for sale with respect to the pricing, listing of such publications, the conditions of sale and payment, the disposition of moneys accruing from sales, the control of stocks and inventories, or other regulations that may be found necessary for the proper observance of the provisions of the Public Printing and Stationery Act.\n\nAll departments and agencies of government are directed to govern themselves accordingly.\n\n(sgd)\nA.D.P.

We plan to have texts for Grades III to VIII in this series, which is Canadian throughout both as to authorship and production. I shall be pleased to know what you think of these books.\n\nIncidentally, in connection with new and forthcoming ventures, the Macmillan Company and ourselves will probably not have copies of our new Arithmetic texts ready to show you until next year, but we believe the texts will be well worth waiting for.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nC.

Church & Dwight,\nSun Life Building,\nMONTREAL, P.Q.\nOttawa, November 17th, 1947.\n\nDear Mr. Driscoll:\n\nPlease find attached four copies of a standardized order form for Indian school supplies. We are doing everything possible to limit teachers' requests for normal school supplies to the articles shown on the attached list. You have already received this order form, and an article describing its use to our teachers, in the November issue of the Indian School Bulletin.\n\nI would particularly draw your attention to the items marked \"1, 2, 3, 4, 5\". In attempting to limit our teachers to these five items, we hope to prevent them requesting drawing, construction and poster paper of unusual sizes and qualities.\n\nIt is, therefore, requested that you place in stock five hundred packages of each of these five items:\n\n- White Water Colour Drawing Paper, 6x9 (100 sheets to a package),\n- White Water Colour Drawing Paper, 9x12,\n- Construction Paper, 9x12, asst. colours (50 sheets to a package),\n- Poster Paper, 9x12, asst. colours (100 sheets to a package),\n- Poster Paper, 6x9,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Mr. Phalen will know what they look like, but we are sending you a sample set, under separate cover.\n\nWe would be willing to let you have 1500 sets, each of ten large pictures, at 10 cents a set, or $150.00 for the lot. I believe that we sold the original set of ten pictures mounted for $1.00 each.\n\nIt seems a shame to waste these pictures which are particularly suited to Indian schools and I hope that you will be able to make use of this surplus stock.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.

We sincerely appreciate this offer on your part, and feel certain that our schools will be able to use these charts to good advantage. I have used them myself and like them very much.\n\nWe are still awaiting your new arithmetic series, as we have not yet settled definitely on a new arithmetic for our Indian schools in Grades Three and upwards. We are using your new Geography Workbooks for Eastern and Western Canada, and our teachers are finding them very useful and satisfactory.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Public Printing & Stationery,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nBFN/SD\nDear Bernie:\n\nOn a recent visit to the Interior of this Province I have been confronted with a large number of complaints from teachers concerning the failure of the Department to supply books and materials requested. Much of this material may be secured locally and this has aggravated the situation.\n\nI have asked the Indian Agents to purchase the most urgently needed supplies locally, and have asked the Department to approve my action. I do not know the reason for the failure to supply these things, but have tried to explain to the teachers that it is no doubt due to the present shortages. In one school in particular the teacher had visited schools in the east and made unfavourable comments concerning the difference in which materials are supplied to this Province.\n\nIn some cases, no doubt, requisitions were late in being sent in to the Department but I feel that this is not the whole explanation, as it seems unlikely nearly all the teachers would be late in forwarding their requisitions. If there is anything that you can do in the way of speeding up the delivery of the supplies requisitioned, it would be greatly appreciated.\n\nI recently visited Bill Mouat who is expecting a by-law for the addition to his school to be put before the Municipality in January. He is very hopeful about the outcome. Bill and his family are well.\n\nBest wishes to you, Betty and Patrick.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nLieut. Colonel B.F.

In my letter to the King's Printer I pointed out that requisitions pass through no fewer than eleven hands before the supplies are finally delivered to the teacher. Rest assured that I will let you know as soon as a reply is received from the King's Printer regarding my proposals for cutting short this long procedure.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMajor R.

If you require further quantities of the JOLLY NUMBERS Primer in order to fill orders, we are in a position to supply these immediately. The stock of JOLLY NUMBERS Book One and JOLLY NUMBERS Book Two First Half is in somewhat scarce supply, and we doubt that we will be able to arrange reprinting of these two titles until some time in February.\n\nWe appreciate very much the intimation that you will use approximately 3,000 of these books during the 1948-49 academic year. Such information enables us to arrange paper supplies and printing schedules so that we will not default on any of the orders.\n\nI am unable, at the present, to give you a quotation on the CARIBOU ARITHMETIC Grade Three. Our prices, and those of other publishers, have to be increased in the near future. As of December last, the price of cloth went up $0.14 a yard, and is now double the pre-war price and paper is likely to go up following the increase, a week or so ago, in the price of newspapers. As you probably know, pressmen are on strike at present and there is no indication that a settlement may be arrived at immediately. It is unpleasant to contemplate that the price of books is likely to be increased over those prices of last spring, but it is a problem which all publishers have to face at the present. I regret that for these reasons it is difficult to quote a price on CARIBOU ARITHMETIC, Grade Three. As soon as we are able to give you a quotation, we shall be pleased to let you know.\n\nThe Workbook for STORIES FOR EVERY DAY, the fifth-grade book in the Coronis Readers, is now in the second-proof stage, and we had hoped to have the Workbook ready before Christmas. Again, the date of publication of this Workbook is very dependent upon the settlement of the afore-mentioned strike, but we hope that this Workbook will be available early in the new year. The work on the Workbook for TREASURE TROVE has not progressed as far as that for STORIES FOR EVERY DAY.\nTo Colonel Neary\n\nGINN AND COMPANY, PUBLISHERS\n\nPage 2\n\nAs soon as these publications become ready, I will see that copies are sent to you for examination.\n\nI would like to take this opportunity to extend to you my best wishes for the coming year.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJBR/sf\nDecember 30, 1947.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed herewith please find Bills of Lading covering shipments forwarded via Northern Transportation Company Limited which you requested us to quote our requisitions numbers.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard F.

Neary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Neary,\n\nWe have 6,360 copies, in sheets, of JOE AND RUTH GO TO SCHOOL. The orders from the Department of Printing and Stationery for this book have been comparatively small in recent years, and we realize that the need for such a primer may be not as great now as it was when the book was first published. However, we only undertook to publish the book in the first case upon condition that the Department of Indian Affairs would eventually absorb our stock.\n\nWe are writing now to know if the Department would be willing to take these copies off our hands at a very cheap price? The last quantity with which we supplied you was sold to you in paper binding at a price of 59 cents net. We are pleased to quote you a price that will merely enable us to get back our costs out of the venture, and we should be grateful if you would advise us what can be done to take these copies off our hands, either this year or during the course of the next two years, as we have no sale for them elsewhere.\n\n6,360 copies in paper binding........... 26\u00a2\n\nWe shall very much appreciate your giving this matter consideration, and you may be sure that we will be willing to co-operate with you in any way possible.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nC. J. Eustace.\nJanuary 20th, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. Eustace:\n\nI have for answer your letter of January 9th.\n\nAt the present time we can take two thousand (2,000) of the primer \"Joe and Ruth Go To School\" from you. We are writing today to the Department of Public Printing and Stationery requesting that they place an order with you for this number, at the price quoted, viz. 26 cents each.\n\nWe will do everything possible to push the use of these books in our schools, and will advise you in the near future of the possibilities of taking further quantities of this text from you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

When I saw you, you expressed interest in our little FOREIGN FRIENDS Series, Abdul of Arabia, Manuel of Mexico, etc., as listed on page 7 of our Elementary Catalogue, which we are sending you under separate cover.\n\nWe have other books of this same inexpensive type, which you will find on pages 38, 39, and 41. You will also find many other inexpensive books from 5 cents up listed, particularly in the section beginning on page 34.\n\nWe would be very glad of the opportunity of sending you examination copies of anything you might like to see before purchasing.

I am taking the liberty of adding a set of INDIAN CUTOUTS, which might interest you, and also our LEARNING IS FUN Series, of which there are four books.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTHE BOOK SOCIETY OF CANADA LIMITED\nColonel Bernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nI have had on my desk for some weeks your letter of December 12 to Mr. Robinson and his reply of December 22. This had primarily to do with your letters of September 12 and 13.\n\nThe strike which has been going on in Toronto for the past four weeks has now been settled, the men having gone back to work yesterday. The settlement includes a retroactive increase in pay from $1.07\u00bd to $1.35, two weeks' holiday with pay as against one week, and eight statutory holidays with pay as against three. This, together with the sharp increases in the cost of materials, unfortunately is going to result in a very sharp increase in the price of books. So far we haven't worked out complete costs on our various titles. We were forced to raise a number of prices on January 1 of this year and other increases will probably have to be made when we have worked out complete costs.\n\nFor the time-being, however, we are able to quote you definitely on one book: CARIBOU ARITHMETICS, Grade Three. On this title we can give you a price of 80\u00a2. It seems to me that this book should be particularly suited for your needs inasmuch as it is written primarily for use in the small school where a teacher has more than one grade. It is, as far as I know, the only arithmetic at this grade level written from this point of view. The Grade-Four CARIBOU ARITHMETIC is in active preparation and will be ready next fall.\n\nThe workbook for STORIES FOR EVERY DAY is almost ready for press. I am sending you under separate cover a set of page proof of this book. This is not final proof and there may be some errors in it. You may rely on these being corrected before the book is published. Also we are making some minor changes here and there in the exercises, particularly in the poetry selections where the exercises will be less factual and more imaginative.\n\nWe have had this proof read by a number of very good teachers, and the changes which are being made are the result of suggestions from them. I hope you will decide to use this in your schools.\nNow that we have the workbook for STORIES FOR EVERY DAY practically finished, we are starting work on the workbook for TREASURE TROVE.\n\nCordially yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMarch\nAIRMAIL:\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nThere appear to be a number of schools in this Province which are not fully supplied with the Provincial Courses of Studies, and authority is requested to purchase the necessary copies to supply these schools.\n\nD.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMr. Norman Ingram,\nGinn & Company,\n563 Bay Street,\nToronto 5, Ont.\nFebruary 3, 1948.\n\nColonel Bernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nWelfare and Training Service,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nI have your letter of January 29, and I find that we received your order 61778 for 150 HEALTH, SAFETY AND SUCCESS and 75 YOUR HEALTH AND SAFETY on January 21 and that the order was shipped complete on January 27. I expect, therefore, that the Printing Bureau has the books by now.\n\nThe printers' strike has been settled on the basis of an increase in wages from $1.07\u00bd an hour to $1.35, with two weeks' holiday with pay in place of one, and eight statutory holidays with pay in place of three. Thus, it has been estimated that, counting these additional holidays, the actual wage increase is to $1.45, rather than to $1.35. The wage increase is retroactive to October 1, 1947. This, combined with increases in the price of paper and very drastic increases in the price of cloth have added tremendously to our manufacturing costs, and we are presently working on a new schedule of prices. The increases are going to be startling - somewhere between 20% and 30%, in many cases. This is just as astounding to us as it probably will be to you, but of course every publisher is in the same boat and there is nothing we can do about it. Our books could, of course, be cheapened by the use of lighter paper, the omission of colour, and that sort of thing, but the demand today is for a first-class book, and we don't think books cheapened in quality would meet with favour in the schools.\n\nWith all good wishes,\n\nCordially yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nNORMAN G.

The only exception that might be made is where they are asking for textbooks of the different provinces which are not carried in stock and which are urgently required.\n\nRegarding the delay, I might state there is no long delay if the department would send me their requisitions with a notation that the goods are urgently required. In many cases books that are required for Indian Schools are ordered from the publishers, but a delay is caused owing to the fact that they cannot be procured at once, in many cases they have not yet been printed.\n\nSome items such as scribblers, pencils, etc., are carried regularly in stock and could be supplies at once providing the department states they are urgently required. Evidently a lot of the delay is caused by the department's regulations as to where the goods should be ordered. In the Deputy Minister's letter he quotes the procedure that requisitions must take before the goods are supplied. A lot of these regulations are inter-departmental and is not caused by any delay on the part of this Department.\n\nI would suggest that before ordering goods the Department of Mines and Resources communicate with Col. B.F. Neary, Superintendent of the Indian Branch, Department of Indian Affairs, who will be in a position to state what text-books are used for his Indian Schools. As already stated many\nof ones for the Department of Mines and Resources are the same as those stocked for the Indian Schools.\n\nGoods that are not carried in stock are forwarded to the Controller of Purchases to be ordered. If there is any delay in ordering, it is not the fault of this Branch.\n\nI would suggest that the Department of Mines and Resources forward their requisitions to this office and preference will be given where the goods are marked urgent.\n\n(sgd.)

Needless to say we cannot comply with their request for free merchandise, but we do occasionally send them a few samples.\n\nWe cannot at the moment honestly remember just who the schools were, but we have the impression that one came from somewhere in Saskatchewan and another from an Indian school somewhere in Quebec.\n\nYou realize, we trust, that our letter to you was merely in the interest of educating these children and you will recall that we stated in our letter that the statements might probably be exaggerated. It might be in order to suggest that your Inspectors or whatever method you have for checking these things, be asked to keep their ears open for any complaints of this nature.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nEBERHARD FABER PENCIL CO.\nCANADA LTD.\n\nJ.S.

The Workbooks and Teacher's Manuals for the Grades V and VI Readers are in course of preparation and will be ready in the very near future.\n\nIn bringing these books to your attention, we would like to say that these are an entirely Canadian project\u2014the entire editorial and manufacturing work has been carried out here in our own plant. One interesting feature which we think will appeal to you is the fact that these Readers are in keeping with the modern trend of reading as outlined for elementary schools. They have a controlled vocabulary and with such tie in with the vocabulary load presented in the Curriculum Foundation Series, that is the elementary set of Readers produced by the Scott Foresman Company and distributed in Canada by the W. J. Gage Company. Teachers who have had the opportunity to examine and test our new books seem to be unanimous in their opinions regarding the presentation and the usefulness of our Readers. We believe they are also the first set of Canadian Readers prepared in Canada entirely by offset lithography.\nTHE COPP CLARK CO.\n\nColonel B. F.

Davey, District School Inspector,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nIn view of the contents of your letter of the 22nd ultimo, file O-11-1, we will in future address school supplies to \"The Teacher\" instead of the individual name of the teacher.\n\nWe have followed this procedure at some schools in the past but this practice also presents some difficulties and I therefore suggest the following:\n\n(1) That you notify the Indian Agents that we will adopt this procedure in connection with school supplies for schools in British Columbia.\n\n(2) That the Indian Agent in turn notify the schools in his Agency and advise each teacher that he or she should immediately get in touch with the post master of the post office where their mail is received and advise this official that any communications addressed \"The Teacher\" should be delivered to him or her.\n\nThis is especially necessary in the case of new teachers as it has happened in the past when the local post master is not personally acquainted with the teacher at an Indian day school. When he receives a letter or parcel addressed to \"The Teacher\" he is not definitely aware to whom it should be delivered.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nConsiderable confusion has arisen through the practice of addressing supplies and correspondence to individuals rather than to the teacher at a given school. As a result supplies and blue sheets from the Department of Public Printing and Stationery have been following teachers about the province, causing confusion and a shortage of goods for the schools concerned.\n\nIt is recommended that the Department might request all teachers to use a standard form of address such as the following sample:\n\nThe Teacher,\nPort Simpson Indian Day School,\nPort Simpson, B.C.\n\nThis would ensure that the supplies went to the school rather than to the teacher who might have moved away from that area.\n\nR.F.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nMr. Robinson has reported to me on his conversation with you and Mr. Doucet regarding the wood-working books. I understand that you do not care for either of the formats which I suggested but would prefer to have the book saddle-stitched, somewhat after the style of Jolly Numbers. This is perfectly feasible and we are working on this basis. I understand also that you do not like the idea of imitation typewriter type because you think that this would be harder for the children to read. That, also, is perfectly all right with us and we are planning to use regular school book type. I understand from Mr. Robinson that you wish a number of extra copies of the students' record sheet, the bill of material, and the chart of basic operations. Mr. Robinson said that you wished a price of $10,000 each of these sheets, as a separate form. It will be perfectly possible to have these made, but I wonder if it would not be better to provide a sample of each of these forms in the text of the book (which, I understand, is what Mr. Doucet wants) and then, at the back of the book, to print a number of copies of each of these and have the pages perforated so that they can be torn out. I think that you would find this much more satisfactory than handling loose sheets, and the difference in cost would be trifling.\n\nQuite a bit of editorial work has to be done on these pages in order to secure an attractive format. One of the troubles is that the amount of material on the pages varies in length. Another thing is that where we have drawings which occupy a full page, as in the case of the tea-pot stand, the instructions should face the drawing, so that the student doesn't have to turn the page to and fro while he is reading the instructions. Also, as a matter of routine, we want to check the material against the texts which are referred to. We have tried to obtain copies of these texts in Toronto but have been unable to do so, except in one case, namely HAND WOOD-WORKING by Evans, Parks, and Slatterie. Would you be good enough to mail to us copies of WOOD-WORK FOR JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS and INSTRUCTIONAL UNITS IN HAND WOOD-WORKING? We can return these to you eventually - I imagine you have an ample supply of these books.\n\nOne of our editors is working on the book just now, making a layout for it, and I shall write you in a day or so, giving you a figure for the book with the\nperforated sheets and also for the book with the sheets separately.\n\nI am glad that you were able to meet Miss Brodie when she was in Ottawa.\n\nCordially yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. I notice a sample of the type we may be using. How do you like it?\nApril 19, 1948.\n\nColonel H. Neary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nFrom Monday, April 26, until Saturday, May 1, I expect to be in Ottawa on my annual business trip.\n\nAs soon as I arrive, I shall telephone you for a definite appointment in the hope that there will be an opportunity to discuss our publications with you.\n\nAs usual, I am looking forward with pleasure to my trip to Ottawa.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nElementary Education\n\nIAW/C for THE MACMILLAN COMPANY OF CANADA LIMITED.\nApril 14th, 1948.\n\nMr. O. P. Larson,\nSuperintendent of Schools,\nBASSANO, Alberta.\n\nDear Mr. Larson:\n\nYou will have received by now a set of the FAITH AND FREEDOM readers for Grades One to Three. Please accept these books with the compliments of Ginn and Company through me.\n\nFAITH AND FREEDOM is a complete basal reading programme, made up of pupils' texts, workbooks, teachers' manuals and certain supplementary aids to reading. A list of all these materials with prices is attached to this letter.\n\nFAITH AND FREEDOM readers, as you know, are the authorized texts in primary reading for the Separate Schools of Saskatchewan. In addition, this new series is prescribed for use in the Catholic Indian schools throughout Canada, being supplied through the Department of Indian Affairs. Col. B. F. Henry, the superintendent of Indian schools, has asked me to draw your special attention to the FAITH AND FREEDOM Readers. It is of prime importance that the teachers have, and use, the appropriate teachers' manuals.\n\nIn several ways, the FAITH AND FREEDOM Readers are far in advance of all basal reading programmes. First of all, the stories in FAITH AND FREEDOM present situations which are part and parcel of every child's life at home and school and at play, and which develop moral choice and ethical action. This feature in itself is by no means new, but it is unique so far as any modern reading programme is concerned. FAITH AND FREEDOM has led the way, and there are signs that forthcoming readers will reflect a return to content illustrating the simple virtues, such as brotherly love.\n\nNo basal reading series today present the techniques of reading better than FAITH AND FREEDOM. The teachers' manuals which accompany each reading level teach every page of the primary books. More important though, than the lesson plans, is the fact that the manuals keep constantly before the teacher specific and varied techniques in presenting basal reading.\n\nIn the final analysis, though, the pupils' books themselves determine the real worth of any reading series. Here, when you come to examine the readers, you will find content based\nunmistakably on children's real life interests, yet the stories are always worthwhile and literate even at the pre-primer level. Even with this high literary standard, the first pre-primer, HERE WE COME, is the easiest pre-primer published today. In case you wish to make further comparisons with the FAITH AND FREEDOM Readers, I am attaching a pamphlet which gives a helpful analysis of the series. Please note particularly the vocabulary chart reproduced on Page 4.\n\nThere are many other features of the books that you will like. The vigorous and appealing illustrations by Charlotte Ware are works of art in themselves. Not least to the credit of the FAITH AND FREEDOM Readers is the sturdy binding designed to withstand the daily use to which basic texts are subject.\n\nFAITH AND FREEDOM is without question the leading reading series in its field. It is used basically in seven thousand of the eight thousand parochial schools in the United States. In addition to this, the series has been adopted in the Province of Quebec and in Newfoundland for use beginning in September.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nGINN AND COMPANY: PUBLISHERS\nFOUNDED IN 1867 BY EDWIN GINN\n\n863 Bay Street, Toronto 5\nApril 20th, 1948.\n\nColonel E.

The demonstration class did not perform as well as a smaller group, but I am afraid I was overly enthusiastic about the number of children she would like to handle in front of an audience.\n\nCopies of the FAITH AND FREEDOM Readers and the pamphlets, giving some of the details with regard to the mechanical aspects and the purpose of the Readers, have been sent to the four inspectors whose names you gave me. Since Mr. Litch travels this territory, he thought it better that he should write to these inspectors, and, when he is next in Alberta, visit them.\n\nFor your information, a copy of the letter which he has written these gentlemen is attached. I hope that it expresses what you would like them to know, and I am sure Mr. Litch will be able to give them a further briefing when he next sees them.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJBR/sf\nEncl.\nDear Sir:\n\nUnder separate cover, I am returning to you a number of library books which you kindly forwarded to me for my inspection.\n\nIt is our intention to order some of these texts when we are preparing our library list next year.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

If this is to supply only the Protestant schools the 300 copies should be sufficient, but if they are to be used in the Catholic schools as well I think the number should be increased to 600.\n\nI had a long visit from Bill Houst yesterday afternoon and he is debating whether to apply for an inspectorate that has been advertised in B.C. with the provincial Department. I think that he would like to go after the position but is hesitating because he would probably be stationed in the North. Living conditions in some of those places do not appeal to Jean and he also has the two children to consider of course. Apparently the addition to the high school is still at the planning stage. Jimmy McCammon has left him and has gone into Burnaby South. Otherwise he seems to be holding on to his staff fairly well, and apparently the last academic year has been a good one for him.\n\nWith best wishes to yourself and family,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.F.

Each cover is individually decorated in colors with an embossed picture reuse.\nThe text matter has been prepared by a number of noted authorities such as Vilhjalmur Stefansson, the famous explorer, and many others, who have traveled many thousands of miles with camera and typewriter to present this outstanding work to you.\n\nLANDS AND PEOPLES PROMOTES PEACE THROUGH UNDERSTANDING\n\nThere would be no wars if the peoples of the world could visit each other, discuss their mutual problems, learn each other's viewpoints and traditions.\n\nLands and Peoples makes these visits practical. It takes you right into the homes and the hearts of the peoples of every country in the world\u2014it teaches you to understand and sympathize with other cultures and other viewpoints.\n\n\"How can peoples get on with each other,\" says Dr. Bowman, in his introduction to Lands and Peoples, \"unless they do talk over their problems and try to understand each other in all their common ways as well as in their unusual and peculiar manifestations? To help understand the citizens of other countries these books on Lands and Peoples have been brought together, with a wealth of color and story. With all of them we as heirs of a 'human civilization,' have business or political relations and all of them act as real forces playing upon us and the rest of the world. They are realities, profoundly interesting realities with their unlikenesses, their (to us) strange civilizations, customs, religions, dress and food. Who would not wish to go a-voyaging among them?\"\n\nGENERAL ARRANGEMENT OF LANDS AND PEOPLES\n\nTHE SEVEN VOLUMES of the work are arranged to bring, so far as possible, contiguous countries together. Beginning with Western Europe we move eastward until the globe has been encircled. The dominions, territories or dependencies of a nation in another continent are treated not with the nation itself but according to their geographical location. For example, Algeria is described not under France, but in the volume on Africa. The general scope of each volume is indicated below.\n\nVOLUME I Western Europe\nIncludes England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Spain, Portugal and the islands of the Atlantic and of the Mediterranean, with 112 pages in full color.\n\nVOLUME II Central Europe\nIncludes Norway, Sweden, Finland, Greenland and Iceland, Denmark, Germany, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Austria-Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Hungary, Switzerland, the Toy States and Italy, with 88 pages in full color.\n\nVOLUME III\nIncludes a full treatment of Canada, Newfoundland and the United States, including Alaska and Hawaii, with special articles on...\nIn all the world there is no other set like it. It gives the student, the traveler, the lover of romance and the adventurer a true insight into the peculiarities, traditions, customs and backgrounds of every nation from the beginning of time to today.\n\nIt makes you understand the reason for national aspirations and ambitions; it puts action into history and makes the past live again.\n\nWhile fascinatingly interesting, the authority of Lands and Peoples is so well established that it has been recommended by Boards of Education everywhere for school use in the study of the social sciences, and it is the standard set in hundreds of educational institutions. Lands and Peoples is ideally adapted for the arrangements of pageants and costume shows.\n\nIt is an inspiring source of material for artists and designers, for writers and research workers, for schools, women's clubs and other cultural groups. It is often chosen for special study on such topics as Transportation, Food, Clothing, Forms of Government and other comprehensive subjects. Lands and Peoples is a rich storehouse of information and pictures on these and hundreds of other subjects. A few of the index headings will serve to show the range of project material: Agriculture, Air Service, Art Treasures, Betrothal Customs, Bridges, Monuments, Burial Customs, Canals, Colleges, Costumes, Customs, Dancing, Festivals, Industries, etc.\n\nLands and Peoples fits perfectly into school curricula wherever the social sciences are taught. It is grouped and arranged to go along with school courses and, for the convenience of teachers, students and general readers, is indexed as follows: Alphabetical Index in each volume; Cumulative Alphabetical Index in Volume VII; Cumulative Index of color plates in Volume VII; Table of Contents in each volume.\n\nLands and Peoples is written in simple, narrative style, and in addition to the descriptive text, contains an encyclopedic article of facts and figures at the end of the article on each country. Each volume is also heavily gold-stamped and gold-topped, with headbands and strongly reinforced back.\nAdventure... Romance... Thrills... Color... Understanding \u2014 are yours with this unique set... it truly makes the world an open book to you. It entertains you while it teaches... it takes you away from yourself, from your daily routine into the far-away corners of the globe... it hurdles time and space... it is the magic...\nkey that opens the doors of every country, every age and every race. It interprets the meaning of events...it explains the development of the human race...it makes you see with your own eyes why thrones totter, kings abdicate, dictators arise, why peoples rebel, why wars are fought, why old civilizations die and new ones are born.\nWITH LANDS AND PEOPLES.\n\nTravel and adventure need no longer be a dream. They become a delightful reality.\n\nDon't wait for vacation time\u2014travel now, tonight!\n\nDo you feel like a trip into the thirteenth-century Mongol empire of Kublai Khan? Open the second volume of Lands and Peoples\u2014and there you are!\n\nDo you long for the gaiety of Rio de Janeiro or the sunshine of Argentina? They are yours in all their brilliance and splendor\u2014and all you need do is sit down with Volume Seven in your easy chairs.\n\nOr perhaps a quick journey to Alaska's frozen North or picturesque Canadian Lake Louise? There it is, as if by magic, in Volume Six.\n\nMaybe it is far-away Tibet or Burma that strikes your fancy. It takes but a moment to reach for Volume Four, and you stand in the very heart of India. At your will, you are in Paris or Berlin, in Madrid or Rome, in Havana or Haiti, in Melbourne or Johannesburg.\nTO THE STUDENT, the artist, the designer, Lands and Peoples is indispensable.\n\nArranged for easy reference, grouped according to classifications, indexed so that even a child can quickly find his way, of facts and figures.\n\nIt makes the study of geography and social science a pleasure, research work becomes entertainment, and the creative mind finds Lands and Peoples a veritable Fountain of Youth.\n\n\"Within twenty-four hours after I got my set,\" says a noted commercial artist, \"I got an idea for a South Seas folder out of it that made me two hundred dollars. What an investment, in addition to the pleasure I get out of it.\"\n\nAnd here is a mother's comment: \"My twelve-year old girl never showed the slightest interest in geography. But since Lands and Peoples came into the house, she can't get enough of it.\"\nCalgary, Alberta,\nMay 13, 1948.\n\nRev. P. A.

But there have, of course, been changes in prices as the catalogues were issued some years ago.\n\nWe have large stocks of all general school supplies and could take care of orders for the heavier goods such as Pupils' Desks, Blackboards, all the way down to the smaller supplies that may be needed.\n\nWe are enclosing herewith some supplementary lists.

In addition to the equipment required, a considerable quantity of general supplies will no doubt be needed and we would appreciate very much the opportunity to be of service.\n\nFrom time to time we have been in contact with the Indian agents at various locations in Ontario regarding equipment required in Indian day schools in the process of erection, and from the meagre results obtained it appears that the actual orders are placed by the Ottawa Division of the Indian Affairs Branch. On the other hand, such supplies as we have shipped during the past year or so have been in connection with orders placed by Mr. A. Gay, through the Department of Public Printing & Stationery. If you will provide us with any definite information as to whom it will be best to contact in connection with the supplies and equipment required for the new projects, we will be very grateful.\n\nIn the meantime, we have placed your name on our permanent mailing list and you will receive all publications within a short time after they have been received from the printers. Should you desire any additional information in connection with the foregoing, please address correspondence to the attention of the writer so that the necessary details can be forwarded promptly.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE GEO.

I quite realize that this is the busiest time of the year as far as school supplies are concerned. You will readily agree that it is important that the schools get their supplies before September as the teachers on opening the schools start re-ordering supplies on the assumption that the original requisition did not reach Ottawa, resulting in duplication of work, cost and material.\n\nTo assist you in speeding up the delivery of the supplies, I am discontinuing to send further requisitions for Supplementary Reading Books and it will be in order for you to discontinue shipping out any Supplementary Reading Books for the present, but to concentrate on the regular school supplies until it is felt that the requisitions for school supplies are satisfactorily cleared up. Then we will proceed with the shipping of library books.\n\nSincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMr. J.W. Driscoll,\nSupt. of Stationery,\nDept. of Public Printing & Stationery,\nOttawa.\n\nMFT/HM.\nAugust 13, 1948.\n\nMr. Bernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRE: File 1-1-4\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe appreciate your cooperation in replying to our recent inquiry concerning equipment and supplies for Indian schools and hope that a much larger volume of business in our lines can be developed. However, it is noted that the requirements of teachers and pupils will continue to be requisitioned through the Department of Public Printing & Stationery, so must endeavour to convince officials concerned that we offer a superior selection of suitable items, based on 50 years' experience in the educational field.\n\nRegarding blackboards, we list three different kinds of material on pages 12 and 13 of catalogue #47A, copy of which was sent you last month. There is as follows: Natural Slate, Black Hyloplate, Green Lite-Site. If you are not familiar with any or all of these, please let us know and we will see that you are provided with samples. At the same time we hope you can give us some idea as to what quantities are likely to be needed for institutions under your jurisdiction, because special terms would apply and we would like to be placed in a position to estimate minimum costs according to the amount and method of purchasing. By the latter we have in mind that you may intend to order in bulk and distribute from Ottawa, while would be the most economical from our point of view - while on the other hand, direct consignments of small lots to various destinations would automatically increase the overhead in handling, crating, etc.\n\nMuch the same remarks apply to school furniture and here again we should have some indication as to size, quantities, and, of course, it is important to know the type of pupils' desks that you prefer for Indian schools. A few are listed on pages 2 to 4 of catalogue #47A, and we\nhave enclosed some bulletins of new styles which, though more expensive than the older models, are smarter, modern and more practical.\n\nLooking forward to hearing further from you shortly, we are\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE GEO.

It fills a long-felt want. Immature bodies need no longer be accommodated on hard, uncomfortable chairs of poor design and doubtful construction.\n\nThe appealing appearance of this model is equalled by the practical features that have been embodied. Seat and back are softly upholstered in tan Fabrikoid, durable and serviceable in all respects. The frame is of bright chrome steel tubing, gracefully shaped and built to assure a lifetime of hard use. The legs are domed; cushioned glides can be added if required.\n\nTrustees and School Officials should see that their Junior Grade rooms are equipped with this outstanding chair.\n\nQuotations will be provided upon request.\n\nThe GEO.

Inspector Davey has contacted this company and has been informed by them that they can make delivery within a week of quantities up to 1,000 sq. ft.\n\nThese blackboards come in standard sizes of 4 x 8, 4 x 12 and 4 x 10. They can also supply sheets of the same length in a 3\u00bd ft. width. The price which they are prepared to give us is $6 per sq. ft., f.o.b. the factory crated for shipment.\n\nA chalked sample of the green colour is forwarded under separate cover. This board is almost identical with the Minster blackboard with which the Department is familiar. Inspector Davey is of the opinion that it would give good service.\n\nI might add that we have no difficulty in securing Hyloplate or Minster blackboard in small quantities for our B.M.S. Schools.\n\nW. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nAugust 18, 1948\n\nR. A.

We would, therefore, appreciate instructions from you to proceed with the manufacture of the additional 350 units for which the penitentiary has the materials, on the same basis.\n\nYour letter of December 13, 1946, suggests that chair desks be made up 60% of the small size, 20% of each medium and large.

Neary\nSupt. of Indian Education\nRe: File 1-1-4 (E.)\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nWe acknowledge receipt of your August 16th inquiry concerning prices and types of available school desks. Unfortunately, we are unable to supply the required details as at the present time, we are not producing any type of school desk.\n\nDuring the war years, it became necessary to eliminate many of our lines due to material shortage and one of these was the school desks which was hardest hit not only because of a lack of good lumber but also pig iron and scrap iron was unavailable to produce the castings. Since cessation of hostilities, the lumber market has been anything but good and in fact, we would not produce school desks from the very poor stock that is available on the market. Consequently we have not re-entered this line nor can we see any future improvement for quite some time.\n\nMost desk manufacturers are much in the same position as ourselves and we hesitate offering even a suggestion as to where you might contact a possible source of supply.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCANADA FOUNDRIES & FORGINGS LTD.\n\nG.

F. Neary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and\nNatural Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nThe workbook for STORIES FOR EVERY DAY is now ready and I am sending you a copy with my compliments. This workbook was written by a first-class teacher who has been using the corresponding text for several years. We think we have a very good workbook, thoroughly in line with modern pedagogical ideas. I would draw your special attention to the list of skills developed which is given on the inside of the back cover. I believe you ordered some of these books some time ago but that you cancelled your orders as the book was not ready. I am hopeful that with its publication you will reinstate your orders.\n\nMr. Robinson has written me of his talk with you and explained the delay in the approval of the woodworking project. I hope we may receive your approval within the next three or four days. We have, as you know, already done the bulk of the work on the first book of this series and get it out for you in very short order once we receive a final clearance.\n\nMr. Robinson tells me that you and Phil are going to the C.E.A. in Winnipeg. I shan't be able to attend the meetings this year, but Mr. Litch will be there, and I hope you will see something of each other. Best wishes for a pleasant trip.\n\nCordially yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nNGSI/MMS\nOctober 12, 1948.\n\nMr. Bernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nTwo months have elapsed since we wrote you regarding equipment and supplies for Indian schools but, up to the present moment, nothing further seems to have resulted and we wondered what action, if any, had been taken towards purchasing requirements.\n\nYou will appreciate that we cannot supplement catalogues with specific details or costs relating to groups of items or individual lines until we obtain your reply to various points raised in the exchange of correspondence.\n\nWe hope you will be in a position to guide us shortly and, if you feel that a discussion of such matters would facilitate consideration, we shall be glad to arrange for a representative to pay a visit to Ottawa.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE GEO.

The new Compton's is further improved in every way. No doubt you are familiar with \"Compton's Pictured Encyclopedia\" as it is in so many libraries and schools throughout Canada.\n\nThe price to you would be $109.50 f.o.b. Chicago per set. There would be no duty, of course, but delivery and any other charges would be additional. In other words I am quoting you a net price in Chicago. However, on a purchase of five or more sets there is a discount of $5.00 and there is also a discount of $5.00 a set for cash - 60 days. We are giving a further discount to schools and libraries who are turning in old sets and in the event of your being desirous of placing a fair size order, we would like to discuss the matter with you further or you could take the matter up with the Compton people in Chicago if you prefer.\n\nYours truly,\n\nFred Sturgess\n\nFS:MB\nOctober 20, 1948.\n\nCorbeil-Hooks, Inc.,\n431 St. James Street West,\nMontreal, P.

B. Dick Company\nWhat are die-impressed stencils? Stencils furnished with your ruled form or heading already stenciled into the stencil sheet. You add necessary typed or handwritten information and from this master produce both the form and added text on blank paper stock, in one duplicating operation. Saves time and cost of printed forms, and all problems incident to their storage.\n\nHow die-impressed stencils are used. These stencils are used to add variable fill-in copy to constant forms. They save time and labor when used for individual daily or weekly reports or notices. They expedite production and simplify controls when used to produce papers needed for paper-work systems or procedures.\n\nFor complete procedures. By using die-impressed stencils and blocking out portions of the constant form and the variable fill-in copy, complete systems and routines can be worked out so that rewriting of the fill-in copy is eliminated. This is done by designing the forms needed for a complete procedure in such a way that all data needed for all forms used in the complete procedure will appear on the stencil, but will be so located that certain portions, not needed for certain steps in the procedure, may be blocked out as required.\n\nCharges... only three cost factors are involved: 1. The cost of the stencil sheets. 2. Type composition for special die (applies only to the first order). Submit copy for estimate. 3. Die-impressing charge\u2014based on quantity ordered. Quotation on request.\n\nThese two services of A. B. Dick Company eliminate the delays and errors due to rewriting of fill-in copy on forms used singly or in procedures. They also provide a practical and efficient method of producing the forms needed.\n\nA. B. Dick Company representatives will be glad to consult with you and give you any additional information you may need to determine whether or not die-impressed and form-topped stencils can be used to advantage in your organization. Call or write A. B. Dick Company, Chicago 6. You will not be obligated in any way.\nAny Mimeograph brand stencil sheet except 1860 may be die-impressed or form-topped\n\nWhat are form-topped stencil sheets? Stencil sheets prepared with facsimile of your printed form in contrasting color on each stencil sheet surface to guide typists in positioning fill-in copy accurately. The form-topped stencil, with copy typed in position, is used on the Mimeograph duplicator to reproduce the fill-in information on preprinted forms.\n\nHow form-topped stencil sheets are used. Form-topped stencil sheets are used when duplicated copy is to be added to preprinted forms. If identical copy must be added to several different preprinted forms, the forms should be so designed that the fill-in copy will be located in the same position on each printed form.\n\nFor complete procedures. Form-topped stencils are used for complete procedures in the same way that die-impressed stencils are used. The main advantage of form-topped stencils is that as many copies as you need can be produced from one typing, and several different printed forms may be filled in from only one typing. This reduces production time sharply and eliminates retyping errors. Unless it is necessary to use printed forms, die-impressing is usually preferred to form-topping because it eliminates the cost of printing and storing large quantities of forms.\n\nCharges...only two cost factors are involved: 1. Cost of stencil sheets. 2. Fixed preparatory charge, regardless of the quantity ordered, on standard-size stencil sheets: initial order, $16.00; repeat order, $9.00. Alterations on repeat orders require a new plate, for which initial preparatory charges apply.\nMimeograph brand inks produce the clean-cut, easy-to-read, permanent copies which are essential to the maximum usefulness of Mimeograph stencil duplication. These inks\u2014\n\n... do not fade or deteriorate, even under adverse handling conditions\n\n... produce good copies on a variety of weights, finishes and colors of paper and card stocks\n\n... function efficiently in the cylinders of Mimeograph duplicators\n\n... can be stored for long periods without deterioration\n\n... provide maximum in Mimeograph results\u2014at low cost per copy.\n\nMimeograph oil-base inks... 767, 1767, 7290, 1590, 1591. These inks are all-purpose inks that give dense, black, permanent copies, suitable for all general duplicating work. Most satisfactory when used on paper or card stock having an absorptive surface. Will not dry or harden in the interior of the cylinder. Mimeograph stencils used with these inks may be filed and rerun, without cleaning, if filed in Mimeograph Oilsorb filing wrappers in accordance with directions.\n\nMimeograph oil-base inks... 1767, 767, 7290, 7280 give intensely black copies and a large number of copies per pound. Preferred for quality work. 1767 for use in closed cylinders, but may also be used in open-type cylinders. 767, 7290 and 7280 for use in open-type cylinders only. 767 or 7290 preferred for normal operating speeds at normal temperatures. 7290 also excellent for high-speed duplication. 7280 preferred for all duplicator speeds where temperatures are unusually cool.\n\n1590 and 1591 give good black copies and are very satisfactory for general office work. May be used in either closed or open cylinders. 1591 preferred for high-speed duplication.\n\nMimeograph emulsion-type inks... 1757X, 1767X. These all-purpose inks give permanent black copies with sharp letter outline. Minimum offset when used on absorptive papers; therefore they are adapted for two-side work. Especially recommended for quality reproduction. Mimeograph stencils used with these inks may be filed and rerun, without cleaning, if filed in Mimeograph Oilsorb filing wrappers in accordance with directions.\n\n1767X and 1757X can be used in either closed or open cylinders. 1767X is preferred for normal duplicator speeds. 1757X is preferred for high speeds.\n\nCLOSED CYLINDER INKS (May also be used in open cylinders)\n\n| No. | Description       | For Models |\n|-----|------------------|------------|\n| 1767X | Black Mimeotone | 100, 96, 93, 92, 91, 788, 778 |\n| 1757X | Black Mimeotone high speed | 100, 96, 93, 92, 91, 788, 778 |\n| 1591 | Black Mimecon    | 100, 96, 93, 92, 91, 788, 778 |\n| 1767 | Black Standard   | 96, 93, 92, 91, 72, 788, 778 |\n| 1590 | Black Mimecon    | 96, 93, 92, 91, 72, 788, 778 |\n\nSupplied in one-pound containers.

Last year, as in former years, there were some delays in deliveries of school supplies. This year, the following two steps were taken in order to expedite the passing of requisitions from here to the Stationery Branch of the Department of Public Printing and Stationery:\n\n1. In the November 1947 issue of the Indian School Bulletin, we sent out a standard school requisition form, a copy of which is attached. This was sent in duplicate and Principals of Residential Schools were asked to forward it to the Department by December 31, 1947. Day School Teachers were asked to forward it to the Department by May 31, 1948. These attached forms were designed to assist both our own clerks and those in the Stationery Branch by having all items listed in a standard order. In the past, a requisition form such as appendix (b) attached had been used.\n\n2. The date upon which requisitions were to reach the Department was advanced from June 30, 1948, to May 31, 1948, as indicated above. In this way, it was felt we would provide an extra month for the Stationery Branch to fill requisitions and thus ensure their arrival at the schools concerned before school opening in September.\nJust how badly these requisitions have been filled can best be indicated by the three samples which I have attached. In each instance, these requisitions were sent from here in three or four days after their arrival to the Stationery Branch on the special forms provided. It would then seem that long delays occurred before the orders were even typed on these special delivery record slips used. The chart hereunder shows the long delays which occurred in the filling of these requisitions.\n\nI would emphasize that these three requisitions were selected by me at random from the top of the last batch of delivery records sent here from Stationery:\n\n| Name of School | Date sent to Stationery Branch | Date typed on Delivery Record | Date parcel sent School |\n|----------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Bella Coola, B.C. | May 26 | July 2 | September 14 |\n| Old Sun, Alberta | May 20 | July 2 | September 9 |\n| Ahtahkakoops, Sask. | May 26 | July 2 | September 10 |\n\nIt can be seen from the above that these teachers did as requested. Not only were their requisitions forwarded to the Department before May 31, but the requests were sent to the Stationery Branch from here before that date.\n\nAs I have previously told you, we are now receiving a deluge of complaints from teachers, principals, superintendents and regional supervisors. We are forwarding a letter in each case to the Stationery Branch to indicate to them the serious discontent on the part of our teachers with the way in which these school supplies are being handled.\n\nI have visited Mr. Driscoll, the Superintendent of Stationery, from whom I have always received the utmost in\nco-operation. He informed me that these delays were mainly due to shortages of staff and to absences because of illness and holidays. He has promised that two or more extra men will be put immediately on to filling back requisitions.\n\nI feel, however, that this will merely alleviate the present condition and will in no way remedy it.\n\nI find that I am answering letters and handling problems which should never reach my attention if these supplies were being issued properly. For example, the requisition for the Fort McPherson Indian Day School was sent from here on June 8, 1946. We were quite confident that it would reach Waterways in July. Instead, it reached there in late August or early September. As a result, it was necessary for my staff and our field staff to take the following action:\n\n1. The parcel was returned here from Waterways.\n2. It was opened here and divided into two parts, namely Essential and Non-essential.\n3. Two smaller parcels were made up and were shipped to Mr. Indian Superintendent Robertson at Edmonton.\n4. He was asked to send the small parcel of essential supplies by Air Express to Fort McPherson.\n5. He was asked to send the large parcel, next Spring, on the first boat.\n\nI do not feel that my time or that of the field staff should be taken up in remedying such situations as are caused by the apparent inefficiency of another department. Therefore I feel strongly that this other department must improve the facilities for handling our supplies or must be prepared to have these supplies taken out of their charge and handled by this Branch. I have prepared a draft letter for the Deputy Minister's signature to the King's Printer, with specific recommendations for the improvement of the delivery of our school supplies.\n\nBernard F.

Please note the large number of letters on this file dealing with our endeavours to locate textbooks of various kinds, from publishers and suppliers in different parts of the country.\n\n(b) 1-1-4 containing letters to and from the Stationery Branch.\n\nI would particularly draw your attention to the letter marked \"flag one\" on file 1-1-4. You will note that on July 23 we became worried over the delays which were occurring in the filling of orders. In order to assist the Stationery Branch, we held up our requisitions for library books and for supplementary readers so that they could concentrate on standard supplies and get these latter items out to the schools by September first. You will note that in this letter I drew Mr. Driscoll's attention to the fact that they were running about one month behind the normal interval for delivery.\n\nI would also draw your attention to Flag No. 2 (File 1-1-4) namely the letter from the King's Printer. Please note that Mr. Jackson first wrote to the King's Printer on October 31, 1947, and no reply being received, again wrote on January 6. A reply finally arrived from the King's Printer on January 27.\n\nI will draw no conclusion from the above facts but will let them speak for themselves.\n\nTo summarize: we have been in constant touch with the Stationery Branch and have done everything possible to keep them advised as to our requirements. I hope that this will clarify the situation for you.\n\nBernard F. Healy,\nSupt. of Education.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nCOL.

In your reply dated January 27, 1948, you stated as follows:\n\n\"I may add that with the return to normal conditions it is hoped that the unavoidable delays complained of by your teachers in Indian schools will be completely eliminated.\"\n\nOur Indian schools have now been open for nearly two months of the academic year. In most instances the teachers at these schools submitted their requisitions in the late spring and these were forwarded to the Stationery Branch in May or June. Every day's mail brings another series of letters of complaints from these teachers concerning the non-delivery of these supplies. I understand that our Superintendent of Stationery has discussed this matter with your Superintendent of Stationery and that efforts are being made to catch up on back requisitions as fast as possible. However, while this might alleviate the condition, it will not remedy it.\n\nThe children in our Indian schools are now reaching higher grades than previously. It no longer suffices to give them a ruler, an arithmetic book and a few scribblers and pencils. In the senior grades they must be provided with\nthe history, geography and literature texts as prescribed in provincial courses of study. We must also equip our schools with supplementary reading and library books, as recommended by provincial departments of education.\n\nI realize only too well that this means an increased number of books to be handled by your Stationery Branch. However, I would point out that as the years go by, we have every hope that more Indian children will reach higher grades and that even more books will be required than are at present being supplied.\n\nTherefore, I would again ask you to consider the recommendation made in my letter of October 31, 1947. I feel that by authorizing the Indian Affairs Branch to purchase its own textbooks as indicated in this letter, it will do a great deal towards reducing the volume of work being required of your Stationery Branch.\n\nIt is quite possible that you might wish to present some other solution to this problem. If so, I would welcome an opportunity of discussing this matter with you and possibly some of your senior officials.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Minister.\nNovember 2, 1948.\n\nB.F. Neary, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Bern:\n\nI am sending you under separate cover a copy of a T.B. Unit which we have developed for use in our B.C. schools. Probably I should have referred this to you before taking any specific action but I was anxious to get it in operation in the current year and I felt that you would certainly approve of the idea. I am afraid the unit is a little bit rough in spots but possibly it could be improved in subsequent years. I would be very pleased to have your reaction towards it. A considerable amount of help has been received from Dr. Barclay, who was primarily responsible for its development. A lot of the work in organizing it was done by Mr. George Sinclair who was formerly employed at the Alberni Residential School. Mr. Sinclair suffers from a severe arthritic condition and is unable to do very much in the way of classroom work. He has now accepted an appointment to the elementary correspondence branch in Victoria, where I believe, he is doing quite well.\n\nI have just returned from a long trip in the North, including visits to the Lejac and Cariboo Residential Schools. The matter of the supply of books is still a considerable headache and I cannot see why there should be the long delay which occurs in almost every school before the receipt of the supplies requisitioned.\n\nAs you will have heard by now the Hazelton School Board has approved in principle the operation of a combined Indian and white school at that point, and as you know we have also received applications from two other school boards for\nassistance in capital expenditures. I believe that this is distinct progress and I hope that the Department will be able to give us an early reply as to the possibility of assistance towards capital expenditures in these cases. I know that the Lytton school board, which is one of the cases mentioned, is awaiting the Department's reply before determining its policy for admitting additional Indian pupils to their schools.\n\nOn the whole the work is going much more smoothly and at the moment I am considerably encouraged by an improvement in the calibre of teachers we are securing. There are however one or two notable exceptions which may have been brought to your attention.\n\nWhile up North I visited the Anaham Indian Day School where the Sister in charge conducted a potato club with considerable success. I have asked her to send me a synopsis of their activities which I will forward on to you. I should like very much to have an account of this activity included in one of the issues of the bulletin as I feel that in this particular case it has been very worthwhile, not only from the standpoint of the educational value to the pupils, but the parents also have, I believe, learned something from this activity. One of the parents is saving the crop harvested by the pupil for seed for next year. However I will give you more on this when I hear from the teacher.\n\nI am sorry that you were unable to get out to B.C. on your last trip but we will be looking forward to a visit from you some time in the near future. I notice that you have a number of problems that you will be bringing along with you and I am sure that we can add considerably to your troubles. A visit by you to the Coast would certainly be worthwhile as both Mr. Arneil and myself have several things which could best be decided by a conference with you.\n\nWith very best wishes,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBob.\nNovember 5, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nACTING DIRECTOR,\n\nHereunder please find the following files:\n\n(a) 1-1-4 dealing with correspondence to and from firms supplying school supplies of all kinds.

The expenditure required by this requisition is strictly unavoidable and the public interest will suffer if it is not made.\n\nSIGNED\u2014\n\nAPPROVED\u2014\n\nFOR Director\n\n(1) Group requisitions for equipment, supplies and material according to commodity, i.e. books, stationery, printing, electrical goods, hardware, machinery, provisions, transportation equipment, etc.\n(2) Avoid issuing requisitions for one item only, except in cases of emergent necessity.\n(3) Furnish exact details of product required.\n\nForm 17a\u2014R-3015\u20143002\nOttawa, November 25, 1948.\n\nThe King's Printer,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYou will recall that on October 31, 1947, I wrote to you with regard to the delays which have occurred in the delivery of school supplies from the Stationery Branch to our Indian day and residential schools across Canada. In your reply dated January 27, 1948, you stated as follows:\n\n\"I may add that with the return to normal conditions it is hoped that the unavoidable delays complained of by your teachers in Indian schools will be completely eliminated.\"\n\nOur Indian schools have now been open for nearly three months of the academic year. In most instances the teachers at these schools submitted their requisitions in the late spring and these were forwarded to the Stationery Branch in May or June. Every day's mail brings another series of letters of complaints from these teachers concerning the non-delivery of these supplies. For example, our District Inspector of Indian Schools for British Columbia recently reported as follows:\n\n\"I have just returned from a long trip in the North, including visits to the Lejac and Cariboo Residential Schools. The matter of the supply of books is still a considerable headache and I cannot see why there should be the long delay which occurs in almost every school before the receipt of the supplies.\"\nwith your Superintendent of Stationery, and that every effort is being made to fill all requisitions forwarded to the Stationery Branch.\n\nOur Education Division has done its utmost to expedite the passing of requisitions to your Stationery Branch. The following two steps have been taken during the recent academic year in order that there would be no unnecessary delay from the time the requisitions left the teacher until the time they were typed and sent over to your Stationery Branch:\n\n(1) A standard school requisition form, a copy of which is attached, has been prepared and sent out in duplicate to all our teachers. Residential school principals were asked to forward this requisition, as well as a requisition for other than standard supplies, to our department by December 31, 1947.\n\n(2) As previously, we endeavored to have our day school requisitions forwarded at a different time of the year than the residential school requisitions in order that the Stationery Branch could handle them more promptly. This year, the date upon which day school requisitions were to reach the department was advanced from June 30 to May 31, 1948. In this way, it was felt that we would provide an extra month for the Stationery Branch to fill requisitions and thus ensure their arrival at the schools concerned before the opening date in September.\n\nThree samples were picked at random from the top of a recent lot of delivery records sent here from Stationery. In each instance, our records show that the requisition was sent from our Education Division within three or four days after its arrival here to the Stationery Branch on the special forms provided. From the chart below, it would seem evident that long delays occurred before these orders were even typed on the special delivery record slips used:\nAfter our representations of last year, there was an improvement in the shipping of these school supplies. In most instances, the residential school requisitions were shipped out in fairly good time; however, after the Stationery Branch re-opened following the stock-taking period, it became evident that the shipping of supplies was slowing up again, either due to the shortage of staff or to the holiday season. Because of this, our Superintendent of Education wrote to Mr. Driscoll on July 23, drawing his attention to the fact that delivery was falling behind the receipt of requisitions. A copy of this letter is attached, and you will note that we discontinued the sending over of supplementary reading book requisitions in order that the standard supplies could be shipped out in time for school opening.\n\nAs a result of the lack of supplies, the progress of our pupils is not being maintained at the rate which our school inspectors have a right to expect. This situation also has a serious effect on our teachers; they are doing everything possible to improve the standard of our schools. Particularly in the higher grades, it is most discouraging for them to start the school year without the texts which they ordered some four or five months previously. Because of this long delay in the delivery of supplies, our Indian schools may face a serious problem. During recent years, every effort has been made to improve the calibre of our teachers and of the instruction given in our Indian schools. These Indian children are now reaching higher grades than previously attained. It no longer suffices to give them a reader, an arithmetic book and a few\nscribblers and pencils. In the senior grades they must be provided as and when required with the history, geography and literature texts as prescribed in provincial courses of study. We must also equip our schools with supplementary reading and library books, as recommended by provincial departments of education.\n\nI realize only too well that this means an increased number of books to be handled by your Stationery Branch. However, I would point out that as the years go by, we have every hope that more Indian children will reach higher grades and that even more books than are at present being supplied will be required.\n\nI would therefore again ask you to consider the recommendation made in my letter of October 31, 1947. I feel that by authorizing the Indian Affairs Branch to purchase its own textbooks, as indicated in this letter, it will do a great deal towards reducing the volume of work being required of your Stationery Branch. We realize only too well the growth in the amount of supplies which have to be purchased by your department. I am advised that your Superintendent of Stationery has always done everything possible to cooperate with me requests for the stocking of supplies and textbooks. It would seem that he is seriously hampered, however, by lack of staff and space in shipping out these supplies within a reasonable time.\n\nI feel that by authorizing the Indian Affairs Branch to purchase its own textbooks, as indicated in this letter, it will do a great deal towards reducing the volume of work being required of your Stationery Branch at the present time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Minister.\n\n[Signature]\n\nWH/RM\n| QUANTITY | DESCRIPTION                                      | PRICE | AMOUNT |\n|----------|--------------------------------------------------|-------|--------|\n| 10       | No. 0-114                                         |       |        |\n| 10       | Rural Schi Bulletin                               | .10   | 1.00   |\n| 10       | Sup. 1, Bulletin for Industrial Arts             | .25   | 2.50   |\n| 10       | Mem. for Schi Libraries                           | .35   | 3.50   |\n| 10       | Listof Library Not Authorized for use in Pub.     | .75   | 7.50   |\n|          | Schis of B.C.                                     |       |        |\n| 10       | Kindergarten Man.                                 | 1.30  | 13.00  |\n\n**TOTAL:** 27.50\n\n**TAX EXEMPT**\n| QUANTITY | DESCRIPTION                                      | PRICE | AMOUNT |\n|----------|-------------------------------------------------|-------|--------|\n|          | No. (called)                                    |       |        |\n| 10       | Rural Sch.

Dent & Sons (Canada) Limited,\n224 Bloor Street West,\nToronto Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Eustace:\n\nI have answered your letter of November 12 and today had an opportunity of discussing its contents with our new Director. He knows Mrs. Thornton quite well because of his previous experience as Indian Commissioner of B. C.\n\nIt has been decided that we would have to have an opportunity of reading Mrs. Thornton's manuscript before we can commit ourselves as to the purchase of some five hundred copies. We would like to ascertain its value for use as a school book and library book.\n\nI would be glad to hear further from you in this regard.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMemorandum:\n\nMajor MacKay,\n\nPlease find attached a self-explanatory letter received from Mr. Bustace of J. M. Dent & Sons concerning Mrs. Thornton's book. You will note that the price will be $4.00 a copy (less 1/3 discount) and will include 44 black and white photographs and four four-colour photos. This is undoubtedly why the book is so expensive.\n\nI would welcome an opportunity of discussing this correspondence with you.\n\nEncl.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nJ. M. DENT & SONS (CANADA) LIMITED\nPUBLISHERS\n224 Bloor Street West\nTORONTO, CANADA\n\nNovember 12, 1948.\n\nMr. Bernard F. Neary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Neary,\n\nI was so sorry to miss you in Ottawa last time I was there. I met Miss Juliette Gauthier de la Verendrye. I do think that she has a good deal of interesting material, and we have asked her to prepare a manuscript for us. This obviously is the first thing to do.\n\nI discussed very briefly with Mr. Phelan the possibility of publishing Mrs. Thornton's book on her interviews with outstanding West Coast Indians. She has built the book around interviews with Indians whose portraits she has painted in oil. Personally I think her paintings are very fine, and certainly the book is worthy of publication. As I explained to Mr. Phelan, however, we would have to print a minimum of 1500 copies of this book to make it a publishing venture and even then we can not foresee a market of more than 600 or 700 copies of the book in Canada. The only way, however, that we can make Mrs. Thornton an offer for her book would be to find someone who would be willing to underwrite a certain number of copies in order to make publication possible. We have a tentative quotation on producing 1500 copies of the book. It would make a 240 page book and would contain 44 black and white photographs of Mrs. Thornton's oil paintings and coloured frontispiece, as well as four four-colour photos. We should have to sell this book for about $4.00 a copy.\n\nWe are wondering if the Department of Indian Affairs would care to go into the question of making the publication of this book possible by purchasing 500 copies of the book at $4.00 less one-third discount. Even with this assistance, I can assure you that the book would be, so far as we are concerned, not in the category of the usual commercial publication but rather what we call a prestige book. By this we mean that we believe that the book is worth publishing, but that its character prevents it from finding a market wide enough to make it a paying proposition from our point of view.\n\nI am hoping very much that the Department will interest themselves in this book, since I believe it will constitute a permanent record of the appearance and life stories of a number of very interesting Indian characters whose lives will otherwise not be known to posterity.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nC.J.E./h\n\nC.

Last year, as in former years, there were some delays in deliveries of school supplies. This year, the following two steps were taken in order to expedite the passing of requisitions from here to the Stationery Branch of the Department of Public Printing and Stationery:\n\n1. In the November 1947 issue of the Indian School Bulletin, we sent out a standard school requisition form, a copy of which is attached. This was sent in duplicate and Principals of Residential Schools were asked to forward it to the Department by December 31, 1947. Day School Teachers were asked to forward it to the Department by May 31, 1948. These attached forms were designed to assist both our own clerks and those in the Stationery Branch by having all items listed in a standard order. In the past, a requisition form such as appendix (b) attached had been used.\n\n2. The date upon which requisitions were to reach the Department was advanced from June 30, 1948, to May 31, 1948, as indicated above. In this way, it was felt we would provide an extra month for the Stationery Branch to fill requisitions and thus ensure their arrival at the schools concerned before school opening in September.\nJust how badly these requisitions have been filled can best be indicated by the three samples which I have attached. In each instance, these requisitions were sent from here in three or four days after their arrival to the Stationery Branch on the special forms provided. It would then seem that long delays occurred before the orders were even typed on these special delivery record slips used. The chart hereunder shows the long delays which occurred in the filling of three requisitions.\n\nI would emphasize that these three requisitions were selected by me at random from the top of the last batch of delivery records sent here from Stationery:\n\n| Name of School | Date sent to Stationery Branch | Date typed on Delivery Record | Date parcel sent School |\n|----------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Bella Coola, B.C. | May 26                          | July 2.                      | September 14            |\n| Old Sun, Alberta | May 20                          | July 2.                      | September 9             |\n| Ahtahkakoops, Sask. | May 26                        | July 2.                      | September 10.           |\n\nIt can be seen from the above that these teachers did as requested. Not only were their requisitions forwarded to the Department before May 31, but the requests were sent to the Stationery Branch from here before that date.\n\nAs I have previously told you, we are now receiving a deluge of complaints from teachers, principals, superintendents and regional supervisors. We are forwarding a letter in each case to the Stationery Branch to indicate to them the serious discontent on the part of our teachers with the way in which these school supplies are being handled.\n\nI have visited Mr. Driscoll, the Superintendent of Stationery, from whom I have always received the utmost in\nco-operation. He informed me that these delays were mainly due to shortages of staff and to absences because of illness and holidays. He has promised that two or more extra men will be put immediately on to filling back requisitions.\n\nI feel, however, that this will merely alleviate the present condition and will in no way remedy it.\n\nI find that I am answering letters and handling problems which should never reach my attention if these supplies were being issued properly. For example, the requisition for the Fort McPherson Indian Day School was sent from here on June 8, 1948. We were quite confident that it would reach Waterways in July. Instead, it reached there in late August or early September. As a result, it was necessary for my staff and our field staff to take the following action:\n\n1. The parcel was returned here from Waterways.\n2. It was opened here and divided into two parts, namely Essential and Non-essential.\n3. Two smaller parcels were made up and were shipped to Mr. Indian Superintendent Robertson at Edmonton.\n4. He was asked to send the small parcel of essential supplies by Air Express to Fort McPherson.\n5. He was asked to send the large parcel, next Spring, on the first boat.\n\nI do not feel that my time or that of the field staff should be taken up in remedying such situations as are caused by the apparent inefficiency of another department. Therefore I feel strongly that this other department must improve the facilities for handling our supplies or must be prepared to have these supplies taken out of their charge and handled by this Branch. I have prepared a draft letter for the Deputy Minister's signature to the King's Printer, with specific recommendations for the improvement of the delivery of our school supplies.\n\nBernard F.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nOttawa, October 30, 1948.\n\nThe King's Printer,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYou will recall that on October 31, 1947, I wrote to you with regard to the delays which have occurred in the delivery of school supplies from the Stationery Branch to our Indian day and residential schools across Canada. In your reply dated January 27, 1948, you stated as follows:\n\n\"I may add that with the return to normal conditions it is hoped that the unavoidable delays complained of by your teachers in Indian schools will be completely eliminated.\"\n\nOur Indian schools have now been open for nearly two months of the academic year. In most instances the teachers at these schools submitted their requisitions in the late spring and these were forwarded to the Stationery Branch in May or June. Every day's mail brings another series of letters of complaints from these teachers concerning the non-delivery of these supplies. I understand that our Superintendent of Education has discussed this matter with your Superintendent of Stationery and that efforts are being made to catch up on back requisitions as fast as possible. However, while this might alleviate the condition, it will not remedy it.\n\nThe children in our Indian schools are now reaching higher grades than previously. It no longer suffices to give them a reader, an arithmetic book and a few scribblers and pencils. In the senior grades they must be provided with\nthe history, geography and literature texts as prescribed in provincial courses of study. We must also equip our schools with supplementary reading and library books, as recommended by provincial departments of education.\n\nI realize only too well that this means an increased number of books to be handled by your Stationery Branch. However, I would point out that as the years go by, we have every hope that more Indian children will reach higher grades and that even more books will be required than are at present being supplied.\n\nTherefore, I would again ask you to consider the recommendation made in my letter of October 31, 1947. I feel that by authorizing the Indian Affairs Branch to purchase its own textbooks as indicated in this letter, it will do a great deal towards reducing the volume of work being required of your Stationery Branch.\n\nIt is quite possible that you might wish to present some other solution to this problem. If so, I would welcome an opportunity of discussing this matter with you and possibly some of your senior officials.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Minister.\nOttawa, October 30, 1948.\n\nThe King's Printer,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYou will recall that on October 31, 1947, I wrote to you with regard to the delays which have occurred in the delivery of school supplies from the Stationery Branch to our Indian day and residential schools across Canada.

We must also equip our schools with supplementary reading and library books, as recommended by provincial departments of education.\n\nI realize only too well that this means an increased number of books to be handled by your Stationery Branch. However, I would point out that as the years go by, we have every hope that more Indian children will reach higher grades and that even more books will be required than are at present being supplied.\n\nTherefore, I would again ask you to consider the recommendation made in my letter of October 31, 1947. I feel that by authorizing the Indian Affairs Branch to purchase its own textbooks as indicated in this letter, it will do a great deal towards reducing the volume of work being required of your Stationery Branch.\n\nIt is quite possible that you might wish to present some other solution to this problem. If so, I would welcome an opportunity of discussing this matter with you and possibly some of your senior officials.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Minister.\nOttawa, November 25, 1948.\n\nThe King's Printer,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYou will recall that on October 31, 1947, I wrote to you with regard to the delays which have occurred in the delivery of school supplies from the Stationery Branch to our Indian day and residential schools across Canada. In your reply dated January 27, 1948, you stated as follows:\n\n\"I may add that with the return to normal conditions it is hoped that the unavoidable delays complained of by your teachers in Indian schools will be completely eliminated.\"\n\nOur Indian schools have now been open for nearly three months of the academic year. In most instances the teachers at these schools submitted their requisitions in the late spring and these were forwarded to the Stationery Branch in May or June. Every day's mail brings another series of letters of complaints from these teachers concerning the non-delivery of these supplies. For example, our District Inspector of Indian Schools for British Columbia recently reported as follows:\n\n\"I have just returned from a long trip in the North, including visits to the Lejac and Cariboo Residential Schools. The matter of the supply of books is still a considerable headache and I cannot see why there should be the long delay which occurs in almost every school before the receipt of the supplies requisitioned.\"\n\nI have been advised that our Superintendent of Education has recently discussed this matter at some length\nwith your Superintendent of Stationery, and that every effort is being made to fill all requisitions forwarded to the Stationery Branch.\n\nOur Education Division has done its utmost to expedite the passing of requisitions to your Stationery Branch. The following two steps have been taken during the recent academic year in order that there would be no unnecessary delay from the time the requisitions left the teacher until the time they were typed and sent over to your Stationery Branch:\n\n(1) A standard school requisition form, a copy of which is attached, has been prepared and sent out in duplicate to all our teachers. Residential school principals were asked to forward this requisition, as well as a requisition for other than standard supplies, to our department by November 30, 1947.\n\n(2) As previously, we endeavoured to have our day school requisitions forwarded at a different time of the year than the residential school requisitions in order that the Stationery Branch could handle them more promptly. This year, the date upon which day school requisitions were to reach the department was advanced from June 30 to May 31, 1948. In this way, it was felt that we would provide an extra month for the Stationery Branch to fill requisitions and thus ensure their arrival at the schools concerned before the opening date in September.\n\nThree samples were picked at random from the top of a recent lot of delivery records sent here from Stationery. In each instance, our records show that the requisition was sent from our Education Division within three or four days after its arrival here to the Stationery Branch on the special forms provided. From the chart below, it would seem evident that long delays occurred before these orders were even typed on the special delivery record slips used:\n| Requisition Numbers | Name of School       | Date sent to Stationery Branch | Date typed on Delivery Record | Date parcel sent School |\n|---------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------|\n| 28968               | Bella Coola, B.C.    | May 26                        | July 2                       | September 14           |\n| 28975               | Old Sun, Alberta     | May 20                        | July 2                       | September 9            |\n| 28995               | Ahtahkakoops, Sask.  | May 26                        | July 2                       | September 10           |\n\nAfter our representations of last year, there was an improvement in the shipping of these school supplies. In most instances, the residential school requisitions were shipped out in fairly good time; however, after the Stationery Branch re-opened following the stock-taking period, it became evident that the shipping of supplies was slowing up again, either due to the shortage of staff or to the holiday season. Because of this, our Superintendent of Education wrote to Mr. Driscoll on July 23, drawing his attention to the fact that delivery was falling behind the receipt of requisitions. A copy of this letter is attached, and you will note that we discontinued the sending over of supplementary reading book requisitions in order that the standard supplies could be shipped out in time for school opening.\n\nAs a result of the lack of supplies, the progress of our pupils is not being maintained at the rate which our school inspectors have a right to expect. This situation also has a serious effect on our teachers, who are doing everything possible to improve the standard of our schools. Particularly in the higher grades, it is most discouraging for them to start the school year without the texts which they ordered some four or five months previously. Because of this long delay in the delivery of supplies, our Indian schools now face a serious problem. During recent years, every effort has been made to improve the culture of our teachers and of the instruction given in our Indian schools. These Indians children are now reaching higher grades than previously attained. It no longer suffices to give them a reader, an arithmetic book and a few\nscribblers and pencils. In the senior grades they must be provided as and when required with the history, geography and literature texts as prescribed in provincial courses of study. We must also equip our schools with supplementary reading and library books, as recommended by provincial departments of education.\n\nI realize only too well that this means an increased number of books to be handled by your Stationery Branch. However, I would point out that as the years go by, we have every hope that more Indian children will reach higher grades and that even more books than are at present being supplied will be required.\n\nI would therefore again ask you to consider the recommendation made in my letter of October 31, 1947. I feel that by authorizing the Indian Affairs Branch to purchase its own textbooks, as indicated in this letter, it will do a great deal towards reducing the volume of work being required of your Stationery Branch. We realize only too well the growth in the amount of supplies which have to be purchased by your department. I am advised that your Superintendent of Stationery has always done everything possible to cooperate with our requests for the stocking of supplies and textbooks. It would seem that he is seriously hampered, however, by lack of staff and space in shipping out these supplies within a reasonable time.\n\nI feel that by authorizing the Indian Affairs Branch to purchase its own textbooks, as indicated in this letter, it will do a great deal towards reducing the volume of work being required of your Stationery Branch at the present time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Minister.\nJ.

Young\n\nThe Basic Science Education Series presents a basic program in science education which is different from the traditional textbook. The Series consists of numerous small books or \"textbooks,\" each containing a complete unit of 36 pages on a science topic. Each book is independent of all others, but when a suggested course of study is followed, they form a complete basic program covering the major areas of science for the school.\n\nTeachers' Manuals are free with quantity orders.\n\nReady in October, 1948!\n\nBooks of the Seasons For First Grade\n\nFALL IS HERE\nWINTER IS HERE\nSPRING IS HERE\nSUMMER IS HERE\n\nEach of these beautiful new books of the seasons is illustrated in four colors on every page and is written in simple first grade vocabulary. Although the books contain many words not in the grade vocabulary of the Alice and Jerry Readers, but the books are easy enough for the children to read without assistance. The spelling system being followed.\n\nThese books explain clearly in pictures and simple text the biological and physical changes in the four seasons: hibernation and migration of animals, the behavior of various animals and their early plant life as found in the different seasons; changes in our weather, as shown by the sky and clouds, in the simple constellations, in the thermometers, and in the clothing needed for the different seasons; plants, birds, and animals in each season. The text to the last page of each book carries a puzzle picture in which the reader must find a hidden animal or bird. The back cover of each book shows pictures which may be used as an oral test or as the basis for map activities.\n\nFour New Books for the Second Grade!\n\nLEAVES\nDOVES\nSIX-LEGGED NEIGHBORS\nBIRDS IN YOUR BACKYARD\n\nPrimary\u2014Each $0.50\n\nAnimals and Their Young\nAnimals Round the Year\nAnimals That Live Together\nAquarium, An\nBirds in the Big Woods\nDoing Work\nHow the Sun Helps Us\nInsect Parade, The\nPerch, The\nPlants Round the Year\nUseful Plants and Animals\nWater Appears and Disappears\n\nUNITEXT\n\nIntermediate\u2014Each $0.50\n\nAir About Us, The\nAnimal Travels\nAnimals of the Seashore\nAnimals We Know\nBirds\nClouds, Rain and Snow\nDependent Plants\nEarth's Great Storehouse, The\nElectricity\nFrogs\nFishes\nFlowers, Fruits, Seeds\nGarden and Its Friends, The\nGarden Indoors\nGrasses\nInsects and Their Ways\nLiving Things\nMagnetics\nMagnetism\nPlant and Animal Partnerships\nPollination\nReptiles\nSaving Our Wild Life\nSeeds and Seed Travel\nSky Above Us, The\nSound, The\nScientist and His Tools, The\nSpiders\nStories Read from the Rocks\nThermometers, Heat and Cold\nTurtles and Frogs\nTrees\nWater\nWhat Things Are Made Of\nYou As a Machine\n\nJunior High School\u2014Each $0.50\n\nAdaptation to Environment\nAnimal World\nAsk the Weatherman\nBirds in the Sky\nBeyond the Solar System\nClimate\nDomesticated Animals\nEarth's Changing Surface\nEarth's Changing Surface\nEarth's Changing Surface\nEarth's Changing Surface\nFire, Friend and Foe\nForests\nHeat\nHow We Are Built\nInsect Friends and Enemies\n\nSCIENCE TEXTFILMS\n\nPhotostrips, 15 cents each packed in tin container accompanied by Manual of Instruction.\n\nPrice, each, net (no discount), postpaid $3.00\n\nSIMPLE MACHINES (correlated with the Unitexts, \"Doing With Simple Machines\")\n\nPERMANENT MAGNETS ELECTRIC MAGNETS\n\n\"Textfilm\" series are correlated with the Unitexts, \"Magnetism\" and \"Electricity.\")\n\nELECTRICITY\u2014TEXTFILM (correlated with the Unitext, \"Electricity\")\n\nAIR ABOUT US\u2014TEXTFILM (correlated with the Unitext, \"Air\")\n\nOUR OCEAN OF AIR\u2014TEXTFILM (correlated with the Unitext, \"Ocean of Air\"), ready November, 1948.\n\nOther TEXTFILMS in preparation.\nHISTORY\n\nOUR NATION BEGINS\nBurke, Dodd, and Webb.\nDiscovery of America to the Formation of the Union.\nIllustrated in color, Grade 1. $1.32\n\nOUR NATION GROWS UP\nBurke, Dodd, and Webb.\nFormation of the Union to 1938.

These small texts make it possible for you to select only that material required to meet your needs.\n- The program is flexible. You can meet variations in grade placement, in individual interests, in shifting needs of emphasis.\n- The program is practical. With these small texts you can keep your teaching programs stimulating, alive, and up-to-date at all times.\n- The program is economical. Buy only what you need, when you need it.\n- The program is complete. Each series offers a complete scope of instructional materials to meet varying requirements.\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs.

(Titles are listed on pages 18, 19, 21-27.)\n\nEach series consists of numerous small publications (UNITEXTS). Each UNITEXT draws its material from one or more of the fields of science, geography, civics, economics, and sociology, and deals with an important aspect of life surrounding the student.\n\nThe UNITEXT PROGRAM offers these major advantages:\n\n- The program is selective. These small texts make it possible for you to select only that material required to meet your needs.\n\n- The program is flexible. You can meet variations in grade placement, individual interests, in shifting needs of emphasis.\n\n- The program is practical. With these small texts you can keep your teaching programs stimulating, alive, and up-to-date at all times.\n\n- The program is economical. Buy only what you need, when you need it.\n\n- The program is complete. Each series offers a complete scope of instructional materials to meet varying requirements.\n\nSCIENCE\n\nTHE BASIC SCIENCE EDUCATION SERIES\n\nBy Herbert Norris Parker and Glenn O. Blough\nMabel E. Donnell, Reading Consultant\n\nThe Basic Science Education Series offers a basic science program in a more practical form than that of the traditional textbook. The series consists of numerous small books, called \"UNITEXTS,\" each of which is a complete unit of study on a scientific topic. Each unit is independent of the others in the series yet when arranged together provides a comprehensive coverage of the basic program from primary grades through junior high school.\n\nTeachers' Manuals are free with quantity orders.\n\nBooks of the Seasons For First Grade\n\nFALL IS HERE $5.00\nWINTER IS HERE\nSPRING IS HERE\nSUMMER IS HERE\n\nEach of these beautiful new books of the seasons is illustrated in four colors on every page and is written in simple first grade vocabulary. They are similar in format and use the same vocabulary of the Alice and Jerry Readers, but the books are easy to read because they are written in the order of the reading system being followed.\n\nThese books illustrate clearly in picture and simple text the biological and physical changes in the four seasons: blossoming and falling leaves; the young of various animals and their care; plant life as found in the forest, the meadow, and the prairie; the movement of the sun across the sky and clouds; the simple constellations; the phases of the moon; the shadows cast by the sun and the sky as indicated by shadows; clothing appropriate to the different seasons; and much more. A puzzle picture is given on the last page in each book carries a puzzle picture in which the pictures are arranged in a sequence. The puzzle picture on the last page shows pictures which may be used as an oral test or as the basis for simple activities.\n\nFour New Books for the Second Grade!\n\nLEAVES TOYS\nSIX-LEGGED NEIGHBORS BIRDS IN YOUR BACKYARD\n\nPrimary\u2014Each $0.40\n\nAnimals and Their Young\nAnimals Round the Year\nAnimals That Live Together\nAquariums, An Introduction\nBirds in Our Big Woods\nDoing Work\nFor the Sun Helps Us\nInside the House, The\nPet Show, The\nPlants Round the Year\nRiddles, Puzzles, and Animals\nWater Appears and Disappears\nTHE COPP CLARK CO.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nIn reply to your letter dated January 13th, re Basic Science Education Series, we wish to advise you as follows:\n\nThe following titles listed in our 1946-47 catalogue, namely, TELLING TIME AND PLACE, HARNESSING THE FORCES OF NATURE, THE SCIENCE OF TRANSPORTATION and THE SCIENCE OF SENDING MESSAGES, have not as yet been published. For some reason these titles have been delayed and the publishers have temporarily dropped them from their new catalogue. We can only surmise that some difficulties have arisen which have delayed publication.\n\nThe following are all available and examination copies are being sent to you under separate cover today. THE SCIENCE OF BUILDING, SUPERSTITION OR SCIENCE, MATTER AND MOLECULES, THE WORK OF THE BODY, FOODS, and KEEPING WELL. There is one little difference and that is in connection with number 59 of this series. This book was to be entitled THE WORK OF THE BODY, but the author and publishers deemed it necessary to change the title on publication, and this will now be recognized as HOW WE ARE BUILT.\n\nNumbers 62, 63 and 64 will all be available within the next week or ten days and examination copies will be mailed to you as soon as possible. Here again we would like to inform you that a slight change has been made in the titles of numbers 62 and 64, which will go under the titles now of DOMESTICATED PLANTS and DOMESTICATED ANIMALS.\nMr. Bernard F. Neary\n\nJanuary 14, 1949.\n\nFour new titles suitable for the Second Grade in our schools will also be available within the next month, and here again we shall send you examination copies at the earliest possible moment. These you will find listed on the attached clipping under the titles -- LEAVES, TOYS, SIX-LEGGED NEIGHBORS, BIRDS IN YOUR BACKYARD.\n\nWe enclose in the parcel three new publications which may be of interest to your Department. One entitled SALLY by E. K. Thomson, a supplementary reading book suggested for Grades VII and VIII. The other two handi-craft books for school use, namely, MAKE THESE YOURSELF by Roseman and THE SCISSORBILL BIRD by Louise Selworthy, are both new publications from the Dryad Press of Leicester, England. The SCISSORBILL BIRD, as you will observe, is a combined story book and handi-craft book containing suggestions for cut paper work in the schools.\n\nWe hope these new publications will be of interest. If we can be of further help in any way, please do not hesitate to write us.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nTHE COPP CLARK CO. LIMITED,\n\nE.

We feel that it will be necessary to give serious consideration to the operation of such auxiliary education classes in certain of our schools. As our Regional Supervisors are the men directly responsible for the implementation of departmental policy in the various provinces, this inspection of auxiliary education classes in action was therefore most valuable for them.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDirector.\nJanuary 14, 1949.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMr. J. Arnold of your staff pointed out that there was a number of outstanding bits of requisitions dating back to 1946 and 1947. He asked me for a possible cancelling of these orders.\n\nOn checking our requisitions, I am pleased to inform you that any outstanding requisitions previous to requisition No. 28450 may be cancelled as the teachers will be re-ordering the items.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMr. J.W. Driscoll,\nSupt. of Stationery,\nDept. of Public Printing & Stationery,\nOttawa.\n\nMFT/HM.\nJanuary 13, 1949.\n\nColonel B. F. Neary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nWe have had a letter dated January 4 from the Department of Public Printing and Stationery in which they inquire if all or part of their orders 45828-29-30 may be returned for credit. These three orders cover 300 copies each of Teaching First Grade Reading I, Teaching First Grade Reading II, Teaching First Grade Reading III and the First Grade teachers' manuals for the Faith and Freedom series.\n\nOur rule, as stated on our invoice form, is that books sent as ordered are not returnable, but we would not want to interpret this too strictly as against a good friend and customer such as you. The trouble, however, is that in this particular case, these books are of American manufacture and were imported especially for you. The schools are now pretty well supplied with these manuals and as a result, orders now are infrequent and small in number. While they can be returned across the border, there is a very considerable amount of red tape involved. We have an adequate stock here in Toronto to meet our estimated requirements for 1949. If we take back from your Department 200 copies, that would probably see us through 1950. We do not like to look further ahead than that because it may be that there will be a revision in the pupils' books, which would render the manuals out of date and unusable.\n\nWould it be entirely satisfactory to you if we offer to take back 200 copies of each manual which would amount to one-quarter of the total order?\n\nI do think it important that all your teachers using Faith and Freedom be supplied with the teachers' manuals and I wonder if it would be possible for you to distribute the other 600 copies of each manual to your schools, either immediately or eventually. On the other hand, we want to avoid embarrassing you in the slightest degree and if you say so, we shall take back the full amount, endeavouring to make the necessary arrangements to send all your stock of them back to the United States.\n\nWith all good wishes\n\nCordially yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nNORMAN G.

F. Neary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nWe wrote you on January 13th relative to a request from the Department of Public Printing and Stationery as to whether they might return for credit all or part of their orders for 800 copies each of Teaching First Grade Reading I, Teaching First Grade Reading II, and Teaching First Grade Reading III, the First Grade teachers' manuals for the Faith and Freedom series. I enclose copy of our letter.\n\nWe are wondering if you have had a chance to consider our proposal yet, and if so, we would appreciate hearing from you as we have today had another letter from the Department of Public Printing in this connection.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary to Mr. Ingram\n\ngd\nencl. 1\nColonel B. F. Neary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nWe have had a letter dated January 4 from the Department of Public Printing and Stationery in which they inquire if all or part of their orders 45828-29-30 may be returned for credit. These three orders cover 800 copies each of Teaching First Grade Reading I, Teaching First Grade Reading II, Teaching First Grade Reading III, and the First Grade teachers' manuals for the Faith and Freedom series.\n\nOur rule, as stated on our invoice form, is that books sent as ordered are not returnable, but we would not want to interpret this too strictly as against a good friend and customer such as you. The trouble, however, is that in this particular case, these books are of American manufacture and were imported especially for you. The schools are now pretty well supplied with these manuals and as a result, orders now are infrequent and small in number. While they can be returned across the border, there is a very considerable amount of red tape involved. We have an adequate stock here in Toronto to meet our estimated requirements for 1949. If we take back from the Department 200 copies, that would probably see us through 1950. We do not like to look further ahead than that because it may be that there will be a revision in the pupils' books, which would render the manuals out of date and unusable.\n\nWould it be entirely satisfactory to you if we offer to take back 200 copies of each manual which would amount to one quarter of the total order?\n\nI do think it important that all your teachers using Faith and Freedom be supplied with the teachers' manuals and I wonder if it would be possible for you to distribute the other 600 copies of each manual to your schools, either immediately or eventually. On the other hand, we want to avoid embarrassing you in the slightest degree and if you say so, we shall take back the full amount, endeavouring to make the necessary arrangements to send all your stock of them back to the United States.\n\nWith all good wishes,\n\nCordially yours,\n\n[Norma C. S. Ingram]\nDepartment of Public Printing and Stationery\nSTATIONERY BRANCH\n\nOttawa, 27th January, 1949\n\nSIR,\n\nI beg to inform you that the Stationery Office will be closed for the purpose of taking stock, from March 21st to March 31st, both days inclusive.\n\nIt will be a convenience if the different Departments will place orders for stationery required within the above-mentioned dates, not later than March 12th as the filling of requisitions received after the above date cannot be promised in the present fiscal year.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nSuperintendent of Stationery\n\nCol.

Dent's has sent my manuscript to you for the blessing of the Indian Dept.\n\nI need not tell you how much thought and toil has gone into the book - you know better than most people for you have helped to make it possible. This is only a fraction of the material I have and I am hoping it may have historic as well as artistic interest of value, and the human element cannot be discounted altogether. Dr Scott wrote the foreword long ago.\n\nThe publication of the book would mean the culmination of a lifetime of effort. Needless to say if you can offer any suggestions, or if you find any inaccuracies I shall be most happy to have you tell me of them. While I have endeavoured to use the utmost care, I do not claim to be infallible and would be very grateful for any advice you may be able to render.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMildred Valley Thornton.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nManuscript - Mrs. Mildred Valley Thornton\n\nI have now had reports from our officials concerning this book and have read most of it myself. It is interesting and well written, but it deals mainly with the personalities of the Indians met by Mrs. Thornton in her travels as an artist among them. While these verbal descriptions of the Indians and their surroundings are informative and accurate, I doubt the value of the manuscript as a textbook or even as a reference book in our schools.\n\nThe vocabulary is such that I doubt if it would hold the interest of any but Indian boys and girls in the senior grades. Therefore, I feel that we could only recommend the purchase of about 250 copies for use as library books. This number, of course, would depend entirely on the price which Dent's set for the published text.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education.\nJ. M.

The new Fifth Grade Reader will be out very shortly, and the Sixth Grade text is in active preparation. Each reader has a workbook and teacher's guide to insure a complete programme for teacher and pupil. In addition, they are handsomely illustrated in colour.\n\nThe revised \"Highroads\" focus attention upon Canada, and upon the thoughts, feelings, interests, and appreciation of Canadian children from coast to coast.\n\nThe price of \"Riding with the Sun\", the Fourth Grade Reader, is $1.00; \"Over Land and Sea\", the Fifth Grade Reader, is priced at $1.40. These prices are subject to our educational discount of 20%.\n\nWe are sending you today an examination copy of \"Riding with the Sun\" to be followed by \"Over Land and Sea\" as soon as it is delivered to us by the printers which should be within a matter of days.\n\nIncidentally, you might be interested to know that the revised edition has been authorized by the Province of Alberta.\nMr. B.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nThis is in reply to your letter of 22nd February respecting the supply of HIGHROADS TO READING. One aspect of the situation about which you inquire is this: HIGHROADS TO READING, Book IV, will not be used in any of the Provinces during the coming school year except possibly in Quebec, and because of the very small quantity required in the Province of Quebec, we have asked the Department there if they would be willing to discontinue it. Book V and VI are both used this year in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, and Book VI, this year, in British Columbia, I believe, as well.\n\nNext year we expect that Book V will be discontinued and we would no doubt declare it out of print; that is, Book V is unlikely to be available for the school year 1950-51. Whether the two Provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan will continue Book VI in that year, we do not know, but certainly by the following year, Book VI also will be out of use.\n\nAt the moment, therefore, we do not expect to have further copies of Book IV; we shall have copies of Book V available throughout the school years 1949-50; and we expect that Book VI will still be available for the school year 1950-51. On this latter point, we are not absolutely sure.\n\nMight I ask whether you feel that it is more appropriate to use, as Readers, the texts authorized in a given Province? The reason that I ask this is that for Indian children, you might find it useful to continue in Grades IV, V and VI with the New Basic Readers. These books are used widely across the country, and are authorized in the Province of Quebec. If you have not seen these books, a note to me would get them to you quickly.\n\nWith very kindest regards,\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nW. R.

F. Neary,\nSuperintendent, Training Service,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nMy attention has been drawn to a bulletin recently issued by your Department recommending supplementary reading material for the various grades. We notice that this list does not contain the Canadian Reading Development Series published by our House, nor our Alice and Jerry Series.\n\nYou have, I think, had samples of our Canadian Reading Development Series (UP AND AWAY, WIDE OPEN WINDOWS, and ALL SAILS SET). The Series has been exceptionally well received and is now authorized for Grades 4, 5, and 6 in the provinces of New Brunswick, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, and is also one of three series authorized in the province of Alberta. I wonder whether its omission from the list was an oversight.\n\nThe new Alice and Jerry Series you may not have had an opportunity to examine. This is the revision of the old Alice and Jerry but has been so completely revised as to make it one of the most effective, interesting, and valuable of the primary series. It offers three levels of achievement, for the immature, average, and superior students. Since it came on the market a year ago we have had an exceptionally heavy sale of this series wherever we have been able to promote it, having sold approximately 100,000 copies in the province of Ontario alone, where it is offered only as supplementary material since there\nColonel B. F. Neary\n\nhas been no change in the authorized texts. I mention these facts merely to draw your attention to the enthusiasm with which teachers have received the new Series. I am taking the liberty of forwarding you sample copies of the books in Grades 1, 2, and 3. I shall be very glad to have your Department examine these for their usefulness in your Division.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE COPP CLARK CO. LIMITED\n\nEditor\n\nC.E.

Gage & Co., Limited. As only a few of the Provinces have decided on an authorized reader for these grades, our position is not clear for we are anxious to use the readers authorized for the province in which the schools are located. To overcome this situation we would like to use the Highroads until such time as a definite decision is made by the different Departments of Education.\n\nI wrote the two publishers asking whether the publication of these readers will be totally discontinued or whether there will be a limited publication for some time.\n\nIn reply, Thomas Nelson and Sons Company have stated that they are definitely discontinuing the printing of Highroads to Reading and are publishing a revised Highroads to Reading. I am not particularly interested in this reader at the present time unless it becomes authorized by the Provincial authorities.\n\nW.J. Gage and Company reply that because of a desire on the part of the Department of Education in Quebec to maintain these books as authorized texts in that Province, they will continue to print for some time to come. This applies to Book 4 which was thought would be out of print this year, as well as to Books 5 and 6.\nIn view of the above stand taken by W.J. Gage and Company, it is respectfully requested that all our requests for these books be booked with W.J. Gage and Company. It would not be wise to place a quantity of these Readers in stock; therefore, orders should be placed as requisitions come in.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

We hope that you have been getting our\ncirculars, as they have been issued from time to time,\nbut regret that it is now some time since we have\nissued a complete catalogue, and we will not likely have\na new one ready until early in the new year. We will,\nhowever, send one along as soon as ready.\n\nOur reason for asking for a list of the\nPost Office addresses of Indian Residential and Day Schools\nwas to send to the principals, circulars covering special\nitems which a school principal might be purchasing for\nhis own personal use, and would, perhaps, not be requisitioning\nthrough the Department so that if it is possible to get a\nlist it would be appreciated. Perhaps it might show in\nthe annual report of the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nWe do hope that you have in your files, a copy\nof one of our large catalogues, or perhaps a copy of the\ncatalogue of the Western School Supply, which was a branch\nof ours in Regina but which is now closed.\n\nThese catalogues were issued some time ago,\nand of course, prices are entirely out of line but they\nmay be used for the selection of goods.\n\nAssuring you of our very best attention to\nyour commands at all times.\n\nYours truly,\n\nCHRISTIE SCHOOL SUPPLY LIMITED\n\nManaging Director\nTHOMAS NELSON AND SONS LIMITED\n\nPUBLISHERS\n\n91 Wellington St. West\nTORONTO, I\n\nJune 1, 1949.\n\n23453\n\nCol.

Consisting of over 300 pages, it meets the demand for authentic information on Canadian trees. The greatest care has been taken in the securing and final selection of the hundreds of photographs used in the preparation of the plates, and they will be invaluable both for the student and the layman in the identification of the tree species.\n\nIn a few words, Native Trees of Canada is a handsome and valuable addition to all libraries.\n\nCopies will be available for distribution in April; meantime fill in enclosed postcard and mail, stating number of copies required.\n\n- The book is protected by a four colour (Kodachrome) Jacket.\n- Two full-colour Kodachrome plates.\n- 124 full-page black and white plates.\n- 117 maps showing distribution of trees.\n- Over 150 native tree species illustrated and described.\n- A large number of exotic species commonly planted in Canada are referred to.\n- Completely revised and expanded check list, including botanical, English, and French names of native tree species.\n- For sample page arrangement, see overleaf.\nTHE PINES\n\nLIMBER PINE\n\nPinus flexilis James\n\nRocky Mountain pine, Rocky Mountain white pine.\n\nThe limber pine, like the white-bark pine which it closely resembles, is a small alpine tree 25 to 40 feet in height and 1 to 2 feet in diameter. The trunk is short, thick, limby, and crooked, and the crown is irregular on account of the irregular whorls of thick limbs. On exposed slopes at high altitudes much of the limber pine growth is prostrate and shrubby. In old trees the lower branches are very long and tend to droop. The young branches are very tough and flexible, hence the name limber pine.\n\nThis tree is found in Canada in the mountains of southern British Columbia and Alberta, at an altitude of 5,000 to 6,000 feet. It is adapted to a great variety of soils, but is most often found on dry, rocky, and exposed slopes. It occurs in small pure stands or singly in mixture with mountain hemlock, whitebark pine, lodgepole pine, Douglas fir, and Engelmann spruce. In southern Alberta it is also found on the tops of the foothills.\n\nLEAVES\u2014Needle-like, in bundles of 5, stout, stiff, slightly curved, 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) to 3\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches long, dark green, mostly clustered on the ends of the twigs.\n\nFLOWERS\u2014Late June; unisexual; small reddish bodies, usually in clusters, male and female on the same tree.\n\nFRUIT\u2014September of the second year; a cylindrical cone, 3 to 8 inches long, short-stalked, with long, narrow, pointed, yellowish-brown scales, rounded, somewhat thickened at the tips; opening at maturity and falling during the winter. Seeds nearly wingless.\n\nTWIGS\u2014Stout, tough; at first hairy, orange-green; later, smooth, darker; buds ovoid, pointed.\n\nBARK\u2014On young stems, smooth grey or silvery-white; becoming rough, dark brown to almost black, deeply fissured into wide, scaly plates.\n\nWOOD\u2014Light, moderately soft, close-grained, non-porous; lemon-yellow with nearly white sapwood.\n\nThe limber pine, although occasionally used locally for fuelwood, has no commercial importance.\nThe SPRUCES *Picea* A. Dietr.\n\nThe spruces are widely distributed throughout the cooler parts of the northern hemisphere. About 40 species have been named, of which 7 are found in North America. Five of these and one variety are native to Canada. One native species, the red spruce, is found only in the East, and 2 others, the Sitka and the Engelmann spruces are confined to the West. The remaining 2 species, the white and the black spruce, range from the Atlantic Coast westward almost to the Pacific and northward to the limit of tree growth in the arctic regions. The range of the variety western white spruce is not fully known as yet, but it has been reported from Manitoba, Alberta, and British Columbia. Two foreign species widely planted in Canada for ornamental and other purposes are the Norway spruce, *Picea abies* (L.) Karst., from Europe, and the blue or Colorado spruce, *Picea pungens* Engelm., from the mountains of the Western United States.\n\nThe spruces are evergreen trees and have long, often cone-shaped crowns and straight, gradually tapering trunks. They have thin, scaly bark and slender, often drooping, lower branches. In the open the branches usually extend down the trunk nearly to the ground. Since the root systems are nearly always shallow, spruce trees are easily uprooted by wind.\n\nThe short, needle-like leaves are stiff and sharp-pointed, and, with one exception, are 4-sided in cross-section. They are single and stemless, and each is attached to a tiny peg-like base. They never appear to be 2-ranked, as is often the case with the firs and hemlocks, but either bristle out all around the twig or are curved and twisted toward the upper side.\n\nSpruce flowers are unisexual\u2014either male or female, never both\u2014but the two sexes are found on the same tree. The mature cones always droop from the branches. They ripen in the autumn of the first season, open to discharge the seeds, and then either drop off before the new crop is formed, or in one case remain on the tree for many years. The seeds are very light and each has a broad wing attached to one end.\n\nThe Norway spruce is easily distinguished from the Canadian spruces by its yellowish-green foliage and larger cones. The blue spruce is distinguished chiefly by the colour of its leaves and the smooth, hairless twigs.\n\nThe wood of the different species is very similar in colouring and mechanical properties. Light-weight spruce timber resembles somewhat that of the white pines and it is often used for the same purposes. Its light colour, its freedom from resin, and the length and strength of the fibres make spruce the premier pulpwood of the world. It is also widely used in general construction, interior finish, and boxes and crating. Its tasteless character makes it of exceptional value for food containers.\nOTTAWA March, 1949\n\nThe last edition of the ANNUAL CATALOGUE of Government Publications is now on sale at a price of 25 cents, and is obtainable from:\n\nTHE KING'S PRINTER\n\nLa derni\u00e8re \u00e9dition du CATALOGUE ANNUEL des Publications du Gouvernement vient de para\u00eetre; on peut l'obtenir moyennant la somme de 25 cents en s'adressant \u00e0:\n\nD'IMPRIMEUR DU ROYAUME\n\nSign and return together with remittance.\n\nSignez et retournez avec votre remise.\n\nName Address\nNom Adresse\n\nTHE KING'S PRINTER,\nDEPT.

Under separate cover you will receive gratis copies of the preprimers in the New Alice and Jerry Series, Skip Along and Open the Door.\n\nThe sale of Alice and Jerry books in Canada has been so successful that we were able to arrange with the American publishers to do the basic books in the Series on our presses. The two preprimers noted above are the first off press, and these will be followed by New Day In and Day Out and New Round About, basic primer and first reader respectively, before summer's end.\n\nI think you will agree from the samples submitted that the lithography and printing are every bit as good as the American originals. But more than that. By printing these books ourselves we have been able to effect a substantial reduction in price. For example, Skip Along will now retail at 30 cents as against 45 cents for the American edition, and Open the Door at 35 cents as against 50 cents for the original edition.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE COPP CLARK CO.

Dent & Sons, Limited,\n224 Bloor Street West,\nToronto, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Eustace,\n\nI have answered your letter of July 10th and note that Miss Gaulthier's book will run from 300 to 400 pages.\n\nWe were primarily interested in a book which could be used in our Indian schools for Social Studies. We wanted a text which would cost between $1.00 and $1.50 and which could be used in all schools across Canada.\n\nOur former Director Mr. Hoey, was very interested in this material and I understand, advised Miss Gaulthier that we would handle about 5,000 copies. I also understand that the Boy Scouts Association is interested and you might write to them for their ideas as to the type of book which they require. I wonder whether it would be possible to publish in one volume form the material which has a \"popular appeal\" and to do the sections on medicine, ocean life, etc., in pamphlet form.\n\nI hope that the above classifies our position in this matter. Thank you for your words of sympathy and I do appreciate this expression on your part.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard D. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nBFN: MMoN\nColonel Bernard F. Neary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary,\n\nMiss Gaultier de la Verendrye was in the office last week and brought us her material which is now in some sort of shape. As a matter of fact, there seems to be a vast amount of material in the five or six booklets she brought in, and we have not yet been able to estimate how long this material would be if put into book form. I should think, however, that it would make a book of 300 or 400 pages, which would probably be both too unwieldy and expensive for the Department of Indian Affairs to interest itself in the publication as a book which should be placed in the schools for the use of the students.\n\nThis letter, therefore, is to explore the situation from your point of view. Miss Gaultier tells us that you are interested in seeing the book published, and that it might be possible for the Department to purchase five thousand copies. If this is so, I should very much welcome your tentative suggestion as to the size of the book that you would want, and whether or not all the material that Miss Gaultier has collected should be used.\n\nThe legends and myths are arranged at the moment in sections. One section contains legends and myths concerning Medicine, another consists of ocean life, another of animal life, and so forth. Do you think we should publish them in sections, or should we make a selection of the best material in all the sections and publish this material in one volume? I do hope you will forgive me asking these rather pointed questions, but from what you know of Miss Gaultier you will gather that she might be as explicit as we would wish about this matter.\n\nCould you please advise if the Department would be interested in purchasing some copies of her book if we publish it? Also, could you please tell us if you want to place this material in your schools for the use of the Indian children themselves? Could you also confirm the possibility that the Department might be interested in the material\nCol. B.F. Neary  \nJuly 10, 1949.\n\nto the extent of purchasing five thousand copies?\n\nI should say, of course, that we are very interested in the material which is evidently authentic and seems to us to be very interesting. We think it is material that should be published, and we see a small market for it through other channels than the Department of Indian Affairs, although it is doubtful if these alone would justify publication.\n\nI was terribly sorry to hear from Miss Gaulthier about the very sad loss you sustained recently in your family. Having children of my own, I can only send you my profound sympathy.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCJ/E/DP  \nG. J.

It will be readily noticed that there were the largest number of slips covering requisition numbers 30000 to 30189 (Section B) which would indicate that this is the regular order of requisitions being filled at present.\n\nThe requisition numbers below 30000 (Section A) are back orders and above 30189 (Section C) are urgent orders. Requisition Number 30189 was placed on May 31st. It is admitted that all requisitions are not the same size and all do not call for the same items, but as we are now working on requisition 30479 you will appreciate our concern about the matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Of course they would also be interested in the sections on medicine, ocean life, etc.\n\nI am expecting to make a trip to the Maritime Provinces during the first few weeks in September, and would like to come to Ottawa for a day.

I am sending therefore, to each of the teachers on the list that you have submitted, a copy of the Annual Book List for the current year.

DISTRICT DIVISION VII\n\nWe are again reminded of the urgency of providing as much suitable reading material as possible for all classes, particularly Grades 1, 2, and 3; you are again commended on the considerable improvement in most of your schools during the past year, in reading material available, and therefore in reading proficiency.\n\nMay I repeat that you should aim to make it possible, as far as you can, for grades to have reading mastery (recognition, pronunciation and meaning) of the following numbers of words:\n\nBy the end of: Gr. 1 Gr. 2 Gr. 3 Gr. 4 Gr. 5 Gr. 6\n600 additional 800 additional 900 additional 1400 additional 800 additional 1100 additional\n\nA Grade I pupil needs to have a daily average of 3 words throughout the year; many come to school with a very limited stock. Since most of the Grade I groups provide about 200 words, at least three Grade I groups of titles are advisable; further, something relatively difficult\u2014a toughening agent\u2014such as \"Happy Days\" or \"Mary, John and Peter\", before the end of Grade I, is an important supplement to the \"pre-digested baby food\" provided by most of the easy and more attractive titles.\n\nThis constitutes a costly set of books for any, particularly a Grade I, pupil; if you can't have all you need from the Board, the library might provide part and the parent the balance.\n\nOne copy of each title in each of several of the following series is advisable for at least every 3 pupils in Grades 1 and 2; (at least enough for 1/3 of class):\n\nAlice and Jerry - Copp Clark\nFaith and Freedom - Ginn\nCathedral Basic (Dick and Jane) - Gage\nReading for Meaning - Nelson\nTags and Twinkie, etc. - MacMillan plus Playmates, with or without Let's Play, its pre-Primer - Ginn and Mary John and Peter.\n\nBeyond Grade II it is suggested that all pupils of each grade have identical \"class readers\" in at least one title, and that there be, for Grade 3, one copy, for at least every three pupils, in as many as possible of such as Dick and Jane, Faith and Freedom, Corona Readers\u2014Ginn (Playmates, etc.). The Public School Reader, which have not been chosen as the \"class reader\".\n\nBeyond Grade III, each pupil should have a copy of his \"class reader\"\u2014Cathedral Basic, Corona, Public School Reader, and the following might be provided, at least one copy per grade\u2014supplementary reading\u2014in all the following which have not been selected as the class reader:\n\nCanadian Parade Readers - Dent (Gr. 4, 5, 6)\nNew World Readers - MacMillan (Gr. 4, 5, 6)\nCathedral Basic - (Gr. 1 - 8)\nCorona - (Gr. 1 - 8)\nPublic School - (Gr. 1 - 8)\nCanadian Reading Development Series - Clark (Gr. 4, 5, 6)\n\nGrades 7 and 8 will read those 4's and 5's and 6's, with interest and benefit.\nHave something Catholic and something Canadian in each grade.\n\nWith limited resources, provision of suitable and sufficient reading material may be a five-or-six-year program.\n\nThe above may be of some guidance through the maze of good material available; above are only some of the titles which are good.\n\nIt is believed that where there isn't money enough for both, it should be spent on books, rather than on work books.\n\nOur Land and Our Living - Reid and Hamilton - Don't - is excellent 6-8 Geography, for teacher or good pupil use. At least one copy, for teacher guidance, of each of the three titles in Getting Ready to Write etc., Gage, at 20\u00a2 per title, would be of great help to each primary teacher.\n\nPlease order for September, as far as money will permit, particularly if you are not returning.\n\nWm.

The latter do not include Home Economics tables and shop work benches so we are unable to make promises of deliveries until new runs are arranged in our production schedule.\n\nIt is impossible to forecast just when we shall again be in a position to fill orders nor do we know our costs because they will depend on the quantity of each type and size manufactured.\n\nWe could probably provide you with close estimates both in respect to prices and shipping dates if you would be good enough to tell us how many you contemplate purchasing. If there are sufficient to justify a special run, or at least form a basis from which to work, we could probably offer much better co-operation than if the matter has to wait until we have an accumulation of demands before deciding the most advantageous course to follow.\n\nIf you therefore care to guide us as outlined, we will go into the subject without delay.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nHENDRY DIVISION\nCENTRAL SCIENTIFIC COMPANY OF CANADA LIMITED\n\nWLM:PB\nAaron\nAlbemarle at\nHogansburg, N.Y.\n\nSeries of pamphlets\nof Indian\nLife\n\n1-1-1\nAugust 19, 1949.\n\nMr. Aaron Akweks,\nHogansburg, N.Y.\n\nDear Mr. Akweks:\n\nI have been lead to believe that you have a series of pamphlets in connection with Indian Life which might prove useful for our work.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would send me a series of these.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

You will be getting orders for these from time to time from our Departmental Purchasing Agent, Mr. Vincent.\n\nIn connection with the desk, it is noted that you are only starting in the production of these and I feel that there are a few points I would point out that may help to make this piece of furniture more substantial.\n\nThey are (1) The four legs should be reinforced by triangular blocks on the inside, as the glue on our sample is already starting to give way and with a bit of rough handling the joints will eventually let go.\n\n(2) The outside end of the drawer should be fastened to the body by dove-tail joints.\n\nWe are interested in the price however, and with these two adjustments I feel that you will have a first-class desk on the market, and will suit our needs.\n\nI will be expecting to hear from you further.\n\nYours sincerely\n\nBernard F.

Attached is an illustration showing the seat adjustment that is provided, for both sizes.\n\nThe price of the #58 Senior, complete with book-box, is $27.95 Net, f.o.b. Winnipeg.

Neary\n\nAugust 26/49\n\nThe prices quoted are for one only, or one hundred desks or more.\n\nIllustrations or a letter to you can hardly do full justice to our desk, and if at some time we can have the privilege of arranging a demonstration, for you or one of your representatives, either in Ottawa or in a Western Canada city, we will be decidedly pleased.\n\nAgain assuring you of our appreciation of your interest in our desk, and sincerely trust to be of further service to you in the near future, we are,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE T.

Any room can become a library, chemistry or experimental class, simply by arranging desks as you require them.\n\nBEAUTIFULLY BALANCED\nScientific design was skillfully incorporated to assure a desk that would not tilt, tip or shift easily. This important factor eliminates noise... makes a desk of unusual stability and pleasing design.\n\nNATURAL SPACE ECONOMY\nDesks take up much less floor area... yet provide lots of leg room, extra comfort and efficiency. This desk allows more extra floor space for other needed equipment.\n\nIT'S EASY TO CLEAN AROUND A BARGEN DESK\nSimplified design, a minimum of base area, and the solid construction of the Bargen desk make the job of cleaning much easier. Also the desk can be readily moved for complete floor cleaning and waxing.\n\nSTUBBORNLY RESISTANT\nRubber-coated spring steel cushions the base and provides stubborn resistance to shoving or pushing, thereby aiding safety, helping to eliminate noise, and saving on floor repair costs.\n4 Basic Styles - Each in Two Sizes\n\nMODEL 55\nTablet arm, with adjustable seat and non-adjustable top.\n\nMODEL 56\nStudy top, with adjustable seat and non-adjustable top.\n\nMODEL 57\nStudy top, with both seat and top adjustable.\n\nMODEL 58\nBook box top; with both seat and top adjustable.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Text Books, Pupils Attending Provincial Schools\n\nThe Provincial Department of Education has recently instituted a scheme for the rental of text books to pupils enrolled in junior and senior high schools. The rental charge is $3.50 for grades 7, 8 and 9 and I believe, $4.00 for pupils in senior high school. This covers all the required texts but does not of course provide the necessary exercise books.\n\nIt would seem that it is to the Department's advantage to make use of this arrangement and I shall appreciate receiving the Department's views as to whether or not it is prepared to participate rather than supply texts to students by requisition.\n\n[Signature]\nM.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nDr. Bernard F. Neary, Supt.\nIndian Education\nDept. Mines and Resources\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa, Ontario, Canada\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nYour message requesting our series of Indian Cultural Pamphlets was received today when I returned home from a trip. In this mail I am forwarding on to you a set of those pamphlets that we have turned out so far. Please accept these as a gift from our organization. In the future there will be others and I will see that you receive copies. One that is being printed at the present time is titled, \"Record of Six Nations Indians, World War II\" and contains war record of every band of the Six Nations, Canada and the United States. It will contain names of over 2,500 Six Nation soldiers who served in the late war, a good record considering the small number of Six Nation People. The thought that the young people of the Indian reservations of Canada can find use in our Six Nation Pamphlets is a pleasant thought to those members who make up our organization.\n\nMay this message find you well\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRay Fadden, Sec.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nWe have an order from the Department of Printing and Stationery (No. 06869) dated July 22, for 50 copies of FAMOUS FAIRY TALES (Pied Piper Books), which we presume are meant for your Branch. We wrote on August 9 to Mr. Desrosiers, Controller of Purchases, asking if we could substitute the Books, Inc., edition of this for the Pied Piper edition, at 52\u00a2 net, but to date have received no reply.\n\nThe situation at the moment is that we have a shipment of FAMOUS FAIRY TALES at the customs, but officials there refuse to accept a certificate from the Department of Printing and Stationery saying that these books are educational. They insist that it be indicated on the certificate the schools involved. We are therefore enclosing with this letter a revised certificate, and would appreciate it very much if you could indicate that the books ordered are for Indian schools under your jurisdiction. It is assumed, of course, that you are willing to substitute the edition; if such is not the case, please feel free to ignore our request.\n\nWe shall look forward to hearing from you in this connection.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nJ.C.W.

These books were originally planned as a 20 volume set for use in schools retailing at $150 a set. Through some miscalculation they overprinted eight volumes each dealing with a different topic as shown on the attached circular. Each volume carries an index for the volume and there is no reference from one volume to another, making each book complete in itself.\n\nThe binding, quality of paper, illustrations, vocabulary material etc., are exactly the same as in the Book of Knowledge. Mr. McLean tells me that the Department of Education for Saskatchewan and Quebec have purchased these sets. The price of $15. for each set of eight volumes is very reasonable.\n\nIn view of the fact that many of our residential schools have a set of the Book of Knowledge and the Grolier Encyclopedia, I would respectfully recommend that Mr. Driscoll be requested to place in stock ten sets of these Encyclopedias.\n\nM.F.

Her firm is apparently the exclusive Western Canadian Agent for Compton's Pictured Encyclopedia, Denoyer-Geppert line of maps, globes and science materials, and D.W. Davies School Furniture.\n\nAs a layman, I was particularly impressed by the encyclopedia as well as Compton's Pictured Library for visual education.\n\nShe stated that her firm would be writing you in the event that you might be interested in placing some sets of their encyclopedia in a few of our Indian Day Schools.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG. H.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nText Book Branch,\nVictoria, B.C.,\n\nMFT/HM\nOctober 11, 1949.\n\nColonel Bernard Neary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary,\n\nIt was very nice of you to give me so much of your time in Ottawa, and I am sorry that I did not telephone you about the result of my deliberations with Miss Gaulthier. Actually I have her manuscript and I am a little puzzled as to what we are to do with it, although she has given us carte blanche to edit it as we please.\n\nAfter thinking over the matter of this manuscript in relation to your own requirements I have come to a few conclusions which I am passing on to you for what they are worth.\n\nIt seems to me that there are two books that you require for your schools according to your needs as you outlined them to me during our conversation. The first book is a reader of about Grades VI and VII level telling something of the traditions and social customs of the Indians with a chapter on their contribution to our present civilization. The object of this book is to make the Indian youngsters proud of their own people and also to tell them something of the traditions of their people.\n\nThe second book is to show the part that Indians played in Canadian history, this to be done through a series of historical biographies or incidents.\n\nOur Western Director is to be here next week and I am writing to him asking him to be sure to bring with him details of a book our Firm decided to do about a year ago on Indians. When we have this before us, we can find out exactly how we can help you in planning a book to meet your needs.\n\nWhen in Montreal I spoke to Mr. E.C. Woodley, who is now retired from the Department of Education in Quebec, about the little book on Indian achievements, as I believe that Mr. Woodley would have both the time and ability to collect some material for us on this subject. I will, therefore, be writing to you about this at a later date. It occurs to me that we might get into the same book something about Indian customs and traditions, although possibly two books may be necessary.\nColonel Bernard Neary\n\nOctober 11, 1949.\n\nHow much material we shall be able to use from Miss Gaulthier's book, I do not know, but there does seem to be an opportunity to publish a third book for general consumption on the subject of the customs, legends and habits of the Gatineau Indians. Evidently the Federal Commission intends to publicize the Gatineau Park as a sort of national centre outside Ottawa, and it is expected that a good many thousands of people annually will visit the park. What we may do here, therefore, is to select from Miss Gaulthier's material sufficient matter to produce a reasonably sized book on the Indians and their customs and legends.\n\nI saw General Spry about these matters and he expressed an interest in all three projects.\n\nOnce again I am grateful to you for your interest in this matter; I will keep you in touch with developments and will probably be writing to you again in the near future.\n\nAs you requested, I am sending you a copy of MASTERING THE READING SKILLS and ANSWER BOOK with our compliments.\n\nKind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nC.J.E./DP\n\nG. J. Eustace\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Pottery Water Coolers\nYour file 1-1-4 (E.6)\n\nA review of our requirements at the various day schools in this Province indicates a need for 57 water coolers.\n\nThis office has recently had a complaint from a medical officer of the Health Unit in which the Seabird Island school is located, in which the Department was criticized for not supplying adequate facilities for drinking water. I feel that our Day schools should be supplied with proper facilities and would request the Department to authorize the purchase of the required water coolers, at a total cost of $244.53.\n\nW.S.

J. GAGE & CO. LTD.\n\nFrank Strowbridge\nColonel B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would have Mr. Track send me a copy of requisitions covering supplies which have been shipped to Indian schools in the Northwest Territories. The Lands and Development Services Branch have been following this policy. It is a good procedure in that I know what has been shipped to schools and am thus in a position to scrutinize requisitions and make recommendations knowing what is on hand.\n\nI would also like to suggest that, in future, non-denominational readers be supplied to our schools and that we use books as authorized by the Alberta Curriculum. Otherwise, we shall have a hodge-podge of books in our schools -- with each individual school using practically anything they wish. In this connection, Indian Agent Kirkby informed me upon his return from Roche River that the parents of the children in that area were quite annoyed that the Faith and Freedom Readers have been introduced into the school. In all our schools in the Northwest Territories, we have children of every denomination. Therefore, it seems to me that it is most unfair to request all these pupils to follow books expostulating the faith of any particular denomination. The only fair and satisfactory solution is to provide books as authorized by the curriculum for non-denominational schools as Protestant and Roman Catholic parents alike do not wish readers of a denominational nature introduced into our schools.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.W. McKinnon,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nMackenzie District, N.W.T.\nNovember 4, 1949.\n\nDear Mr. McKinnon:\n\nI have your letter of October 17th in reference to copies of requisitions covering supplies which have been shipped to Indian schools in the Northwest Territories.\n\nWe feel that it is not possible and not feasible to send you copies of requisitions as many of the requisitions are not filled for a considerable length of time after the requisition is placed. In fact, we have a large quantity of supplies in the office now to be shipped to the North early next Spring.\n\nAs you are aware, when the supplies are forwarded by the Department of Public Printing and Stationery a delivery slip is sent to the teacher with the parcel. The teacher is required to sign the receipt and return it to Ottawa. It would appear that if you wish to be informed on what supplies have been shipped to the school, you might ask the teacher to sign the receipts and forward them to you. After you have noted them you should forward them to the Department of Public Printing and Stationery.\n\nThe contents of your letter regarding the readers and other text books for the schools in the Northwest Territories have been noted. There will be an article with reference to this in the next issue of the Indian School Bulletin.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMr. J.W.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nI note in your letter of November 4th, (your file 1-1-4(EB)) that you are unable to supply this office with copies of requisitions covering supplies which have been forwarded to schools in the Mackenzie District of the Northwest Territories for the current school year. I regret that you are unable to supply our office with this information as we are most anxious to keep a complete inventory of all equipment and supplies provided to schools in the Mackenzie District.\n\nYou will recall that when Miss Davis was in charge of requisitions, you were good enough to provide us with this information. I also find that the Lands and Development Services Branch have found it quite possible to provide this office with copies of requisitions covering all supplies forwarded to schools in the Mackenzie District for the present school year.\n\nThere are various difficulties in getting this information from the blue delivery slips as suggested in your letter. This method is unfeasible and practically impossible at this time of the year as most of the blue delivery slips will have been returned to Ottawa by now. Even if this were possible, we have not sufficient help to do this work.\n\nYou may have misunderstood my request as all that we require is that the officer in charge of requisitions in your Branch run off an additional copy for our files when he is preparing the requisitions. Then, in turn, this list would be checked by this office against the blue delivery slips and a notation made of all supplies provided.\n\nWe shall not have any difficulty in this regard another year as all requisitions will be submitted through this office to Ottawa. This will enable us to keep a complete record of all equipment and supplies ordered for the coming school year and, by checking these lists against the blue...\ndelivery slips, we shall keep our records up to date. However, it would be appreciated if you would, in future, have additional copies of such information forwarded to this office as our files should be completely up-to-date in every way.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.W. McKinnon,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nMackenzie District, N.W.T.\nTRANS-CANADA TEACHERS' SERVICE\n\n7 Heather Street, Toronto, 12, Ontario\n\n\"Teach Without Tears!\"\n\nMONTHLY SEATWORK PACKS\nHECTOGRAPH WORKBOOKS\nTEACHING AIDS\nSUPPLEMENTARY READING\n\nOur MONTHLY SEATWORK PACK provides a full set of ready-to-use Seatwork for each pupil in your class.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis will acknowledge with thanks your recent order.\n\nWe regret that there was a shortage in the order sent you recently, of which we were not aware until the books were received by us.\n\nThe publishers have assured us that this shortage will be made up, and your most recent order shipped to us on November 30, or before. Their own stocks of these numbers have been exhausted, so that they have found it necessary to reprint in mid-year, a circumstance which I gather from the tone of their letter is most unusual. (but probably gratifying, since it indicates an increased demand.) Books will be shipped from Toronto immediately they have been cleared through Customs.\n\nWith apologies for troubling you in this matter, may we please have two signed copies of the attached certificate for Customs purposes in connection with this shipment?\n\nWith sincere appreciation of your interest in the publications we handle,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW.E. Lender\nThis is to certify that the attached shipment of school books, published by the Duplication Company, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A., is for the use of the Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Canada, in accordance with the curricula of the various Provinces in which schools under the said Branch are situated, and in which said books will be used.\n\nPlease send 2 signed copies to:\nTrans-Canada Teachers' Service,\n7 Heather Street, Toronto, 12.\nProvince of Saskatchewan\n\nDEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION\n\nHJ/JD\n\nRegina, January 31, 1949.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your recent letter I wish to advise you that our Department recommends Compton's Pictured Encyclopedia as the best work of this kind for elementary schools. We do not list it as such in our Circular Relative to Textbooks but through our School Librarian, Miss L. E. Evans, we are in constant contact with teachers and school boards regarding library needs. We do furnish mimeographed material upon request indicating the relative merits of various encyclopedias. This, however, is only for our own teachers.\n\nI should be very pleased to receive any advertising material which you have together with the cost at which the set could be laid down to us from Vancouver.\n\nI have my own personal copy of the 1948 edition of the complete set and can tell you that it is continually an inspiration to my own children.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector of Curriculum.\n\nMr. Fred Sturgess,\nSturgess Distributers,\n564 Howe Street,\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\nMay 6, 1949\n\nMiss Jessie E. Casselman,\nManager\nSchool and Library Division\nSturgess Distributors\n564 Howe Street\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Miss Casselman:\n\nAs a teacher and as a Librarian, it is really a pleasure to have the opportunity of making a recommendation for the use of \"COMPTON'S PICTURED ENCYCLOPEDIA\" in our schools.\n\nWe find it extremely useful and suited to the needs and the capacity of both Junior and Senior High School pupils. On account of our lack of space the Grade School pupils are unable to make much use of the Library (which serves two other purposes also), but the Grade School teachers find it very useful in preparing their work and sometimes carry one or more volumes along to their classes.\n\nThe subject matter, the illustrations, and the style are all at the level of the school boy or school girl. This is an encyclopaedia prepared for school use, not a general service set which may be also used in school. The FACT INDEX adds greatly to the value of the book.\n\nI can assure you that any school authorities that purchase this encyclopaedia will surely be satisfied.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Fev. Br.) P. V. Shea, F.S.C., M.S.\nLibrarian\nAugust 28th, 1948.\n\nMr. F. Sturgess,\nSturgess Distributors Ltd.,\nP.O. Box 47,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Sturgess:\n\nI am very pleased to hear of your new connection with Compton's Pictured Encyclopedia. I have used this work for many years and have nothing but praise for it. It is in my home, is in various departments and branches of the library, in school libraries and wherever young people and children need it, we have it.\n\nI happen to know considerable about the internal organization of the Compton Company. I am familiar with their methods as well as their officials and staff and can say they do a most meticulous and careful job of whatever they undertake. They use only the best authorities for compiling their articles which are geared to the school curriculum wherever possible. Their material is accurate, up-to-date and presented in a pleasing and attractive manner.\n\nIt is the illustrations which are a special feature of their encyclopedia and on which I wish to comment particularly. They spend an enormous amount of time and money on their art work, all of which is designed to be educational as well as informational and recreational. The pictures are simple but illustrate the text clearly and as completely as possible. Their maps and diagrams are clear and easily understood by the youngest child. I can safely say, there is no more attractive set on the market today than Compton's at any price.\n\nTheir method of keeping the set up-to-date is costly but effective. They are constantly revising it and re-writing those parts which need changing or the addition of new material. You can present this encyclopedia to any home, school or library without fear that it will not do the work required of it. I can only congratulate you on your connection with Compton's and wish you every success in introducing it in Canada where we lack such first-rate encyclopedias for children.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrarian.\n\nESR/cm.\nDecember 3, 1946.\n\nMr. Fred Sturgess,\n564 Howe Street,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nDear Mr. Sturgess:\n\nI was very interested in learning that you had become the official representative of Compton's Pictured Encyclopaedia for the Province of B. C.\n\nThis encyclopaedia is one of two which has been chosen by our Library Pool Committee as being most suitable for use in the elementary schools. We find that the children make very great use of this encyclopaedia and that it provides practically all the information necessary for children of these grades in their school work. In addition to this it is such an attractive set of books that the children often take volumes off the shelves simply for browsing purposes.\n\nAs you probably know we placed a set of these encyclopaedia in every elementary school in the City of Vancouver two years ago. I do not believe that any other set has received as much use as has Compton's.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Elementary Schools.\nSturgess Distributors, Ltd.\n\nfor\n\"COMPTON'S PICTURED ENCYCLOPEDIA\"\n\n2196\n2864 Yew Street \u2022 Vancouver, B.C.\nTelephone BAyview 2520\n\n14 November, 1949\n\nCol. D.W. Neary,\nSup't. of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Col. Neary:\n\nI am the Manager of the School and Library Division of the above firm and am writing you to ask if Sturgess Distributors Ltd. can be given an opportunity to quote you on the following lines of School Supplies:\n\n(1) Compton's Pictured Encyclopedia\n(2) The Denoyer-Geppert line of maps, globes and science materials\n(3) The D.W. Davies line of School Furniture\n\nI have discussed Compton's with Mr. Davey of your Department in Vancouver and Mr. Davies has discussed the furniture with him. I have discussed the above three lines with Mr. Battle in your Alberta office. Both gentlemen seemed quite favourably impressed and I would appreciate it very much if you would ask them to tell you their opinion.\n\nI am enclosing copies of several letters of recommendation for Comptons: one from Mr. Owen Thomas, one from Mr. E.S. Robinson, one from Bro. Shea and one from Mr. Jantzen, all of which I think you will find interesting.\n\nThe fact that the Vancouver and Victoria School Boards each buy thousands of dollars worth of Denoyer-Geppert materials speaks for itself. I know that officials of either of these Boards would be glad to tell you of the merits of this excellent line.\n\nMr. D.W. Davies has been with the B.C. government Purchasing Commission for years and has now gone into business for himself\u2014Mr. Davey perhaps could tell you of him.\n\nHoping that we may have the privilege of quoting your Department and hoping to hear from you soon in this regard,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nSchool & Library Division\nNovember 18, 1949.\n\nDear Miss Casselman:\n\nI have for answer your letter of November 14th.\n\nWe purchase our Encyclopedias directly from the publishers and naturally obtain a reduced price because of this. I would appreciate getting from you a quotation on the Compton's Pictured Encyclopedia so that we may compare it with the product presently being supplied.\n\nYou might also quote prices on the following maps:\n\n(a) Canada\n(b) The World\n(c) North America\n(d) Prairie Provinces\n(e) Ontario, Quebec and the Maritimes\n\nThe above quotations should be based on linen backing with rollers at top and bottom.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

We regret that we are not presently\nmanufacturing equipment of this kind and would not be able\nto give you up-to-date specifications.\n\nRegretting our inability to serve you on\nthis occasion, we remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nVILAS FURNITURE COMPANY LIMITED\n\nVice-President.\n\nHDH-W.\nNovember 8, 1949.\n\nMr. A.J. Doucet,\nSupervisor of Vocational Education,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: File No. 1-1-4 (E2)\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of November 2, we do not publish catalogues or specifications covering Home Economics equipment, because the line is only in limited demand and, in recent years has developed into more or less household furniture.\n\nThe note appearing in catalogue No. 47A to the effect that \"other types of tables can be supplied\" is intended to convey to customers that our facilities for manufacturing enable us to meet individual requirements, based on details or sketches that the prospective purchaser submits.\n\nHowever, the writer will be visiting Ottawa November 14th to 16th and, will be glad to discuss the matter with you. We can probably have available illustrations, etc., of designs other than those shown in No. 47A.\n\nOn account of a somewhat crowded program for the Ottawa visit, would you be good enough to let us know by return mail, whether you wish to discuss the subject in question.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nHENDRY DIVISION\nCENTRAL SCIENTIFIC COMPANY OF CANADA LIMITED\n\nWLM:DC\nNovember 7, 1949.\n\nColonel Bernard Neary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary,\n\nSubsequent to my recent letter to you in which I sent you a first tentative outline for a projected reader for the Indian schools. Since writing to you, we have heard from our Western Director who has made some good suggestions for amplification of Mr. Woodley's outline, and I shall hope to send you a revised outline very shortly for your approval or suggestion.\n\nMr. Woodley tells me that there will be no difficulty in checking the language, as he is acquainted with your Inspector of Schools at Caughnawaga and will use his Sixth Grade for testing the selections.\n\nMy own feeling is that Mr. Woodley is on the right track with his outline. I hope you will let me know whether you think it interesting, and whether the venture is practical before we proceed further with it.\n\nWe have been over a part of Miss Gaulthier's manuscript, and we are of the opinion that the material is in such a state that the editorial task is too great for us to undertake in this office. We are informing Miss Gaulthier that unless she can submit to us a manuscript that is in some kind of order, we cannot undertake publication of it. We realize that there is some immensely valuable material in the manuscript, but Miss Gaulthier really needs the services of an editorial assistant who can reorganize and partly rewrite her manuscript for publication. We wish we had the time in this office to do this, but unfortunately we have not.\n\nWe shall look forward to hearing from you about the other matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. M. DENT & SONS (CANADA) LIMITED\n\n[Signature]\n\nCJ/E/DP\n\nC. J. Eustace\nNovember 18, 1949.\n\nDear Mr. Eustace:\n\nI have answered your letter of November 7th and I am trying to go over the suggested outline for the book.\n\nI think that possibly the best arrangement would be for me to see Mr. Woodley when I next visit the Caughnawaga school.\n\nHas Mr. Woodley a copy of Dr. Jenness' book on The Indians of Canada? If not then I think he should get one at once as we feel his work in this regard is the most authoritative yet published.\n\nWith regard to Miss Gaulthier's manuscript, I believe that she does not have the funds to get an editorial assistant to go over her manuscript. I think she is contacting a retired professor at McGill University in this regard.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMr. C.J.

It is a copy from our own library and I know you will take care of it while doing the necessary research.\n\nIt is probably the most authoritative book and should give you very valuable background concerning the various tribes, their characteristics and environment.\n\nI am also sending you a copy of the Story Workbook in Canadian History, which has proven to be very satisfactory in our Indian schools. This type of book appeals greatly to our pupils and to our teachers because of the following reasons:\n\n(a) The work is divided into connected units.\n(b) Each unit is followed by seatwork problems.\n(c) The content is simple and yet interesting.\n(d) The black and white illustrations help to make the book more appealing to our Indian children.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCopy sent to Mr. C. J. HUSTAGE,\nJ. M. DENT & SONS\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nColonel Bernard Neary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Colonel Neary,\n\nMr. C.J. Eustace of J.M. Dent and Sons has suggested that I should write you regarding a prospective Reader for Indian children, in which his firm is interested. He mentioned the book to me last month when visiting Montreal and asked me if I would consider its preparation.\n\nI understand that Mr. Eustace has communicated with you about the Reader and that, naturally, you are greatly interested in anything related to Indian education.\n\nSome time ago I made a tentative outline in accordance with the objectives described to me by Mr. Eustace. I think that he has sent you a copy of this outline. The outline was only intended to be an initial step and will probably be changed to some extent before the actual writing begins. One of the major problems will be the accommodation of the language to the understanding of Grade VI pupils.\n\nWould it be possible for us to meet during one of your visits to Montreal? I should like to discuss a number of aspects of this proposed book before I go much further. If you will let me know when you will be in Montreal I shall gladly arrange for our meeting.\n\nIn his letter to me, Mr. Eustace mentions your inquiry regarding my knowledge of Mr. Jenness' work on the Indians of Canada. I know the book well. I have a copy of the Bulletin of Dr. Jenness on the \"Indian Background of Canadian History\" but do not possess a copy of the larger work which I have been able to consult only at libraries. Can the larger book still be procured? I thought that it was out of print. If the book is still available, through your Department, I shall be glad to purchase a copy, as it will facilitate my work.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nE.C. Woodley\nApril 28, 1950.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAttached, please find the certificate required for customs purposes as requested by you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMr. Gordon C.

Neary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nUnder separate cover, we are sending you a copy of ACROSS CANADA one of the most attractive and valuable Canadian Juveniles we have published in some time.\n\nThe author and illustrator is Mr. Clare Bice, curator of the London Art Gallery, and author of JORY'S COVE, a children's story of Nova Scotia.\n\nAs you will note ACROSS CANADA is a series of stories about children in each of the significant geographical areas in Canada from Nova Scotia to British Columbia and the Northern territories. In addition there are eight full pages of coloured illustrations and numerous black and white sketches which should give school children a new sense of the beauty of their country.\n\nACROSS CANADA seems to us a suitable supplementary book for Social Studies as well as a library title and we hope that it will find a place as such in your recommended lists.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nElementary Education\n\nList Price: $2.75\n15c FUZZY WUZZY PICTURE BOOKS\n\nNo. 804\u2014SCOOTER, the FUZZY WUZZY PUPPY BOOK.

By illustrating and naming the various geographical terms in common usage, J100\u2014Map of Standard Geographical Terms aids considerably in the acquisition of proper visual conceptions of the geographical formations of the earth.\n\nSection J100\u2014COMPOSITE LANDSCAPE\n\nPortrayed above is a halftone reproduction of Section J100 of the map, depicting a composite landscape. This illustration is in three colors only; the actual map is lithographed in full natural colors. Directly beneath the landscape scene, but not shown here, is a complete dictionary of definitions.\n\nIllustrated overleaf is Section J100b of the map, showing various types of natural phenomena. There are 20 black and white photographs, averaging 6x8 inches each.\nA BASIC MAP\n\nThe Standard Map of Geographical Terms has been produced by the Denoyer-Geppert Company to aid the school children in gaining a clear understanding of the various physical features of the earth represented by the common geographical terms. By acquainting the children with the different types of land forms, this basic map or chart lays the foundation for correctly interpreting the regular maps to which they are eventually introduced, and on which all physical or natural features are necessarily portrayed by means of symbols.\n\nIN TWO SECTIONS\n\nThe two sections of this map supplement each other, and each is 44x36 inches in size. The first section (J100) consists of an artificial landscape, lithographed in full natural colors. It is done on a composite plan that illustrates all manner of land forms, with the names thereof printed on. Immediately below the landscape appear definitions of the geographic terms illustrated in the landscape.\n\nThe second section (J100b) consists of 20 black and white photographs, depicting various natural features of the earth. Several of them also illustrate how men have adapted themselves to different natural surroundings. At the top of the sheet appears an explanation of the type of phenomenon illustrated by each picture.\n\nBoth sections, J100 and J100b are hand-mounted on a heavy quality of closely woven muslin. Mounted together as a single unit, or separately as individual maps.\n\nNET SCHOOL PRICES\n\nMOUNTING\n\n-1D Dissected to fold with eyelets and either oilcloth faces or pressboard folder........... $10.75 $7.75\n-10 Plain wood rods at top and bottom........... 8.00 5.00 $11.50\n-14 Spring roller and board with dustproof cover, or removable unit.......................... 10.75 7.75 14.25\n\nDENOYER-GEPPERT COMPANY\n\n5235-59 Ravenswood Avenue\n\nChicago 40, Illinois\nSturgess Distributors, Ltd.\n\nfor \"COMPTON'S PICTURED ENCYCLOPEDIA\"\n\n2146 Yew Street \u2022 Vancouver, B.C.\nTelephone Bayview 2620\n\n7 December, 1949\n\nCol. B. F. Neary, Sup't.\nIndian Education,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Col. Neary:\n\nI apologize for being so long in answering your letter which I received on November 21st. I was waiting for some information re the Denoyer-Geppert maps which just arrived this afternoon.\n\nCOMPTON'S PICTURED ENCYCLOPEDIA\n\nWe are the exclusive representatives for Compton's for Western Canada, from Fort William west and can give you the following price for schools: The School price is $119.50 f.o.b. Chicago, payable in Canadian funds to our Vancouver office, less $5.00 for cash (60 days). We will give a quantity discount of $5.00 per set when 5 or more sets are ordered as one order for shipment to the same address. Besides this, we would be glad to give a $10.00 trade-in allowance on an old reference set per new set providing you ask for it and providing you guarantee to get the old set out of the school and to replace it with Compton's. If you can take advantage of this complete offer, you can see what a nice reduction is allowed. I know that your teachers and pupils would be delighted with Compton's Pictured Encyclopedia and hope that it will not be long before there are sets in the Indian schools of Western Canada.\n\nDenoyer-Geppert maps, globes and science materials\n\nUnder separate cover, I am sending you a copy of two Denoyer-Geppert catalogues. You asked about a map of Canada\u2014we recommend our Jll which is a Political and Industrial edited by Dr. Cornish\u2014see page 22, Catalogue #49. The mounting you requested is known as -10 and is handmounted on muslin with wooden rod top and bottom. These sell at $8.00 and are size 44 x 58. On pages 16 and 17, you will see our Jrp series which includes a fine map of North America and several World maps. These also sell at $8.00 and are 44 x 58. If you want a larger world map, I would recommend S9arp or S79rp, on page 13. These are 64 x 44 and in the -10 mounting, sell at $9.75. Should you be interested in a Slated\nI would refer you to CS9b, size 64 x 50, illustrated on page 8. In the -10 mounting, this sells for $12.00. Denoyer-Geppert is planning on getting out a Slated map of Canada which will be known as CS11b and will sell at $12.00. Also, the plan is to produce a combination map, on one side the Slated World and on the other the Slated Canada. This combination will be called CS11b and will sell for $15.00 in the -10 mounting. These prices are all f.o.b. Chicago and in American funds.\n\nIt is not anticipated that there will be separate maps of Alberta or any of the Provinces at present. Should these be available, I would be glad to let you know.\n\nI am enclosing a partial price list of School Furniture\u2014we can make practically anything you need to your specifications. We also have a good line of Gymnasium and Playground equipment. Would be glad to send information on request.\n\nAlso enclosed please find a miniature Geographical Terms Chart, J100, size 44 x 40, in -10 mounting, price $8.00. This would be very useful to your teachers in teaching the beginning of Geography.\n\nShould there be any further questions, do not hesitate to write me, c/o Sturgess Distributors Ltd., 2146 Yew St., Vancouver, B.C. If you desire to see samples of any of our lines, do not hesitate to ask for same.\n\nHoping that we may be privileged to serve your department,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJessie E. Casselman\n\nJessie E. Casselman, Manager\nSCHOOL AND LIBRARY DIVISION\n\nP.S. The prices quoted above on Compton's is in a Fabrikoid binding which is very strong and beautiful. However, we can supply Compton's in a Dura-Cloth binding for $5.00 a set cheaper. This binding, I am sure would suit your purpose. So, if you are interested in the cheaper binding, just deduct another $5.00 from price listed above.\n\nJ. E. C.\nOTTAWA, December 9, 1949.\n\nColonel B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education Service,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\n220 Queen Street,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nThe charts showing the history of Canada in money that I had the pleasure of exhibiting to you a few days ago were prepared by Mr. W. H. Kernohan, of Forest, Ontario. Mr. Kernohan is an old man who is nearly blind, and he has put a lot of study and expense on these charts, and I am sure that you agree that they are most interesting and educative. They could be used to distinctive advantage in schools throughout Canada.\n\nI have mislaid the price list of these charts but will mail it to you in a few days' time.\n\nThanking you for your time and courtesy while in your office and trusting that these maps will be of real service in your schools, I am,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nHugh MacKenzie,\nM.P. for Lambton-Kent.\nDecember 9, 1949\n\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nAttention: Mr. Bernard F. Neary\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe acknowledge and thank you for your kind inquiry of the 7th, and we are shipping you via express three (3) only sample frames. We are pleased to quote you a price of frame #1 made from 1\u00bd\" moulding at $.90 each. Frames #2 and #3 2\" moulding at $1.10 each.\n\nIf we might be permitted to suggest to you we believe it would be more economical and more satisfactory for you to take these frames made up other than ship in pieces cut that is mitred ready for joining. There is a great possibility of the corners of the mitres being damaged, consequently when the frame is joined it leaves a very pronounced bad corner on the frames.\n\nPrices which we are quoting you we believe will be almost as economical with regards to cost, infact cheaper than it would be for you to assemble the frames if same were shipped in pieces. Prices quoted are f.o.b. Kingston, plus tax, packing charges included.\n\nThanking you, we are,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nK-D MANUFACTURING CO., LTD.,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPresident\nDecember 13, 1949.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis refers to your card 16238 dated December 2, 1949 in connection with the non delivery of a parcel for E.A.

Neary  \nSupt. of Indian Education  \nDept. of Mines & Resources  \nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReference your file letter 1-1-4 (EG), recently received.\n\nTo quote on this intelligently so as to make the best looking job consistent with price, we would like, if possible, a little further information. The general rule of framing is that a picture showing white border or matt uses a narrower frame than one framed close. Then, again, there are so many types of finishes, some of which look better on coloured pictures than on black and white. If possible, we would like to see one of these prints, failing which, however, could you advise us as to whether a white border shows, and as to the colouring of the picture, and if you have any choice on types of finish in the moulding.\n\nWe sell now a coloured picture of the King & Queen, approximately your size, which shows a white border, for which we use a one-inch Natural coloured frame. This, we believe, looks very well, and we find it goes with practically any finish which could appear in the schools.\n\nThanking you for this inquiry, and hoping we will be able to be of service to you in this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMATTHEWS BROTHERS LIMITED\n\nW.

Neary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\n200 Queen Street,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nI am pleased to tell you that our work on the manuscript of the fourth grade Faith and Freedom reader, *This is Our Land*, is well along and practically the only writing which remains to be done is for some of the exercises. We cannot finally determine the length of the exercises until the main part of the book is actually in type. We have therefore commenced to set the type.\n\nI am sending you a copy of the manuscript and would be grateful if you would read it and let us have any observations that you care to make. I should point out that we are sending you a copy which has not been carefully read against the original. It is quite possible, therefore, that there are errors of spelling, a word omitted, or something of that nature. You may be quite sure that this will not be carried into the finished book.\n\nThe manuscript has involved almost complete re-writing. We have had numberless conferences with the authors and various school people about the material, and we are just about as sure as we can be that it is what is wanted. You will be pleased to note that all the features of the American book have been retained and that the plan and purpose of the Canadian book is in full accord with the aims of the whole Faith and Freedom programme.\n\nFollowing the plan of the American book, we take the children on a sweep right across Canada which, of course, is in accordance with the title, *This is Our Land*. I think you will enjoy reading the selections. The writing is all excellent, - in some cases, I think, brilliant. The more I have worked with this manuscript, the happier I have felt about it.\n\nThe manuscript is being read also by a priest in Montreal, to make sure that we have nothing unfortunate from the French-Canadian angle. I believe we have guarded quite well against anything which might cause trouble in the Indian schools, but I should like you to read the manuscript particularly from this point of view. The authors have been very careful to omit any references to the Indians being cruel, bloodthirsty, wild savages, or anything\nTo Colonel B. F. Neary\n\nGINN AND COMPANY, PUBLISHERS\n\nPage 2\n\nThat nature which occurs so frequently in the usual story about Indians for white children. We felt it quite important to have several stories about Indians such as, for example, the story of Father Brebeuf. Similar stories in the Corona Readers have, as far as I know, been quite acceptable and I hope these will prove to be the same.\n\nApart from the necessity of having the material in type to determine the space available for the exercises, it is even more important to determine exactly the space for illustrations and get the artists started on their work. The book will have the same type of illustrations as in the original edition.\n\nWe hope to publish This is Our Land next spring. If, therefore, you could read and return the manuscript and let us have your observations at the earliest possible moment, I shall be very grateful indeed.\n\nMy wife and I enjoyed seeing you in Fredericton. I hope, if you are in Toronto, you will give me a ring and come out to the house to have a meal, if you can spare the time.\n\nCordially yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nNGSI:GD\nSir:\n\nRe: Books & Maps for Schools in N.W.T.\n\n1.

However, there are no frames to go with the pictures.\n\nIt has been decided to purchase a suitable frame for each picture and despatch the picture and the frame together.\n\nWe have contacted a number of picture moulding manufacturers who have quoted prices on a picture frame 20 x 24\". We found the price quoted by K.D.

The author of this is Mr. E.C. Woodley, M.A., F.R.Hist.S., who is retired now from the Department of Education in Quebec where he occupied the position of Education Officer to the Director of Protestant Education. Mr. Woodley is well known as a competent Canadian historian and he has written a number of text books for the schools. He will guarantee to present these little stories in language suitable for Grade VI, and if you are interested at all in this book, perhaps it would be possible to arrange for someone in your Department to check the material from the point of view of comprehension by Indians, as it is written.\n\nIn the meanwhile, would you be kind enough to look over this outline and make any suggestions either for additions or omissions.\n\nIt occurs to me that the last section \"The Indians To-day\" could probably be enlarged as there must be other contributions that Indians have made to our present life in Canada which Mr. Woodley has not mentioned.\n\nI should also like to have your comments on the sections he suggests such as (a) the games they played (b) the things they made, etc.\n\nYou will not want a book that is too long, and it occurs to me that perhaps two books might be necessary if you want a good deal of material devoted to the games they played, etc. However, it would be best to have everything in one reader.\n\nYou may also be interested to know that our Firm has completed a manuscript on the \"Life of the Eskimos\" at Grade III level and we are at work on one on the Indians. The book on the Eskimos will be published during 1950 and the manuscript of the Indian book will probably be finished some time next year also.\n\nPlease be assured that we appreciate very much your interest and cooperation in this venture, and for our part we shall do our best to produce an interesting and attractive looking book. However, since this book will\nColonel Bernard Neary\n\nOctober 25, 1949.\n\nbe written especially from the point of view of Indians, we feel it essential to obtain your very specific interest in this venture, and your cooperation throughout the writing of it and its production.\n\nLooking forward with great interest to hearing from you, I am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.

We are primarily concerned with a Social Studies text and the legends could well be left out, possibly for a future book.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard P.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Your File 1-1-5-(E)\n\nReplying to your letter of December 15th regarding the use of Cinoplate blackboards, there has been very little blackboard material of any kind sold to schools since the depression and we do not know of any installation in the neighbourhood of Ottawa. Canadian Commercial Corporation have bought this material on a number of occasions and some few months ago for the Department of National Defence, Royal Canadian Engineers, Camp Borden, Ontario. One of our Toronto architects who builds a number of schools, Mr. C. P. Band, specifies Cinoplate blackboards along with slate. Natural slate, however, is the blackboard material used in 90% of Ontario schools.\n\nWe have been supplying this material for fifteen or twenty years and have had no complaints of its character or quality, consequently, have no hesitation in recommending it to you.\n\nWe will be glad to know if there is anything further we can do for you in this connection.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFRANK G.

We hope and believe that you may find this work suitable for your Department -- aside from the bargain feature which, as mentioned, occurs very rarely.\n\nThe volumes in quantity run as follows:\n\n| Volumes | Copies |\n|---------|--------|\n| 1       | 227    |\n| 2       | 135    |\n| 3       | 65     |\n| 4       | 56     |\n| 5       | 30     |\n| 6       | 187    |\n| 7       | 13     |\n| 8       | 138    |\n| 9       | 7      |\n| 10      | 234    |\n| 11      | 138    |\n| 12      | 63     |\n| 13      | 12     |\n\n(Please note that there are no Volumes 5 and 11 in the overrun volumes and cannot be supplied.)\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC. W. MacDonald/a\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Permanent Record Cards\n\nInspector Davey endeavoured to secure from the Provincial Text-Book Branch a sufficient quantity of Permanent Record Cards to supply our Indian Day Schools. Unfortunately the Provincial Department was unable to supply them in the quantity requested and the order was referred to the Remington Rand Company who supply these cards to the Province.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nDecember 22nd, 1949.\n\nMr. Romeo Query,\nDirector of Services,\nDept. of Public Printing & Stationery,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Query:\n\nYou will recall that some time ago an order was placed with the National Film Board for 400 pictures of the King and Queen. These pictures are presently in stock. However, there are no frames to go with the pictures.\n\nIt has been decided to purchase a suitable frame for each picture and despatch the picture and the frame together.\n\nWe have contacted a number of picture moulding manufacturers who have quoted prices on a picture frame 20 x 24. We found the price quoted by K.D. Manufacturing Co., Ltd., 670-680 Montreal Street, Kingston, Ontario, to be the most fair and just.\n\nWould you kindly place in stock, therefore, 400 picture frames #2, size 20\" wide by 24\" long, completely assembled (glass, cardboard, backing not included) costing $1.10 each.\n\nAs soon as delivery is made on these frames, it is our intention to submit a requisition to your office and have the pictures sent out to the schools at once, as there are but few pictures of the King and Queen in our schools at present.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nWe are interested in the new GESTETNER CUSHION SHEETS for Stylus Pen lettering and sketching. Please supply us with the following:\n\n- Stylus Pen # @ $1.00 each\n- Gestetner Cushion Sheets @ 1.50 per pad\n\nNAME:\nADDRESS:\nCITY: PROV.\nSIGNATURE:\nWith the introduction of the Gestetner CUSHION SHEET, a new and efficient method of reproducing signatures, handwriting, and simple line sketches has become available to all Gestetner Users.\n\nIt is not necessary that one be a skilled artist to obtain pleasing results. Anyone who can trace an outline picture can, with very little practice, cut a good stencil by following the simple instructions given on this page. The only equipment required is one or more Stylus Pens, as illustrated, and a pad of Cushion Sheets.\n\nEach pad contains twelve sheets which are tinted blue-black so that Stylus work cut on the stencil shows up distinctly. The top cover of the pad is folded under the top sheets, thereby acting as a cutting base. Each sheet may be used several times before losing its efficiency.\n\nYou will find the enclosed card a convenient means of ordering both Stylus Pens and Cushion Sheets. The cost of these items to Gestetner users is only $1.00 each for Stylus Pens, and $1.50 per pad for foolscap size Cushion Sheets.\n\nIf you have an illustrating, lettering or ruling problem beyond the scope of the Stylus Pen technique, we suggest you discuss it with your Gestetner representative on his next visit. If more convenient, write to us direct, enclosing specimen or rough draught of the type of work you have in mind.\n\nRAISE TOP CUSHION SHEET FROM PAD.\nLAY IT SMOOTHLY OVER TOP COVER.\nINSERT WHOLE PAD BETWEEN STENCIL & BACKING SHEET.\nWRITE OR DRAW ON STENCIL WITH GESTETNER STYLUS PEN.\n\nGestetner (Canada) Limited\nOffices in all Principal Cities\nJanuary 10, 1950.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFor some time it has been next to impossible for us to secure suitable kindergarten school scissors for use in our Indian schools across the country. We have, however, managed to secure small quantities from jobbers from time to time, who sell us English made scissors. These supplies have been inadequate for our needs.\n\nWe have become interested in placing an order for approximately 10,000 pairs of inexpensive kindergarten scissors priced in Canada at approximately twenty to thirty cents a pair. These scissors should be about four inches long either cast or pressed. However, it is understood that cast scissors are slightly more expensive. It is not expected that all the scissors will have to be delivered when the order is placed but deliveries may be made as scissors are available.\n\nWould you kindly quote me a price in Canadian funds including cost of shipping charges, duties, sales tax, etc., on scissors that you consider suitable for our needs naming your Canadian representative; minimum quantity we would require to purchase before you would be interested in an order if this applies to your firm, speed of delivery after order is placed. A sample would be appreciated.\n\nI will be interested in hearing from you as to what you have to offer and in the event that you do not manufacture the type of scissors we are interested in, we would appreciate being advised of a firm who does.\n\nThanking you, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW.

He encloses a new tentative outline of the book on the Indians, which I attach hereto. You will note that he has followed your suggestions and eliminated the section \"Tales told by the Camp Fire and in the Tepee\".\n\nI like the outline now better than I did the first one, as it seems to me to deal rather definitely now with the history of the Indians and to do it in a factual manner. Perhaps, however, the title \"The Indian Heritage\" is not a very good one if the legends and myths are to be left out, since these are part of the heritage of the Indian, although you will know better than I what influence, if any, these myths and legends would have on modern Indians.\n\nI hope it will be possible for you to contact Mr. Woodley when next you are in Montreal. He is anxious to proceed with the writing of this book, but feels that he should not do so until the outline is approved. Is there any possibility that we can get the outline approved, - at least unofficially - in the near future?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nC.J.E./DP\n\nEnc.\nJanuary 13th, 1950.\n\nMcLean Merchandise Sales Limited,\n29 Melinda Street,\nToronto 1, Ontario.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nWe have been very pleased with the \"Richards Topical Encyclopedia\" which we purchased from you at $15.00 for each set of eight volumes.\n\nCould we please be advised whether you have additional copies of these books available, and at what price per volume or per set.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

We are glad to have you join our great and happy Canadian family. I feel sure that you have a great contribution to make to our Canadian way of life and that you will appreciate the privileges of our Canadian way of life, known as Democracy, especially that of an education in our Night School.

We trust that you will benefit from your attendance at these classes, and that the knowledge you will acquire and the associations you will form will be both pleasant and profitable. We are glad to welcome you as New Canadians and we trust that you will make your contribution to the building of a better Canada.\n\nW. J. Logie, Principal\nKELOWNA HIGH SCHOOL\nKelowna Junior-Senior High School\n\nBox 448\n1766 Richter St.\nKelowna, B.C.\n\nJanuary 10, 1950\n\nRev. Father O'Grady,\nPrincipal, Indian School\nKamloops, B.C.\n\nDear Father O'Grady:\n\nPlease find enclosed two copies of my booklet, \"What a Canadian Should Know\", an illustrated primer in Citizenship.\n\nSome time ago I sent a copy of it to the Indian Affairs Branch in Ottawa. In reply Mr. Neary, the Superintendent of Indian Education suggested that we try this booklet in your school.\n\nThe booklet enclosed are the original notes as prepared for my Citizenship Classes for New Canadians. I might add here that my eight year's work with the Indians helped for I have not forgotten their needs.\n\nShortly before Christmas I completed a revision of this booklet. The number of questions and answers have been reduced to a hundred, and I have added Word Study and Work Book sections. The word count is well within the bounds set by Basic English Authorities and every illustration has a definite teaching value as a teaching device. All material used has been carefully tested in classroom (both High School and Night school) for interest, language, and general suitability.\n\nSince I have not the time to cut the stencils for the revised booklet I wondered whether you would undertake to publish this booklet as a classroom project, that is, if you have a duplicating or mimeographing machine. If you are interested, I can send you my handwritten copy.\n\nWhile it is true that the trend has been away from factual presentation of historical facts towards the storybook type of history, many teachers and business men feel that it has resulted in no learning! To prove this loss I conducted three separate experiments with control groups among our Grade 9 classes. The results indicated without doubt the need for mastery of at least some minimum essentials.\n\nDuring the past three years I have examined a great number of books dealing with the same material and I invariably found that they were written at a reading level above that required of most public school students.\nNow that the Indians of British Columbia have the right to vote, I feel that the booklet should be made available to all Indian Students as well as to adults of voting age.\n\nI have received very favorable comments from various educators, including the Extension Department of the University of British Columbia. Mr. John Fisher heard about our work here and showed considerable interest. He gathered much information which he will use in a future broadcast. It might be added that the booklet is also under consideration for use in some of the provincial school systems.\n\nWith best wishes for a Happy New Year.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nJ. M.

I am having mailed to Mr. Woodley two or three books which might help him in giving more details concerning these Indians. There will certainly have to be more mention of the Prairie Indians and of the B. C. Indians. I am sure that Mr. Woodley will get some ideas from the books I am sending to him. There should be more detail also concerning the social life of the various tribes of Indians.\n\nI believe that Mr. Woodley could start to write his book now and that he could deal with the outline already given. He could then fill in to his outline sections on the Western Indian as I have mentioned. Exercises in seatwork should certainly follow each section as we are anxious to make this as practical a book for use in our schools as possible.\n\nI have had to postpone my trip to Montreal on several occasions but believe I should be down there during February.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

I quite agree with you that more stress on the Western Indians is no doubt necessary, particularly as you have so many schools in British Columbia. If you wish, after we receive the manuscript we could send it on to our Western Director in Vancouver and ask him to have it checked with your Inspector there.\n\nI am glad that you think Mr. Woodley might now begin to do some writing, and I have forwarded on this information to him.\n\nOne of these days I hope to be in Ottawa again, and shall look you up as there are a number of things I should like to discuss with you.\n\nWith very best wishes,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nC.

This is necessary as we have no room to stock all our school supplies nor have we the authority to make large purchases.\n\nI am returning to you the punches prepaid as it will not be possible for us to pay for them.

Shore, published by J. M. Dent & Sons, Toronto.\n\nThis is a very good book with chapters on Reedcraft, Textiles, Leathercraft, Woodcraft, etc. It also has a chapter on where to secure art and craft supplies. It is well illustrated and the directions are easy to follow.\n\n(2) The Art Class in Action, by Jeiccy M. Horne, published by Longmans, Green & Company, Toronto.\n\nThe author is the instructor in Art at the Toronto Normal School and this work is also useful. There are chapters also on Weaving, Carving, Silk Screen Processes, etc.\n(3) Working in Leather, by M. Iekis,\npublished by The House of Little Books,\nNew York, N.Y.\n\nThis is one of a series of paper-covered books\nwhich deal in detail with various craft subjects.\nIt is well illustrated and very easy to follow. It\ngives more detail than the two books mentioned above.\nIf a particular artcraft were being studied, these\nbooks would be helpful.\n\nThere is another series of individual craft books\nalso available. These are published by the Macmillan Company,\nToronto, Ontario.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMr. B.F. Neary,\nEducation Service,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\n220 Queen St.,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nWe take the liberty of submitting for your consideration the following text of an inquiry which we have received from the Director of a School for the Rehabilitation of Crippled Children:\n\n\"We are interested in obtaining information on hobbycraft in general, and with particular reference to the following topics:\n\n1. Basket weaving\n2. Seat Weaving (These seats are made out of straw, plastic, cord or shaving strip of ashwood)\n3. Leather goods (belts, etc.)\n4. Mats or rugs from scrap rubber\n5. Wooden toys\n6.

There has been a pretty fair sale for both of these books, but we still have stock of the JOE AND RUTH WORK BOOK. As we are anxious to distribute the type of books which we shall not reprint again, I am wondering if there is likely to be any further sale for the work book after the present stock is exhausted? If not, I assume that we may dispose of the type?\n\nIn anticipation of hearing from you in connection with this matter,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. M. DENT & SONS (CANADA) LIMITED\n\nC. J.

We have already outlined to you our proposal with regard to the purchase of soap.\n\nWe would appreciate your action also with regard to the supply of paper. These requirements fall into two categories:\n\n(a) Toilet paper; (b) Paper towels.\n\nEach one-room school requires 30 packages of paper towels (equivalent to Eddy's CELINE Junior Paper Towel). Each school also uses about 100 rolls of toilet paper (equivalent to Eddy's NAT Tissue, or similar).\n\nWe would appreciate your immediate action in contacting a Paper Company concerning this request. We would require 400 cartons of each type of paper, as mentioned above, and would supply detailed addresses, etc.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F.

We feel that it is desirable that all equipment and supplies on hand in the schools should be catalogued, and that the equipment at least should be checked at regular intervals. This would protect the teacher, enable us to transfer equipment from one school to another without the teacher carrying any of the responsibilities, enable us to list requirements with the minimum of work, and finally in the event of a change of teachers, both the new and the old teacher would be protected.\n\nThe Ontario Department of Education has a standard type of catalogue, but this does not meet with my approval because we want a type of catalogue that could be used for checking purposes over a number of years. With the Ontario Catalogue it is necessary to erase the check marks each year or as is usually done, write out a list of the equipment each year and check from this written list. If your Department has no standard catalogue in supply, I would be in favor of using No.200 Government of Canada Register, with a supply of Index Tabs. We would require at least 5 of these books to start with.\n\nWe also discussed the cataloguing of Library Books. Some of our schools are building up a nice library and consequently it is proving quite a chore to find any particular book. We are therefore interested in systems of cataloguing libraries. If the Department has no standard system in their schools we would like to catalogue the books according to the subjects on our curriculum. This system has many disadvantages, but I feel its simplicity outweighs them all. We would require for our book shelves some type of metal card holder. I would suggest that 3 dozen of these would be sufficient at the present time.\n\nDRC.R\nD.R.CASSIE,\nSuperintendent Tyendinaga Agency.\nColonel B. F. Neary\n\nI acknowledge receipt of your memorandum of the 18th instant, regarding paper requirements for Indian Day Schools.\n\nThis matter was discussed with the E. B. Eddy Company, Hull, Quebec, and they reserve the right to supply Navy Tissue Toilet Paper to chain stores only in the size of one case (30 rolls), 650 sheets per roll. However they have a substitute equivalent to this paper in every way except that the number of sheets per roll is 550 only, and is lower priced accordingly.\n\nThe prices quoted me were as follows:\n\n**Universal Toilet Tissues**\n(30-Roll Case - 550 Sheets Per Roll)\nPrice Halifax to Fort William Per Cs $5.85\nPrice Ft.

William and West to Vancouver $5.05\n(Sales Tax Included)\n\nThe only objection raised was the matter of delivery. The firms will not ship less than five cases to any given point. They suggest that in the cases of small shipments of one or two cases that probably the bulk could be sent to\nTo Colonel B. F.
