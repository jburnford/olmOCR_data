Mr. Taylor.\n\nThis Paper may be found at:\nKIRK'S NEWSPAPER OFFICE\nNEW YORK\n\nFRIDAY, FEB. 3, 1888\n\nN.W. REPRESENTATION.\n\nWe pointed out a short time ago the peculiar representation which was proposed by the Northwest Council to treat the District of Saskatchewan in the manner of representation in the proposed Local Assembly. We also pointed out that according to population the District should have six out of the twenty-five members, and we are glad to see that our local public bodies are taking action in the matter. The Town Council and Agricultural Society have both moved, and the Board of Trade is expected will follow suit; should not the Conservative Association make a move in the same direction; and the women's movement is doing well to get Liberal friends. There is a question that does not concern only one section or class of people, or one political party, but it is one which should interest every individual in the District, and affect the whole community, and one on which depends in a large measure the future welfare of Saskatchewan. Therefore it should not be left to any one body to take up the matter, but everyone ought to fight against the threatened injustice. The Dominion Parliament will meet this month, when it is likely a Bill will be passed creating a Legislative Assembly for the Province, and this Bill will affect our share of representation in such Assembly, and if the Parliament in framing and passing the Act have no other expression of opinion regarding them than that given by the Northwest Council, it is unreasonable to suppose that they will not act on the recommendations of that body, and this District will be left out in the cold with only four members. If we cannot secure more than two members, it would be unfair to the advantage to do so much for, and we have none at all. It is useless to wish at any time to throw cold water on any movement that might tend to the development and advantage of the Province, and if the Assembly grants us to be in the minority, it is the duty of the member to assist his constituents in every way possible, and fulfill all their wishes.\n\nClearing Sale.\n\nALL REMAINING\nParlor Stoves\nAT COST\nBox Stoves\nREDUCED TEN PER CENT.\nAcme Skates\nREDUCED TEN PER CENT.\nT.

It bears date \"the 24th instant,\" and says the writer will give 500 pounds in silver to have half so more come to live. It is from, and is signed \"L. Littler, St. Nicholas.\"\n\nThe Government expects to make arrangements to allow a course in the military college to count for students in university.\n\nKINGSTON, Jan. 31. \u2014 A house of young women, men, women and girls in the party, and all fool and republicans. It was soon learned that this was not a party, but a band of republicans who had returned to Kingston. They were searched and about half of them were found to be carrying silver and a half-filled bottle with bills. A purse containing a large amount of silver was taken out of the house. The leader of the republicans said they were going to leave the city. Before their arrest they were seen looting stores and houses for passes. The leader, who came from Clinton, took charge of the party in Montreal.\n\nTOMORROW, Jan. 31. \u2014 It is reported that Mr. Allan, cashier of the Central Bank, had left the city. Allan was also reported to have left the city immediately. Owing to his feeling in the city, he could not get employment there, and decided to go elsewhere. He went away last night.\n\nDURHAM, Jan. 30. \u2014 The arrival of Father McPhail, of Greenock, at London, caused considerable excitement. His visit was the occasion of a patriotic meeting. Immediately upon the appearance of the priest, at the parish station, the excited assembly of patriots became violently excited and attacked the constable, having him in custody, with stones. The police were immediately called, but the crowd, who were desperately resisted. A number of persons were severely injured. It is reported that a detective was taken to the hospital suffering from concussion of the brain.\n\nMr. Wm. Wilson was released from Toronto jail today. He went immediately to the house of the parish priest. Large crowds followed him and were enthusiastic in their reception, but not entirely united.\n\nLOCHSIDE, Feb. 1. \u2014 The resignation of Lord Charles Beresford has raised quite a breeze both in political and club circles and in the columns of the press. A petition has been presented to condemn the action of the naval minister as reflecting upon the naval administration, but it is said that the minister is sufficiently outspoken to declare that he believes that the present system of carrying on the Navy Department is a failure, and must be changed, as a matter of disclaiming any responsibility for the hanging of Lord Nelson and the Admiralty office. Foremost among the newspapers calling for drastic action is the St. John's Gazette, which declares that the reasons given by the Admiralty for Lord Charles Beresford's resignation are insufficient, and that the minister should be dismissed for his conduct, and charged as a matter of disclaiming any responsibility for the hanging of Lord Nelson and the Admiralty office. There is only one obstacle in the way and that is that he would be overthrown by the people.\n\nWESTMINSTER, Jan. 31. \u2014 The Call says many Reformers are anxiously awaiting when Major Jones will take a lead. He was not present at the last great election, when he refused to support Mr. Conolly in Northumberland, and publicly declared that he was a member of his family. The same paper also says it is stated that Mr. Jones will seek election in South Wiltshire, where he has a large constituency. There is only one obstacle in the way and that is that he would be overthrown by the people.\n\nThe attempt of Gabriel Dumont in New York by Premier Macdonald shows how thoroughly the French Canadian Roman Catholic and are in sympathy with the rebels.\n\nAbout six o'clock on Saturday morning a fire broke out in the store shop occupied by Mr. J. Boyd, near the corner of Main and Farnham streets, which resulted in the total destruction of the shop and two stories adjoining on the north side. The temperature registered 40\u00b0 below zero, but in spite of this the firemen were promptly on hand and commenced a vigorous attack against the flames. The building was in imminent danger for some time, being only separated from the fire by a narrow space. The fire was caused by a spark from the engine, this house being several feet from any other. The loss will amount to about $20,000, with very heavy insurance.\n\nMONTREAL, Jan. 31. \u2014 The fire on this order morning was the worst seen here for some months, and was not extinguished until nearly twenty hours after its commencement.\n\nThe premises of Duff & Co., the Canada Insurance Company, the offices of Mr. Murray Co., J. H. McNeil, Burgess & Co., the Scrapyard Wine Co., and other buildings were destroyed by fire. The loss is estimated at $50,000, which will amount to about three fourths that amount.\n\nThe firemen of the brigade were called out at once, and the fire was fought with all possible energy. The fire was practically under control within an hour, and to make matters worse the house next door was destroyed by fire, and the firemen had to work under very difficult conditions.\n\nIf you want your money's worth in Hardware, Boots and Shoes, Clothing or Groceries, call on\n\nJ.
